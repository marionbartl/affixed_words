COPENHAGEN --
The world 's largest offshore wind farm , the London Array , will begin construction this summer after the British government doubled the incentives for offshore wind energy , the project 's main owner , Denmark 's DONG Energy , said today .
The 1,000 - megawatt Thames Estuary behemoth had been in doubt after Royal Dutch Shell PLC pulled out of the scheme last year because of rising costs , leaving DONG with a 50 percent stake , Germany 's E.ON with 30 percent and Abu Dhabi 's renewable energy fund , Masdar , with 20 percent .
Now the three partners have pledged to invest $ 3 billion for the 630 - megawatt first phase of the project , which will be completed in time to deliver wind energy to the London Olympics in 2012 .
DONG's CEO , Anders Eldrup , said the U.K. government 's announcement last month of increased support for offshore wind power prompted the consortium to decide to build the wind park .
" The decision to build the London Array offshore wind farm is a cornerstone in DONG Energy 's strategy to increase the proportion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources , " Eldrup said .
" DONG Energy has built approximately half of all offshore wind farms in operation in the world today . "
The British government provided £ 525 million in the 2009 budget for offshore wind subsidies between 2011 and 2014 by increasing the number of renewables obligation certificates , or ROCs , available for offshore wind generation .
The United Kingdom already has the most installed offshore wind power generation capacity in the world .
ROCs are the main support scheme for renewable electricity projects in the United Kingdom .
It places an obligation on U.K. suppliers of electricity to get an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources -- from 9.7 percent this year to 15.4 percent by 2016 .
Suppliers meet their obligations by presenting ROCs or by paying into a buyout fund .
Under the new rules , the government will issue two ROCs for every megawatt - hour of offshore wind power produced , doubling the original incentive .
A further £ 405 million in the budget were earmarked for " the development of a world leading low - carbon energy and green manufacturing sector in the U.K. , " something that analysts expect will benefit mainly wind and tidal power and should kick - start the 8,000 megawatts of various U.K. wind power projects that have secured approval but have not started construction .
Without the increased incentives , the London Array would not have been economical , analysts said .
" The London Array is a flagship project in our drive to cut emissions by 80 percent by 2050 and meet future energy needs , " said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in a statement .
" The U.K. is a world leader in offshore wind farms , creating jobs and prosperity for the economy .
That 's why we have increased our support for this technology as we move toward a low carbon future . "
Masdar 's CEO Sultan Al Jaber also praised the government 's involvement .
" The London Array represents Masdar 's strategic approach to renewable energy , whereby real partnerships are formed between government and the private sector , " he said in a statement .
" This project is a great achievement for the U.K. government , E.ON , DONG Energy and Masdar , which exemplifies our commitment to build cooperation to take renewable energy further down the path to widespread global adoption . "
The London Array wind farm will be built on a 90 - square - mile area that will be 12 miles off the coasts of Kent and Essex .
The first phase will consist of 175 turbines built by Siemens AG .
The second phase will take the farm to 1,000 megawatts , or enough power for 750,000 homes -- a quarter of Greater London homes -- and displace the emission of 1.9 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year , according to project planners .
But the investment decision to build the second phase will be taken separately and depends on phase one performance and additional environmental studies .

The Center for Inquiry is proud to hold Special Consultative Status as a non-governmental organization under the United Nations Economic and Social Council .
As CFI ’s Representative to the United Nations , I have recently been working hard to fight a proposed " defamation of religions " resolution at the UN ’s General Assemby .
The " defamation of religions " resolution is backed by the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , an association of 57 states promoting Islamic values and interests .
Upset by a supposed campaign by " the media " to " perpetuate stereotypes about certain religions " and " sacred persons " ( read : Islam and Mohammed ) , the OIC proposes that the United Nations condemn " defamation " of religious ideas as a human rights violation .
This dangerous and misguided resolution would subvert longstanding principles of human rights law by empowering those who seek to silence or intimidate religious dissidents , nonbelievers , and human rights activists .
It poses a direct threat to the guarantees of freedom of speech and belief found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
As noted by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , Ms. Asma Jahangir , UN resolutions targeting " defamation of religions " can be used to legitimize anti-blasphemy laws that " punish members of religious minorities , dissenting believers and nontheists or atheists . "
The " defamation of religions " resolution is a stunning perversion of longstanding principles of human rights law .
It is premised on an expansive right of citizens not to be insulted in their religious feelings , and a right to respect for religious beliefs .
These supposed rights have no grounding in international human rights law .
International law guarantees freedom of religious exercise , not freedom from insult ; it guarantees nondiscrimination for individual believers , not respect for belief systems .
Existing legal instruments , such as Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) , already protect religious believers against expression that constitutes incitement to discrimination , hostility and violence .
The OIC would go farther by protecting religious beliefs themselves .
Earlier this month , the UN ’s Human Rights Council in Geneva wisely rejected the concept of " defamation of religions " by omitting this term from a compromise resolution on freedom of opinion and expression .
CFI urges that the General Assembly likewise reject this concept in favor of other , less problematic resolutions of the values of freedom of expression and equality of citizens — for example , by turning to existing human rights laws that prohibit discrimination against religious believers , without shielding religious beliefs from criticism , and without threatening the rights of religious dissidents and nonbelievers .
Unfortunately , we expect this resolution to pass the General Assembly , as it has for the last several years .
Our goal is to soften support for the resolution by increasing the number of member states voting against it .
Each year , support for the resolution has weakened .
With hope , that trend will continue this year .
Surely we can protect individual religious believers from discrimination without shielding religious belief systems from criticism , and without threatening the rights of religious dissidents , religious minorities , and nonbelievers .
Bringing the Starshade to Reality
The goal of detecting a terrestrial class exoplanet has burned bright in the imagination ever since the discovery of the first planets orbiting main sequence stars .
In a recent SEED Magazine story , Lee Billings ( one of the most graceful science writers now working ) harkens back to then NASA administrator Daniel Goldin ’s 1996 speech at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San Antonio , Texas .
Goldin talked about seeing Earth - like exoplanets up close , speculating that in 25 years we might be able to obtain images with a resolution to see clouds , continents and oceans .
I ’m going to use a different Goldin quote than Lee did , from a later speech , but the idea is clear enough in either iteration .
Here Goldin is speaking about the classrooms of the mid-21st Century and what they might look like :
When you look on the walls , you see a dozen maps detailing the features of Earth - like planets orbiting neighboring stars .
Schoolchildren can study the geography , oceans , and continents of other planets and imagine their exotic environments , just as we studied the Earth and wondered about exotic sounding places like Bangkok and Istanbul . . . or , in my case growing up in the Bronx , exotic far - away places like Brooklyn .
This is a classroom I ’d love my grandchildren to spend some time in , but exactly which generation gets to do that depends on how timely we are in creating the kind of terrestrial planet finder missions that can do the job .
With a star outshining a terrestrial exoplanet by a huge factor , the challenge of just finding the planet is , as Billings notes , “ … like photographing a lit match on the cusp of a detonating hydrogen bomb . ”
And in any case , we seem to have set up a built - in generational gap here .
We ’re making huge progress today at detecting exoplanets , but funding for the follow - up investigative tools is sadly lacking .
This is why I ’ve often looked at starshade concepts on Centauri Dreams , thinking the technology of an external occulter could simplify the detection process and , in doing so , lower the costs of the project .
Webster Cash ( University of Colorado at Boulder ) has spent the last five years working on a starshade that could function with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope .
The cost : $ 700 million to image alien Earths around nearby stars , a fraction of the price of the original TPF -C and TPF - I concepts worked up at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
We ’re not talking about those Goldin - style images of Earth - like worlds on the schoolhouse wall , at least , not with the earliest generation of starshade .
But Cash does believe we can use the early starshades to get a spectrum of an Earth - like exoplanet within the next ten years .
That could flag the presence of oceans and even reveal signs of life .
Here ’s Billings ’ description of the operative technology :
Cash ’s starshade would resemble a many - petaled sunflower — if sunflowers were matte - black and about half a football field in diameter .
Its special shape is designed so that waves of starlight will diffract around it , lapping against and nullifying each other to cast an ultra - dark shadow , ensuring that only an exoplanet ’s light falls on the JWST ’s huge mirror .
Equipped with small thrusters , the starshade would fly some 70,000 kilometers in front of the JWST , precisely aligning to block light from a target star so that its accompanying planets could be seen .
Read the article for more on this ( and , if you ’re looking for further background , run a search on this site for stories on Cash ’s work ) .
And keep this in mind .
Astro2010 is a decadal survey of astrophysicists put together by the National Research Council , one that will soon release a report on research priorities for the coming decade .
Cash ’s starshade has been submitted to the committee , and so has a competing starshade concept by David Spergel and Jeremy Kasdin ( Princeton University ) , former Cash collaborators .
Will the committee support a starshade ?
The lack of support from NASA on bringing such projects home is a natural consequence of the funding crisis the agency faces , one that may or may not change no matter what the upcoming Astro2010 report has to say .
“ The problem here is not the technology , but the lack of money to demonstrate it one way or another — and there ’s something wrong with that , ” Cash tells Billings .
“ This would n’t be just helping me , it would be NASA helping itself .
NASA has a unique opportunity to conduct an experiment whose results , if positive , will never be forgotten . ”
Church of Scientology convicted of fraud in France
The self - styled ‘ celebrity ’ Church of Scientology was today found guilty of fraud in France and fined more than £ 500,000 .
Prosecutors in Paris were told that the only reason the cult was not banned from the country completely was because it would carry on anyway ‘ outside a legal framework ’ .
The conviction will come as a huge shock to the church ’s millions of followers around the world , who include Hollywood actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta .
Convicted : The Paris branch of the Scientology Church 's Celebrity Centre and Bookshop was ordered to pay a £ 600,000 fine after being convicted of fraud
Examining judges sitting at the Paris Correctional Court found six leading Scientologists guilty of fraud , including Alain Rosenberg , the sect ’s leader in France .
Rosenberg was given a two - year suspended jail sentence and fined the equivalent of just under £ 30,000 .
The church ’s so - called Celebrity Centre and Bookshop – both of which make up the HQ of Scientology in France - were ordered to pay the equivalent of £ 600,000 .
All were accused of extorting money from ‘ vulnerable ’ people who had become Scientology followers or employees .
The Church of Scientology was founded in 1954 by science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard ( left ) .
Hollywood actor Tom Cruise ( right ) is an ardent follower
The Paris case was launched following a complaint from two women , one of whom said she was tricked into handing over £ 20,000 towards dubious projects , including the development of an ‘ electrometer ’ to measure mental energy .
The second woman said she was forced by the Scientologists to undergo embarrassing tests , and to enrol in courses about the sect in 1998 .
When she refused she was sacked .
Judge Jean - Christophe Hullin , who spent years examining the cult ’s activities , attacked the Scientologists ' ‘ obsession ’ with financial gain and practices he said were aimed at plunging members into a ‘ state of subjection ’ .
Prosecutors had originally asked for the Celebrity Centre and Bookshop to be shut down completely , and for a £ 2 m fine to be paid .
But last month the French courts were alerted to a little - noticed legal change voted in by parliament in May - the month the trial opened - which bars French courts from dissolving an organisation convicted of fraud .
Although the change has since been dropped , this was not retrospective and thus Scientology was protected from an outright ban in the ongoing case , forcing the court to downgrade the sentence .
Judge Sophie - Helene Chateau said : ‘ A ban on its activities would have risked taking us outside the framework of the law . ’
The Church of Scientology was founded in America in 1954 by science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard .
It is officially recognised as a religion by the US authorities , and claims a worldwide membership of 12 million .
In 1995 it was officially classified as a cult in France , where it claims 45,000 followers .
The group ’s French branch immediately announced it would appeal today ’s Paris verdict .
Defence lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve had claimed during the trial that neither the six leaders nor the church had gained financially from the group ’s practices .
This is a very good sign .
Yesterday , in a closed Democratic caucus meeting , The Speaker was critical of the Baucus health care bill yesterday , according to The Hill :
“ The savings [ in the Baucus bill ] come off the backs of the middle class , ” Pelosi told a closed - door caucus meeting .
“ This is why we need a strong public option going into conference with the Senate . ”
The remark , confirmed by several of those in attendance , demonstrated that Pelosi is increasingly siding with the liberal members of her caucus on strategy .
Leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have consistently pushed the bill to the left in order to improve the bargaining position it will have in conference with the more centrist Senate when it hammers out a final version .
For the record , Pelosi would also be siding with a large segment of the American people who want that public option : 61 % in the latest Quinnipiac poll .
But , in the world of Capitol Hill , it ’s easy to overlook what the people want .
Max Baucus demonstrated that .
The fact that Progressives are asserting their authority is making the Blue Dogs cranky .
Apparently , the Blue Dogs , who have tried to control the agenda , do n’t like others Democrats using their power , via The Hill :
That strategy has infuriated centrists , particularly Blue Dog Democrats , who do n’t want to take politically risky votes on provisions likely to be bargained away in the final hours .
They feel Pelosi and other leaders have ignored their suggestions .
“ This is n’t about achieving bargaining power in conference , ” said Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin ( D - S.D. ) , a Blue Dog leader .
“ We should be coming together to see what can be achieved . ”
Of all people , Sandlin is the last person to be whining right now .
She famously claimed “ victory ” when the Blue Dogs used their bargaining position to delay passage of the health insurance reform bill before the August recess .
Sandlin was unabashed about flexing the muscle of the Blue Dogs :
“ It is because of the Blue Dog Coalition that there is no floor vote before the August break . ”
The Blue Dogs are n’t running the show this time .
And , I ’m sick of hearing politicians whine about taking tough votes .
That ’s their job .
If they do n’t want to take hard votes for critically important policy , they should n’t be in Congress .
We all tend to make excuses from time to time .
It ’s just human nature .
But I ’ve seen people rely too heavily on excuses when it comes to money .
When they have too much debt or ca n’t seem to make ends meet they pull out the excuses as to why their life has to be this way .
The excuses become a way to avoid dealing with the real problems , which are usually fixable with effort .
Here are the most common excuses I hear and how you can combat them in your own life .
I Just Ca n’t Manage Money
Some people get it in their heads that finance and money are just concepts that are so far above their understanding that they ’ll never get it .
Finance is only for the super intelligent , they think .
Either that or they believe that , having tired and failed , that money is just not something they “ get . ” “ I can ’t ” is a great excuse .
It lets you off the hook for so many things .
The truth is that you can manage money , it just requires some time , effort , and a little education that you are n’t willing to put forth .
Little kids can grasp the basics of money management with a little effort .
So can you .
Try to figure it out .
Ask for help .
Read or take a class .
Get in there and work with your money .
Involvement and practice are the antidotes to , “ I can ’t . ”
I ’ll Never Get Ahead , so Why Bother ?
This is defeatist thinking .
For whatever reason you ’ve convinced yourself that you ’ll never be better off than you are today so you wo n’t even put forth the effort to try .
And you know what ?
You ’re right .
If you wo n’t try to change things they will remain exactly the same .
Here ’s the thing :
Unless you have a crystal ball , you ca n’t know for sure that you ’ll never get ahead and be better off than today .
So what ’s wrong with trying ?
If things do n’t work out , you ’re still where you are today .
But are n’t the potential payoffs worth at least trying ?
Even with a little effort you can drastically improve your finances so think about what might happen if you really make a push to be better .
I ’m Only Young Once
This one is legendary .
People rationalize all kinds of crazy , irresponsible spending in the name of mortality .
“ I want to make memories while my kids are still little so we need that expensive vacation . ”
“ I might get run over by a bus tomorrow , so I want to buy that diamond ring . ”
It ’s true , we all grow up , age , and eventually die .
It ’s sad and there is something to be said for balancing the needs of tomorrow with the desire to live life today .
But when you ’re spending money you do n’t have under the excuse that you might die tomorrow or that your kids wo n’t have any good memories of their childhoods , you ’re not living a balanced life .
You ’re completely neglecting your ( and your kids ’ ) future needs for today ’s wants and that ’s a road to disaster .
Do this often enough and you ’d better hope you do die young because you wo n’t have anything to see you through your old age .
I Deserve a Treat / Reward
You work hard for your money and you want a reward .
I do n’t deny that you deserve to enjoy some of the money you work so hard for .
But you do n’t deserve to enjoy every last cent of it at the expense of your future needs .
You have to take a balanced approach and enjoy some of your money today while saving enough that you can enjoy it later .
And not all money is meant to be enjoyed .
Sometimes money has to pay for things that are no fun like medical care , taxes , car or home repair , or school tuition .
When you ’re spending recklessly on rewards you ’re forgetting the fact that you earn money to pay for more than fun .
It ’d be nice if all money could be used for fun and nothing else , but that ’s not the case .
I ’m Not Good at Math
People who are afraid of math trot out this excuse to avoid dealing with their finances .
But you know what ?
You do n’t have to be good at math to be good at finance .
All you need to know how to do is add , subtract , multiply and divide .
And you do n’t even have to be that good at those with calculators and software programs to help you .
There is no calculus , geometry , or algebra involved in personal finance .
It ’s basic math .
Personally , I stunk at math in school but I am good at personal finance .
Even with a math phobia you can become good at personal finance if you ’re willing .
I ’m Too Overwhelmed to Know Where to Start
If you ’re really in a financial mess it is easier to say you do n’t know where to start than it is to begin .
But if things are really bad , it does n’t matter where you start .
Anything is going to be better than where you are .
It ’s like cleaning a very messy house .
Does it matter if you start in the bathroom or the living room ?
Nope , because every little bit you clean up is going to improve the overall picture .
With finance it does n’t really matter if you start with credit cards , the mortgage , or saving .
Anything is going to be an improvement so just pick something and work on it .
Chances are that the next step will become clearer after you work on one thing for a while .
I ’ll Get to It Later
Funny how “ later ” is the time that never comes .
We put things off and later never comes around .
We get busy with other things and later comes and goes .
Then we get busy with more things and never get around to all of our “ later ” projects .
With finance the longer you put something off , the more difficult it becomes to deal with , the more it costs you , or it becomes too late as in the case of insurance and wills .
Take care of things when you think of them .
Learn not to put things off because procrastination will only cause you more problems .
I Do n’t Make Enough Money to Have the Lifestyle I Want
Maybe you do n’t make enough money right now to solve your financial problems or have the things you want .
But that can be fixed with more income ( or reduced spending ) .
Go get a second job .
Freelance from home .
Ask for a raise at work .
Look for a job that pays more .
Take on overtime .
Send your spouse back to work .
These may not be easy or popular choices but if lack of income is your excuse , the only way to fix it is to bring in more income .
All of the problems / obstacles ( childcare , time management , inexperience , etc. ) of generating more income can be solved with some thought and perseverance .
If you really need more income , the only way to get it is to work more .
Fate / Karma / God
Is against Me
Many people blame whatever power rules their world for their money troubles .
“ Someone up there hates me , ” is a popular excuse because it lets you off the hook .
You ca n’t succeed if “ someone ” is n’t letting you .
I do n’t know enough about theology to be an expert , but I do n’t think that anyone “ up there ” is actively gunning for you .
Chances are your problems are of your own making .
You made a bad decision .
You got involved with the wrong people .
You spent money you did n’t have .
You were n’t informed about what you were getting into .
Your decisions and actions are yours and they can be fixed , or at least not repeated .
Sometimes things just do n’t work out , but it does n’t mean that someone hates you and that you ’ll never succeed .
Figure out what went wrong and then do things differently next time .
I Wo n’t Fit in / I ’ll Lose My Friends
Ah , peer pressure .
If you start saving money and stop spending lavishly , what will your friends think ?
They wo n’t invite you out .
They might think you ’re weird .
They might think ( eek ! ) that you have financial problems .
So you keep things the same as they ’ve always been to keep from running afoul of your friends ’ perceptions .
But this is n’t helping you .
As your mother would have said , “ Do you really want to be friends with people like this ? ”
Change what you need to change and if your friends can’t deal with it , find new friends .
I Got Screwed by [ a Lender , an Employer , the IRS , a Relative … ]
Many people blame others for their financial problems .
“ The bank did n’t explain things to me . ”
“ My employer fired me . ”
“ Joe did n’t pay back that $ 1,000 I loaned him . ”
“ The greedy IRS took $ 10,000 in back taxes . ”
The truth is these problems are the result of bad decisions on your part ( or uncontrollable events like massive layoffs ) .
If you owe the IRS , it ’s because you did n’t file correctly .
If you could n’t lose that $ 1,000 , you should n’t have lent it to irresponsible cousin Joe .
If the bank screwed you , it ’s because you did n’t read the fine print .
If your employer fired you and it was n’t part of a massive layoff related to the economy , you did n’t do your job well enough .
These things are your fault and blaming someone else wo n’t fix it .
You have to figure out where you went wrong and then do things differently next time .
I Do n’t Have Time
Really ?
But you have time to watch TV for three hours a night or play video games for six hours at a stretch .
You can find the time , but you just do n’t want to .
When you do n’t devote time to your finances you ’ll find that they can get out of control pretty quickly .
A few months of unbalanced checkbooks , unpaid bills , investing in the wrong products , or not saving anything can cost you big time .
When you first set out to manage your finances it takes a lot of time to get things organized and set up to run smoothly .
But once you ’ve got everything under control , it only takes a few minutes each day to keep things on track .
Be disciplined and carve out the time to deal with your finances just like any other important responsibility .
I ’m Scared I Might Screw Up
It ’s true that some aspects of finance like taxes , owning a business , and investing can be scary and can carry bad consequences if you mess up .
But you have to push past that fear if you want to succeed .
You can learn what you need to know .
There are plenty of books , websites , and advisors out there that can help you and prevent screw ups .
The IRS is more than willing to help with your tax questions because they want your money .
Many organizations are devoted to helping business owners handle things like taxes , incorporation , and payroll .
A reputable financial advisor can help with your investing decisions .
You do n’t have to go it all alone .
And even if you do screw up , chances are it can be fixed if you work at it .
Financial screw ups are n’t fatal .
You may have a setback , but you can come back from it .
I ’m Too Old / Young , so Why Start Now ?
Age does n’t matter .
If you ’re young and have very little money , you need to carefully manage and grow what you do have .
You need to think about your future , not about those new shoes in the store window .
If you ’re old and your finances are a mess , it ’s not too late to fix it .
Maybe you do n’t have millions , but you can save up something .
Work a couple of extra years .
Get your estate paperwork straight .
Try to limit future damage .
Age is n’t an excuse .
Whether you ’re young or old there is always something you can do to improve your financial situation .
I Do n’t Want to Think about That
No one likes to think about the bad things that might happen and sometimes it feels like if you think about them , they ’ll happen .
It ’s like inviting the devil to the door .
But that ’s exactly what good financial management forces you to do .
You have to think about what happens if you die or become disabled .
What happens if the house burns down or someone gets very ill ?
What happens if you lose your job ?
These are all scary things and it ’s easier to ignore them and hope they do n’t happen than to face up to them .
Bad things happen to everyone and it ’s best to prepare for them when you ’re able , in your right mind , and not facing the pressure of an emergency situation .
Get your will and estate in order .
Purchase life insurance , disability insurance , health insurance , and insurance for your home , car , and other belongings .
Put together an emergency fund to see you through a job loss or other problems .
Get it together now before the bad things happen and you really are screwed .
Excuses are a way to avoid taking responsibility for your finances .
I ’ll admit :
It is easier to fall back on a myriad of excuses than it is to do the real work of becoming financially successful which often requires sacrifice and doing things you may prefer not to do .
But making excuses will never get you where you want to be .
You may tell yourself that you ’re broke because of some excuse , but in your heart you know you could do better .
You just wo n’t because the excuse is easier .
Stop making excuses and start getting your financial life in order .

A company that makes steel for bearings used in heavy trucks had a big problem .
The trucks travel through harsh , perilous environments such as Siberia , and an unexpected bearing failure on a remote stretch could literally put the driver 's life in danger .
Knowing how long the steel would hold up under those conditions was beyond their ability to predict experimentally , so they turned to specialists at MIT .
Under applied weight , steel deforms over time at an ever - increasing rate .
The exponent in the equations governing that process should be three , according to scientific theory , while experiments conducted over many decades always found it was really four or five , says MIT materials scientist Krystyn Van Vliet .
Nobody could demonstrate the reason for this discrepancy — until now , using new computational techniques .
Computers were able to solve the mystery by controlling all the variables and exploring every possible variation , Van Vliet says .
The analysis had to be done at the level of the individual atoms in the material — exactly how carbon atoms are spaced among iron atoms in the material , and how hydrogen atoms penetrate into that structure as the material degrades — in order to understand the behavior of the bulk material .
" In laboratory experiments , it would have been impossible to do in anyone 's lifetime , " she says .
Now , using the analytical tools developed at MIT , the company has embarked on a major program to analyze the material 's degradation and find ways to improve it .
That 's just one example of how the field of materials science has profoundly changed in recent years .
From largely trial - and - error laboratory experiments , the field has graduated to computational methods that use first principles of physics and chemistry to evaluate thousands of different variations in material composition .
The new approach , called computational materials science , is a powerful way of discovering new materials with desired properties — such as improved charge and discharge speeds for battery materials — and of understanding and fine - tuning the properties of well - known , long - used materials such as steel alloys , ceramics , and cement composites , whose fundamental properties are still surprisingly little understood .
Although the approach has evolved over many years , its potential has been recognized only relatively recently , says Sidney Yip , MIT professor emeritus of nuclear science and engineering and materials science and engineering , who retired from teaching duties this summer after 44 years .
" By and large , the role of computers in materials science is still in the process of gaining acceptance , " he says .
" It 's a change of paradigm that seems to be occurring at an accelerating rate . "
Duane Johnson , a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois and a leading researcher in the field , agrees that this is a major change .
" Today , as is reflected in many journal publications , computational materials science is a key , and often equal , partner in characterization of materials , often more than just to support experimental observation , " he says .
" In fact , computationally complex methods provide predictions that are becoming more and more reliable , helping direct experiments and improve materials technologies design . "
That change is so profound that one of the field 's leading researchers , MIT 's Gerbrand Ceder , has called for a massive project somewhat analogous to the Human Genome Project , to create an exhaustive database of all possible inorganic compounds ( those that do n't include carbon ) and their properties .
He calls it the Materials Genome Project .
Computational materials science " emerged a while ago , and is in full bloom now , " says Ceder , the R. P. Simmons Professor of Materials Science and Engineering .
Now , his department has five or six people doing computer modeling full time , he says , and three people who do modeling based on first principles of physics .
" I do n't think people would have anticipated that " even a few years ago , he says .
Working in a virtual world
Using the new computational methods , " we can use modeling almost as a microscope into the nature of materials , " Ceder says .
" If you can realistically simulate the materials , it 's a virtual world : you can do controlled experiments , which are difficult to do in the real world .
It rapidly allows you to understand things . "
Though it 's been building for many years , however , the new approach has not yet yielded many dramatic results , Yip says .
" I think the word is potential .
There are not that many obvious successes so far . "
But there are major efforts under way to bring about those successes .
MIT recently announced a new interdisciplinary project , the Concrete Sustainability Hub ( CSH ) , to study the fundamental properties of concrete and find ways of improving them and of reducing concrete 's massive carbon footprint .
Amazingly , though the material has been in widespread use since the Roman Empire , the basic structure of concrete is still not well understood .
" Nobody knows what its fundamental structure is at the molecular level , " Yip says , though recent work at MIT has provided significant new insights into that structure .
The aim of the CSH is to produce new versions of the material , either with improved properties such as faster setting or greater durability or with a significant reduction in the carbon dioxide emitted by cement manufacturing .
The five - year project , partly funded by the Portland Cement Association , the industry 's trade group , is being led by Franz - Josef Ulm , the Macomber Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering .
The team working on cement science includes several computational materials modelers including Roland Pellenq , Markus Buehler , Nicola Marzari , Jeff Grossman , and Bilge Yildiz , as well as Van Vliet and Yip .
Understanding the detailed properties of materials still requires laboratory experiments — no computer models are perfect , and they may never be .
But the guidance provided by the modeling allows the laboratory work to be done much more efficiently , Ceder explains .
" Now , when you go into the lab , you know what you should be doing , " he says .
" It 's not a random experiment anymore . "
Inorganic oxides and concrete are not the only traditional materials coming under new scrutiny .
Steel alloys , crucial to so much of modern life , are also not well understood .
Yip explains that new , more radiation - resistant steel alloys will be essential for the proposed new generation of nuclear power plants seen by many as an important low - carbon energy source to replace plants that consume fossil fuels .
Predicting steel 's behavior
" It 's a great challenge , " Yip says .
" If we want to extend plant lifetimes from 30 years up to 60 or 80 years , we have to make sure the material can withstand the radiation damage .
Many people are working on that . "
For example , early computational results by Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering Michael Demkowicz are pointing to several possible approaches to damage - resistant microstructures .
Already , this approach has led to some significant progress in steel formulations , says Van Vliet , the Thomas Lord Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering .
For example , one company was finding that steel was failing prematurely , and " they knew they could n't make it better just by processing .
They knew it was failing in certain ways , " and that it could fail sooner via absorption of hydrogen from water and oil .
" Hydrogen embrittlement is an issue for many infrastructure applications , from bridges to nuclear power plants , " Van Vliet says , and the simulations allowed the company to better understand that process .
" It 's very predictive , " she says , allowing solutions to be developed for specific situations .
Other materials that are slowly yielding their secrets to the new computational techniques include the coatings applied to many common mechanical devices .
For example , Carter says , turbine blades used in jet engines may have coatings to protect them from high temperatures .
" A bad thing would be for these blades to lose that coating , " he says .
" We have used computer simulations to analyze the boundary between the coating and the material " in order to understand better how the two might become separated .
Computational methods are also proving useful in explaining how materials change over time — by , say , undergoing gradual corrosion .
And , in the ever - more - important field of battery research , these simulations can show how the components of a lithium - ion battery , for example , are altered by repeated cycles of charging and discharging .
" It gives us new insight into the behavior of these batteries , " Carter says .
" We can relate the microstructure to the overall behavior " of the battery .
The whole field is evolving , and that is changing the way research is carried out and therefore the way the field is taught , says Professor of Materials Science and Engineering W. Craig Carter .
" Over the next decade , how you decide to teach materials science will depend on the evolution of the computer model , " he says .
MIT has played a significant role in the growth of this new approach , says the University of Illinois ' Johnson .
" Certainly , MIT has been a leader in promoting the area of computational materials from the beginning .
They have maintained a strong group of quality researchers in computational materials science and materials physics , " he says .
" The MIT computational materials science faculty continue to be successful in using new and fundamental techniques . "
And the science itself will continue to evolve dramatically , Ceder believes , as the computational techniques become ever more capable of automating the process of discovery and analysis .
" Once you automate things , the world changes , " he says .
But some things wo n't change .
Even as the well - controlled thought experiments offered by computational materials science will drive both the education and the experiments of the next generation of engineers , the field of materials science will continue to rely on good old - fashioned , trial - and - error lab work , researchers say .
" Many materials in widespread use , like concrete , steel , and polymers , are very complex organizations of many atoms which cannot possibly be simulated by computer , " says Carter .
Computational materials science appears to be " generating successes in directing the nature of the experiments that should be done , " he says .
" But then you still have to do the experiments to find out the real properties of the material being studied .
There are some properties that are almost impossible to model . "

Hacking DDC .
Over the last couple of months I 've been doing a bit of hacking on an experimental compiler called DDC .
This has been some of the most interesting , gratifying and challenging hacking I have done in years .
Having this much fun should probably be illegal !!
I was introduced to DDC at the April 2008 meeting of FP - Syd when Ben Lippmeier , its author , gave a presentation titled " The Disciplined Disciple Compiler " .
The two main reasons this compiler is interesting are :
Its written in Haskell an advanced purely functional programming language .
The language it compiles ( Disciple ) has some interesting solutions to the problems of side effects and mutability .
The Disciple language is very Haskell - like but has some extra features in the type system which allows the compiler to track mutability and side effects in the type system .
The important differences between the Disciple language and the Haskell language are listed on the DDC web page as :
Strict Evaluation Order is the default , laziness is introduced explicitly .
Type directed Field Projections complement type classing .
All data objects support Destructive Update .
The Effect System tracks what computational effects are being used in a program , without the need for state monads .
The Class System ensures that effects and destructive update play nicely with laziness .
Closure Typing is used to track data sharing , and to preserve soundness in the presence of Polymorphic Update .
Obviously a compiler that is doing all this really clever stuff has to be pretty complicated , but it still only weighs in at about 50 k lines of code .
The main challenge in working on this is that i am not a very experienced Haskell programmer .
There are also large chunks of the compiler doing some very complicated stuff that I do n't even have a hope of understanding without reading and understanding Ben 's PhD thesis .
Despite that , Ben was willing to give me commit access to the Darcs repo and I have been able to significantly reduce the number of bugs in the DDC bugtracker .
Since I was already pretty familiar with the concepts of lexing and parsing as well as being familiar with Parsec ( probably the most widely used parsing tool in the Haskell community ) I started off fixing some simple lexer and parser bugs like :
I then managed to hack in support for Int64 and Float64 ( #106 ) followed by some significant re-factoring of the Parsec parser which reduced the usage of the Parsec.try construct allowing Parsec to produce much better error messages .
Once I 'd done all that , I ran into a very busy time at work and did n't mess with DDC for a couple of months .
When I finally got back to looking at DDC , I realised that nearly all of the remaining bugs were much deeper than the bugs I had tackled so far .
Tackling these deeper bugs required a new strategy as follows :
Scan the bug list for reports that either had test cases already or give enough information for me to proceed .
Create a new darcs branch for each bug .
This allowed me to work on multiple different bugs at once so that if I got stuck on any one specific bug , I could just leave it and move on to another .
Create a reproducible test case if one did n't exist already .
Create a shell script in the root directory of each branch which did make and then ran the specific test case for this specific bug .
Use Haskell 's Debug .
Trace module in conjunction with Haskell 's very wonderful Show Type Class to add debug statements to the code .
Use the Wolf Fencing debugging technique to narrow down the problem to specific area of the code .
Once the problem had been narrowed down to a piece of code , all that remained was to develop a fix .
In many cases this resulted in me asking Ben how he'd like it fixed , either in email or on IRC .
I also often came up with an ugly fix at first which was refined and cleaned up before being applied and pushed upstream .
With the above methodology I was able to fix a number of deeper and more complex bugs like the following :
I 'm now getting a pretty good idea of how the compiler is put together and I 'm stretching my hacking into feature enhancements .
My enthusiasm for DDC was recently validated by functional programming guru Oleg Kiselyov 's comment on the haskell - cafe mailing list :
" One may view ML and Haskell as occupying two ends of the extreme .
ML assumes any computation to be effectful and every function to have side effects .
Therefore , an ML compiler cannot do optimizations like reordering ( even apply commutative laws where exists ) , unless it can examine the source code and prove that computations to reorder are effect - free .
.....
Haskell , on the other hand , assumes every expression pure .
Lots algebraic properties become available and can be exploited , by compilers and people .
....
Hopefully a system like DDC will find the middle ground . "
Anyway , back to hacking ....

Interesting news this weekend .
Apparently everything we ’ve done in our entire careers is a “ MASSIVE lie ” ( sic ) because all of radiative physics , climate history , the instrumental record , modeling and satellite observations turn out to be based on 12 trees in an obscure part of Siberia .
Who knew ?
Indeed , according to both the National Review and the Daily Telegraph ( and who would not trust these sources ? ) , even Al Gore ’s use of the stair lift in An Inconvenient Truth was done to highlight cherry - picked tree rings , instead of what everyone thought was the rise in CO2 concentrations in the last 200 years .
Who should we believe ?
Al Gore with his “ facts ” and “ peer reviewed science ” or the practioners of “ Blog Science “ ?
Surely , the choice is clear … .
More seriously , many of you will have noticed yet more blogarrhea about tree rings this week .
The target de jour is a particular compilation of trees ( called a chronology in dendro - climatology ) that was first put together by two Russians , Hantemirov and Shiyatov , in the late 1990s ( and published in 2002 ) .
This multi-millennial chronology from Yamal ( in northwestern Siberia ) was painstakingly collected from hundreds of sub - fossil trees buried in sediment in the river deltas .
They used a subset of the 224 trees they found to be long enough and sensitive enough ( based on the interannual variability ) supplemented by 17 living tree cores to create a “ Yamal ” climate record .
A preliminary set of this data had also been used by Keith Briffa in 2000 ( pdf ) ( processed using a different algorithm than used by H&S for consistency with two other northern high latitude series ) , to create another “ Yamal ” record that was designed to improve the representation of long - term climate variability .
Since long climate records with annual resolution are few and far between , it is unsurprising that they get used in climate reconstructions .
Different reconstructions have used different methods and have made different selections of source data depending on what was being attempted .
The best studies tend to test the robustness of their conclusions by dropping various subsets of data or by excluding whole classes of data ( such as tree - rings ) in order to see what difference they make so you wo n’t generally find that too much rides on any one proxy record ( despite what you might read elsewhere ) .
****
So along comes Steve McIntyre , self - styled slayer of hockey sticks , who declares without any evidence whatsoever that Briffa did n’t just reprocess the data from the Russians , but instead supposedly picked through it to give him the signal he wanted .
These allegations have been made without any evidence whatsoever .
McIntyre has based his ‘ critique ’ on a test conducted by randomly adding in one set of data from another location in Yamal that he found on the internet .
People have written theses about how to construct tree ring chronologies in order to avoid end - member effects and preserve as much of the climate signal as possible .
Curiously no - one has ever suggested simply grabbing one set of data , deleting the trees you have a political objection to and replacing them with another set that you found lying around on the web .
The statement from Keith Briffa clearly describes the background to these studies and categorically refutes McIntyre ’s accusations .
Does that mean that the existing Yamal chronology is sacrosanct ?
Not at all – all of the these proxy records are subject to revision with the addition of new ( relevant ) data and whether the records change significantly as a function of that is n’t going to be clear until it ’s done .
What is clear however , is that there is a very predictable pattern to the reaction to these blog posts that has been discussed many times .
As we said last time there was such a kerfuffle :
However , there is clearly a latent and deeply felt wish in some sectors for the whole problem of global warming to be reduced to a statistical quirk or a mistake .
This led to some truly death - defying leaping to conclusions when this issue hit the blogosphere .
Plus ça change …
The timeline for these mini-blogstorms is always similar .
An unverified accusation of malfeasance is made based on nothing , and it is instantly ‘ telegraphed ’ across the denial - o - sphere while being embellished along the way to apply to anything ‘ hockey - stick ’ shaped and any and all scientists , even those not even tangentially related .
The usual suspects become hysterical with glee that finally the ‘ hoax ’ has been revealed and congratulations are handed out all round .
After a while it is clear that no scientific edifice has collapsed and the search goes on for the ‘ real ’ problem which is no doubt just waiting to be found .
Every so often the story pops up again because some columnist or blogger does n’t want to , or care to , do their homework .
Net effect on lay people ?
Confusion .
Net effect on science ?
Zip .
Having said that , it does appear that McIntyre did not directly instigate any of the ludicrous extrapolations of his supposed findings highlighted above , though he clearly set the ball rolling .
No doubt he has written to the National Review and the Telegraph and Anthony Watts to clarify their mistakes and we ’re confident that the corrections will appear any day now … .
Oh yes .
But can it be true that all Hockey Sticks are made in Siberia ?
A RealClimate exclusive investigation follows :
We start with the original MBH hockey stick as replicated by Wahl and Ammann :
Hmmm … neither of the Yamal chronologies anywhere in there .
And what about the hockey stick that Oerlemans derived from glacier retreat since 1600 ?
Nope , no Yamal record in there either .
How about Osborn and Briffa ’s results which were robust even when you removed any three of the records ?
Or there .
The hockey stick from borehole temperature reconstructions perhaps ?
No .
How about the hockey stick of CO2 concentrations from ice cores and direct measurements ?
Err… not even close .
What about the the impact on the Kaufman et al 2009 Arctic reconstruction when you take out Yamal ?
Oh .
The hockey stick you get when you do n’t use tree - rings at all ( blue curve ) ?
No .
Well what about the hockey stick blade from the instrumental record itself ?
And again , no .
But wait , maybe there is something ( Update : Original idea by Lucia ) … .
Nah … .
One would think that some things go without saying , but apparently people still get a key issue wrong so let us be extremely clear .
Science is made up of people challenging assumptions and other peoples ’ results with the overall desire of getting closer to the ‘ truth ’ .
There is nothing wrong with people putting together new chronologies of tree rings or testing the robustness of previous results to updated data or new methodologies .
Or even thinking about what would happen if it was all wrong .
What is objectionable is the conflation of technical criticism with unsupported , unjustified and unverified accusations of scientific misconduct .
Steve McIntyre keeps insisting that he should be treated like a professional .
But how professional is it to continue to slander scientists with vague insinuations and spin made - up tales of perfidy out of the whole cloth instead of submitting his work for peer - review ?
He continues to take absolutely no responsibility for the ridiculous fantasies and exaggerations that his supporters broadcast , apparently being happy to bask in their acclaim rather than correct any of the misrepresentations he has engendered .
If he wants to make a change , he has a clear choice ; to continue to play Don Quixote for the peanut gallery or to produce something constructive that is actually worthy of publication .
Peer - review is nothing sinister and not part of some global conspiracy , but instead it is the process by which people are forced to match their rhetoric to their actual results .
You ca n’t generally get away with imprecise suggestions that something might matter for the bigger picture without actually showing that it does .
It does matter whether something ‘ matters ’ , otherwise you might as well be correcting spelling mistakes for all the impact it will have .
So go on Steve , surprise us .
Update : Briffa and colleagues have now responded with an extensive ( and in our view , rather convincing ) rebuttal .
Dr. Chris James demonstrating brain to brain communication using BCI to transmit thoughts , translated as a series of binary digits , over the internet to another person whose computer receives the digits .

New research from the University of Southampton has demonstrated that it is possible for communication from person to person through the power of thought alone .
Brain - Computer Interfacing ( BCI ) can be used for capturing brain signals and translating them into commands that allow humans to control ( just by thinking ) devices such as computers , robots , rehabilitation technology and virtual reality environments .
This experiment goes a step further and was conducted by Dr Christopher James from the University 's Institute of Sound and Vibration Research .
The aim was to expand the current limits of this technology and show that brain - to - brain ( B2B ) communication is possible .
Dr James comments : " Whilst BCI is no longer a new thing and person to person communication via the nervous system was shown previously in work by Professor Kevin Warwick from the University of Reading , here we show , for the first time , true brain to brain interfacing .
We have yet to grasp the full implications of this but there are various scenarios where B2B could be of benefit such as helping people with severe debilitating muscle wasting diseases , or with the so - called ' locked - in ' syndrome , to communicate and it also has applications for gaming . "
His experiment had one person using BCI to transmit thoughts , translated as a series of binary digits , over the internet to another person whose computer receives the digits and transmits them to the second user 's brain through flashing an LED lamp .
While attached to an EEG amplifier , the first person would generate and transmit a series of binary digits , imagining moving their left arm for zero and their right arm for one .
The second person was also attached to an EEG amplifier and their PC would pick up the stream of binary digits and flash an LED lamp at two different frequencies , one for zero and the other one for one .
The pattern of the flashing LEDS is too subtle to be picked by the second person , but it is picked up by electrodes measuring the visual cortex of the recipient .
The encoded information is then extracted from the brain activity of the second user and the PC can decipher whether a zero or a one was transmitted .
This shows true brain - to - brain activity .

Google has announced a pact to feed Twitter 's Web2.0 rhea straight into its search engine , hours after Microsoft unveiled a similar deal .
" We are very excited to announce that we have reached an agreement with Twitter to include their updates in our search results , " reads a blog post from Googirl Marisa Mayer .
" We believe that our search results and user experience will greatly benefit from the inclusion of this up - to - the - minute data , and we look forward to having a product that showcases how tweets can make search better in the coming months . "
Presumably , Google 's deal was already in place , but the unveiling was rushed out as part of its ongoing tete - a- tete with Redmond .
What does this mean for netizens ?
" The next time you search for something that can be aided by a real - time observation , say , snow conditions at your favorite ski resort , " Mayer says , " you 'll find tweets from other users who are there and sharing the latest and greatest information . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression has ended , but weak household spending as the labor market struggles to create jobs will slow the pace of the economy ’s recovery , according to a survey released on Monday .
The survey of 44 professional forecasters released by the National Association for Business Economics , also known as the NABE , found that 80 percent of the respondents believed the economy was growing again after four straight quarters of declines .
“ The great recession is over , ” NABE President - Elect Lynn Reaser said .
“ The vast majority of business economists believe that the recession has ended , but that the economic recovery is likely to be more moderate than those typically experienced following steep declines . ”
Recessions in the United States are dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
The private - sector group , which does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product , often takes months to make determinations .
The recession that started in December 2007 is the longest and deepest since the 1930s .
It was triggered by the U.S. housing market ’s collapse and the ensuing global credit crisis .
While the economy is believed to have rebounded in the third quarter , analysts believe that ordinary Americans will probably not see much difference as unemployment will remain high well into 2010 , restraining consumption .
“ We do n’t necessarily expect the U.S. economy to fall into a double - dip recession .
This time round , consumers will be reluctant to join the party , ” said Paul Ashworth , senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto .
The NABE survey , conducted in September , predicted real GDP growth expanding at an annual pace of 2.9 percent over the second half of this year .
Output for all of 2009 is expected to contract 2.5 percent and next year , rebound 2.6 percent .

Much of the anticipated recovery was seen driven by businesses rebuilding their inventories after aggressively reducing unwanted stockpiles of unsold goods to match weak demand .
HOUSING PRICES TO HIT BOTTOM
Investment in the residential market would also add to growth , with the majority of the survey ’s respondents convinced that the housing market downturn , which has lasted more than three years , was close to coming to an end .
About two - thirds of respondents believed house prices will reach a bottom this year .
The survey found that high house prices would not pose a threat to the sector ’s recovery .
The survey predicted that the unemployment rate will rise to 10 percent in the first quarter of 2010 and edge down to 9.5 percent by the end of that year .
The labor market was not expected to regain most of the jobs destroyed in the recession until 2012 or beyond .
The weak labor market will continue to weigh on consumer spending , slowing the recovery .
The jobless rate climbed to 9.8 percent in September -- a 26 - year high -- from August ’s 9.7 percent .
Labor market slack , combined with weak wage growth , meant inflation would not be an obstacle to the economic recovery and the Federal Reserve will not be under pressure to raise interest rates , the survey found .
“ With improving credit markets , the U.S. economy can return to solid growth next year without worry about rising inflation , ” Reaser said .
The U.S. central bank was seen leaving its overnight benchmark lending rate near zero until late next spring , followed by measured increases that would take the rate to 1 percent by the end of 2010 , the survey showed .
Despite signs of improvement in the financial markets , most respondents believed that it would take some time for them to return to normal .
Only 29 percent believed this would happen in the second half of next year .
Respondents also expected the U.S. dollar to weaken further this year and into 2010 , but did not see this contributing to a narrowing of the country ’s trade deficit as the economic revival stimulates demand for imports .
The dollar has lost about 5.8 percent of its value against a basket of currencies so far this year , largely because of worries over the government ’s growing budget deficit and expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates at super - low levels for a while .

Energy chiefs have warned of further possible damaging floods along the Shannon after the swollen river reached record levels .
As Taoiseach Brian Cowen visits the worst affected regions , the ESB said parts of counties Clare and Limerick faced further damage .
" Exceptional flooding along the River Shannon - the highest on record - requires ESB to increase the amount of water that must be released at Parteen Weir , " the ESB said .
" The discharge levels have been growing in recent days but the release of higher volumes of water downstream will become unavoidable ...
Localised downstream areas can expect higher flood levels as a result . "
The Parteen Weir controls the flow of water into Ardnacrusha power station further downstream .
Councils in Clare , Limerick and North Tipperary and local emergency services warned areas from Parteen downstream to Limerick city face further floods .
Mr Cowen , in Cork before visiting Clare and Galway , said the focus of work should be on helping those affected by floods .
The Taoiseach refused to be drawn on calls for an inquiry into the floods .
Meanwhile , Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds urged the public to take extra care in flooded and coastal areas .
" The public is strongly advised not to go out on exposed coasts , cliffs , piers , harbour walls , beaches , promenades or any other coastal areas , " he said .
" Do not attempt to cross at fast running river or flood water fords as they may be stronger and deeper than you think .
Flooded urban areas may contain many hazards , not least of which include submerged open manholes and downed power lines .
" The combination of tides , forecasted gales warnings for later this week , high sea conditions and swollen rivers may result in very dangerous conditions . "

Testing the long nose of the law :
Do car odors belong to you ?
State high court takes up unique drug case
The Illinois Supreme Court is weighing a possible first - of - its kind ruling on the legality of a new drug - dog search procedure and the limits of police powers .
SPRINGFIELD - Suppose the next time police stop your vehicle the officer asks for your license , insurance card and then tells you to roll up the windows and crank the fan .
Excuse me ?
That very scenario is now before the Illinois Supreme Court for a possible first - of - its kind ruling on the legality of a new drug - dog search procedure and the limits of police powers .
The case stems from a 2006 downstate case in which an officer in Adams County stopped Cheryl Bartelt after observing her parked illegally .
After taking the routine information and telling the driver of the violation , the officer - who'd heard the driver was involved with methamphetamines - instructed Bartelt to roll up her windows and turn the fan on high .
By that time a police dog had arrived and , as the fan blew inside , the dog sniffed outside and was alerted to contraband .
A search of the vehicle found possible methamphetamine paraphernalia and residue .
Bartelt was charged with unlawful possession .
However , her attorney successfully fought to suppress the evidence , arguing it was illegally obtained .
The case ping - ponged through the courts and is now before the Illinois Supreme Court , which recently heard arguments in Springfield .
The questions posed could have significant legal implications but also sound a bit odd for the justices of the high court .
For instance , are the odors inside your vehicle yours ?
Is there an expectation of privacy attached to interior aromas protecting them from the prying eyes ... err noses ... of police outside barring probable cause for a search ?
Arden Lang , the attorney for the driver , argues the police had no right to be inside the vehicle so officers got creative and found a way to force the inside air out and in doing so violated the driver 's rights .
" Air is part of your home .
Air is part of your car , " Lang recently told justices .
" You can't say you have a privacy right in your floorboards but not the other . "
Lang argues the procedure the police employed is akin to letting the drug dog roam inside the vehicle , something that is n't allowed without probable cause .
Court documents show the procedure in question is being taught by the Illinois State Police .
Obviously the attorney representing the police disagrees , saying air is coming in and going out of vehicles all the time .
The meth - tainted air inside this vehicle would have eventually come out and alerted the dog , so the procedure and the arrest are legitimate .
" An expectation to privacy in air in the vehicle is unreasonable under these circumstances , " Katherine D. Saunders told justices during the arguments .
For their part , justices seemed skeptical of both sides .
Chief Justice Thomas Fitzgerald noted airport luggage can be " fluffed " to force out air for screening but there 's not been a case examining the legality of forcing ambient air out of a vehicle 's interior .
" Why should this ... be authorized by this court ? "
Fitzgerald asked the attorney for the police .
And Justice Ann Burke questioned why police did n't first let the dog walk around the car .
But Justice Robert Thomas noted police are free to act on things they see in plain sight and for this case wondered , " Is there plain smell ? "
There is no immediate deadline for the justices to render an opinion in the case .

The White House misread the congressional mood regarding Guantanamo Bay -- as it found out abruptly in May , when the Senate voted 90 - 6 against funds for closing the base | REUTERS Obama 's Gitmo blame game
Greg Craig , the top in - house lawyer for President Barack Obama , is getting the blame for botching the strategy to shut down Guantanamo Bay prison by January — so much so that he ’s expected to leave the White House in short order .
But sources familiar with the process believe Craig is being set - up as the fall guy and say the blame for missing the deadline extends well beyond him .

Instead , it was a widespread breakdown on the political , legislative , policy and planning fronts that contributed to what is shaping up as one of Obama ’s most high - profile setbacks , these people say .
The White House misread the congressional mood – as it found out abruptly in May , when the Senate voted 90 - 6 against funds for closing the base after Republicans stoked fears about bringing prisoners to the U.S.
The House also went on record last week opposing bringing Gitmo detainees here .
The White House misread the public mood – as roughly half of Americans surveyed say they disagree with Obama ’s approach .
A strong element of NIMBY - ism permeates those results , as Americans say they do n’t want the prisoners in their backyards .
But most of all Obama ’s aides mistook that political consensus from the campaign trail for a deep commitment in Washington to do whatever it takes to close the prison .
“ The administration came in reading there to be wide support for closing Guantanamo at home and abroad , and I think it misread that attitude , ” said Matthew Waxman , a Columbia law professor who held Defense and State Department positions on detainee policy .
“ In general , they were right …. but there was very little willingness to accept the costs and risks of getting it done . ”
The White House declined to make Craig available for an interview , or discuss the Gitmo deliberations in detail , but several allies and even some critics scoffed at suggestions that Craig bears the main responsibility for the missteps .
“ This clearly was a decision that had the full support of the entire national security team , ” said Ken Gude , who tracks Guantanamo issues for the liberal Center for American Progress think tank .
“ It ’s typical Washington that someone has their head on the chopping block , but it ’s ridiculous that it ’s Craig . ”
“ The implication that this was the brainchild of the White House counsel is not really credible , ” said Elisa Massimino of Human Rights First .
When Obama signed a series of executive orders on Guantanamo during his second full day in office , what grabbed attention was not his promise to close the prison but his pledge to do it within one year .
During the presidential campaign , Obama talked almost daily about closing Guantanamo , but he rarely offered a timeline .
His Republican rival , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , spoke in a far greater specificity , proposing to move the Gitmo prisoners to Ft. Leavenworth in Kansas .
However , back in July 2007 , Obama co-sponsored an amendment offered by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) and Sen. Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) that called for Guantanamo to close within a year .
Obama ’s primary rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) was also a co-sponsor .
Some Bush administration officials contend that the one - year timeline was driven by a naïveté on the part of Obama ’s aides .
“ To a certain extent , they had drunk a lot of the far - left Kool - aid : that everybody , or most people , at Guantanamo were innocent and should n’t be there , and the Bush administration was not working very hard to resolve these issues , and that the issues were fairly easy to resolve once adults who were really committed to doing something about it in charge , ” said one Bush official who met with Obama ’s aides during the transition on Gitmo .
“ It became clear to me they had not really done their homework on the details . ”
But even back on Jan. 22 , 2009 , the same day Obama signed the orders , Craig acknowledged some of the difficulties involved – including that some of the detainees can never be tried , a problem Craig called “ difficult ” and “ most controversial . ”
Now Obama ’s decision to set a one - year deadline is being widely second - guessed .
Craig supported the idea – and Craig ’s allies say that a deadline was needed to persuade foreign governments that Obama was serious .
They note that President George W. Bush talked on at least eight occasions about his desire to close Guantanamo – and left office with 250 prisoners there .
“ Simply reasserting the intention to close Guantanamo would not have been sufficient in the international community , ” Gude said .
“ They had to have a firm date and they had to have a timeline . ”
Gude had advocated an 18 - month timeline to “ build in a cushion ” but he said the only real mistakes the White House made involved failing to anticipate the resistance in Congress – particularly surrounding the Senate ’s sharp rejection of Obama ’s $ 80 million request to close Gitmo .
“ They made that request without much supporting information and opened the door for Republicans in Congress to make it a Congressional issue and they did it very successfully , ” Gude said .
“ The White House did n’t have a plan to support Democrats who were willing to back up their proposal and it all fell apart . ”
Craig ’s backers contend that , if that was the White House ’s key misjudgment , other top officials share responsibility for the breakdown .
“ It seems very unlikely to me that Greg Craig , by himself , engineered a DOD appropriations request , ” one lawyer close to Craig said .
In retrospect , there were early signs of possible trouble ahead .
Within hours of Obama signing the orders , McCain warned of a backlash and said the time frame the president set out would be “ very difficult ” to achieve .
A McCain adviser said the Obama team should have known .
“ I do n’t think they realized how much heat McCain took from conservatives ” during the GOP primary , said the aide , who asked not to be named .
“ Had they been aware of that I do n’t think they would have handled it this way ….. It should n’t have surprised anybody . ”
Today , the National Security Council and Obama senior adviser Pete Rouse are effectively in charge of closing Gitmo , though Press Secretary Robert Gibbs denied Craig had been stripped of his responsibilities on the prison .
“ There are number of people that are working on it , Greg being one of them , ” Gibbs said .
A review of Guantanamo prisoners is also nearly complete , with about 80 detainees up for release and State Department envoy Dan Fried lining up places to receive them .
“ Our friends and allies have accepted or agreed to accept more than 30 of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be sent home due to humane treatment concerns , and are seriously considering taking others , ” said a White House official who asked not to be named .
But it ’s been slow .
Obama ’s administration has transferred 17 Guantanamo prisoners to other countries so far – compared to 19 by the Bush administration in the first nine months of 2008 .
Obama aides have blamed the delays on disarray in government files about the detainees , but several former officials said that is not directly linked to the thorniest questions such as where to locate detainees in the U.S.
“ Those issues that have been kicked down the road are by far the hardest , ” Waxman said .
Often , sites view seo and PPC marketing as exclusive marketing techniques .
Each marketing method has its advocates .
In reality , both have a place in the Internet marketing process .
If you intend to pursue a major seo effort , a PPC campaign is a critical early step .
PPC For Testing
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s say you have a site offering a service or product in the travel market .
YouÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve put together a healthy budget and decided to go for broke .
Yep , you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re optimizing and trading links in an effort to go after keyword phrases with major traffic and competition .
For instance , you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve decided to have a go at Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Europe travelÃ¢â‚ ¬Â , which has roughly 400,000 searches each month and major competition for high rankings .
You spend two years trading links , adding content and so on .
Miracle of miracles , you pop on to the first page of search results .
You start shopping for your private jet only to realize a very disturbing thing .
You are getting thousands of visits , but few sales .
After running calculations , you find the site is converting at 1 in 10,000 .
Houston , we have a problem .
A PPC campaign should be used to test your site against keyword phrases before you spend the time and money on an seo campaign .
The best platforms to use for your campaign are Google Adwords and Overture .
Yes , click fraud is a problem , but less so on these platforms .
After opening accounts and laying a credit card down at the PPC alter , you need to give some thought at to how you will test your keywords .
HereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a hint .
The campaign should be designed to test the keyword phrases , not maximize sales .
This may sound like a strange statement , but keep in mind the purpose of the campaign .
You are determining whether you have picked appropriate keyword phrases for the seo campaign .
So , how does it all go wrong ?
With both Overture and Adwords , you have the ability to designate the reach of your keyword phrases .
Most pick the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ broad matchÃ¢â‚ ¬Â option , which is terrible for testing .
With broad match , your advertisements are going to appear for your keyword phrase AND variations of the phrase .
Since the ad is appearing on a variety of keyword phrases , the results can give you a false impression of the value of the primary keyword phrase .
Going back to our example , we start a Google Adwords campaign for Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Europe travelÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and use the default broad match option .
After a month , we are happy to find the ads converting at 1 in 70 .
Having validated the keyword phrase , we set off on the long seo campaign .
But are we really sure about the validity of the keyword phrase .
Since Google has been known to seriously expand keyword phrases under the broad match option , how do we know that the true keyword phrase isnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ European travelÃ¢â‚ ¬Â ?
We donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t unless we take a few additional steps .
The first step is to limit the PPC advertisements by bypassing the broad match option .
Instead , you want to limit the appearance of the ad only to searches for the exact keyword phrase .
In Adwords , this is known as the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ exact phraseÃ¢â‚ ¬Â match .
To designate it , you simply place brackets Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ [ ] Ã¢â‚ ¬Â around the keyword phrase .
Second , you need to track traffic originating from the ads .
This can be done using tracking tools on your server or through the tracking options offered by each PPC platform .
Regardless of your choice , the resulting data will give a much truer picture of the value of the particular keyword phrases .
Nothing is more aggravating then getting top rankings , but miserable conversions .
The only way to beat this problem is to test , test , test .
Using PPC campaigns at the outset of an Internet marketing efforts can save you a lot of headaches later on .
Researchers are developing a number of vaccines with the potential to prevent ear infections in children .
Enlarge By Jennifer S. Altman for USA TODAY Denise Gordon anda Todd Wiley observe their children Jackson , 4 , and Langston Wiley , 6 , at their home in Brooklyn .
the boys had tubes implanted in their ears because of infections , but are better now .

Ear infections are a painful rite of passage — both for crying children and their sleep - deprived parents .
With about 13 million annual cases in children under 5 , ear infections are the leading reason for prescribing antibiotics , according to an article in Pediatrics in May .
The ailments are more common in the first few years of life because the eustachian tubes in a young child 's middle ears are short , floppy and prone to collecting fluid that can foster bacteria .
Some children suffer more than others .
Jackson Wiley , 4 , and his brother , Langston , 6 , had so many ear infections that the fluid in their ears actually muffled sounds from the outside world .
Because they could n't hear well , both boys had trouble learning to talk , says their mother , Denise Gordon of Brooklyn , N.Y .
" They were n't following directions , and we were n't sure if they could n't understand or if they could n't hear , " says Gordon , who takes both children to speech therapy .
When the child were 2 , their doctor recommended surgery to implant ear tubes .
The procedure aims to ventilate the middle ear and allow fluid to drain rather than build up and get infected , says the boys ' doctor , Richard Rosenfeld , professor and chairman of otolaryngology at Long Island College Hospital .
More than 300,000 kids have the procedures each year , according to Pediatrics .
Both children needed a repeat procedure to install a second set of tubes in each ear , Gordon says .
Because the tubes tend to fall out after 12 to 18 months , about one in three children need repeat procedures , Rosenfeld says .
Although the boys can now hear and speak well , Langston is still prone to painful ear infections , Gordon says .
Though researchers do n't yet have a way to stop this suffering , they are working on at least three experimental vaccines with the potential to prevent ear infections .
Developing vaccines for ear infections is tricky because more than 100 types of germs cause such infections , Rosenfeld says .
Because children develop ear infections so often , and because parents miss so much work because of them , certain vaccines against ear infections could actually be cost - effective , even if they cost $ 65 to $ 125 each , says Tracy Lieu of Children 's Hospital Boston , co-author of the Pediatrics paper .
Three candidate vaccines might offer relief : Prevnar 13
The Prevnar vaccine , licensed in 2000 , prevents infection with seven of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal pneumonia , meningitis and blood infections , which can be fatal .
The same bacteria also cause ear infections , Rosenfeld says .
Prevnar has helped reduce cases of invasive pneumococcal disease , such as pneumonia and meningitis , by 34 % , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
But the vaccine has barely made a dent in the number of ear infections , Rosenfeld says .
That 's because many other types of pneumococcus also cause ear infections , and these strains have proliferated to replace the bacteria blocked by the vaccine .
Wyeth , which makes Prevnar , has applied for approval of a second - generation vaccine to block 13 strains of pneumococcus , hoping to offer even better protection against pneumonia and meningitis .
The company expects the Food and Drug Administration to decide on approval by the end of September , says spokeswoman Lili Gordon .
Doctors do n't yet know how the new vaccine will affect ear infections , Rosenfeld says .
Synflorix GlaxoSmithKline has developed a vaccine called Synflorix , approved in Europe in March , against 10 types of pneumococcal bacteria that cause ear infections and more serious illness .
In a 2006 study in The Lancet , an early version of Synflorix reduced ear infections by 34 % .
GlaxoSmithKline does n't know how well the final version will prevent ear infections , because researchers have n't yet completed a definitive trial , says company spokesman Jeff McLaughlin .
The company has not yet applied for FDA approval .
A topical vaccine Hoping to spare children from the pain of shots , researchers at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , are testing a topical vaccine against ear infections .
The vaccine — so far tested only in chinchillas , a type of rodent — is rubbed into the skin around the ear .
The topical vaccine still needs to be tested in humans .
And even if it 's successful , it would take years before it would be ready for approval , says researcher Lauren Bakaletz , a professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine .
If the vaccines are approved , Gordon says she would definitely consider them for her boys .
" I see what my son goes through , " she says .
" The pain is really bad . "
Until then , parents and children are left to take comfort in the fact that children eventually grow out of ear infections , Rosenfeld says .
Ear infections tend to become much less common by age 3 or 4 and almost disappear by age 7 .
" It 's an occupational hazard of childhood , " Gordon says .
" The only cure is to feed them and water them and let kids grow up . "

Well , you know how these things go ... We can't come right out and name any names .
( Unless someone can hook me up right quick with the Witness Protection Program ? )
However , I will tell you that this leading character is a male , and he is not necessarily pictured above .
( He might be , he might not be . )
And he is one of the original cast .
And you thought Hayden 's same - sex kiss was surprising , eh ?

Thanks partly to his miserable end 40 years ago , Kerouac has lost some of his lustre as a counterculture icon .
But that was never what he wanted to be
Forty years ago today , Jack Kerouac died .
Not for him the glorious blaze that 's the proverbial price of a life lived too fast .
At the age of 47 , he may have died relatively young , but he did n't leave a good - looking corpse .
Kerouac had retreated into the philosophical if not actual loneliness of the writer 's life , and died in hospital after vomiting much of his vitality out into the toilet of the home he shared with his wife and mother in Florida , America 's sunshine retirement capital .
Bloated , reactionary and guileless , his was a painful and undignified death , brought on my too much drink and dissolute living , played out in the presence of the mother whose apron strings he could n't seem to cut , and the wife who did n't understand him .
Venerated by his fans and dismissed by many critics ( Truman Capote was probably the most memorably sniffy about his spontaneous prose - poetry and the work of the Beat writers at large : ' None of these people have anything interesting to say , ' he said , ' and none of them can write , not even Mr Kerouac . '
It 'is n't writing at all - it 's typing . '
But he did not want for detractors ) , Kerouac has divided opinion as to his literary merit since his ungainly demise .
But has his time finally come round again ?
The evidence against Kerouac is , on the face of it , overwhelming .
As joyful as his lyrical , stream - of - consciousness prose could be , it was n't , we are reminded , proper writing .
For a counterculture legend , he could come across like a grumpy old man from a US sitcom ; while his foil and pal Neal Cassady moved seamlessly from the 1950s Beat Generation to the hippy revolution of the 60s , Kerouac could n't or would n't understand this brave new world .
When Cassady , by now running with the new generation epitomised by Ken Kesey 's Merry Pranksters , visited him in 1964 , Jack doubtfully took LSD and ended up silently beating himself up over the perceived failings which saw him kicked out of the Merchant Navy .
But to accept all that as criticism of Kerouac is to misunderstand what he was all about .
He never set himself up as the champion of a nation - changing revolutionary counterculture - he was just a kid from a blue - collar background who longed to write .
While contemporaries such as Allen Ginsberg , William S Burroughs and Gary Snyder seemed to have an innate " otherness " that set them apart from the rank - and - file of post - war American society , Kerouac refused to fully excise the connections that hooked him to his fairly average working - class upbringing .
Ginsberg was the bearded , dark - eyed nightmare ready to subvert the American dream with his shouty poems and alien sexuality ; Kerouac seemed to remain the type of square - jawed college boy you could take home to your mother for Sunday lunch ( assuming he was going easy on the sauce that day ) .
Few of us could aspire to be Ginsberg , but we could all hope to be Kerouac .
The fat , depressed , apparently antisemitic Jack Kerouac who died after throwing his guts up in the toilet in St Petersburg , Florida – that 's not the Jack we like to remember .
That 's not the Jack buried beneath the flat headstone in the cemetery just outside the town of Lowell , about 30 miles outside of Boston , where Kerouac grew up .
Back in the late 90s I found myself in Boston and struck out for Lowell .
It 's a pretty , spacious red - brick former mill town , which honours Kerouac in a non-flashy kind of way .
There 's a small sculpture park comprising half a dozen monoliths on which were etched passages from Jack 's work .
The man in the tourist information bureau , upon selling me a couple of Kerouac books that I had n't found in British bookshops , gave me a photocopy of a hand - drawn map showing some important sites – his old house , his school – and the location of his grave in the municipal Edson Cemetery .
It was a blazing hot July day , and I walked the few miles from the town centre to the cemetery , past white picket fences and well - tended yards .
I found Jack 's grave in the deserted cemetery .
" Ti Jean " , it said on it : his childhood nickname in Canuck patois , Little Jack .
Previous well - wishers had left gifts of beer - bottle caps , unsmoked joints , key - rings , scrawled notes .
When Kerouac was returned to his home to be buried on 24 October 1969 , there were allegedly two old Lowellians outside the church .
One asked whose funeral it was .
" Jack Kerouac , " said the other .
The first ruminated for a moment then said , " Who 's Jack Kerouac ? "
Who was Jack Kerouac ?
Not the best writer in the world , but a writer nonetheless .
Perhaps not the revolutionary hero some people think he was n't very good at being , but which he was n't actually trying to be .
An ordinary guy thrust into sometimes extraordinary situations , trying to straddle the abyss between what was expected of him and what he wanted to be ?
An incredible humanist , wide - eyed at the possibilities of life ?
A man of confused but deep spirituality ?
That 's what I got as I sat beside Jack 's grave on that hot July afternoon .
A long - awaited movie adaptation of Kerouac 's breakthrough book ,
On the Road , is due out next year , with Sam Riley , who played Ian Curtis in the Joy Division biopic Control , slated for the role of Jack 's alter ego , Sal Paradise .
Whether it reconciles the duality of Kerouac the legend and Kerouac the man – both of which have been found wanting in many regards – perhaps it does signal that we 're on the road to a new and overdue appreciation of Jack Kerouac .
• This article was amended on 23 October 2009 to expand and give added context for Truman Capote 's remark on Kerouac and the Beats .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a big fan of naming and shaming .
When it launched its patent - busting project a few years back , the activist group put up a " Wanted by EFF marshals " poster ; eight of the ten patents on the list have already been narrowed , invalidated , or reexamined .
So when it wanted to highlight the overzealous use of DMCA takedown notices on the Web , the EFF went a similar route with its new " Takedown Hall of Shame . "
Initially , eight items have been granted the coveted laurel wreath of infamy :
NPR 's takedown request of some All Things Considered audio used in a recent same - sex marriage ad
The National Organization for Marriage 's takedown request on audition footage for its anti-gay marriage ad
Nativist radio host Michael Savage 's takedown request against the Council on Islamic - American Relations for posting clips of the rhetoric found on Savage 's show
Polo Ralph Lauren 's takedown request against Boing Boing and the Photoshop Disasters blog over a ridiculously photoshopped model whose head looked like a pumpkin on a toothpick
Warner Music Group 's YouTube takedowns against " literal videos " and teens singing Warner songs a cappella for friends
Diamond giant DeBeers ' attempt to shutter a parody site that looked like the New York Times and contained a fake DeBeers ad reading : " Your purchase of a diamond will enable us to donate a prosthetic for an African whose hand was lost in diamond conflicts .
DeBeers : from her fingers to his . "
Diebold 's 2003 takedown attempt against internal e-mails revealing problems with the company 's voting machines
NBC 's takedown request of an Obama campaign video in which Tom Brokaw calls the election for John McCain
Most of these takedown requests have already been overturned or rescinded , though not all of them .
The Obama video , made to encourage supporters to get out and vote , remains inaccessible on YouTube .
A careful look at the list is instructive .
The National Organization for Marriage ( NOM ) is on the list because gay - marriage supporters somehow got hold of the audition tapes for NOM 's best - known ad , tapes that were then aired on the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC .
NOM sent a takedown notice .
Ironically , NOM had been on the receiving end of just such a request a few weeks earlier , during the controversy over Miss California , Carrie Prejean .
When Prejean came out against gay marriage during the Miss USA pageant , judge Perez Hilton bashed Prejean as a " dumb bitch . "
NOM promptly stuck this footage in one of its ads to show the intolerance of the " tolerant " Hilton , and Hilton filed a takedown request ( as did the Miss USA pageant ) .
Weeks later , NOM tried the same thing , and was just as successful ; the clip is still up on the MSNBC web site .
One other item of interest : Big Content is represented less than one might think .
The complete list does mention NBC , NPR , Warner Music , CBS News , and Universal Music , but it 's dominated by smaller , non-media players like Union Square Partnership , Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association , Uri Geller , Diebold , and DeBeers .
If you talk to lawyers for the big content providers ( which we do so you do n't have to !
I kid , they 're nice people ) , they will point out that the flood of DMCA takedown notices they issue results only in a handful of problem cases .
These are then — unfairly , in their view — harped on repeatedly to suggest that they care nothing for fair use , have no sense of proportion , and probably nibble on succulent children for breakfast .
Miroslav Ciro Blazevic - who has Portsmouth star Asmir Begovic in his squad - said : " I take two of my players and tell them , ' Love him !
Kiss him !' and he kisses him . "
The House committee that oversees the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) passed an amendment today that adds language to the committee ’s report urging the DOJ to clarify its position on state - legal medical marijuana .
The provision is a non-binding recommendation , but carries weight given the committee ’s role in funding the department .
…
The language , sponsored by Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - N.Y. ) , states , “ There have been conflicting public reports about the Department ’s [ DOJ ] enforcement of medical marijuana policies .
Within 60 days of enactment , the Department shall provide to the Committee clarification of the Department ’s policy regarding enforcement of federal laws and use of federal resources against individuals involved in medical marijuana activities . ”
Via Ben Morris at MPP
Although federal interference with state medical marijuana laws has been sparse since Obama took office , we have seen evidence of a potential loophole in the attorney general 's pledge to respect state laws .
As long as charges are brought in federal and not state court , there exists no mechanism for determining that state laws were ever violated , thus DEA could theoretically raid legitimate dispensaries based on unverified claims that local laws were being broken .
That 's why Hinchey 's effort to ensure accountability is so important .
Although public outrage has been a powerful force towards pushing federal medical marijuana policy in a more reasonable direction , we simply cannot count on DEA to execute the new policy in good faith .
The more pressure that 's applied early on , the better our chance of ensuring that the worst excesses of the war on medical marijuana are behind us .
ALBERTVILLE , AL - A Marshall County woman is in the city jail here for having her 13 - year - old daughter ride in a cardboard box atop her van .
Albertville Police spokesman Sgt. Jamie Smith said Jackie Denise Knott , 37 , of Albertville was charged with endangering the welfare of a child .
Smith said the child was turned over to a relative .
Smith said police received a call Sunday morning of a minivan traveling on U.S. 431 with a large cardboard box on top with a child inside .
Officers stopped the van on U.S. 431 and asked Knott why the child was riding atop her vehicle .
" The box was too big to go inside the van , and she would be able to hold it down if she was inside the box , " Smith said the woman told police .
When asked about the child 's safety , Smith said Knott told the officers that she had the box secured to the van with a clothes hanger .
But while the plan would pare compensation substantially from what the highest - paid people at the companies might have received under normal circumstances , it would still permit multimillion - dollar pay packages .
In addition , it would have no direct impact on firms that did not receive government bailouts or that have already repaid loans they received from Washington .
Therefore , it is unclear how much effect , if any , the plan will have on the broader issues relating to executive compensation , income inequality and the populist animosity toward Wall Street and corporate America .
The plan , which was written by Kenneth R. Feinberg , the official at the Treasury Department in charge of setting compensation for bailed - out companies , will be made public in a few days .
The official who described the plan ’s basic components did not disclose the particular impact on specific employees of the firms .
Wall Street is facing criticism and anger over the large year - end bonuses at many firms .
Firms like Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley received tens of billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees from the government but because they have returned the loans , they are no longer under any pay restrictions .
With the financial markets and their profits recovering after the huge government assistance program last year , the three are expected to make huge payouts this year even as unemployment continues to rise .
The administration and regulators at the Federal Reserve have been preparing new guidelines to align executive pay scales at banks with appropriate risk - taking .
But the White House , which has come under attack from conservatives for giving the government what they consider too large and intrusive a role in the economy , has also made clear that it has no intention of seeking to impose any broad - based caps on executive pay .
In a corehackers discussion yesterday , David Golden suggested that collecting , reconciling , and unifying a vision for Perl 5 may lead to improvements in development processes , scheduling , and prioritization .
I know of no better description than James Shore 's summary of Vision from The Art of Agile Development :
Every project needs a single vision ....
Distance between visionaries and the product manager increases error and waste .
Some projects have multiple visionaries .
They need to combine their ideas into a unified vision .
A vision for your project helps you identify success .
It expresses what you believe to be important .
It allows you to measure your completion of your success conditions .
Vision defines what you 're building , why you 're building it , and when you 've finished .
I 've worked on several projects without vision .
They 've all failed to produce anything useful .
Vision in Practice
Vision affects every technical and philosophical decision made about the project .
Which features are important ?
Which features can wait ?
Does one group of users deserve prioritization over another ?
Are there long term implications of decisions ?
What kind of organization works best ?
Community - driven software projects with strong leadership often have strong visions .
For example , David Wheeler 's PostgreSQL Development : Lessons for Perl ?
expresses one element of the PostgreSQL core team 's vision :
[ The ] PostgreSQL project can be explicit about what versions of PostgreSQL it maintains ( in terms of regular releases with bug fixes and security patches ) and can quickly deliver new releases of those versions .
Because so little changes in maintenance branches other than demonstrable bug fixes , there is little concern over breaking people 's installations .
PostgreSQL makes a priority of keeping old installations running .
This leads to development practices :
[ Every ] time a major new version of PostgreSQL ships , a maintenance branch is forked for it ; and thereafter only bug fixes and security issues are committed to it .
Nothing else .
I write this not to contrast with any other project 's vision or development practices ; I write this only to demonstrate a strong connection between a well - defined vision and well - enforced development practices .
Vision for Perl 5
David also suggested that a discussion of motivations and goals may help the Perl 5 community converge on a shared vision .
Here 's my vision for Perl 5 .
I would like Perl 5 to :
Increase in usability and consistency , especially with regard to metaprogramming
Change its default behavior to improve learnability for novices and to encourage writing maintainable , elegant code
Become easier to modify and extend
Allow further optimizations available in other dynamic languages ( JIT , better garbage collection , automatic parallelization , serializable bytecode )
Absorb widely - used and well - designed features tested from the CPAN , perl5i , and corehackers
You could summarize this into a simple phrase : " I want Perl 5 to become a better language for new development . "
Now the fun begins : what 's your vision for Perl 5 development ?
Feel free to post a comment here .
( Be aware that I will unapprove any comment criticizing another vision ; visions are positive statements of what you personally value .
Express what you value instead . )
Astronomers said Wednesday that a race halfway across the universe had ended in a virtual tie .
And so the champion is still Albert Einstein  for now .
The race was between gamma rays of differing energies and wavelengths spit in a burst from an exploding star when the universe was half its present age .
After a journey of 7.3 billion light - years , they all arrived within nine - tenths of a second of one another in a detector on NASA ’s Fermi Gamma - Ray Space Telescope , at 8:22 p.m. , Eastern time , on May 9 .
Astronomers said the gamma-ray race was one of the most stringent tests yet of a bedrock principle of modern physics : Einstein ’s proclamation in his 1905 theory of relativity that the speed of light is constant and independent of its color , or energy ; its direction ; or how you yourself are moving .
“ I take it as a confirmation that Einstein is still right , ” Peter F. Michelson of Stanford , principal investigator for Fermi ’s Large Area Telescope and one of 206 authors of a paper published online Wednesday in the journal Nature , said in an interview .

Washington D. C. - Due to a rash of exploding iPhones , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) has banned airline passengers from bringing the phones on board the airplane .
Passengers will still be able to place iPhones in checked luggage .
Acting Administrator of the TSA Gale Rossides said , " The explosive nature of the iPhone has forced us to classify it as an explosive , " said Rossides .
" Also we have received intelligence reports of terrorists using the phone in IEDs in Iraq , so it wo n't be long before they try to use them to blow up a plane . "
The ban does not affect any other brand of smart phone , leaving many to think Apple is being singled out by the TSA .
A charge that Rossides denies .
" We are not banning any iPod including the iPod Touch .
This is purely based on the facts of the situation .
If Blackberries start exploding than they will be considered for the ban as well , " said Rossides .
Apple has denied they are at fault for the exploding iPhones , alleging that iPhones only explode when violating Apple 's terms of service by setting the phone next to a Windows PC for a period over 5 hours or calling Apple tech support more than 3 times .
Sara Botchman of Apple said , " People have been known to spontaneously combust , are we going to ban people from planes now too ? "

What am I supposed to do on the plane ? " said Marc Allenburg of Indianapolis .
" I guess I 'll have to go back to masturbating under the blanket . "
Travelers without iPhones were mostly pleased by the news .
" It 's kinda annoying to sit next to someone with an iPhone .
They 're enjoying a movie , or playing a game and I 'm stuck there doing the crossword puzzle in the in - flight magazine , " said Barb Morton of Leesburg , Virginia .
" You have to admit that most iPhone owners are dicks about it . "
The ban goes into effect immediately .

Silvano Tomasi , osservatore del Vaticano in sede ONU , intervenendo a Ginevra presso il consiglio dei diritti umani per rispondere alle critiche mosse dal delegato IHEU Keith Porteous Wood ( Ultimissima del 29 settembre ) , ha sostenuto che nella maggior parte dei casi i preti che si sono macchiati di violenze su minori non sono pedofili , ma piuttosto omosessuali con tendenze di “ efebofilia ” come riportano testate quali “ El Pais ” .
Tra le repliche a questa dichiarazione , da segnalare quella del presidente nazionale di Arcigay Aurelio Mancuso : “ Il Vaticano è in stato confusionale e confonde ancora una volta il reato di pedofilia , commesso da uomini adulti nei confronti di minori – bambini o bambine , ragazzi o ragazze – con i rapporti consenzienti omosessuali . [ … ]
Il vero problema della Chiesa cattolica è la repressione sessuale che crea solo gravi danni nelle persone , essendo causa di solitudine , disinformazione e patologie sessuali ” .
Electron microscopes are the most powerful type of microscope , capable of distinguishing even individual atoms .
However , these microscopes cannot be used to image living cells because the electrons destroy the samples .
Now , MIT assistant professor Mehmet Fatih Yanik and his student , William Putnam , propose a new scheme that can overcome this limitation by using a quantum mechanical measurement technique that allows electrons to sense objects remotely .
Damage would be avoided because the electrons would never actually hit the imaged objects .
Such a non-invasive electron microscope could shed light on fundamental questions about life and matter , allowing researchers to observe molecules inside a living cell without disturbing them .
Yanik and Putnam report their new approach in the October issue of Physical Review A — Rapid Communications .
If successful , such microscopes would surmount what Nobel laureate Dennis Gabor concluded in 1956 was the fundamental limitation of electron microscopy : " the destruction of the object by the exploring agent . "
Electron flow
Electron microscopes use a particle beam of electrons , instead of light , to image specimens .
Resolution of electron microscope images ranges from 0.2 to 10 nanometers — 10 to 1,000 times greater than a traditional light microscope .
Electron microscopes can also magnify samples up to two million times , while light microscopes are limited to 2,000 times .
However , biologists have been unable to unleash the high power of electron microscopes on living specimens , because of the destructive power of the electrons .
The radiation dose received by a specimen during electron microscope imaging is comparable to the irradiation from a 10 - megaton hydrogen bomb exploded about 30 meters away .
When exposed to such energetic electron beams , biological specimens experience rapid breakdown , modification of chemical bonds , or other structural damages .
Although there exist special chambers to keep biological samples in a watery environment within the high vacuum required for electron microscopes , chemical preservation or freezing , which kill cells , is still required before biological samples can be viewed with existing electron microscopes .
In the proposed quantum mechanical setup , electrons would not directly strike the object being imaged .
Instead , an electron would flow around one of two rings , arranged one above the other .
The rings would be close enough together that the electron could hop easily between them .
However , if an object ( such as a cell ) were placed between the rings , it would prevent the electron from hopping , and the electron would be trapped in one ring .
This setup would scan one " pixel " of the specimen at a time , putting them all together to create the full image .
Whenever the electron was trapped , the system would know that there was a dark pixel in that spot .
Though technical challenges would need to be overcome ( such as preventing the imaging electron from interacting with electrons of the metals in the microscope ) , Yanik believes that eventually such a microscope could achieve a few nanometers of resolution .
That level of resolution would allow scientists to view molecules such as enzymes in action inside living cells , and even single nucleic acids — the building blocks of DNA .
Yanik , the Robert J. Shillman Career Development Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering , says he expects the work will launch experimental efforts that could lead to a prototype within the next five years .
Charles Lieber , professor of chemistry at Harvard and an expert in nanoscale technology , describes Yanik 's proposal as a " highly original and exciting concept for ' noninvasive ' high - resolution imaging " using an electron microscope .
" From my perspective , it has the potential to be a breakthrough for those working with sensitive samples , such as biological imaging , " Lieber says .
" Also , in general terms I find his work intellectually exciting because it is not incremental but takes a quantum ( excuse the pun ) jump forward through creative thinking . "
PRESIDENT OBAMA is far too absent of outrage over Wall Street ’s continued abuses .
As a candidate , he railed against its “ greed and irresponsibility . ’’
He had more to say in his first month in the White House , after finding out that Wall Street firms were still paying $ 18.4 billion in bonuses despite bringing America to its financial knees and dropping to their own knees for an unprecedented $ 700 billion taxpayer bailout .
“ That is the height of irresponsibility .
It is shameful , ’’ Obama said .
Calling on Wall Street to share in the recovery out of the “ big hole ’’ of the economic crisis , Obama said , “ There will be time for them to make profits , and there will be time for them to get bonuses - now is not that time . ’’
So now is the time ?
Just a year after the bailout , the Wall Street Journal last week reported that the nation ’s top 23 banks and investment firms plan to give out a record $ 140 billion in bonuses .
The Dow may be back up over the 10,000 mark , but unemployment is still going up , too , to nearly 10 percent , more than double what it was at the beginning of this decade .
Black unemployment is 15.4 percent .
States , including Massachusetts , are still announcing massive job and funding cuts .
Workers are told to be patient , that jobs might not come back in a few months or even a few years , but they will come back .
But the toga party is already back on Wall Street .
All that Obama has done so far is send out his charges to bleat some mild humbugs on the talk shows .
Chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said , “ The American people have a right to be frustrated and angry .
. . .
Wall Street is back doing what Wall Street did .
They have a responsibility to part of the solution . ’’
Adviser David Axelrod did call the bonuses “ offensive . ’’
He said it was also offensive that ordinary Americans were not yet seeing the kind of lending that helps them .
But then he qualified everything by saying the administration has “ limited sway other than moral suasion . ’’
It is time for that moral suasion .
One possible reason the administration has not been as assertive as it should be is that in conventional Washington politics , it is biting the hand that fed them .
In the 2008 elections , JPMorganChase , Citigroup , and Bank of America gave the majority of their $ 10 million in campaign contributions to the Democrats .
Another reason is that the administration still wants banks to increase lending as well as accept consumer protections .
But these reasons are not enough when Bank of America is about to pay out $ 30 billion in bonuses , followed by JPMorganChase at $ 29.5 billion , Citigroup and Goldman Sachs at $ 22 billion each , and Morgan Stanley at $ 16.4 billion .
They are behaving as if last year never happened at all , candidly crying to the Journal that if they did n’t pay billions in bonuses , oh my , their employees would flee .
Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag told the Journal , “ The easiest way to destroy the firm would be if we did n’t pay our people .
. . .
Destroying a profitable enterprise would not be in anybody ’s interest . ’’
That sounds like professional spoiled brats , especially when there are still too many once - profitable mom-and - pop enterprises going down the tubes and too many nonprofit enterprises like public schools , police , fire , and public works construction being slashed to the bone .
He should demand that the bonuses be slashed , say by half , with the other half going to long - established charities .
Can you imagine what $ 70 billion would do for the United Way or the Boys and Girls Clubs ?
Back in January , Obama said , “ We ’re going to be having conversations as this process moves forward directly with these folks on Wall Street to underscore that they have to start acting in a more responsible fashion if we are to , together , get this economy rolling again . ’’
All that has happened thus far is that Wall Street is rolling again , a steamroller once again flattening the American people .

Reverence : Renewing a Forgotten Virtue
by Paul Woodruff .
183 pages , Oxford University Press , $ 11
This little book wins people over because of its simplicity not its rhetorical fireworks or intricate arguments .
When you think about it , distilling a simple truth out of a complex situation is either supremely difficult , or strikingly dishonest .
In this case , I believe , it ’s the former .
Reverence is “ the virtue that keeps human beings from trying to act like gods , ” says Woodruff , and we ’ve forgotten it .
That jives with what I know of people arrogantly acting as if their own needs are all - important , their opinions are fact , their science and statistics are more important than observation and , most of all , that we ’re all equal and better toe the line and not offend anyone — or else .
All of these things originate in what Woodruff describes as the irreverent outlook , where we believe that our emotions , socially - defined conclusions , social status and shared memes somehow trump ultimate reality itself .
In short , we ’ve made ourselves gods and replaced paying attention to reality with solipsistically paying attention to ourselves .
Nietzsche pointed out how humanism leads to solipsism that denies all that ’s good in life so we can avoid conflict , and get along like good equal social animals , nevermind that we ’ve traded the future for temporarily stability today :
Once upon a time , in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems , there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing .
That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of “ world history , ” but nevertheless , it was only a minute .
After nature had drawn a few breaths , the star cooled and congealed , and the clever beasts had to die .
One might invent such a fable , and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable , how shadowy and transient , how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature .
There were eternities during which it did not exist .
And when it is all over with the human intellect , nothing will have happened .
For this intellect has no additional mission which would lead it beyond human life .
Rather , it is human , and only its possessor and begetter takes it so solemnly — as though the world ’s axis turned within it .
But if we could communicate with a gnat , we would learn that he likewise flies through the air with the same solemnity , that he feels the flying center of the universe within himself .
There is nothing so reprehensible and unimportant in nature that it would not immediately swell up like a balloon at the slightest puff of this power of knowing .
And just as every porter wants to have an admirer , so even the proudest of men , the philosopher , supposes that he sees on all sides the eyes of the universe telescopically focused upon his action and thought .
On truth and lies in an extra-moral sense , by F.W. Nietzsche
In Woodruff ’s view , the human tendency to view human commentary on the world as inherent truth is diametrically opposed to a transcendent worldview , in which we place ourselves mentally as small parts of a big world , and pay attention to how it works and adapt ourselves to it .
Through this transcendence , he reasons , we can interpret any belief system in the correct context , and assess any fact or reason in context , giving us the ultimate simple tool for finding a realistic solution or way of life .
Even more , as he argues in plain “ psychologist speak ” with a heavy dose of literary and philosophical references , we learn to appreciate ourselves again by not taking on an insane burden of the world but by seeing it as the magnificent , complex system it is and alleviating our feelings of the necessity of moral judgment .
Reverence does n’t tell us what is right and wrong .
It is instead the ultimate meta - level thought , telling us how to think about how we think about right and wrong .
Although it will not grab headlines , this simple thought - virus is profound enough to make this book recommended reading for those in any discipline , religion , ideology or stage of life .

Carbon is usually typecast as a villain in terms of the environment but researchers at the University of Warwick have devised a novel way to miniaturise a technology that will make carbon a key material in some extremely green heating products for our homes and in air conditioning equipment for our cars .
Most domestic heating and automotive air conditioning requires a lot of energy .
Domestic space heating and hot water account for 25 % of energy consumption in the UK .
Across the EU , vehicle air conditioning uses about 5 % of the vehicle fuel consumed annually , and within the UK it is responsible for over 2 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions .
To combat global warming , new technologies to reduce these emissions are vital .
Researchers at the University of Warwick have been working on practical solutions for many years and are now developing new energy saving technologies .
In houses , the best condensing boilers are about 90 % efficient .
There are electric heat pumps on the market that use electricity to extract heat from the outside air or the ground to heat homes more efficiently , but the electricity used still incurs large CO 2 emissions at the power station .
Researchers have long been aware of a much more energy efficient way to drive heat pumps ( or air conditioners ) using adsorption technology .
This uses heat from a gas flame or engine waste heat to power a closed system containing only active carbon and refrigerant .
When the carbon is at room temperature it adsorbs the refrigerant and when heated the refrigerant is driven out .
A process which alternately heats and cools the carbon can be used to extract heat from the outside air and put it into radiators or hot water tanks .
In the case of air conditioning it extracts the heat from the inside of the car .
The major snag has been that adsorption technology to date would need to be roughly 300 litres in volume for a car air conditioner and larger for a heat pump to heat your house .
Clearly that is not going to fit into a car and the volume of unit required for domestic heating probably could n't fit under your stairs at home either …
However University of Warwick researchers have made a breakthrough in adsorption systems design that dramatically shrinks these devices making them small and light enough for use in both domestic heating and automotive air conditioning .
They have devised and filed a patent on a clever new arrangement that distributes thin ( typically 0.7 mm thick ) sheets of metal throughout the active carbon in the heat exchanger .
Each of these sheets contains more than a hundred tiny water channels ( typically 0.3 mm in diameter ) designed to make the heat transfer much more efficient .
This has enabled the Warwick team to create adsorption based equipment that is up to 20 times smaller than was previously possible .
The researchers expect that their new adsorption technology can create domestic heat pumps that will produce a 30 % or more reduction in domestic fuel bills ( and CO 2 emissions ) compared to even the best condensing boiler .
In car air conditioning systems their new system can exploit waste heat from the engine , converting it into useful cooling .
Because no ( or very little ) mechanical power is then taken from the engine it will reduce both fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions by nearly 5 % .
The research team also anticipate that in new vehicle models the system can be integrated with little or no extra cost .
The University of Warwick engineers have had significant interest in the new technology from a range of companies , and they have already entered a technical partnership with a major global vehicle manufacturer to develop and demonstrate the technology .
There has also been considerable interest from the domestic heating and hot water market
This significant commercial interest has led to a new spin - out company , Sorption Energy Ltd , being set up by Warwick Ventures , the university 's technology transfer office , and H2O Venture Partners .
Initially the company will use the new patent pending technology to focus on two high value markets : greener heating and hot water systems for houses and air conditioning for cars .
Lead researcher on the new technology , University of Warwick 's Professor Bob Critoph said :
" My team has been working on these developments for several years , supported by grants from EPSRC and the EU totalling over £ 2.5 million .
The technology is now ready for commercialisation and we are very excited by the opportunities which are developing .
It is particularly pleasing that the technology will significantly help reduce CO 2 emissions . "
Dr David Auty , Chief Executive of Sorption Energy said : " This is exciting stuff .
The technology has been proven in the University 's laboratories at the sizes needed for vehicles and domestic systems , and there are several other large markets .
The ability to provide products which make significant reductions in both energy consumption and CO 2 emissions at a similar price to existing products will make Sorption Energy very attractive to customers , and is very satisfying for the team . "
" The UK is the global market leader in gas boilers .
There are 21 million gas boilers in the UK with 1.7 million installed each year , mainly replacements , and around 11 million units sold annually worldwide .
For domestic housing the retrofit market is the primary interest : 80 % of the housing for 2050 has already been built .
This presents both a massive opportunity both for emission reduction and for UK industry . "

United Airlines learned its lesson the hard way that David Carroll was not just another customer .
After baggage handlers at United broke his guitar last summer and the airline refused to pay for the $ 1,200 repair , Mr. Carroll , a Canadian singer , created a music video titled “ United Breaks Guitars ” that has been viewed more than 5.8 million times .
United executives met with him and promised to do better .
So how was Mr. Carroll ’s most recent flight on United ?
This Everyman symbol of the aggrieved traveler was treated , well , like just another customer .
United lost his bag .
In an interview , Mr. Carroll said that for more than an hour on Sunday , he was told he could not leave the international baggage claim area at Denver International Airport , where he had flown from Saskatchewan .
He said he had been told to stay because his bag was delayed , not lost , and he had to be there to claim it when it came down the conveyor belt .
“ I ’m the only person pacing around this room , ” Mr. Carroll said , recalling how he was caught between an order from United staff members to stay and collect his bag , and a federal customs official telling him he had to leave the baggage claim area .
The bag never showed .
After an eventful eight years in Washington , the BBC's North America editor Justin Webb has mixed feelings about his imminent return to the UK .
If you do not like your life and you have drive and luck , you can change it because - being American - you believe you can change it
" You can check out any time you like , but you can never leave " America was not designed to be left .
The opposite in fact - it was designed to be arrived in .
It was programmed to receive and - as was the case in the Eagles ' song Hotel California - there is some wonderment at the front desk when you try to go .
For effect , I sometimes exaggerate our sadness at the end of our time in America , result : confusion .
" Our British home is in south London so we 'll probably all be murdered before Christmas . "
" Oh , my gosh , um , why not stay ? "
Because you have no sense of humour , would be one answer .
But it is not why we are leaving .
In more than seven years of life in America , I have come to value - to love , actually - the stolid , sunny , unchallenging , simple virtuousness of the American suburban psyche .
The woman who is to sell our house is a prime specimen .
She is perky .
Nothing gets her down , not even the fact that we are selling in the midst of the biggest depression since the Great Flood .
In this area it is different .
" You have a lovely home ! "
But she thinks we have too many books .
She does not say so but she talks of creating spaces on the shelves - for snow - globes , perhaps , or silver photo frames with perfect children showing off perfect teeth .
This is a cultural thing .
When selling a home in America , you have to pretend that you do not live there .
No , you have to pretend that no - one lives there .
Or ever has .
Previously owned homes are of course the norm for us Europeans .
We understand that previous generations have made their mark .
This means - as we English know , having grown up with rattling windows and mouldy grouting - that a home will be imperfect .
They do not make such allowances in America .
Illusion of safety
So the inspector 's report , the survey , is the cause of much deliberation and soul - searching with our potential buyers .
An outside light is not working properly .
A tap is leaking .
A chimney needs investigation .
I feel crazy going back to the old world
As I read it , my mind turns to our house in London which is actually falling down - somebody omitted to prop up the middle when an arch was cut in a downstairs room 100 years ago - but which is still eminently saleable .
The English understand that we are all falling down .
Dust to dust , we intuit .
Americans do not .
They have not got there yet .
Truth be told , I would rather be them than us .
I admire the concern over the chimney and the belief that the problem can be fixed .
I sit on the porch , in the growing evening heat of the Washington spring , the cicadas chirruping and the sound of lawns being mowed , and yearn to be staying .
It would be so easy , so uncomplicated , so safe .
And yet of course - like the perfect home we tried to create - this safety is an illusion .
Route 17 From Washington let me take you south 600 miles ( 965 km ) or so to the state of South Carolina .
Charleston 's many churches have earned it the nickname " the Holy City "
In the steamy heat of the night , cicadas deafening in these parts , breeze all but non-existent , I drove Route 17 south , out of Charleston and down into the low country , the salt marshes .
Charleston is one of America 's most elegant cities , but Route 17 is not on any tourist maps , at least not as an attraction in its own right .
In a sense though , it should be .
It gives a wonderful insight into hardscrabble American life , the sleazy glamour of the road that repels and appeals to visitors - and indeed Americans themselves - in roughly equal measure : gas stations , tattoo parlours , Bojangles Pizza , $ 59 ( £ 35 ) - a- night motels , pawn shops , gun shops , car showrooms , nail bars , and Piggly Wiggly , the local supermarket chain which , in my limited experience , smells almost as odd as it sounds .
It is a panorama of the mundane : Doric columns a - plenty but all of them made of cheap concrete and attached to restaurants or two - bit accountants ' offices .
On and on it goes , encroaching into the palm forests with no hint of apology .
' Bible - laced hypocrisy '
As it happens , I am due to visit one of those forests and the following morning I find myself standing next to a black , four - wheel - drive vehicle and another quintessentially American phenomenon .
A politician mired in Bible - laced hypocrisy .
Mr Sanford was a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential elections
At the time I met Mark Sanford , the governor of South Carolina , just a few months ago , I did n't know about the hypocrisy .
But I should have guessed when he offered to let me in to a secret .
He was a closet tiller of fields , he said , and liked nothing better than to get out with his boys and work the land .
A little too wholesome to be true .
Weeks after telling me that all - American story , it transpired that he was also ploughing furrows in foreign fields .
The man disappeared only to turn up in Buenos Aires with an Argentine woman who was not Mrs Sanford .
This from a man who , when he was a congressman , lived in some peculiar Christian fellowship house in DC .
It did not stop his Doric columns from being false .
Zest for life
And yet for all the ugliness , the deadening tawdriness of much of the American landscape and the tinny feebleness of many of its politicians - for all that nastiness and shallowness and flakiness - there is no question in my mind that to live here has been the greatest privilege of my life .
The immensity of America , the energy and the zest for life remind me sometimes of India .
And as with India , where I spent some time for the BBC many moons ago , America shines a light on the entire human condition .
Few other nations really do .
Italy reveals truths about Italians , Afghanistan about Afghans , Fiji about Fijians .
But America speaks to the whole of humanity because the whole of humanity is represented here ; our possibilities and our propensities .
Often what is revealed is unpleasing ; truths that are not attractive or wholesome or hopeful .
On the last day we spent in our home in north - east Washington , they were holding a food - eating competition in a burger bar at the end of our street .
The sight was nauseating : acne - ridden youths , several already obese , stuffing meat and buns into their mouths while local television reporters , the women in dinky pastel suits , rushed around getting the best shots .
America can be seen as little more than an eating competition , a giant , gaudy , manic effort to stuff grease and gunge into already sated innards .
You could argue that the sub - prime mortgage crisis - the Ground Zero of the world recession - was caused mainly by greed : a lack of proportion , a lack of proper respect for the natural way of things that persuaded companies to stuff mortgages into the mouths of folks whose credit rating was always likely to induce an eventual spray of vomit .
There is an intellectual ugliness as well : a dark age lurking , even when the president has been to Harvard .
The darkness epitomised by the recent death in Wisconsin of a little girl who should still be alive .
Stone - Age superstitions Eleven - year - old Kara Neumann was suffering from type one diabetes , an auto - immune condition my son was recently diagnosed with .
Her family , for religious reasons , decided not to take her to hospital .
They prayed by her bedside and the little girl died .
The night before she died - and she would have been in intense discomfort - her parents called the founder of a religious website and prayed with him on the telephone .
But they did not call a doctor .
If Kara had been taken to hospital , even at that late stage , insulin could have saved her .
She could have been home in a few days and chirpy by the end of the week , as my son was .
It was an entirely preventable death caused , let 's be frank , by some of the Stone Age superstition that stalks the richest and most technologically advanced nation on earth .
I deplore the superstition and the eating competitions and the tatty dreariness of so much of America , and I note that the new president is also unimpressed by the infrastructure and not a fan of fat but , after more than seven years living here , I am increasingly convinced that these elements of the nation are not the flip side of the greatness of America , they are part of that greatness .
There is something about the carelessness of America that gives space for greatness .
Making it big
Out on route 17 in South Carolina , you can do very well or very badly .
You can crash and burn , or you can fill up with cheap petrol and ride off into the sunset .
If you do not like yourself in South Carolina , you can hire a self - drive hire truck and take it to Seattle .
If you do not like your life and you have drive and luck , you can change it because - being American - you believe you can change it .
Ms Sotomayor grew up on a public housing estate in the Bronx Sitting in a dingy apartment in New York watching Perry Mason on the TV , you can decide to make it big in law as eight - year - old Sonia Sotomayor once did .
This summer , now in her fifties , she becomes a Supreme Court justice and the latest American story to send shivers down the spines of dreamers of the American dream .
But if Sonia Sotomayor is to make it big , there must be something creating the drive , and part of that something is the poverty of the alternative , the discomfort of the ordinary lives that most Americans endure and the freedom that Americans have to go to hell if that is the decision they take .
This is the atmosphere in which Nobel Prize winners are nurtured .
A nation which will one day mass produce a cure for type one diabetes , could not , would not , save little Kara Neumann from the bovine idiocy of her religious parents .
More than 300 million people live here now , settlers from all over the world .
From Ho Chi Minh City , from Timbuktu , from Vilnius , from Tehran , from every last corner of the earth , they have made America their home and they are still streaming in .
I feel crazy going back to the old world .
My five - year - old daughter Clara , who is the proud owner of an American passport , agrees .
She says she intends to leave home , at around 12 - years - old , and return to her native land .
I do not blame her .
If you are willing to chance your arm , if you back yourself , if you want to live the life , America is still the place to be .
Drive out on Route 17 and take a chance !
So that 's it from me , I am checking out .
But part of me can never leave

A pre-Colombian sculpture at the National Museum of Death illustrates the close relationship between life and death in the ancient religions of Mexico .
Enlarge By Sergio Solache , USA TODAY
The National Museum of Death 's collection includes a figure of the " Virgin of Good Death , " venerated in a few Roman Catholic churches .
Museum looks death in the eyes AGUASCALIENTES , Mexico  Dead men may tell no tales , but death itself — well , in Mexico , the subject fills an entire museum .
The National Museum of Death , founded two years ago , explores the country 's macabre interest in death and dying , from the mass human sacrifices of the Aztecs to modern - day Day of the Dead celebrations , which begin Sunday .
In its galleries , human skulls encrusted with turquoise grimace at visitors .
Tiny skeletons gather around miniature banquet tables , toasting their own demise .
The Grim Reaper glares across a room at a case full of bloody crucifixes .
" Mexicans have death imprinted all over their art and culture , " museum director Jose Antonio Padilla said .
" So why not a museum about it ? "
The museum came about because a Mexican art collector had a lot of skeletons in his closet : dozens of tiny calaveritas , or skeleton dioramas , along with hundreds of other death - related artworks he had acquired over 50 years .

The owner , Octavio Bajonero Gil , was looking for a museum to take his collection .
Meanwhile , the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes , a state college , was looking to found an art museum and wanted something different , Padilla said .
The museum , with Bajonero 's donation as its core collection , opened in 2007 in two buildings owned by the university in downtown Aguascalientes .
Admission is 20 pesos , about $ 1.53 .
Reaction to the museum among Mexicans has been mixed , Padilla said , partly because the country is grappling with a wave of murders following President Felipe Calderón 's military crackdown on drug cartels .
" People from ( border cities in ) the north say , ' Why do you want to celebrate something that I 'm trying to avoid every day ? ' " Padilla said .
" But this is not a museum of drug violence .
It 's a museum about a certain artistic tradition . "
About one - third of the museum 's 70,000 annual visitors are from other countries , mainly the United States .
" It 's definitely kind of bizarre , " said Spencer Garcia - Stinson , 24 , of Gilford , N.H. " In the United States , we do n't like to talk about death , but here they 're dealing with it so openly .
...
It 's amazing . "
Season of celebration
This is peak season for the museum because of the Nov. 1 - 2 Day of the Dead celebrations , when Mexicans honor their ancestors and recently deceased relatives .
The fascination with death has its roots in pre-Hispanic religions , Padilla said .
Mayans , Aztecs and other cultures regarded death as an important step between life and reincarnation .
The souls of one 's ancestors were constant , invisible companions .
In one gallery , pre-Columbian sculptures show people cavorting with skeletons representing the souls of the dead .
Others depict human sacrifices or the god Xolotl , who guides souls to the Aztec underworld .
One display shows clay sculptures of the hairless Mexican dogs known as xoloitzcuintles .
Tribes on Mexico's Pacific coast buried these dogs with their dead to help guide them through the afterlife .
In another case , colored lights shine through a 2 - inch - high skull carved from quartz crystal .
Only three like it have been found in Mexico , Padilla said .
Other rooms include Roman Catholic images of death , such as crucifixes and a rare statue of the Virgin of Good Death , which is revered in some Spanish churches but is little - known in Mexico .
The collection also includes statues of " Saint Death , " the grim reaper , which is increasingly worshiped at shrines and chapels in poor neighborhoods of Mexico .
Some museumgoers have tried to leave offerings for the grim reaper statues , said Juan Manuel Vizcaino , assistant director of exhibits .
" We get some unusual people here , " Vizcaino said .
" Sometimes we have to remind them that it's a museum , not a place of worship . "
Many of the cases hold calaveritas , the tiny clay skeletons thatare used , along with candy skulls and marigold flowers , in the altars that Mexicans build for their ancestors ahead of Day of the Dead events .
On the night of Nov. 1 - 2 , many families hold all - night vigils at their relatives ' graves .
Some towns hold ceremonies with dances , music and displays of flowers .
Death from abroad
The museum also includes depictions of death from other countries , from American Halloween decorations to small replicas of the terra cotta soldiers of China .
Twentieth - century art is housed in a modern annex with blood - red windows .
It includes posters from horror movies and calaveras , skeleton cartoons that are published in Mexican newspapers around Day of the Dead and are usually accompanied by satirical poems .
In one calavera from 1964 , skeletons representing U.S. presidential candidates Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater are shown dropping bombs on the Congo , Cuba and Vietnam .
The museum also hosts special exhibits , such as Death in Black Pottery , as well as seminars , art workshops and plays with titles such as The Fandango of the Dead and Blame Your Dead on Me.
Before visitors leave , they can visit the museum 's coffee shop —
The Café of Death — and a gift shop offering T - shirts and calaveritas .
Death 's door opens at 10 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m.

Pa'u Skirts - Hula Skirts Print This Page
Add To Favorites Pa'u Skirts What You Should Know About Pa'u Skirts .
There is something unique about pa'u skirts .
Actually , they are correctly and famously referred to as " Pa'u Hula Skirts " .
Pa'u is Hawaii language for skirt .
Hula is a traditional Hawaiian dance performed by women .
The term " Pa'u Hula " is therefore loosely translated to " dance skirt " .
The Hawaiian dance skirt is made of two panels of fabric measuring anywhere from four yards to twelve yards .
The quality of skirts range from cheap to expensive .
The cheapest skirts are produced mechanically in a clothing factory .
The quality of mechanically produced skirts is low to average .
On the other hand , high quality skirts are handmade and expensive .
They are made of authentic material with intricate designs .
High quality Hawaiian print fabric is used to make the skirts .
The material consists of 50 % polyester and 50 % cotton .
The waist is made of elastic to make the skirt comfortable for dancing .
Three or more rows of elastic are used to make the waist bend and you can choose between adjustable elastic and unadjustable elastic .
The average length of the skirt is about 29 inches , with the hem of the skirt almost touching the calf .
You will find the skirt at most shops in the USA and Hawaii .
International shops in Japan , Malaysia , China , South Korea , Phillipines and Singapore also sell the Pa'u skirt .
If you are a tourist , you can find this skirt at one of the tourist shops .
The price of the skirt ranges from $ 40 to $ 60 .
The price depends on the quality of the skirt , that is the material used , and the method of manufacture .
The skirts come in many colours such as red , pink , blue , purple , navy and white .
The skirt is especially made for the Hula dancer .
It is the classic skirt of the Hawaiian tradition derived from the ancient hula style .
There are many variations of the skirt .
The most common skirts are made of bright coloured polyester and cotton .
However , you can find skirts made of prints .
Factory prints include the calico print and other types of prints .
A designer may make handmade prints on the borderline of the skirt , usually at the hem .
Designers can make hundreds of themes for Pa'u Hula skirts .
Many styles for waistbands are also available .
The waist can be made of five rows , four rows , three rows or even one row .
Instead of using elastic for the waist , some stylists prefer cords .
A single row waist consists of a casing for inserting a cord which runs around the waistband and that can be tied at the front or side .
Designers can also make several rows of casings with two or more lines of cords .
If you are shopping , you must know the styles , so that you can decide which one is suitable .
Elastic waists can have more than five rows .
It all depends on the designer .
You cannot talk about the Pa'u skirt without knowing the Hula dance and its origins .
Hula dancers not only wear the Pa'u skirt , but they also dorn themselves with exotic necklaces , anklets , bracelets and headpieces .
The original dance involved beautiful women dancing topless .
The Hula dance was invented by native Polynesians who inhabited the island in the earliest times .
The dance involves people chanting and the dancers responding to the chant .
The hula dance practiced by the original settlers is known as " kahiko " .
When European settlers arrived in Hawaii in the 19th century , the dance was modified .
Modern hula after the arrival of European settlers is called " auana " .
Many things have been integrated in the modern hula .
The modern dance is not only accompanied by a chant , but it includes guitars , double basses and other instruments .

VALPARAISO , Chile —
A court forensics expert said Wednesday that former Chilean President Eduardo Frei Montalva was assassinated in January 1982 after a simple hernia operation during the rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet .
The statement by Carmen Cerda , the chief of the forensics team investigating the case , confirmed longtime suspicions that Frei Montalva , who was Chile ’s elected president from 1964 to 1970 , had died of foul play at age 71 .
Medical officials had said that infection related to the surgery was the cause of death .
Cerda , however , said that a combination of toxins , including mustard gas , gradually administered to the former president ultimately killed him .
If confirmed , Frei Montalva would be the only Chilean president to be assassinated .
Judge Alejandro Madrid , whom Chile ’s Supreme Court appointed to investigate Frei Montalva ’s death , said he had n’t issued a final ruling in the case and called any conclusions “ premature . ”
Frei Montalva ’s son , Eduardo Frei Ruiz - Tagle , who was Chile ’s president from 1994 to 2000 , said he was certain that his father had been killed , and he demanded that the crime ’s “ intellectual authors ” be found .
“ Here , there were organisms like the Chilean army that dedicated themselves to producing chemicals , protochemicals and gases to eliminate people , ” Frei Ruiz - Tagle said Wednesday in the country ’s legislature , where he is a senator .
“ Unfortunately , they were also used on President Frei . ”
Frei Ruiz - Tagle said he hoped Wednesday ’s bombshell disclosure would “ accelerate ” the ongoing investigation into his father ’s death , which started eight years ago .
Separate investigations have showed that the Pinochet regime ordered the assassinations of top officials of previous governments such as former army chief Gen. Carlos Prats , who died in a 1974 car bomb attack in Buenos Aires , Argentina , and former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier , who was killed in a similar 1976 car bomb attack in Washington .
Manuel Contreras , who headed Pinochet ’s intelligence services , was given double life prison sentences last week for masterminding the Prats assassination .
The forensics expert did not say who killed Frei Montalva , but leaders of the ex-president ’s Christian Democrat party accused the Pinochet regime .
The killing “ reflects the disdain of a dictatorship for the life of a person , including that of an ex-president , ” said Sen. Soledad Alvear , president of the Christian Democrats .
“ We hope that we arrive at the truth until the very end , as much as to the material authors as the intellectual ones . ”

COLUMBIA , Md .
NANCY FINK is a career coach for Maryland ’s department of labor , running seminars for the most skilled unemployed workers .
For 17 years , she has counseled professionals , business managers , engineers , accountants , scientists  people who are mature , middle - aged , highly motivated , well - educated , well - spoken .
But in all that time , she ’s never seen so many of the jobless with such impressive skills as this last year .
“ Last week I had seven lawyers in this room , ” she said .
“ I ’ve had lots of folks from TV and The Baltimore Sun .
This week I ’ve got five human resources directors 
I ’ve never had that . ”
The number of professionals and managers in unemployment programs at this suburban work - force center halfway between Baltimore and Washington is the highest it has been since the state first made this group a target for outplacement support in 1992 .
They ask questions young workers do n’t .
David Kozlowski , 52 , a systems vice president laid off in June , wanted to know how far back to go when an interviewer inquires about his work experience in information technology .
“ I ’ve had 30 years in I.T. , ” he said .
Many of the 53 people at a recent two - day seminar had themselves hired employees before being fired .
When Ms. Fink quizzed them on the first question interviewers ask , Jim Chrzanowski , 45 , a systems engineer who once oversaw 83 workers , knew immediately .
“ ‘ Tell me about yourself ’  it was the first question I always asked , ” he said .
Yesterday Ken Lewis announced he was stepping down as Bank of America 's CEO .
Let me be the first to say , " good riddance . "
As a San Francisco native the Bank of America has been in my life and my family 's life for a century .
My Italian immigrant grandparent 's grub stake in the American Dream came in the form of a loan from the bank , then named The Bank of Italy .
It 's founder , who Ken Lewis is not worthy to even mention , was Amadeo Giannini .
Giannini started the bank in 1904 when he noted that existing banks were something less than thrilled with the idea of lending money to what they considered little more than a bunch of southern European peasants .
My grand father used those small loans to build two brick and stucco duplexes on what was then the outskirts of San Francisco , and to start his bricklaying business .
I only mention this because Giannini and Ken Lewis did have one thing in common - they were each at the helm when financial disaster struck .
For Giannini it was the crash of 1929 and the depression years that resulted .
For Ken Lewis it was ... whatever the hell you call this thing we 're in now ... another Great Depression or , as the guys who caused it prefer , " the Great Recession . "
But that 's where the similarities end .
Because the way the two men , and the institution they headed , handled the crisis could not have been more different .
My father , eleven - years old in 1929 , recalled the hard times that followed well .
" When my father and others in our mostly Italian neighborhood started to have trouble keeping up with their mortgages and business loans , Giannini sent them a letter , " my father told .
" In it he said he understood that it was n't the borrower 's fault and that the bank wanted to keep them as customers and help them get through the hard times , but that both sides had to pitch in . "
Giannini 's proposal was simple , fair and balanced ;
" Forget making principal payments on your loan , " he told my father and others in the same boat .
" If you can manage a few dollars every month towards principal , great , he told borrowers .
But if you can't , then just make the interest payments until you 're back on your feet . "
My father said Giannini 's wise strategy not only saved his family 's home and his father 's business , but those of scores of other families in their neighborhood .
It also saved Giannini and his young bank the burden of repossessing properties that , due to the depressed conditions , could have only been an enormous loss to the bank .
Compare that with how the renamed Bank of Italy , now Bank of America - but really owned by Nation 's Bank of Charlotte - handled the mortgage meltdown .
Just to say that Ken Lewis et al , handled the current mess exactly opposite of how Giannini handled his crisis , would be a gross understatement .
Lewis & Co. not only went the opposite direction , but did so with the kind of gusto and enthusiasm normally reserved for the manically insane .
Here 's just a personal snapshot of what I speak .
Over the past six months I 've been trying to help a young couple with their BofA problem .
They took BofA up on an offer about four years ago , a first time homebuyer 's loan .
They both had perfect credit ratings and both were employed .
They got 100 % financing from BofA .
Then the market crashed and a few months ago their house was appraised .
They now owed $ 100,000 more than what they paid and what they owed the bank .
Since they had zero equity I suggested they contact the bank and see if they could cut a deal to adjust the loan .
They contacted the bank the same week BofA pocketed about $ 50 billion in taxpayer bailout dough .
The bank treated these kids like deadbeats and told them to get lost .
I suggested they contact the bank and put it this way to them :
" I think you misunderstood our earlier letter .
You thought we had a problem .
No. YOU have a problem and we 're trying to help you out while getting some relief ourselves .
Because if we walk away from this property YOU are going to have to take the whole $ 100,000 loss .
So , let 's talk . "
Long story short - they were n't interested in talking .
" Keep paying on the underwater loan or we will foreclose on the property , " was their only response .
( It reminded me of my favorite scene in a movie - Blazing Saddles , where the new black sheriff is surrounded by angry white townies , draws his gun and points it at his head a warns the advancing crowd , " One more move and the n .......r gets it ! " )
So those young ( former ) homeowners are walking away from that house this weekend .
Over the last two weeks they tried again to save the BofA time and money , offering to simply sign a deed in lieu of foreclosure .
The bank refused .
Then they tried to find someone at the bank willing to take the keys and secure the property so it does not join the hundreds of other vandalized abandoned homes already on the local market .
Nope .
The bank was n't interested in securing the home either .
So the kids will simply leave , and the bank will .... well , who the hell knows what the bank will do .
And at this point , who the hell cares ?
The bank lost on so many fronts in just that one case ; they lost the hope reducing their loan loss , they lost the chance to keep a modified but performing loan on it's books , it lost the chance to avoid the expense and time of a lengthy foreclosure process and they lost the chance to secure what will soon become an asset on it's already troubled books .
Oh , and they lost two future customers who are just beginning their earning lives .
The kids closed all their BofA accounts and went with a local credit union .
Amadeo Giannini is doing cartwheels in his marble sarcophagus .
And you and I , being the taxpayers we are , can only sigh and wonder why Ken Lewis - and his kind - are being bailed rather than jailed .

Leaders of three of the most powerful states in Europe have strongly criticised David Cameron at the EU summit over a Conservative attempt to scupper the Lisbon treaty .
Nicolas Sarkozy , Angela Merkel and José Luiz Rodríguez Zapatero are understood to have privately criticised the Tory leader after he sent a handwritten letter to the Czech president , Vaclav Klaus , who has been refusing to sign the treaty .
The letter was seen as an attempt to influence the Czech Republic , which is the only country not to have ratified the treaty .
Senior British sources familiar with thinking at the highest levels of the EU say the French , German and Spanish leaders all raised questions about Cameron 's letter .
It is understood that Cameron encouraged the Czech president to delay ratification of the Lisbon pact by setting out Tory policy to hold a referendum in Britain on the treaty if it had not yet been ratified by all member states .
The sources told the Guardian that :
• Sarkozy was overheard telling Gordon Brown that he was incensed by Cameron 's letter , which the French saw as an attempt to wreck the Lisbon treaty .
• Merkel was also said to be upset by the Tory leader 's letter .
The German chancellor is understood to have echoed the concerns of senior figures in her Christian Democratic Union party , such as the former president of the EU parliament Hans Gert Poettering , that Cameron 's behaviour had been untrustworthy .
• Zapatero , who addressed the Labour party 's recent conference in Brighton and will have to negotiate directly with Cameron if the Tories win the general election – because Spain holds the EU 's rotating presidency until July 2010 – made clear to diplomats that he regarded Cameron 's letter as an attempt to scupper the treaty .
The interventions by the EU leaders come as the Tories plan to abandon their two - year campaign to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty if , as expected , the Czech president finally ratifies the treaty .
Senior Tories told the Guardian that Cameron would set out his thinking in the coming weeks .
It is understood that Cameron will drop his pledge to hold a referendum on the treaty on the grounds that it is impossible to open a treaty that has entered EU law .
A Tory government would instead focus on repatriating social and employment laws , in effect restoring the British opt - out from the social chapter .
This has been sprinkled around various EU treaties since Tony Blair ended the opt - out in 1997 , meaning that its measures could only be restored to Britain with the agreement of all member states .
Brown yesterday used his appearance at the summit to launch a strong attack on the Tories ' approach to Europe .
Speaking of the Tory decision to abandon the main centre - right EPP grouping in the European parliament in favour of a smaller group consisting mainly of fringe parties from the hard right in eastern Europe , the prime minister said : " The Conservative party are standing apart from the mainstream in Europe .
They are part of a very small group of minorities – of 23 people apart from the Conservative party .
They are standing on the fringes of Europe .
That is a huge mistake for British interests . "
A Tory spokeswoman said : " We have never concealed the fact that we sent the letter … David Cameron has made no secret of its contents .
It sets out his public opinion in a private letter . "
Last night a spokesman for the Elysée palace said : " We do not comment on rumours from the corridors of the European council . "
Racism and homophobia are still alive and well in America :
A Geneva High School teacher is being accused of making anti-gay and racist comments in his classroom .
Dave Burk , who teaches consumer education , is accused of making the comments by his students during an Oct. 5 lecture on tax money involving the National Endowment for the Arts .
" How would you feel about your tax dollars going to pay some black fag in New York to take pictures of other black fags ? "
Burk allegedly asked , according to student Jordan Hunter .
Now do n't be too hard on the guy , according to his attorney he never meant to offend anyone and he 's really , really sorry :
" Mr. Burk is cooperating fully with both the principal , the dean of students and the school board , " Tegeler said .
" Mr. Burk 's biggest problem is he does not want to intentionally offend anybody and if he did , he apologizes . "
Read on ...
The man who reported Burk to the school administration is calling for his firing , and rightfully so .
The best lesson the children in his class could learn would be that racism and bigotry are unacceptable and that there are consequences for our actions .
If you would like to contact the school and give your thoughts on Burk 's comments , here is their contact information .
As always , please be nice .

BBC News , Mumbai
Troops battled for three days to regain control of Mumbai in November 2008
The bodies of nine gunmen killed during attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai a year ago are still awaiting burial .
The unclaimed bodies are lying in a local government hospital and Mumbai police say they have still to take a decision about their future .
Muslim clerics had denied permission to bury the bodies in Mumbai graveyards , saying the actions of the gunmen had " defamed " their religion .
Ten men attacked Mumbai on 26 November 2008 , killing more than 170 people .
Only one gunman , Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab , survived and he is currently facing trial .
' Un - Islamic '
The bodies are being kept in the morgue of Sir JJ Hospital .
Officials say the area is secluded and guarded around the clock .
The seal is checked every day .
TEN NAMED GUNMEN Nasir , alias Abu Umar ( Nariman House ) Abu Ali ( Taj Palace ) Soheb ( Taj Palace ) Fahad Ullah ( Oberoi ) Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab ( survived ) Bada Abdul Rehaman ( above left , Taj Palace ) Abdul Rehaman Chota ( above right , Oberoi ) Ismal Khan ( CST station ) Babar Imaran ( Nariman House ) Nazir , alias Abu Omer ( Taj Palace )
The question of what should be done with the dead militants arose soon after the attacks .
Pakistan flatly refused to take them despite India 's argument that they should go back to the country from which they originated .
After post - mortem examinations the bodies were taken to the hospital morgue as Indian Muslims said they would not allow the bodies to be buried in their cemeteries .
Ibrahim Tai , president of the Muslim Council Trust , says he opposes such burials as the gunmen 's actions were un -Islamic .
He says if the bodies have to be buried , it should be at " an unknown location " .
" We know Indian authorities are stuck as the bodies have not been claimed by Pakistan .
These nine people should not be identified by anyone .
If they are buried without leaving any trace , then it is fine with us .
" We believe that their actions should not be praised or recognised by anyone .
If they set up tombs then tourists will visit and people will talk about it .
We do n't want that to happen , " he said .
Local Muslim cleric Maulana Mustaqil Azmi said it was important that the bodies were disposed of soon and that the matter was closed .
" We do not want them to be buried on any of our burial grounds but they can be disposed of anywhere else in India .
Good Muslims are laid to rest in our burial grounds .
We do not believe that these nine men are true followers of Islam . "
Police say the bodies have been embalmed and are well preserved but a decision on burial has yet to be taken given the religious sensitivity .

English : Chartered Accountants Tax Conference
Bill English
17 October , 2009
Speech to New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Tax Conference
Good afternoon and thank you .
It is a pleasure to be here .
It 's great to have the opportunity to explain the Government 's economic plan and lay out some of the challenges we face - along with the role tax policy will play .
The Government has a very clear plan to increase our productivity , grow our exports and start narrowing the income gap with our trading partners .
We 're focused on what matters : jobs and growth .
Since the election , the economy has been the Government 's top priority .
One of the main effects of the recession has been a big fall in forecast tax , putting pressure on Government spending and limiting policy options .
We are not alone .
Governments around the world are facing the same pressures .
Wrestling debt under control will be the fate of many Western countries as they emerge from the current crisis .
They will end up with smaller public services , lower pensions or increased taxes as a result .
New Zealand is better placed than many countries in determining how it responds .
We do n't want to go down the route of raising taxes .
We are committed to a tax system that contributes to economic growth , is competitive internationally and helps New Zealand families get ahead .
As we emerge from the recession it is worth pausing to reflect on whether our tax system is as simple , fair , efficient and robust as it can be .
The fiscal and economic challenge
But first , it 's important to understand the wider economic and fiscal environment in which we are considering our tax policy options .
Our current economic and fiscal challenges are more significant than we have seen for two or three generations .
The Government inherited a New Zealand economy that had gone into recession in early 2008 and was under considerable stress from imbalances built up over the past decade .
It 's now clear that our economy started to get out of balance around 2003 - and it has since got progressively worse .
Here 's what I mean :
• Bank credit and household debt started blowing out
• Non-tradeables inflation took off and remained high at around 4 per cent
• Government spending ballooned - increasing by 50 per cent in the past five years - double the rate of economic growth and government revenue
• And since 2003 , our productivity has sunk to a 25 - year low .
Let me set out two indicators of our lopsided economy :
First the tradeables sector - that 's exporters or industries competing with imports - has actually been in recession for five years , contracting by about 10 per cent in that time .
Even more staggering , there have been almost no net jobs created in the tradeables side of the economy for the past 10 years .
By contrast , the non-tradeables sector - domestic industries not competing with exports , including the Government - has grown by 15 per cent in the past five years .
The second symptom of New Zealand 's unbalanced growth is the red ink in the Government 's accounts - the result of fast - rising spending and falling revenue .
The Crown accounts for the year to June 30 , 2009 , released this week , illustrate the problems we face .
Revenue was $ 2 billion lower than in 2008 , spending jumped by $ 7 billion and the operating deficit stretched to $ 10.5 billion - an almost $ 13 billion turnaround from the $ 2.4 billion surplus 2008 .
We now face cash deficits of between $ 10 billion and $ 12 billion for each of the next four years .
On current projections , we will not be back in budget surplus for a decade .
The recession has had a significant impact on the Government 's books .
Over the four years from 2008 , our total GDP will be permanently $ 50 billion lower than if the global financial crisis had not occurred .
That means the Government will collect about $ 16 billion less tax revenue .
With expenses continuing to grow regardless , we will double government debt by 2014 - borrowing an average rate of $ 250 million every week for the next four years .
One of the consequences of issuing all of this debt is that the Government 's finance costs will increase markedly .
In recent years , these costs have sat around $ 2.5 billion a year .
Budget 2009 forecast finance costs to double to more than $ 5 billion a year by 2014 - roughly the combined amount spent on law and order and defence .
So these finance costs will compete directly with spending on more worthwhile public services .
It was entirely appropriate for the Government to increase its borrowing to cushion New Zealanders from the worst effects of the recession .
We are doing this to maintain public services , preserve entitlements and prepare the economy for sustainable productive growth .
However , additional borrowing on this scale cannot continue indefinitely and the Government has taken steps to ensure the rising tide of debt is turned back .
Let me stress here that public finance cycles are long .
Net government debt rose steadily from the early 1970s and peaked at over 50 per cent of GDP in 1992 .
It then took another 16 years of near continuous growth to get it down and almost eliminate it by 2008 .
So we can now expect it to take 20 to 30 years for the Government 's finances to recover from the impact of this recession .
The Government 's economic programme
Before I discuss our thinking about tax policy in more detail , I 'd like to set out the Government 's plan for dealing with these challenges and increasing New Zealand 's economic performance .
It 's important that tax policy is seen within this wider context .
We have identified six key drivers of our economic programme over the next three to five years :
• o The first area is reforming the regulatory environment and cutting away red tape getting in the way of business and productive investment .
Regulatory Reform Minister Rodney
Hide has been extremely busy working with the Government to get this significant two - year review programme underway .
It includes the Overseas Investment Act , the Resource Management Act , the Building Act , the Holidays Act , electricity and telecommunications rules , and the emissions trading legislation .
• o The Government 's second policy driver is significantly lifting the performance of the public sector , while reducing the rate of spending increases .
You will have heard a little about this from Revenue Minister Peter Dunne yesterday when he spoke about work being done to " Transform IR " .
The public sector represents about 30 per cent of the economy , so it 's essential that it plays its part , particularly with the Government 's finances under pressure .
We 've made it clear that we will improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of spending , while limiting the negative impacts of public policies on private enterprise .
• o The next area is investing in productive infrastructure .
The challenge here is quite simple .
It is to ensure that the right level of investment is made in the right places by organisations with the knowledge and incentives to invest .
Earlier this year , we established the National Infrastructure Unit .
One of its roles is producing the first National Infrastructure Plan by early next year - a stock take of current demands and investment programmes which will become the focal point for industry co-operation .
The impact of the Government 's programme on infrastructure investment is already evident .
We are investing $ 7.5 billion over the next five years to build and upgrade schools , roads , housing , hospitals and telecommunications .
• o The Government 's fourth policy driver is education and skills .
There are several parts to the Government 's focus in this important area .
The first is literacy and numeracy at primary schools , driven by National Standards , which will set clear expectations , measure children 's progress against those expectations and report their progress to parents in plain English .
The second area is providing options for secondary - age students outside the traditional school system .
• o The Government 's fifth policy driver is innovation and business assistance .
This covers government and business investment in research and development , in innovation , and in developing new markets and products .
Our considerable investment in this area will help firms connect with overseas markets and consumers ; as well as help them develop new ideas to create new and higher value products and services .
Those goals will help drive productivity growth and investment in the tradeables sector , and improve our export performance .
• o Finally , let me turn to taxation - the sixth focus of the Government 's economic policy agenda for the next three to five years - and no doubt the area you are keen to hear about today .
Taxation is one of our six policy drivers because of the pervasive influence it has on both the economy at large and on decisions made by individuals .
As we have said , New Zealand needs to lift its economic growth .
That 's all the more important with 60,000 people now on the unemployment benefit and with unemployment likely to continue rising well into next year .
We also need to increase household incomes so they can save , repay debt and , from the Government 's perspective , so it can get back to budget surpluses sooner .
This Government sees a simple , fair and efficient tax system that encourages New Zealand families to get ahead under their own steam as one of the key drivers of economic growth .
Ideally , the tax system should impose the minimum cost necessary to get the revenue needed for vital frontline services and to support the most vulnerable .
That means it should be simple to administer , easy to comply with and not drive behaviour and investment decisions .
It should also provide the right incentives - allowing people to keep more of their own money encourages them to invest time and effort into improving their skills so they can earn more .
This also has a productivity benefit for the economy .
In addition , the system should be fair - most forms of income should be covered and where possible loopholes that allow the sheltering of income to avoid tax should be closed .
Lastly , our tax system must be internationally competitive - New Zealand with its small population and capital markets needs to attract skilled workers and encourage people to invest here .
And if our economy is to thrive , we need to ensure our best and brightest have good reasons to stay .
It is no secret we have one of the most internationally mobile labour forces in the OECD , with huge numbers of Kiwis living overseas , the second highest proportion of expats after Ireland and strong migrant flows .
In short , we rely on high levels of inward migration and investment .
The tax system should help New Zealand attract and retain the people , businesses and investment it needs .
Until recently , the relative simplicity of the New Zealand tax system was one of its strengths .
However , it has become increasingly complicated .
Tax Working Group
Earlier this year , the Minister of Revenue and I announced the establishment of a Tax Working Group , led by Victoria University 's Centre for Accounting , Governance and Taxation Research to review our tax system .
The aim was to take a first principles look at the system and see how it could be improved - and in recent months the working group has set out some of its ideas in a series of public papers .
The working group is looking at proposals that , when taken together , are fiscally neutral .
The Government has a strong preference not to increase taxes to close the deficit .
We prefer more efficient taxes over higher taxes .
And , unlike many other countries , we have no desire to increase the tax take .
Some of the challenges the Tax Working Group is considering are :
• Whether the efficiency and integrity of the tax system could be improved through changes to the tax mix .
This will include consideration of the Government 's30/30/30 tax goal , and challenges associated with this in the current environment .
• Whether the tax base could be broadened so we are less reliant on personal and corporate tax .
• Whether changes to the tax mix could tilt the playing field away from borrowing and spending towards exports , investment and sustainable jobs .
• How we could simplify the tax system to reduce compliance costs and make it as easy as possible to administer .
I 'd like to take this opportunity to commend the Tax Working Group 's work to date .
The calibre of its experts - drawn from government , academia and the private sector - is extremely high .
So far it has tackled its brief with clarity and rigour .
The group 's work is also extremely timely .
Across the Tasman the Australians are conducting a review of their own tax system , led by the Secretary to the Treasury , Ken Henry .
Australia is our largest trading partner , the source of much of our foreign investment and a destination that lures large numbers of Kiwi workers abroad , so we are keeping a close eye on developments .
If the Henry review results in Australia moving to lower its taxes , our own review will leave us well placed to consider options that maintain our international competitiveness .
So I look forward to receiving the Tax Working Group 's report in December .
We will consider its findings in the New Year and any changes will be signalled in Budget 2010 .
The benefits must clearly outweigh any potential difficulties to warrant significant changes .
Let me be clear , equity and fairness will be key considerations , alongside benefits for the economy and for households .
The Tax Working Group 's papers on property - related taxes have generated a lot of public debate .
And so too has the idea of increasing GST to provide revenue for personal tax cuts .
The main issue here is fairness - low income earners , in particular , would have to be compensated for any increase in GST .
There are arguments for and against these ideas and I 'm happy for the working group to consider them .
As a Government , we welcome debate , but we must be practical and realistic .
As Prime Minister John Key and I have both stated previously : the Tax Working Group will have to come up with some fairly compelling reasons to convince us of the overall benefits of further property - related taxes or an increase in GST .
High marginal tax rates
The working group has raised a number of issues in its papers released so far .
One of them is our internationally high marginal tax rates .
An average wage earner with children loses over half of every extra dollar they earn , once our high top tax rates and the abatement of Working for Families tax credits are taken into account .
This puts us in the bottom half of the 30 OECD countries on this measure .
In the UK , France and Japan , the same worker would get to keep far more of every extra dollar earned .
Getting to keep less than half of what they earn is hardly an incentive for people to aspire to higher incomes .
In New Zealand the top rate of 38 c starts at just $ 70,000 - about 1.5 times the average wage .
This is much lower than the OECD average , which is about 2.4 times the average wage .
In Australia the top rate at 45 c is higher but you need to earn over A$ 180,000 to pay it , while in the US the top rate is about 40 per cent , but you need to earn about NZ$ 340,000 before you pay it .
Differential tax rates and income support like Working for Families and student allowances create big incentives for people to minimise their " taxable income " .
This is amply illustrated by the 9700 high - income families with rental properties , who last year claimed tax losses , enhancing their eligibility for Working for Families payments .
A case can also be made that a wide gap between the corporate and the top personal rates provides incentives to use the company structure to avoid the top personal rates .
A key issue here is the overall credibility of the system .
Large scale legitimate avoidance behaviour by higher income earners undermines the goodwill of lower income earners .
It 's quite telling that there has been virtually no growth in the number of people paying tax on $ 1 million of annual income since the 39 cent top personal tax rate was introduced 10 years ago .
We do n't want people spending their time and resources trying to avoid tax .
Equally we also do n't want IRD devoting all its time to chasing tax and compliance issues .
As a country , we want families , businesses , accountants and lawyers looking at how to unlock greater income and productivity , not working out how to minimise their tax .
I 'm pleased to see the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and Tax Management New Zealand proactively looking at how the tax system for small businesses could be simplified to reduce compliance costs .
They have set out two proposals :
One is for micro businesses earning under $ 60,000 a year and not registered for GST to pay a final tax of 15 per cent based on turnover .
The other proposal is for businesses with annual turnover of less than $ 1.2 million to have their income tax calculated on a cash basis , based on their GST return .
I understand that a final report will be submitted to the Government next year for our consideration , after consultation with the SME sector .
I believe these proposals have merit and they will not be dismissed out of hand .
Tax policy officials will engage with the Institute on them .
Examining the tax mix
Another area the Tax Working Group is considering is the tax mix .
As a country , New Zealand relies heavily on the taxes that are most damaging to growth - income and corporate taxes .
Nearly 60 per cent of our revenue comes from these two sources .
Here are some facts worth considering :
• In 2000 around 5 per cent of wage earners paid the top personal tax rate .
In 2009 this has climbed to 9 per cent and it is expected to reach 25 per cent in 10 years .
• We collect the third highest ratio of corporate tax to GDP in the OECD .
At the same time , distortions are created by the things we do not tax .
Most people would see it as unfair , for example , that speculators can reap large tax - free gains while low and middle income workers are taxed on every dollar they earn .
Inland Revenue has published data showing that last year the losses claimed by people with rental properties were $ 575 million more than the income declared from residential rentals .
The net reduction in Government revenue was approximately $ 150 million , while the capital value of this asset class roughly doubled .
This is a recent trend .
In 1999 rental properties generated over $ 600 million in taxable income .
Industries like farming , manufacturing and tourism , are vital to providing sustainable jobs as we come out of the recession .
However , in recent years , large increases in property values have contributed to high interest rates for these sectors .
Those higher interest rates , in turn , push up our dollar , reducing exporters ' margins and making it more expensive for businesses to borrow .
Again , this cycle harms our productive industries .
Conclusion
Can I finish by reiterating that the Government is clear about what needs to be done to turn this economy around .
We have a balanced , targeted and effective plan to achieve that .
However we need to make sure we get the kind of recovery we want - one that will create sustainable jobs and growth .
Despite our considerable economic challenges , I 'm confident about New Zealand 's prospects because of the resilience demonstrated by many New Zealanders .
We are seeing early signs of recovery , which I welcome .
By backing ourselves as a country , we have a real opportunity to emerge from the recession stronger and more competitive than other countries .
Thank you .

Seeds Across the Oceans November 23 , 2009
New York , N.Y .
How do plants get from one land mass to another ?
Here 's one plausible answer from a man who actually performed the necessary experiments :
Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds .
I could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean .
We may I think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour ; and some authors have given a far higher estimate .
I have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird ; but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey .
In the course of two months , I picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds , out of the excrement of small birds , and these seemed perfect , and some of them , which I tried , germinated .
But the following fact is more important : the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice , and do not in the least injure , as I know by trial , the germination of seeds ; now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food , it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours .
A bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles , and hawks are known to look out for tired birds , and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered .
Mr. Brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up flying carrier - pigeons from France to England , as the hawks on the English coast destroyed so many on their arrival .
Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole , and after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours , disgorge pellets , which , as I know from experiments made in the Zoological Gardens , include seeds capable of germination .
Some seeds of the oat , wheat , millet , canary , hemp , clover , and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twenty - one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey ; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours .
Freshwater fish , I find , eat seeds of many land and water plants : fish are frequently devoured by birds , and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place .
I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish , and then gave their bodies to fishing - eagles , storks , and pelicans ; these birds after an interval of many hours , either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement ; and several of these seeds retained their power of germination .
Certain seeds , however , were always killed by this process .

There has been much ado , of late , concerning President Obama trying to procure Chicago as the 2016 Olympic site for the United States of America .
Chicago , they say , is just part of the dirty Obama / Chicago Machine .
Let ’s see what that dirty , liberal , Marxist , communist , Fascist , hippy President had to say about it :
Union League Club of Chicago
Chicago , Illinois 11:35 A.M. CST THE PRESIDENT : I want to thank the members of the 2016 Chicago bid to get the Olympics .
Listen , Mr. Mayor , you and your committee have put together a great plan .
It ’s a plan that will make America proud .
They say that the Olympics will come to Chicago if we ’re fortunate enough to be selected , but really it ’s coming to America , and I ca n’t think of a better city to represent the United States than Chicago .
This is a well thought out venue .
There will be — the athletes will be taken care of .
People who will be coming from around the world will find this good city has got fantastic accommodations , great restaurants .
It will be safe .
And so I — this country supports your bid , strongly .
And our hope is that the judges will take a good look at Chicago and select Chicago for the 2016 Olympics .
Thank you all .
END 11:36 A.M. CST
Oh , wait , that was n’t President Obama who said that , it was President Bush , on January 7 , 2008 .
Must have been something to do with the tens of thousands of jobs that would be created over the next eight years and the millions of dollars that would be injected into this craptastic economy by dozens of countries worldwide .
We definitely do n’t need that !
Nevermind .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The vacancy rate at U.S. strip malls reached a 17 - year high in the third quarter and mall vacancy was the highest in at least 10 years , reflecting the protracted pull - back by consumers , real estate research firm Reis Inc said .
The downturn in the U.S. economy , anemic consumer spending and the U.S. housing bust severely hurt new retail properties , 30 percent of which were completed with less than 50 percent occupied , Reis said in a report released on Thursday .
“ Our outlook for retail properties as a whole is bleak , ” Victor Calanog , Reis director of research , said .
“ Until we see stabilization and recovery take root in both consumer spending and business spending and hiring , we do not foresee a recovery in the retail sector until late 2012 at the earliest . ”
The prognosis does not bode well for mall and shopping center owners including Developers Diversified Realty Corp DDR.N , Macerich Co MAC.N , General Growth Properties Inc GGWPQ.PK , Simon Property Group SPG.N , Equity One Inc EQY.N , Kimco Realty Corp KIM.N , Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust PEI.N , Realty Income Corp O.N and Kite Realty Group KRG.N .
The third - quarter vacancy rate at U.S. strip malls , which include local shopping and big - box centers , rose 0.3 percentage points from the second quarter to 10.3 percent , the highest since 1992 , Reis said .
Asking rent at strip malls slid 0.3 percent from the second quarter to $ 19.22 per square foot and were down 1.9 percent from the prior year .
Asking rents were the lowest since mid 2007 .
Factoring in months of free rent and other perks , effective rent fell 0.8 percent from the second quarter to $ 16.89 per square foot or down 3.8 percent from the third quarter 2008 .
Rents were the lowest since mid-2007
Rents continued to decline as retail property landlords faced ongoing pressure from tenants who reduced their space requirements , negotiated more favorable lease terms , or went out of business altogether .
“ Since asking and effective rent growth only turned negative about one year ago , it is daunting to observe this acceleration in decline in what has traditionally been regarded as a stable property type , ” Calanog said .
Reis expects rising vacancy levels and declining asking and effective rents for neighborhood and community centers through 2011 .
“ We have yet to observe any unexpected systematic resumption in hiring and strength in consumer spending that may lead us to revise our projections with a more optimistic bent , ” Calanog said .
U.S. mall vacancy rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 8.6 percent in the third quarter , the highest vacancy level since Reis began tracking regional malls in the first quarter 2000 .
Asking rent at big U.S. malls fell 0.6 percent from the prior quarter to $ 39.18 per square foot and was down 3.5 percent from a year earlier .
It was the fourth straight decline in rents and the largest one - year decline Reis has seen .
Reis does not generate forecasts for regional malls .

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a bill creating an annual day of recognition for pioneering gay rights activist Harvey Milk , officials said Monday .
The designation of each May 22 as “ Harvey Milk Day ” encourages schools around the state to commemorate the murdered gay politician , whose life was the subject of the Oscar - winning 2008 film “ Milk . ”

Milk was California ’s first openly gay elected official .
He was shot to death , along with San Francisco ’s mayor , by a former city supervisor in 1978 .
His birthday was May 22 .
Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year , saying Milk ’s legacy “ should continue to be recognized at the local level . ”
While gay rights groups praised the governor ’s signing of the bill , conservative groups reacted with scorn .
Deriding it as “ Gay Day , ” the Pacific Justice Institute criticized the bill and said it “ offers no opt - out provisions for parents who might not want their children to focus on sexuality for an entire school day . ”
“ It is no wonder schoolchildren in California are struggling on standardized tests , when lawmakers continue to promote political correctness in the classroom over academic achievement , ” said Brad Dacus , president of the institute .

KENT , Wash. , Sept. 17 ( UPI ) -- A California man says police in Kent , Wash. , have returned a portion of his medical marijuana that was seized during his February arrest .
Seattlepi.com said Thursday that Kent Police returned the first portion of the more than 11 pounds of marijuana seized from Matthew Zugsberger as part of a King County Superior Court judge 's ruling the drugs be returned in 1 1/2 - pound portions .

After police found the drugs in the trunk of Zugsberger 's car in February , Zugsberger pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession and received three months of probation .
Defense attorney Aaron Pelley , who represents Zugsberger , filed a petition seeking the return of the marijuana to his client , who has a prescription for medical marijuana .
The presiding judge ultimately ruled that Zugsberger , whose age was not reported , would receive portions of his marijuana stash at seven - day increments .
" To my knowledge , it was the first time anyone has asked for their marijuana back , " Pelley said .
" It 's the weirdest case I 've ever dealt . "
Seattlepi.com said the incremental distribution was deemed necessary since Washington state law allows an individual with a valid marijuana prescription to possess only 1 1/2 pounds of the drug at a given time .

RUSSIAN football fans have been offered a free tipple of Welsh whisky – after they were told it could help them stave off swine flu .
Hundreds of fans are expected to fly in from Russia to Cardiff this week to watch their country ’s World Cup qualifier against Wales .
But Russian officials last month issued a public warning telling fans to boycott Britain , amid fears they could contract the infection .
That was followed by a message from Alexander Shprygin , the head of the Russian supporters ’ association , who insisted there was no need to worry – as long as everyone had a strong drink once they got here .
He said : “ We urge our fans to drink a lot of Welsh whisky as a form of disinfection .
“ That should cure all symptoms of the disease . ”
Now the Penderyn Distillery , in Rhondda – Wales ’ only whisky manufacturer – is offering Russian fans a complimentary sample .
Managing director Stephen Davies told Wales on Sunday : “ We would n’t ever claim any medical benefits for our products .
“ But we are happy to let any Russians fans – or , indeed , any Welsh fans – come down to the distillery and try some of our whisky for free .
“ We thought it would be a nice idea to welcome our Russian friends – the least we can offer them is a glass of whisky while they are here .
“ We ’re only a 15 - minute drive from Cardiff and we’d be happy to offer tours around the distillery , ” he added .
BIG MATCH PREVIEW : SPORT PULLOUT
Oct. 15 , 2009  --
Two women are challenging an Oklahoma law that will require the state to create a Web site where any woman who has an abortion will have to provide intimate details about her choice -- including her relationships , financial situation and even her motivation for seeking the abortion .
" A friend said it best :
It 's like undressing women in public , exposing their most personal issues on the Internet , " said Lora Joyce Davis , one of the plaintiffs working with the New York - based Center for Reproductive Rights to fight the law , which goes into effect Nov. 1 .
Called the Statistical Reporting of Abortions
Act , the law requires all doctors to file information on a woman's age , marital status , education level , number of previous pregnancies , cost and type of abortion , as well as the mother 's relationship to the father , with the Oklahoma Department of Health .
Though it does not ask for names , the form poses 37 questions detailing a woman 's personal situation .
Critics say the first eight questions alone could easily lead to the identification of a woman who lives in one of the state 's many small communities .
" This law asks for so much information , and they are going to put it on the Internet for public scorn , " said Davis .
" Women who have abortions are considered murderers by many people , and you are going to put the name of a town of 200 and the fact that the girl is 17 and it's her first pregnancy and she in the 10th grade .
People are going to know who it is . "
Many questions fish for more , critics say .
" Was there an infant born alive as a result of the abortion ? " and " Was the abortion performed within the use of any public institution ? "
Doctors who fail to provide information would face criminal sanctions and loss of their medical license .
While the litigants object to the invasion of privacy , their lawsuit challenges the law on more technical grounds .
It charges that House Bill 1595 covers more than one subject and therefore violates the state constitution .
The plaintiffs hope to delay implementation of the law and the planned March 1 , 2010 , launch of the Web site .
Last month , the organization used the same argument to successfully strike down a 2008 law that would have required women seeking abortions to have an ultrasound within an hour of the proceedings and require doctors to describe the picture to their patients in great detail -- down to the numbers of finger and toes .
In addition to mandating the new Web site for abortion - related demographics , the legislation also redefines various abortion terms , bans sex- selective abortion and creates other new reporting requirements .
Abortion Law ' Protects Sanctity of Life '
The new law was sponsored by two anti-abortion rights Republicans , Sen. Todd Lamb , of Edmond , and Rep. Dan Sullivan , of Tulsa .
" This legislation is essential in protecting the sanctity of life , " said Lamb when the bill was enacted last April .
" Too often the life of the unborn is taken for granted , and I applaud my colleagues for their bipartisan support of a pro-life measure , despite attempts on the floor to sabotage this issue important to families across our state . "
Lamb , who is running for lieutenant governor , said he is confident the law will be upheld , calling it " commonsense legislation " that passed with bipartisan support .
" To say these [ questions ] are onerous , we are talking about human life , and to ask some questions and add two pages of forms to the already multiple pages you are filling out for the medical profession , for an innocent child , that 's not much to ask , " Lamb told ABCNews.com .
But Davis , and co-plaintiff Wanda Jo Stapleton , a former Democratic state representative from Oklahoma City , argue that the law is not only ineffective but is also " an unlawful expenditure of public funds . "
The Web site , they say , will cost taxpayers $ 281,285 the first year and $ 256,285 every subsequent year .
Davis said money spent on women in " personal crisis " could be better spent addressing Oklahoma 's high teen pregnancy rate -- which is the sixth highest in the nation , according to a 2009 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" I always cared about civil rights , and it seems in Oklahoma , politicians keep trying to do something on the abortion issue to make them look like they are pro-life , " said Davis .
a 66 - year - old great - grandmother from Shawnee .
" It 's disingenuous to keep passing laws that make it harder and harder for people seeking abortion for personal reasons and to keep lowering funding for support of teens who are pregnant . "
" People are more likely to choose abortion if there is not hope for taking care of the child , " she told ABCNews.com .
Oklahoma allows abortions to be performed up to 22 weeks .
There are only three doctors in the state who are known to perform abortions , and many have become " vilified in the public eye , " according to Jennifer Mondino , staff attorney for the U.S. legal program for the Center for Reproductive Rights .
" I think the intent is to further stigmatize doctors who provide abortions and make it more difficult for women to access reproductive health services , " said Mondino .
" In talking to abortion providers , they have been telling us that they are seeing a serious upswing in harassment and protest activity since the beginning of the year , " she told ABCNews.com .
In 2007 , more than 6,300 abortions were performed in Oklahoma , down slightly from the previous year and reflecting a trend nationwide , according to Planned Parenthood , an organization that supports abortion rights .
" Oklahoma women should be terrified of this onerous law , " said Keri Parks , director of external affairs for Planned Parenthood of Central Oklahoma .
" It basically turns an already difficult and personal decision into a situation which may put a woman 's private and protected health information at risk of inadvertent disclosure .
" Our reproductive rights are challenged yearly in the Oklahoma legislature , and our state seems to have become a testing ground for oppressive restrictions on abortion access , " she told ABCNews.com .
The number of abortion restrictions is increasing nationwide , according to Planned Parenthood .
During the 2009 state legislative session alone , 23 bills were introduced in Texas and 18 were introduced in Mississippi .
But supporters say the law is not about restricting access to abortion but helping the state gather important information .
" I do n't think [ the bill ] has anything to do with restrictions or roadblocks , " said David Dunn , director of research for the Oklahoma Family Policy Council , which opposes abortion .
" The government knows what the situation is and is n't operating in the dark , " said Dunn , who dismissed complaints that the new Web site might reveal confidential information .
" We might have a situation in some small town , but I do n't know why it 's a big deal if abortion is legal and there is nothing wrong , why would people be ashamed to have an abortion ? " he asked .
Recording statistical data on abortions is nothing new .
Currently 46 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia have mandatory or voluntary reporting , according to the Guttmacher Institute , which promotes sexual and reproductive health worldwide .
Since 1969 , when abortion was legal in only a handful of states , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has gathered and released aggregate data provided by state health departments to track maternal morbidity and mortality .
" Generally , the requirements have been benign , " said Elizabeth Nash , a Guttmacher public policy associate .
" The forms go to the health department and they put them under lock and key and send the data to the CDC . "
But over time , as the abortion debate has heated up , states have added " twists and turns " to those requirements , asking for details on minors and fathers of the fetus , according to Nash .
" They are becoming more and more intrusive , " she told ABCNews.com .
" And now comes the Oklahoma law -- it 's pretty darn intrusive .
" You basically get into a whole bunch of stuff that goes way far beyond the CDC in its interest in your personal life , " she said .
" This is very personal , the kind of information you keep very close and might not even share with a close family member . "
The law also places a burden on abortion providers , who Nash said are " really being put between a rock and a hard place . "
" They want to protect themselves , and their patients from troubling and upsetting questions and at the same time there are strong penalties , " she said .
As for women seeking abortion , this week 's Guttmacher report says that the abortion rate is roughly equal in countries where it is legal and those where it is highly restricted .
" Honestly , " said Nash .
" It seems to be that women surmount all sorts of barriers to abortion waiting periods .
They travel long distances to get child care because they know what they need to do .
Women still get abortions and I think this is just adding to their burden . "
My name is Katherine Ottaway and I am a Mad as Hell Doctor .
I am a Family Practice physician .
I live in a rural town of 9000 and I take care of people from birth to death .
I have delivered babies for 18 years .
I am Mad as Hell because people are suffering and 30 % of the money spent on health care goes to administration and profit , not to health care .
60 % of bankruptcies in the United States are triggered by medical bills .
I am Mad as Hell because my patients tell me their stories .
A patient came to me , a man in his upper 50s .
He had worked hard , done well , retired early .
The American Dream , right ?
He decided to give back to the world and joined the Peace Corps .
He had health insurance that covered him overseas .
While he was gone , a friend got sick .
Very sick , with cancer .
The retired man came back to the United States to take care of his friend , until the friend died .
Then the retired man had a heart attack .
He was life flighted ( about $ 10,000 ) on a helicopter and had a stent and treatment .
He had forgotten that his insurance only covered him when he was abroad .
In the United States , he was uninsured .
" I 'm starting over , " he said , " My retirement is entirely gone to medical bills . "
That would not happen in any other industrialized country .
Not in Denmark , England , Cuba , Slovakia .
Why ?
They have decided that everyone has the right to single payer .
Everyone gets care !
You can only be bankrupt by medical bills in the United States .
I am Mad as Hell that the American Dream no longer exists and that my patient 's retirement was wiped out .
We need single payer .
Each year on her birthday , Ann Hernandez and her boyfriend , Alan Tomaska , would settle on the rocky shore of Thacher Island and uncork a bottle of champagne in a toast to the day .
When the bottle was empty and the tide going out , Hernandez would tuck a handwritten message inside and Tomaska would hurl the bottle over the rocks and into the crashing surf .
Tomaska considered the ritual a lark .
But for Hernandez , the messages in a bottle were a kind of personal driftwood - a piece of her joining the sea and traveling with its currents to hoped - for far - flung locales .
“ When we got back to our humdrum lives , we did n’t talk about the bottles , ’’’ said Tomaska , a home remodeler .
“ But whenever we were on the island , she would say , ‘ One of these days , someone is going to find one of those bottles . ’ ’’
It would take six years , but someone did .
Defying nautical laws and odds , one of Hernandez ’s bottles last month bobbed along the coast of France to a quaint village , where a French couple , Michel and Daniele Onesime , scooped it out of the water and read with wonder the note inside .
“ While we were setting out to go deep - sea fishing one morning from the port at St. Gilles Croix de Vie , on the Vendee coast , my wife and I found a white glass bottle floating by , ’’ Michel Onesime wrote in an e-mail to the Globe .
“ The moment we plucked it from the water , we saw that there was a message inside . ’’
The message read : “ Ann Hernandez is a lighthouse keeper on Thacher Island - Cape Ann Light Station and had a birthday there Oct 10 2003 .
Drop her a card at home . ’’
The message included her year - round Illinois address .
The Onesimes quickly jotted a postcard and sent it off .
But the connection was not to be .
The postcard came back to them marked undeliverable .
When the couple sent an e-mail to the Thacher Island Association , it reached its president , Paul St. Germain , who relayed sad news .
Hernandez unexpectedly died at age 61 from complications of surgery the day before Thanksgiving last year .
Since then , the Onesimes have joined in mourning Hernandez and found themselves linked to her friends and loved ones - a connection forged , in this age of instant communication , not through text message , not through e-mail , but through a bottle that withstood a 3,000 - mile trip across the ocean .
Blue Cross Blue Shield in North Carolina thought it might be nifty to spend a lot of money writing its customers and asking them to lobby Democratic Senator Kay Hagen to oppose the health care reform bill .
Only problem ?
Blue Cross had just raised their customers ’ rates by 11 % .
People lost it .
First , they learned their rates will rise by an average of 11 percent next year .
Next , they opened a slick flier from the insurer urging them to send an enclosed pre-printed , postage - paid note to Sen .
Kay Hagan denouncing what the company says is unfair competition that would be imposed by a government - backed insurance plan .
The so - called public option is likely to be considered by Congress in the health - care overhaul debate .
“ No matter what you call it , if the federal government intervenes in the private health insurance market , it ’s a slippery slope to a single - payer system , ” the BCBS flier read .
“ Who wants that ? ”
Plenty of people , it turns out .
Indignant Blue Cross customers have rebelled against the insurer ’s message , complaining that their premium dollars have funded such a campaign .
They ’ve hit the Internet in a flurry of e-mails to friends and neighbors throughout the state .
They ’ve called Hagan ’s office to voice support for a public option .
They ’ve marked through the Blue Cross message on their postcards to instead vouch support , then dropped them in the mail — in at least one case taped to a brick — to be paid on Blue Cross ’ dime .
Or dimes .

A recently released security report from Microsoft warns that cyber crooks are digging deeper into computers in order to steal and control data .
The Security Intelligence Report reveals that rogue security software ( " scareware " ) was the biggest threat during the first half of this year .
Worm Activity on the Rise
In a recent report , Jeff Williams , Microsoft 's Malware Protection Center principal architect noted that rogue security software is no longer the primary tool for hackers and that worm activity , particularly the Conficker and Taterf worm , are on the rise .
Scareware usually spreads by tricking people with pop-up messages that warns of bogus alerts about their machines being infected .
Users that fall victim to scareware are coerced into providing hackers with credit card information and installing a bogus application that " fixes " a computer problem that never existed .
Worms , on the other hand , are designed to replicate themselves and target machines by hiding in legitimate applications or by piggy - backing on portable data storage devices such as USB drives .
( Source : google.com )
Worms Infect Millions of Computers Worldwide
Earlier this year the Conficker worm plagued the Internet .
It was so pernicious that computer software and security firms , including Microsoft , formed a task force to combat it .
Since then , the Conficker and Taterf worms have wiggled their way onto millions of computers all over the world .
USB and other media drives have become increasingly popular for people to move music , video , games , files and other data between computers .
Those types of media tend to bypass computer security systems designed to guard against hackers breaking into a computer from the outside .
Users should scan removable media drives such as USB drives for malware before using them on multiple computers .
Important to Keep Your Computer Updated
Cyber crooks are becoming increasingly adept at reverse engineering security patches released by Microsoft intended to fix vulnerabilities in their software programs and operating systems .
The patches are dissected by hackers to identify weaknesses and to create malicious code that takes advantage of flaws in the software , so it 's imperative that users keep their software updated .
Data from Microsoft 's security report was based on billions of scans per day in more than 200 global regions .

She traveled 1,800 miles to find it .
She knew it was there .
And by cracky , in just one morning of panning the creekbed , Janet Gilray had a handful of gold flecks in her hand .
" Woo - hoo ! " she screamed .
" Gas money ! "
There 's a 160 - year - old reason California is called the Golden State , and people like Gilray are making that reason fresh again .
A new gold rush is in full gallop all over California .
Driven by the record - high gold prices - $ 1,056 an ounce on Friday , double that of just three years ago - and the lure of easy money , prospectors are flocking to the state 's 1849 Gold Rush fields with pans and sluice boxes .
Some want to beat the punishing recession , some just want a quick buck for fun .
Some are with big companies , some are lone folks in sedans .
They all have dollar signs in their eyes .
Gold mining permits , or claims , on file with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for California have shot from 15,606 in 2005 to 23,974 this year .
They 're popping up in every corner of the state , from the Stanislaus River outside Yosemite National Park to the Klamath River near the Oregon border and the deserts of Southern California .
Nowhere is hopping more than the Sierra streambeds from Sutter Creek to Jamestown , where the original 49ers carved their notch in history - and where Gilray was found with a pan in her hand last week .
Gold fever
" There 's a real thing to gold fever .
I feel it right now , " Gilray said as she waded in Woods Creek , which produced millions of dollars of yellow stuff more than a century ago and is drawing thousands of the new 49ers this year .
" You can really make money doing this . "
Gilray is on sabbatical from her elementary school - teaching job in Indianapolis , and when she launched on a cross-country trip to put together an American history project for next year 's class , she had no doubt where she 'd end up .
She had heard of the commonly held estimate that only 20 percent of the Gold Country 's treasure was ever coaxed from the ground , and she was determined to scratch at that remaining 80 percent .
" I might be able to fund my whole project right here , " Gilray said excitedly .
Her handful of the morning was worth about $ 20 , and there was plenty of day left .
Locals know better
The pair of brothers teaching her how to gold pan , Brent and Bryant Shock , tipped back their weathered bushman hats and sighed as they heard her words .
Like virtually every other prospecting tour company in the Sierra , they 've seen their Gold Prospecting Adventures business on Jamestown 's Main Street explode , doubling to 6,000 customers in the past year alone .
Most come just to have fun , such as school groups - but the ones hot to make quick cash have jumped from a couple a month to at least one a day .
Nobody seems to be daunted by warnings that prospecting is a back - breaking grind of kneeling in rocky water or in dank mines for years on end to eke out what usually amounts to a hand - to - mouth living .
They 've heard stories like the one - true - about a hobbyist who stumbled across an 8.7 - ounce nugget near Bakersfield in May .
They 've seen " Gold Fever " and other popular documentaries on cable TV .
" Guys call me up all the time and say , ' How can I get enough gold to pay my bills ? '
And you know what I tell 'em ? " said Brent Schock , who with sporadic teeth and a bushy gray beard looks like the lifelong prospector that he is at 57 .
" I tell 'em , sell doorknobs or shovels .
The merchants were the ones who really made the money in that last big gold rush of 1849 , and that 's a lesson to remember .
" But hey , we 're happy to show them how to do this , " he said .
" We just remind them that prospecting is very hard work .
It 's best to think of it as a great hobby . "
He might as well be shouting into the wind .
" I used to be out there on my own a couple of years ago , panning the streambed with hardly anybody around , " said David Basque , a 30 - year - old prospector who lives in a tent on the Klamath River near Yreka ( Siskiyou County ) .
" But now ?
I see 15 cars a day coming through with guys looking for gold .
" It 's gone crazy . "
Basque , a construction worker , started digging in the far north rivers about four years ago for fun and pocket change .
But now that he 's learned to pick out about 2 ounces a month and gold prices are stratospheric , he 's spending more time with a pan than a hammer .
Going big
Joe Christopher of Texas is n't bothering with pans .
This month he set up shop at the historic , mountainous Dorado Mine about 20 miles northwest of tiny Weaverville ( Trinity County ) with a backhoe and truck - sized trommel and sluice screening machines - and he 's aiming for millions of dollars .
As president of the Oil America Group in Texas , Christopher acquired the long - shuttered 19th century mine over the summer .
With a small crew at his side , he is already exceeding the 3.5 ounces of gold per 100 yards of dirt that an assay study said he could expect .
" It 's like going back to the Wild West , " Christopher said .
" This mine is out in the middle of nowhere , and it 's not easy work .
But we 're getting pretty excited . "
Christopher said he is branching into gold mining to shore up his bottom line when the oil business dips .
" Gold holds its value well , even in bad times , " he said .
" And I think we 're in the beginning stages of this gold rush .
So far , we 're happy . "
Back in Jamestown , Bryant Shock counts his blessings that he's in one of the few growth industries in the worst economic downturn in generations .
" Our main business is teaching people to look for gold , but believe me , I never stop prospecting myself , " said Shock , who at 54 looks like a slightly less grizzled duplicate of his brother .
" I found a 1 - ounce nugget just up the creek from town , and we do OK overall throughout the year .
" I can't guarantee that you 'll always find a lot of gold , but I will say this , " he said .
" You work hard and look long enough , you 'll get some . "
Normally the closure of two bridal magazines , a dining magazine and a mom magazine would n't be notable ; except that this time their publisher , Conde Nast , notes that they 're going to focus on digital distribution instead .
The important part of Gawker 's memo is here :
In the coming weeks , we hope to announce initiatives to develop digital versions of our brands that will make use of new devices and distribution channels .

New devices makes it seem like it's not just moving those four publications online — a move that would have succeeded already if just going online would save magazines .
It 's that new devices bit that 's intriguing .

One Canadian soldier was killed and two were injured Wednesday in Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device .
Lt. Justin Garrett Boyes , 26 , was killed when his foot patrol was hit by the blast , at about 9 a.m. local time , 20 kilometres southwest of Kandahar City in Panjwayi district .
Boyes belonged to the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry based in Edmonton and was 10 days into his second deployment to Afghanistan when he was killed .
At the time of his death , Boyes was mentoring an Afghan national police patrol .
Two other soldiers who were wounded in the incident were treated at the Kandahar Airfield medical facility and are in good condition .
Boyes is survived by his wife Alanna and son , James , 3 , his parents Angela and Brian , a brother serving with the 2nd Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry in Shilo , Man. , as well as a sister living in the U.K .
In Kandahar , Brig. - Gen. Jonathan Vance called Boyes " a dedicated family man " who spent every possible moment with his wife and son .
" Growing up in Saskatchewan , he was an easy - going Prairie boy who preferred sitting around the backyard with good friends , his family and a cold drink . "
Boyes is the first Canadian soldier to be killed in action in October .
Canada 's last casualty was Pte. Jonathan Couturier of the 2nd Battalion , Royal 22nd Regiment , based in Valcartier , Que. , who died when his armoured vehicle struck an improvised explosive device on Sept. 17 .
Boyes is the 132nd Canadian soldier to die in Afghanistan since the mission began in 2002 .
SECAUCUS , N.J.  Babe Ruth has struck out looking .
Displeased , he leans on his bat , right hand on his hip , and looks back at the umpire .
He utters something that can only be imagined .
Lou Gehrig , on deck , leans on his bat , too , as if he has seen this act before .
Ruth finally shuffles away , head turned to the umpire , dragging his bat through the dirt .
The scene , along with eight seconds of footage of Ruth playing the outfield , was found by a New Hampshire man in his grandfather ’s home movie collection .
It provides a rare look at Ruth , a showman even in defeat .
No American sport has a past as deep and cherished as baseball’s .
But precious little of the sport ’s history is preserved in moving images .
Much occurred before the television age , leaving only grainy , scattershot clips culled from newsreels and home movies  and rarely do the clips show a player of Ruth ’s stature .
The newly arrived Ruth film is part of the video collection of Major League Baseball Productions , the league ’s official archivist , which spans more than 100 years and includes about 150,000 hours of moving images .
Most of the collection is stored in plastic cases that line metal shelves of a room labeled “ Major League Baseball Film and Video Archive . ”
The overflow is stored a few miles away in Fort Lee .
If you were gearing up to launch a tablet computer — and these days , who is n’t ? — who would you hire to market it ?
One obvious candidate would be Michael Tchao , one of the original developers of Apple ‘s groundbreaking but failed Newton personal digital assistant .
Mr. Tchao joined Apple on Monday as vice president of product marketing , Steve Dowling , an Apple spokesman , confirmed .
He will report to Phil Schiller , a senior vice president .
Mr. Tchao is returning to his old Cupertino stomping grounds after an absence of 15 years .
During that time , he has had a high - profile career , most recently as the general manager of Nike Techlab , the company ’s technology arm , which designed armbands and sneakers that integrate with the iPod .
It is not clear what his new duties at Apple will entail ; Apple would not comment further on the matter , and Mr. Tchao did not immediately respond to a phone message .
But identifying a market for the much - rumored Apple tablet could certainly be among them .
Mr. Tchao gets the credit ( or perhaps the blame ) for convincing John Sculley , Apple ’s former chief executive , to integrate the company ’s handwriting - recognition technology into a consumer device .
“ He ’s got the scars and the great ideas ” about tablet computing , said another former Apple employee who worked with Mr. Tchao .
He did not want to be named because the hiring was not yet public .
Laura Dekker put under guardianship of authorities until July , but she could still set record for youngest solo circumnavigation
A Dutch court today barred a 14 - year - old girl from attempting a world record for sailing solo around the world , placing her under the guardianship of child protection authorities until July .
The decision by judges at Utrecht district court means Laura Dekker , who was first blocked from attempting the trip in August , will remain with her father but her parents will have to check with child protection officials about any major decisions in her life .
Mariska Woertman , a spokeswoman for the family , who were not in court , said the teenager was " disappointed that the court does not have faith in her to leave now . "
Woertman said the way was now open for Dekker to begin the voyage next summer , meaning she could still set the record for the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe alone .
The title is currently held by Mike Perham , a 17 - year - old Briton , who completed the trip in August .
The Utrecht court 's initial decision against Dekker shortly after that sparked a debate in the Netherlands about whether officials should be allowed to circumscribe such parentally approved adventures .
Dekker 's parents – both of whom are experienced sailors – are separated .
While her father is a keen advocate of the trip , her mother has expressed concern given Dekker 's age .
The court said today that the mother agreed to the voyage " so long as she has assurances about the safety measures .
At the moment , as far as she is concerned , they are insufficient . "
The court said that while Dekker 's sailing skills were adequate and a psychological report concluded that the voyage would not harm her social or emotional development , there were questions about safety and her ability to continue her schooling while at sea .
During a private court session this week , Dekker said she planned to delay the trip at least until May and would be guided by an experienced sailor in a separate boat .
" The good news … is that we have established Laura is capable of making this voyage , " said her lawyer , Peter de Lange .
He said Dekker could still set the record despite the enforced delay , " but the record is not her primary goal .
Laura just wants to sail . "
A fortnight ago , a 16 - year - old Australian girl , Jessica Watson , sailed out of Sydney harbour on a planned solo global circumnavigation .
It goes without saying that there 's no smoking in class .
But there is a good deal of sniffing of leaves , discussion of the finer points of inhaling and debate over which plant gives the biggest hit .
Welcome to Detroit 's cannabis college , recently opened with courses on how to grow marijuana – and harvest , cook and sell it too – after Michigan legalised the drug as a medicine .
Students get instruction from horticulturalists , doctors and lawyers as well as hands - on experience cultivating plants and guidance on how to protect their stash from the criminal element .
" Growing pot by chucking seeds in the garden is fine for the recreational industry , " says the college co-founder , Nick Tennant , whose wholesome and youthful appearance , including acne-covered cheeks , startles some of the more ragged - looking students .
" But when we 're using this from a medicinal standpoint , you really need to document your strains and your genetics .
The horticultural process is very complex .
If you want to do it right you 're going to need to learn .
There 's a lot of money in this if you do it right . "
With more than 1,000 medical marijuana certificates issued each month in Michigan for users and growers to sell to them , there is demand for places at MedGrow Cannabis College , located in a small office block .
Among the first students paying $ 475 ( £ 285 ) for six evening classes are people reliant on marijuana for pain relief and those who help them , including a clergyman who runs an Aids clinic .
Then there are young men such as Ryan Hasbany , a 20 - year - old business student .
He 's still a year too young to get a grower 's licence but he wants to learn the trade .
" My father is a family practice doctor and he is issuing medical marijuana cards so I know there are a lot of people getting them .
It could turn into a very lucrative business .
The street prices are ridiculously high , " he says of medical grade marijuana , which sells at $ 250 ( £ 150 ) an ounce in Michigan .
" There 's Harvard economists who say this is what we need to bring the economy back . "
Hasbany has no hesitation in admitting that he might be in a good position to judge the quality of what he grows .
" I smoke it .
In my high school graduating class , I 'd say 25 % of them were smoking it , " he said .
Michigan became the 14th state to legalise medicinal marijuana this year after about two - thirds of voters supported the measure in a referendum .
The move reflects growing acceptance of the drug in large parts of the country .
In the past week , the US 's first marijuana cafe opened in Oregon and Colorado ordered cannabis sales subject to tax .
The path was carved by California , where permission to buy marijuana requires little more than telling a sympathetic doctor it would make you feel better .
Attitudes are changing in Washington too , where the Obama administration has told the FBI and other federal agencies to adhere to state marijuana laws in deciding who to arrest .
For all that , there is still hesitation over identification with what is now a legal industry in Michigan .
The first class of the evening at cannabis college is led by a physician who wants to be known only as Dr Powell .
" Do n't mention my first name .
It 'll make it harder for them to identify me , " he says .
Powell explains to the students the range of conditions that permit him to issue a medical marijuana certificate , from cancer and Aids to a broad category of severe chronic pain .
" If someone 's had back surgery or a gunshot wound , " says Powell .
There are questions .
" Can I get it for gout ? " asks a student .
Powell thinks it unlikely .
The doctor says he is not concerned about addiction but regular cannabis users should find an alternative to smoking .
That 's why the course also includes a cookery class with recipes as varied as hash cakes and marijuana sushi .
The horticulture lecturer is even more wary than the doctor about being identified .
" They might ask how I know how to grow all this stuff , " he says .
" I 've been doing it for rather longer than it 's been legal . "
He , like many of those who lecture at Cannabis College , is also a consumer because of severe injury in a bad sporting accident .
Tennant obtained a medical marijuana certificate to deal with a stomach condition that causes nausea .
It is what brought out his acne .
The horticulturalist pulls open a couple of large white doors that act as an entire wall at the front of the classroom .
Bright white light streams through the cracks and across the classroom to reveal a den of silver - lined walls , air conditioning ducts , fans and intense lights .
At the heart sit a handful of plants – some of them bushes really .
The teacher runs through soil versus hydroponics , lights ( red and blue better than LED ) , pruning ( pluck , do n't cut ) and the intricacies of cloning .
There 's an explanation of ozone generating devices to cover the smell .
" You might not want the neighbours to know .
You do n't want them raiding your house for your supply , " he says .
Pasted to the wall is a chart of the labyrinth of marijuana species , their effect on different diseases and their particular tastes .
The horticulturist explains that there 's money to be made from the trade in medicinal marijuana but growers must tailor the plant to the customer 's need .
" There 's pot that makes you not shut up for five hours .
There 's pot where you sit on the couch and drool for five hours .
That 's not what you need if you 're going to hold down a job .
There 's thousands of people getting patient cards and they all have needs .
If you can work out how to meet those individual needs you 're gonna get rich , " he says .
If you have been following this blog , the version of the Google App Engine SDK was 1.2.5 .
Recently Google announced a release 1.2.6 of its App Engine SDK .
I think you should upgrade to the latest version since it a very cool feature that resonates with an earlier episode titled Episode 3 : Using the GAEJ Email Service .
That episode covered using the Email Service that allows you to send an email from your GAEJ application .
The latest release 1.2.6 of the App Engine SDK for Java allows you to receive incoming emails too in your application .
And that will be the topic in the next episode , so I thought it is best that I mention here that it is time to upgrade to version 1.2.6 of the App Engine SDK .
Here are a few steps and points to note to upgrade to version 1.2.6 of the SDK .
I am assuming that all your development / deployment is being done via the Google App Engine plugin for Eclipse since that is what we have used throughout this series .
Here are the steps :
1. Launch the version of Eclipse that you have been using so far for the GAEJ development .
2. Go to Window –> Preferences .
And then click on Google –> App Engine .
You can see the version of the App Engine SDK and most likely it is 1.2.5
3. Stay in Preferences and go one level higher in the tree on the left to Google .
You will see a tiny checkbox that mentions “ Notify me about updates ” .
If you have this selected , then you should have already got a notification status in the status bar in Eclipse , somewhere in the bottom of the screen .
It looks something like this :
Clicking on this link would bring up a dialog that looks like the one shown below :
Depending on your version of Eclipse , you might see a different message and maybe the menu options might be slightly different but the process is a standard one in Eclipse to update your plugins .
4 . Even if you had deselected the option to Notify about updates , the process to upgrade the plugin / SDK to the latest version 1.2.6 is the same .
Go to Help –> Check for Updates in the main menu .
This is for version 3.5 of Eclipse that I use ( Galileo version ) .
This will bring up a dialog and show all your installed components / plugins in Eclipse that have a newer version ( update ) for you to install .
A sample screenshot from my Eclipse setup is shown below :
5. Select only the Google specific upgrades .
You should be able to see the version 1.2.6 of the SDK shown as above .
Click on the Next button .
This will confirm the updates as shown below :
Click on Next , accept all the terms as shown below and proceed with Finish appropriately .
This will download , install the update to the SDK .
I recommend to restart Eclipse as prompted .
Post Installation Steps
The following two steps are very important in order to start using the latest version correctly .
This is what worked for me and I am not sure if there are other things that are still required but this two steps should suffice for now :
1 . Make sure that all your projects moving forward use version 1.2.6 of the SDK .
This is not mandatory but required if you wish to use the new features available in version 1.2.6 .
To do this , go to Window –> Preferences .
Click on Google –> App Engine as shown below :
In this screen , you are seeing only only entry for the version 1.2.6 of the SDK .
Normally you will see more than one ( the older 1.2.5 SDK ) will also be shown and it will be the default selected one .
You are not seeing it over here in my setup , because I deleted it and am using only 1.2.6 of the SDK as shown .
Select and you will find that as mentioned in the dialog above , the checked SDK will be used by default for newly created projects .
2. Google App Engine SDK also ships with a development server that you can use for local testing .
We will be using it in the next episode .
You can simply right click any project in the project hierarchy and select Run As –>
Web Application to launch your GAEJ application in the development server .
The development server is automatically started as you will notice in the console window and you can access your application at http://localhost:8080 .
But an additional step now needs to be performed to help the development server start .
This has got added since version 1.2.6 — it looks like that .
Follow the next steps to get this correctly setup .
3 . Select the project you want to run in the Project Hierarchy on left .
Right click it and select Run As –> Run Configurations … as shown below :
4 . This will bring up the Run Configuration as shown below .
Notice the Error message displayed which I have highlighted in Yellow .
5 . So all you need to do is add the VM Argument that they are mentioning .
Simply copy the string starting from - javaagent to the end .
And paste it in the VM Arguments field in the same dialog as shown below :
You will find that the error message will go away .
You can click Run now to execute the Web Application .
The server will be able to start successfully now .
This completes the upgrade of your Google plugin to version 1.2.6 of the SDK .
Upcoming Episode
Make sure that you have version 1.2.6 of the SDK setup as mentioned in this episode .
The next episode coming in a day will show how your Google App Engine applications can receive incoming emails , which is one of the newly enabled features of version 1.2.6 of the SDK .
Till then , happy upgrading !

Machtkonzentration im Internet : Bekanntestes Online - Lexikon leidet an einer starren Hierarchie .
Wikipedia - Schöpfer Jimmy Wales .
Das Projekt Wikipedia begann mit der revolutionären Idee , kostenloses Wissen von allen für alle zugänglich zu machen .
In der Praxis mangelt es der freien Internet - Enzyklopädie aber an demokratischen Strukturen : Die meisten Nutzer sind passive Leser der Artikel , die wenigsten verfassen Texte .
Außerdem entscheidet im Zweifelsfall eine kleine Elite von sogenannten Wikipedia - Bürokraten und - Administratoren über die Inhalte .
Das Projekt krankt an zunehmender Machtkonzentration .
Für sein Drehbuch zum Spielfilm  Bis aufs Blut hat Jung - Regisseur Oliver Kienle aus Rödelsee bei Dettelbach den mit 25 000 Euro dotierten Thomas - Strittmatter - Preis der Medien - und Filmgesellschaft Baden - Württemberg erhalten .
Der Südwestdeutsche Rundfunk und CP
Medien verfilmen das Drehbuch , der Film soll 2010 fertig werden ( wir berichteten ausführlich ) .
Nun wollte Stefanie Lörch , die für das Internet - Marketing des Films zuständig ist , mit einem Wikipedia - Eintrag auf den Film aufmerksam machen .
Der Wikipedia - Administrator  He3nry  machte ihr einen Strich durch die Rechnung .
Er entfernte den Eintrag nach einer intensiven Diskussion unter Wikipedia - Administratoren , an der sich Stefanie Lörch nach eigenen Angaben nicht beteiligen durfte .
Zwei Stunden nach der Erstellung des Artikels wurde er zur Löschung vorgeschlagen .
Grund laut Wikipedia - Administratoren :  Nur Werbung , der Film ist noch nicht fertig , keine Relevanz .
Das sieht Stefanie Lörch anders :  Oliver Kienle hat einen hoch dotierten Drehbuchpreis gewonnen , schon deswegen hat der Artikel Relevanz . 
Es sei gut , dass es die  Wikipedia - Polizei gebe , aber hier hätte sie übers Ziel hinausgeschossen .
Außerdem sei die letzte Version des Artikels laut Lörch bereits derart gekürzt gewesen , dass nur noch die groben inhaltlichen Daten des Films übrig geblieben waren , von PR keine Spur .
Mit der wachsenden gesellschaftlichen Bedeutung von Wikipedia und der Professionalisierung der Kontrolle sind die Anforderungen an neue Artikel stetig gewachsen .
Das bestätigt Michael Diederich aus Filderstadt , der dienstälteste deutsche Wikipedia - Bürokrat :  Der Druck ist höher .
Die meisten Benutzer erwarten perfekt formatierte Artikel .
Vollständig , mit Bildern ausgeschmückt , mit Referenzen und internen Verlinkungen . 
Diederich steht als Wikipedia - Bürokrat in der Hierarchie über den Administratoren und kann nicht nur Artikel löschen , sondern auch Administratorenrechte vergeben .
In Deutschland gibt es lediglich sechs Bürokraten .
Der aktuellen ARD / ZDF - Onlinestudie zufolge nutzen 94 Prozent der 14 - bis 19 - Jährigen Wikipedia .
Allerdings steuern nur vier Prozent der Nutzer selbst Inhalte bei .
In Deutschland gibt es rund 23 000 aktive Autoren ( Stand : August 2009 ) , also Nutzer , die innerhalb von 30 Tagen mindestens einen Artikel bearbeitet haben .
Laut einer Wikipedia - Statistik gibt es aber nur rund 5000 Benutzer mit über 1000 Artikel - Bearbeitungen , also regelmäßig aktive Autoren .
Nach oben wird das Feld immer dünner : Rund 330 Administratoren werden von sechs Bürokraten kontrolliert .
Diese werden in Wahlen bestimmt .
Ist Wikipedia auf dem
Weg zu einer elitären Enzyklopädie , deren I nhalt von wenigen Nutzern bestimmt wird , die ultimative Löschrechte haben ?
Diederich sieht keinen Anlass für derartige Befürchtungen :  Die Bürokraten und Administratoren setzen nur das Ergebnis des Entscheidungsprozesses um , welche Artikel bleiben und welche gelöscht werden sollen .
Die Entscheidungsgewalt bleibt bei den Benutzern .
Der Soziologe Christian Stegbauer kann dem nur im formalen Sinne zustimmen , nicht aber im realen .
Stegbauer ist wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter am Institut für Gesellschafts - und Politikanalyse an der Goethe - Universität in Frankfurt und hat Wikipedia wissenschaftlich untersucht .
 Es gibt definitiv eine Machtkonzentration bei Wikipedia , sagt Stegbauer .
Ein Grund sei auf der organisatorischen Ebene das Wahlverfahren von Administratoren und Bürokraten :  In der Praxis sieht es so aus , dass bei Administratorenwahlen meist nur Vorschläge von bereits amtierenden Administratoren berücksichtigt werden .
Außerdem ist die abgegebene Stimmenanzahl der Administratoren und Bürokraten bei den Wahlen verhältnismäßig viel höher als die von normalen Benutzern , sagt Stegbauer .
Theoretisch sei jeder Wikipedia - Nutzer wahlberechtigt , der seit drei Monaten angemeldet ist und mindestens 200 Artikel - Bearbeitungen vorzuweisen hat .
Diese Bedingungen erfüllten die meisten der angemeldeten Benutzer aber nicht .
 Als Neuer ist es heute fast gar nicht mehr möglich , in die Führungsriege zu kommen , sagt Stegbauer .
Die Machtkonzentration findet auch auf der Artikelebene statt : Während Administratoren und Bürokraten ihre Freizeit für organisatorische Aufgaben opfern , stecken regelmäßig aktive Autoren viel Zeit in die Bearbeitung ihrer Artikel  unentgeltlich , denn Wikipedia wird durch Spenden finanziert .
 Wikipedia - Artikel haben oft eine Art Besitzer , also einen Nutzer , der an der Erstellung und Optimierung des Artikels maßgeblich mitgewirkt hat .
Diese Besitzer schauen ganz genau hin , wenn andere Benutzer etwas in ihrem Artikel verändern .
Sehr oft passt ihnen die Änderung nicht , weswegen sie rückgängig gemacht wird , sagt Stegbauer .
Manchmal mündet das in offenen Streit , bei dem Nutzer , die gegenteiliger Meinung sind , gegenseitig die Artikelversion des anderen überschreiben .
So schreckt das Wikipedia - Establishment neue Autoren ab , was auch erklärt , warum die Mehrheit der Nutzer passiv mitliest .
Die Flexibilität der freien Enzyklopädie ist auf Grund ihrer Machtstrukturen gefährdet .
Gerade den Vorteil , den Wikipedia gegenüber den konventionellen Enzyklopädien hat , droht sie zu verspielen , wenn sie potenzielle Autoren vergrault .
Alexander McQueen 's tall order : Towering 12 - inch boots on Paris catwalk that were NOT made for walking ...
These bizarre shoes would be a tall order for any woman to walk in .
They may be the height of chic , but it ’s unlikely that British designer Alexander McQueen tried out his own creations ahead of their unveiling in Paris last night .
Instead he left it to his models to gingerly make their way along the catwalk in crystal - studded shoe - boots with 12 - inch elevations .
The platform shoes were part of a collection inspired by Charles Darwin ’s The Origin Of The Species .
The height of fashion : Alexander McQueen sent models down the catwalk in 12 - inch - high shoe - boots
But the fantasy fauna inspired fashion did n't end there .
Models with their hair teased into devil - like horns , strutted the catwalk in minidresses decorated with all manner of colourful , elaborate skins .
Ruffled hemlines were frilled to resemble feathers , and vibrant fabrics were printed to resemble amphibian - like breastplates .
The high - tech show set then morphed into a prehistoric underwater scene , lending something of an otherworldly feel .
Animal magic : Alexander McQueen 's spring 2010 collection was inspired by Charles Darwin's Origin of Species
The weird and wonderful mood was heightened by the models ' shaved eyebrows and gills painted on their temples .
Shimmering stud and crystal - embellished designs played on the models ' glossy skin , while elliptical , serpentine jackets made for a graphic contrast to the detailed prints .
The exclusive invite - only catwalk show was intended to be streamed live to an audience of six million last night , but the Showstudio.com website , on which it was due to be shown , crashed thanks to none other than Lady GaGa .
The eccentrically - dressed pop princess , who provided the music for McQueen 's show , had tweeted that her new single , Bad Romance , would be premiered at the show , citing the website as a source from which to hear it .
Fantasy fauna :
The eerie mood was heightened by models ' shaved eyebrows and gills painted on their temples

The show morphed into an underwater theme , with iridescent fabrics and ethereal make up
* Wealthy Palm Beach investor pulled from pool at home
* Madoff case trustee accused him of complicity in fraud ( Adds details , background )
MIAMI , Oct 25 ( Reuters ) - Palm Beach billionaire Jeffry Picower , described as the biggest beneficiary of Bernard Madoff ’s fraud , died on Sunday after he was found lying at the bottom of the pool at his home , police said .
Emergency services were called to the oceanside mansion after Picower , 67 , was pulled from the pool by his wife and a housekeeper and he was later pronounced dead , the Palm Beach Post reported quoting police and Fire Rescue officials .
Police were investigating the death as a drowning , the newspaper said .
It reported he was not breathing when he was pulled from the pool and paramedics worked unsuccessfully for 20 minutes at the scene to try to revive him .
Picower and his wife , Barbara , were friends of Wall Street financier Madoff , who is serving a 150 - year sentence after pleading guilty to running a $ 65 billion Ponzi scheme .
The trustee handling the Madoff fraud case , Irving Picard , said in court documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York late last month that Picower , newly listed as one of the 400 wealthiest Americans by Forbes magazine , was complicit in the fraud .
Part of Picard ’s filing said : “ Based upon the trustee ’s investigation to date , Picower was the biggest beneficiary of Madoff ’s scheme , having withdrawn either directly or through the entities he controlled more than $ 7.2 billion of other investors ’ money . ”
Picower was being sued for the $ 7.2 billion , $ 2 billion more than the trustee in the case demanded in May .
He was listed 371st and worth $ 1 billion on the latest published Forbes list .
Picower started out as an accountant and lawyer and then made money investing in the medical sector .
He and his wife headed a philanthropy , the Picower Foundation .
The foundation closed when the Madoff fraud unraveled last December .
A spokeswoman for the Picowers ’ attorney , William Zabel , has rejected Picard ’s accusations against Picower as “ false and outrageous claims ... based on a misreading of the purported ‘ facts ’ . ”
She said the Picowers initiated discussions to reach a settlement with the trustee , who is winding down Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC .
Picard , who is leading a global search under the Securities Investor Protection
Act to recover money for thousands of defrauded investors , has collected about $ 1.5 billion , but has sued for some $ 15 billion .
The case is Irving H. Picard , trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC v. Jeffry M. Picower 09-01197 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .

Today I received my copy of Beautiful Data , a just - released anthology of articles about , well , working with data .
Lukas and I contributed a chapter on analyzing social perceptions in web data .
See it here .
After a long process of drafting , proofreading , re-drafting , and bothering the publishers under rather sudden deadlines , I ’ve resolved to never use graphics again in anything I write :)
Here ’s our final figure , a k - means clustering of face photos via perceived social attributes ( social concepts / types ? with exemplars ? ) :
I just started reading the rest of the book and it ’s very fun .
Peter Norvig ‘s chapter on language models is gripping .
( It does word segmentation , ciphers , and more , in that lovely python - centric tutorial style extending his previous spell correction article . )
There are also chapters by many other great researchers and practitioners ( some of whom you may have seen around this blog or its neighborhood ) like Andrew Gelman , Hadley Wickham , Michal Migurski , Jeffrey Heer , and still more …
I ’m impressed just by the talent - gathering - and - organizing operation .
Big kudos to editors Toby Segaran and Jeff Hammerbacher , and O’Reilly ’s Julie Steele .
I also have an apparently secret code that gets you a discount , so email me if you want it .
I wonder if I ’m not supposed to give out many of them .
Hm .
I was to steal from my employer , then deliver the goods to his house for his home renovation project .
Since I would get the materials for free , he would be able to purchase them from me at a great discount .
It was , he explained , a win - win situation .

A system that is less expensive than welfare and also less debasing to the poor , it seems to me , should not be objectionable to anybody but hardcore sadists .
When still in high school I entered the dark world of capitalism .
It was my first foray into using money to make more money , rather than using my labour or ideas .
I was a lazy teenager , and I had great expectations for this road to riches .
Extreme wealth was inevitable .
Why not ?
The capitalist system had been making individuals wealthy since the Middle ages .
For my initial business investment of $ 750.00 I reaped exactly nothing in profit .
Never mind profit , I could not even get my initial investment back .
After waiting several long , disappointing days , I swung a new deal .
In the end I settled for a car that I hoped was worth at least the money I was owed .
The car was a well - used 1969 Mustang coupe with faded paint and a motor that sounded like a tractor .
Dreams of a lucrative business venture quashed , I began to make lemonade out of my lemon .
I drove the Mustang for thirteen years , then sold it for $ 750 .
I had salvaged something from my first attempt at commerce , and learned that the world of business was strictly survival of the fittest .
Wealth would have to wait .
My saddest exploration of the underbelly of greed and wealth accumulation occurred when I brushed up against a millionaire in my home town .
He was known to my family and was a respected man about town and at church .
Mr. Money had a huge house complete with indoor swimming pool .
Surely he would take me under his wing and share his secret to wealth .
At the time I was employed in a job I did not like , and looked forward to quitting once the riches began to roll in .
This was Mr. Money 's business plan : Except of course , for my employer , the actual owner of the goods in question .
And my conscience .
I was puzzled .
Why would a man , already swimming in money , propose such a devious , unethical , andplan ?
Then it dawned on me .
This is how capitalism worked .
You get things as cheaply as possible , then sell them for as much as possible .
This millionaire did not steal because he was rich , he was rich because he was willing to steal .
He would doto minimize his output and maximize his bottom line , even if it meant theft .
I filled the trunk of my Mustang and drove off to complete my second business venture .
I finished with a pocket full of cash , but was unable to enjoy it .
My guilt overwhelming , I started serving my sentence immediately .
So much for business venture number two .
" If this is how people get ahead " , I thought to myself , " then I am willing to fall behind .
" Today I am mildly repulsed by the world of business .
There are good business practitioners out there , but throw money into a pit anywhere and you are going to see a fight .
Capitalism will bring out the worst in all involved .
Show me big money and I will show you criminal activity .
Lottery frauds are one small example .
The recent global economic meltdown is another .
The capitalist system is just as bereft of workable solutions as the Soviet system once was .
The best system will be a balanced blend of the two .
In that regard income redistribution would be the best case scenario for both those that do not have enough , and for those who have too much .
Robert Anton Wilson recommended a guaranteed annual income , saying : Where 's the exit ?
I 'm out .
I would rather give things away than sell them .
Commerce makes me feel dirty .
I can hear the little suited guy on my shoulder whispering sweet schemings in my ear .
It does not feel right .
I do n't want to buy , and I do n't want to sell .
I am a failed capitalist .
Ask certain people in the know , and they will tell you that the current gaming market is unsustainable .
It ’s pretty rare that I turn my Sauron eye to the forums for support , but this particular comment about Electronic Arts ’ recent layoffs is the kind of science I like to see laid on people .
It ties together with troubling research I ’ve done on my own end , and while I ’m not on board with the full conclusion , there does seem to be some strong evidence that the gaming industry is stuck in the Death Star trash compactor and ca n’t seem to get 3PO on the communicator .
I honestly have a genuine fear about what the next 3 or 4 years might bring in the gaming marketplace .
Even if there is not dire writing on the wall some troubling graffiti has turned up portending dark days ahead .
The industry has been in a struggle for nearly a decade to monetize their transactions outside of the initial purchase , and instead of making progress the rise of the used market , an unreliable consumer base and the omni-present piracy revenue suck have just made things worse .
So , when Bioware and EA put so many resources into developing a hardcore gamers - game like Dragon Age , and people light pitchforks on fire because of optional DLC , I ca n’t help but feel intensely frustrated at what I see as thin - skinned entitlement and monumental naivete .
I consider many in the angry mob to be friends , and it does not give me pleasure to stand against them .
But , I firmly believe that if you want to keep getting games like Dragon Age , like Fallout 3 , like Uncharted 2 , like The Beatles : Rock Band then gamers are going to need to get on board with or at least stop openly revolting against things like Day - 1 DLC .
I have been watching with trepidation and concern the past 2 years as a conflict of game publishing ideology has erupted between the once mighty Electronic Arts and the laser - focused , unrepentant capitalism of Activision .
And , as EA sheds hundreds of jobs , and more importantly dozens of projects , my worst fears are come true .
The focus on scatter - shot approaches to new IPs and emphasis on driving quality over quantity is great for warming cockles in hearts , but ejaculating dozens of crappy iterations of go - to franchises has tragically triumphed as the profitable way to go .
The only way to sustain that emphasis on gamer - friendly qualities is by making a profit on the releases that do well to off - set the costs of doing business .
Warden ’s Keep is n’t about greedily slurping up the ignorance of gamers .
It ’s about funding the next Mirror ’s Edge .
It ’s about having the resources to take chances on games that gamers love .
Have cake or eat cake .
Sorry , kids , you only get to choose one , and I fear now even that choice may have been taken from our hands .
While we were all squabbling in the corner over meaningless skirmishes about DLC and dedicated servers , the war was waged on another front and it ’s starting to look like we lost .
I hate to be dire , but I ’ve seen 3 years of the Bobby Kotick doctrine , and if that ’s what the future for companies like EA and TakeTwo and THQ is going to be then we ’re going to sit back in a few years and long for the day when we got to whine about Day - 1 DLC in a game like Dragon Age .
Let me describe the future I see .
Subscription based services married with microtransactions .
Hobbled initial releases where the DLC is not just an optional quest , but key game mechanics .
One - time required online authentication that prevents multi-player for used games .
A virtual death of games like Mirror ’s Edge , Dead Space , Ghostbusters , Brutal Legend , Borderlands or Dragon Age .
You 're standing on the Titanic , and you 're complaining about the color of the deck chairs .
If I sound mad , it ’s because I am .
It is an unfocussed rage that simmers and burns , because many of the kinds of games I adore are destined for the dust bin .
And , the reality is that no one is clean in this fight .
Publishers have adopted a model that is proving unsustainable to match the rising cost of development .
Retailers who struggle against thin new - release profit margins have compromised the industry as a whole for their own profit .
Gamers have waged their own zealot war against a changing marketplace , irresponsibly made unreasonable decisions about their entitlements and bent the rules as they see fit to get what they think they ’ve got coming .
Nobody comes out of this smelling like a rose .
As our well - informed forum commenter mentions in his post , the acquisition of Playfish along with the cancellation of mid-range games might as well be EA ’s white flag waved in the breeze .
You recall when Activision let go of Ghostbusters , Brutal Legend and the Chronicles of Riddick remake .
These are exactly the kind of games that major publishers can’t afford to make any more if they can’t find a meaningful way to continue profiting beyond initial sales .
These are exactly the kind of games that EA just ejected .
Let me put it this way , if having Day - one DLC in a game like Dragon Age means that Bioware gets to make the sequel , and not having it means they do n’t , I will happily take the opportunity to make my informed purchasing choice and I will fold my arms and look sternly at those who gripe and complain .
Drawing the line in the sand has consequences , and I ’m not nearly invested enough in the ideology of consumer activism in the gaming marketplace to throw the baby out with the bathwater .
If you want an industry that can take chances .
If you want an industry that can be agile and adaptable to niche demands .
If you want publishers that are willing to explore new IPs and put resources behind projects like Dragon Age , then you , my stubborn and well - intentioned comrades , need to turn down the righteous fury .
Following are excerpts from two interviews with former Egyptian chief of staff Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli , which aired on Al - Jazeera TV on August 17 , 2009 and September 14 , 2009 .
Interviewer :
Why was the [ 1973 war ] " Seam Line " [ at the Suez Canal ] so wide ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : You 'd need a commission like the Agranat Commission to answer a question like that .
I say it was because of Sadat 's shameful interference in running the war .
Interviewer : Do you mean that the political leader interfered in the military matters , and that this was the cause ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : Of course .
Interviewer : Did President Sadat issue orders directly to the commanders of the brigades and the divisions ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : No .
He had the control through [ then defense minister ] Ahmad Isma'il .
But sometimes , he would call the division commanders , and tell them this or that .
That was a very grave mistake .
Interviewer :
And you , as Chief of Staff , had no knowledge of those orders ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : Even if I knew about it – what could I have done ?
One of the greatest mistakes is for a president , who is a political leader , to interfere in the running of military operations .
I 'm not saying that military commanders should ignore the political leaders .
Absolutely not .
But to make things clear – I believe that military commanders should be subordinate to the political leaders , because ultimately , war has to achieve a political goal , and it is one of the means of struggle .
Interviewer : Excuse me , sir , but one of our viewers might say that President Sadat was a military officer as well .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : No .
Interviewer : He was one of the Free Officers , so maybe he had [ military ] opinions , even when holding a political position .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : No. Being one of the Free Officers is one thing , and being a military officer is another thing .
He spent only 2 - 3 years in the Signal Corps , and then he was kicked out of the army .
His military knowledge did not qualify him to be a military commander .
You can say that US President Bush was a military man , because he participated in the world war ...
Interviewer : He was a pilot in World War II .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : But as President , he did not interfere in running the war .
Interviewer : But he was the decision maker .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli :
His job was to define the mission .
[...]
The [ Soviets ] said to us openly , even in the days of Gamal Abd Al - Nasser : " We supply [ arms ] to you so that you can retrieve the land you lost in June 1967 , but the destruction of Israel is where we draw the line . "
Interviewer :
That 's an important point .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : Of course .
Who are we to destroy Israel ?!
There was still a long way to go ...
They could give us weapons , knowing for sure that we were a long way from destroying Israel , which was the red line of the USSR vis -à - vis the US .
Obviously , this could be done only under a different international balance of power .
Interviewer :
If you had destroyed Israel 's military force in the Sinai and the " Seam Line , " this would be tantamount to the destruction of Israel .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : No , no .
Even if we had destroyed their armored brigades , we could not have reached the straits .
We could not reach the straits as long as the Israeli air force was in place .
We did not yet have mobile air defense systems .
There was still a long way to go .
The destruction of Israel is still difficult to accomplish .
The [ Soviets ] helped us only to retrieve our land , and even this – in stages .
[...]
Interviewer :
Do you expect future wars between the Arabs and Israel , or was the October 1973 war the last war , as some people have claimed ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli :
There will definitely be more wars .
This is based on our belief in God , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad .
Interviewer :
So you do not ignore the aspect of faith ...
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : Absolutely not .
Without the aspect of faith , we could not have done a thing .
Without faith , we are nothing .
Like any regular person , faith is the basis for everything .
The words " Allah Akbar " are a central component of victory .
The great thing is that this religious perception is supported by the strategic perception , which says that sooner or later , the Arabs will definitely defeat the Jews , or defeat Israel .
Interviewer : That is the strategic perception ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli :
This is definite .
[...]
Interviewer : How did you feel when the president resigned ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli :
When who resigned ?
Interviewer : President Gamal Abd Al - Nasser .
How did you feel when you heard about it ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli :
It did not last very long .
It is like when people have a crisis when their father dies suddenly , and nobody knows who will replace him .
When he resigned , what did Abd Al - Hakim Amer do ?
Interviewer : He resigned too .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli :
That 's right .
The country became empty .
It was left without a head .
Of course , it was a very worrying time , but it did not last more than a few hours – less than 24 hours ...
Interviewer : Could such a thing happen in countries with [ proper ] institutions ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : Countries with institutions ?
Interviewer : Yes .
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : Of course not .
You can not compare us to countries with institutions .
Interviewer : Why not ?
Sa'd Al - Din Al - Shazli : Because there is a tremendous difference .
All our institutions are artificial .
None of them have been elected .
The ruler is the benefactor of these institutions , and they are loyal to him .
There is no room for comparison .
A regime is either democratic or non-democratic .
There is one system for democratic regimes and another for non-democratic regimes .
For any given human cancer there is , somewhere , a person who possesses immune cells that can kill it efficiently and rapidly .
That , at least , is the theory - and the evidence backing it up is good .
Some people have granulocyte immune cells that are immensely effective at destroying cancer , and those cells and their cancer - killing properties can be safely transferred to other people .
You might recall that the work of Zheng Cui , presented at SENS3 , provided an impressive demonstration of this strategy for dealing with cancer :
Dr. Cui tested the ability of these cells to fight off cancer by transfusing them into normal mice with cancers .
Surprisingly , the simple transfusion of the cancer - fighting immune cells from the resistant mice effectively transfered the same remarkable protection to the normal mice .
And even more excitingly , the treatment did n't just prevent cancers from forming , but actually fought off existing cancer : when researchers transfused the anti-cancer white blood cells into normal mice with existing skin tumors , the tumors regressed completely in a matter of weeks .
Moreover , a single dose of the cancer - fighting immune cells gave the normal animals a cancer immunity that often lasted for the rest of their lives .
At SENS3 , Dr. Cui presented the next logical step in his research : work demonstrating the existence of , and characterizing , high - potency cancer - killing granulocytes in humans .
Dr. Cui's team first went looking for the existence of potent cancer - killing granulocytes in a group of healthy volunteers .
This was done by testing the volunteers ' granulocytes ' ability to destroy cancer cells in a petrie dish .
They found that , unlike in mice ( who seem to have an all - or - nothing effect ) , there appears to be a classical bell - shaped distribution of cancer - killing ability in the granulocytes of people in the population : a few people have white blood cells extremely weak cancer - killing activity , the great majority have an ' average ' competence , and a very small group of outliers have the kind of overwhelming search - and - destroy activity ( at least in a test tube ! ) that is seen in the SR / CR mice .
Since then interest in granulocyte transplant therapies has been growing .
A clinical trial is underway in Florida , for example .
What I wanted to draw your attention to today , however , is the non-profit Livly .
A number of familiar faces are involved , such as John Schloendorn who has worked on bioremediation research for the SENS Foundation 's lysoSENS project .
The folk at Livly are presently involved in advancing the state of the art in granulocyte therapies :
Currently , Livly 's work is focused on using the innate immune system to combat cancer .
This idea was popular in the 80s , but had been abandoned in favor of adaptive immunity ( the now fashionable " cancer vaccines " ) .
Recently , Dr. Zheng Cui of Wake Forest University received much popular press for reviving this idea .
...
Livly 's story began when John ’s friend Chris Heward , President of Kronos Science Labs in Phoenix , AZ , was diagnosed with terminal esophageal cancer in the fall of 2008 .
Doctors gave him no chance of surviving the year , even with the best available standard of care .
So he decided to forego the so - called " palliative " chemotherapy treatment and give this leukocyte transfer idea a shot .
Kronos worked with Wake Forest to begins screening a large number of healthy individuals for innate cancer - killing activity .
However , the cancer progressed far too rapidly .
Chris died in early 2009 , before the group was able to have a leukocyte transfusion ready .
Eri and John founded Livly in order to take a more direct role in fighting cancer .
After determining that thier work would contribute to the field , they could not turn their backs on this mission while only waiting , watching and hoping that other loved ones would not also be victims of cancer .
The next phase of cell transplant therapies is to do away with the need for a foreign source of cells by understanding how and why such a transplant achieves its goal .
In this case , a plausible future involves altering some of the patient 's own immune cells to have the cancer - killing ability found in only a few people , then culturing a large quantity of them , and returning them to the body .
Another option is some form of drug that alters the behavior of the patient 's existing granulocytes , thus removing the need for any transplant .
On May 12 , 2009 , the ACLU and the Public Patent Office submitted a brief to the Southern District Court of New York .
The legal action involved twenty plaintiffs , including organizations like the Association for Molecular Pathology along with medical doctors and private individuals .
They all had one goal in mind — to invalidate the claim of a Utah - based company over genes that affect the fate of every woman in America .
The company in question , Myriad Genetics , owns the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer .
They also own the only currently available diagnostic test for these genes , which they sell for a little over three thousand dollars .
And they control the right to allow testing and experimentation on these genes .
It is no exaggeration to say that Myriad controls every facet of those genes .
As a result , many women have been unable to get vital health information , and scientists have been unable to perform important research without paying large sums of money to Myriad .
According to a statement issued by the ACLU , they and the Public Patent office have stepped in to challenge Myriad because “ Gene patents undermine the free exchange of information and scientific freedom , bodily integrity and women ’s health . ”
The statement further claims that the granting of gene patents “ interferes with a person ’s right to know about his or her own genetic makeup . ”
They ’ve set loose a team of legal experts to attack the validity of the patents on BRCA1 and 2 .
In their brief , they claim that the patents violate the First Amendment and Article 1 , Section 8 , Clause 8 , of the Constitution — the section that provides for the creation of patents .
Because the ACLU claims that the patents violate constitutional law it is likely that the case will end up in front of the Supreme Court .
If that happens , the decision could have consequences that reach far beyond the individual case .
According to Luigi Palombi , Project Director of the Genetic Sequence Right Project and author of the book Gene Cartels : Biotech Patents in the Age of Free Trade , “ If this case makes it to the U.S. Supreme Court …
I am confident that the Supreme Court will rule that these patents [ gene patents in general ] … will be confirmed as non-patentable subject matter . ”
He cautions , however , that the case against Myriad may not make it all the way to the Supreme Court .
In a similar case prosecuted by Palombi in Australia against Chiron over their patent on hepatitis C genes , Chiron settled out of court once they realized that if they lost it might threaten their chances of getting a patent in America .
The case abandoned , the question of the patent ’s validity was left unanswered .
While it is uncertain whether Myriad will try to settle , Daniel Ravicher , a lawyer representing the plaintiffs , has said that they would be willing to settle if they get everything they want .
Myriad certainly does n’t look , as yet , like they ’re backing down and looking for an out - of - court settlement .
The company has thrown its first punch by bringing a motion to dismiss the case on the basis that there is no controversy and that the plaintiffs lack standing .
Myriad told h+ that it does n’t comment on ongoing litigation .
Palombi noted that while the patents themselves may be invalidated , the patent of any invention derived from them will still be valid , so Myriad will still own the patent on the BRACAnalysis® test .
So what would an ACLU victory mean ?
Advocates believe that researchers will be free to develop and market other tests , bringing competition and driving down costs .
It would also mean researchers could spend more money on research , since they would no longer have to pay Myriad .
And life - saving treatment may be developed more quickly for thousands of women .
Beyond that , it could close the door on more gene patents , if not invalidating all previous patents and opening up legal debate about the limits of patents and intellectual property .
… the case against Myriad opens the door for some serious legal questions about intellectual property and patentability .
Companies involved in this type of patenting take a different view .
They say that a favorable verdict could do more harm than good .
Large companies claim that they need gene patents to provide incentive to perform research and make such exploration possible .
They also point to several studies conducted on intellectual property that state that so called “ patent thickets ” do not hinder competition or impede research .
Regardless of the results , the case against Myriad opens the door for some serious legal questions about intellectual property and patentability .
It will answer the question of whether or not it is legal to patent a gene .
You might say that the Supreme Court could decide just who owns you .
One of the awkward aspects of modern physics is that its two most successful fields , relativity and quantum mechanics , are fundamentally incompatible , as things happen in the quantum world that relativity says should not be possible .
That 's left physicists looking for a way to harmonize the two , with two primary contenders : string theories , and quantum gravity theories .
Testing either of them has been a bit challenging , but researchers have now managed to use a single , intensely powerful photon detected by the Fermi Telescope to significantly limit the number of viable quantum gravity theories .
The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has only been operational for about a year , but results from its observation have already been appearing in a number of significant publications .
The observatory is designed to detect the highest energy radiation , which is only produced by the most energetic events in the universe , such as supernovae .
In this case , the key observation was of a single photon produced by the gamma-ray burst GRB 090510 , which came in at an extremely energetic 31GeV .
That photon allowed researchers to test some forms of quantum gravity against the predictions of relativity .
According to relativity , the speed of light obeys Lorentz Invariance : it 's the same for all observers and all energies of light .
Some theories of quantum gravity , however , suggest that Lorentz Invariance may break down near the Planck length , 1.62 x 10 - 33 cm , causing high - energy photons to travel at different speeds than their low - energy peers .
Unfortunately , the effects are small , meaning you need something very high energy that 's travelled for a very long distance before you could detect them .
That 's why this gamma ray burst turned out to be so useful .
GRB 090510 was found to have a redshift of z=0.9 , which places it about 10 percent of the way across the observed universe , which gives it the sort of distance required .
The 31GeV gamma ray has the sort of energy needed to see a difference between it and some of the lower - energy photons detected at the same time , and the event was short - lived , with most of the high - energy photons arriving within a single second of each other .
If high energy photons moved at a different speed , we should be able to detect it .
We do n't .
There 's a degree of imprecision when it comes to the time window in which the high - energy photons arrive , and the authors spend most of the paper considering different scenarios , like the probability that high - energy photons might be generated earlier than their low - energy peers ( the authors ' conclusion : this seems very unlikely ) .
In the end , they conclude that if there is a quantum influence on the speed of light , it can only operate at distances of less than 1.2 times the Planck length .
A value this close to the Planck length means that quantum gravity models in which there 's a linear relationship between photon energy and speed are " highly implausible . "
That leaves other quantum gravity options open , including those in which the the relationship is non-linear .
Hopefully , theoreticians will be able to devise real - world tests for some of these .
Of course , it remains possible that some of the timing assumptions made by the authors are wrong .
Fortunately , it looks like we may have other opportunities to test things at much greater distances .
The same issue of Nature contains two papers that describe another gamma-ray burst , GRB 090423 , which was detected earlier this year .
Preliminary results suggested that it was the most distant item of this sort ever detected , and the papers confirm this : z = 8.2 , which corresponds to an origin at the time when the Universe was only 630 million years old .
The discovery suggests that massive stars were being born and exploding in very short order after the birth of the universe .
The similarity of the burst with more modern ones suggests that , on some levels , the early universe was n't entirely different from its current state .
It also raises the prospect that we can use further bursts of this age to study the Cosmic Dark Ages , when the gasses that make up much of the visible matter of the universe had cooled enough to form neutral atoms , absorbing much of the light .
This period ended as the first stars started re-ionizing these atoms , allowing light to propagate across the Universe .
This era started at about 800 million years post - big bang , so GRB 090423 may provide a window into the era .

" They can ramp up their defence rapidly , and then resume routine behaviour quickly after an intruder has been stopped .
We were trying to achieve that same framework in a computer system . "
The human brain is surprisingly bloody .
I 've worked in neuroscience labs , and I 'm used to seeing brains that are stored in glass jars filled with formaldehyde , the preserved tissue a lifeless gray .
But this brain — removed from a warm body just a few hours ago — looks bruised , its folds stained purple .
Blood drips from the severed stem , forming puddles on the stainless steel table .

I'm in the dissection room of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle , and the scientist next to me is in a hurry :
His specimen — this fragile cortex — is falling apart .
Dying , the gray matter turns acidic and begins to eat away at itself ; nucleic acids unravel , cell membranes dissolve .
He takes a thin , sterilized knife and slices into the tissue with disconcerting ease .
I 'm reminded of Jell - O and guillotines and the meat counter at the supermarket .
He saws repeatedly until the brain is reduced to a series of thin slabs , which are then photographed and rushed to a freezer .
All that remains is a pool of blood , like the scene of a crime .
Behind all the gore there 's a profound purpose :
The scientists here are mapping the brain .
And while conventional brain maps describe distinct anatomical areas , like the frontal lobes and the hippocampus — many of which were first outlined in the 19th century — the Allen Brain Atlas seeks to describe the cortex at the level of specific genes and individual neurons .
Slices of tissue containing billions of brain cells will be analyzed to see which snippets of DNA are turned on in each cell .
If the institute succeeds , its maps will help scientists decipher the function of the thousands of genes that help produce the human brain .
( Although the Human Genome Project was completed more than five years ago , scientists still have little idea which genes are used to make the brain , let alone where in the brain they are expressed . )
For the first time , it will be possible to understand how such a complex object is assembled from a basic four - letter code .
" The maps of the brain we currently have are like those antique maps people used to draw of the New World , " says Allan Jones , chief scientific officer at the Allen Institute .
" We can see the crude outlines of the structure , but we have no idea what 's happening on the inside . "
Jones is in charge of making sure the atlas gets finished .
He wears starched button - up shirts and crisply pleated khakis , and he looks like the kind of guy who has a drawer full of bow ties .
" Studying the brain now is like trying to navigate a vast city without any driving instructions , " he says .
" You do n't know where you are , and you have no idea how to find what you 're looking for . "
For more from FORA.tv , visit wired.com / video Author Jonah Lehrer spoke at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club on February 19 , 2009 about the black box of the human mind .
When the project is completed in 2012 , at an expected cost of $ 55 million , its data sets will list the roughly 20,000 genes that , switched on in the exact right place at the exact right time , give rise to this self - aware tangle of neurons .
And because the vast majority of mental illnesses and disorders , from schizophrenia to autism , have a significant genetic component , scientists at the institute hope that the atlas will eventually lead to new methods of diagnosis and more effective medical treatments .
To map the brain is to map its afflictions .
This enterprise is unique in one other respect : scale .
" People ask me why we did n't start with a more modest goal , like trying to map some small brain area , " Jones says .
" The point of doing the whole brain , though , is that it allows us to really develop theories about how the brain works .
Sometimes , the only way to make sense of a complex system is to be systematic . "
To achieve this , the Allen Institute reimagined the scientific process .
There was no grand hypothesis , or even a semblance of theory .
The researchers just wanted the data , and , given the amount needed , it quickly became apparent that the work could n't be done by hand .
So , shortly after the institute was founded in 2003 , Jones and his team started thinking about how to industrialize the experimental process .
While modern science remains , for the most part , a field of artisans — scientists performing their own experiments at their own benches — the atlas required a high - throughput model , in which everything would be done on an efficient assembly line .
Thanks to a team of new laboratory robots , what would have taken a thousand technicians several years can now be accomplished in less than 20 months .
The institute can produce more than a terabyte of data per day .
( In comparison , the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome can fit in a text file that 's only 3 gigabytes . )
And the project is just getting started .
Preparing a fresh specimen for analysis .

In March 2002 , Paul Allen — cofounder of Microsoft and 41st - richest person in the world — brought together a dozen neuroscientists for a three - day meeting aboard his 300 - foot yacht , Tatoosh , which was anchored in Nassau , Bahamas .
At the time , Allen 's philanthropic work consisted of an eclectic ( some say frivolous ) set of endeavors .
There was the Experience Music Project in Seattle , a rock - and - roll museum designed by Frank Gehry ; the Allen Telescope Array , 350 radio telescopes dedicated to deep - space observation and the search for extraterrestrial life ; and SpaceShipOne , the first privately funded plane developed to put a human in space .
But Allen was eager to start something new : a project involving neuroscience .
He was excited by the sheer uncharted mystery of the mind — one of the last , great scientific frontiers — hoping a single large - scale endeavor could transform the field .
" I first got interested in the brain through computers , " Allen says .
" There 's a long history of artificial intelligence programs that try to mimic what the brain is doing , but they 've all fallen short .
Here 's this incredible computer , a really astonishing piece of engineering , and we have no idea how it works . "
Over several days , Allen asked the neuroscientists to imagine a way to move their field forward dramatically .
" I wanted them to think big , " he says .
" Like the Human Genome Project , only for the brain . "
Some advocated focusing on a single disease , like Alzheimer's .
Others argued for more investment in brain imaging technology .
But a consensus emerged that what neuroscience most needed was a map , a vast atlas of gene expression that would reconcile the field 's disparate experimental approaches .
It 's not that scientists do n't know a lot about the brain — it 's that they have no idea how it all fits together .
Today , you can measure the electrical activity of individual neurons , which involves plunging a microelectrode into the tissue and hoping to find an interesting cell .
You can image the brain in an fMRI machine and isolate the areas that are active during certain types of mental activity .
Or you can use the tools of molecular biology and study specific kinase enzymes , synaptic proteins , or RNA splices .
The problem with this multiplicity of techniques is that they fail to explain how the brain 's essential elements — the wet stuff , the genetic text , the electric loom of cells — conspire to create a sentient piece of matter .
Allen decided that what neuroscience needed was a tool to help get beyond these obsolete boundaries .
" It became apparent to me that there were lots of scientists studying their own little area of brain , pursuing these very specific questions , " he says .
" But I wanted to develop something that would focus on making these crosscutting connections , so that everybody in the field could benefit . "
Say , for instance , someone is investigating the anatomy of autism .
The scientist has done an fMRI study that reveals abnormalities in a cortical area in autistic subjects — a bit of brain is not functioning properly — and this might help explain the symptoms of the disease .
But now what ?
The problem has been isolated , but at a very abstract level .
The research has hit a dead end .
Meanwhile , another scientist is looking at autism from a very different perspective , conducting large - scale genetic studies that identify a few of the fragments of DNA associated with the disease .
( Autism is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders . )
The problem with these efforts is that they often highlight obscure genes that have n't been studied .
Nobody knows what these genes do , or whether they 're even expressed in the brain .
As a result , the research stalls and it remains completely unclear how this genetic defect might lead to the particular problems seen in the fMRIs .
But now imagine that this scientist has access to the Allen atlas .
By looking at the map , he should be able to quickly see whether any of the genes known to be associated with autism — several have already been identified — are expressed in the brain areas that appear abnormal in the fMRI scans .
This means that the disease can be pinpointed at a very precise level , reduced to a few dysfunctional circuits expressing the wrong set of genes .
" That 's what having a huge database lets you do , " Allen says .
" It becomes a tool that will really accelerate the pace of research . "
Such a map can also help neuroscientists better target their genetic searches .
Instead of looking at every gene expressed in the brain — according to the institute 's research , that may include nearly 80 percent of the human genome — they can focus only on those that are present in the relevant brain areas .
Then there 's the mystery of the developing brain .
How does something so complex manage to build itself ?
The Allen Institute is also measuring genetic expression in the mouse brain , from embryo to adult , to explore how the orchestra of genes is switched on and off in different areas during development .
Which snippets of DNA transform the hippocampus into a center of long - term memory ?
Which make the amygdala a warehouse of fear and anxiety ?
" One of the things I 've come to appreciate about the brain is the importance of location , " Allen says .
" It 's not just a set of interchangeable parts that you can swap in and out .
These brain areas are all so distinct , and for reasons we can finally begin to understand . "
Industrial - Strength Science
To create a complete genetic map of the brain , scientists at the Allen Institute had to invent a high - throughput system that can process tissue and data on an unprecedented scale .
Traditional methods would have taken decades , but by using assembly - line robots and new protocols , they expect to finish the human brain atlas in four years .
Here 's how it 's done .
1 ) As soon as the institute receives a fresh human brain — fewer than 15 specimens will ultimately be used to create the atlas — it 's immediately hand - sliced into 5 - mm slabs , which are frozen .
2 ) Using a machine called a microtome , technicians shave each slab into thousands of transparent slices only a few microns thick .
These are mounted on 2 x 3 - inch barcoded glass slides .
3 ) In a process called in situ hybridization , specialized robots work round the clock using fragments of RNA to probe each sample for a particular gene , which is stained with colored dye .
4 ) Robotic microscopes equipped with high - speed loaders take digital photographs of each slide .
The intensity of dye color is used to quantify the amount of gene expression in the tissue .
5 ) The complete atlas , correlated by both gene and location , is stored on the institute 's servers .
Powerful tools to explore the data will be available for free to all researchers at brain - map.org .
There 's something ironic about Allen , cofounder of a software empire , funding an exhaustive atlas of our neural hardware .
( He established the institute with a donation of $ 100 million . )
For decades , many cognitive scientists insisted that the physical brain was largely irrelevant to the study of the mind .
It did n't matter whether the human operating system was running on a real cortex or a set of silicon microchips — the software was everything .
Given Allen 's background — this was the man who helped develop MS - DOS 1.0 , after all — he might have been expected to ally with the software crowd in the belief that the 1s and 0s were more important than the anatomical details .
Instead ,
Allen decided that our operating system could run only on one very particular kind of computer .
" There are so many intricacies to our brain that wo n't be understood unless we start to look at the system as a whole , " he says .
" All these different details do n't operate in isolation .
But how do they work together to create such a powerful machine ? "
The cavernous and antiseptic main lab on the second floor of the Allen Institute is dominated by five big black boxes , each the size of a Smart Car .
These are robots , specially constructed by lab - automation company Tecan .
At the center of each is a glass window , through which all the action can be observed : A metal arm equipped with a series of long plastic pipettes moves endlessly back and forth , squirting a variety of liquids onto slices of brain .
The accompanying mechanical noises — a comforting chorus of squeaks , clanks , and beeps — sound like the androids from WALL-E .
At the moment , each robot is processing 192 brain slices per day , allowing the lab to analyze nearly a thousand every 24 hours .
( Other bots perform more specialized tasks , like delicately adding glass covers to the tissue samples . )
They work through the night , continuing to do science while their human counterparts sleep .
Before a single brain was dissected , back when the atlas was still purely hypothetical , Allan Jones realized that the most difficult challenges would n't be scientific .
All the necessary tools were available , and there were no theoretical obstacles .
Instead , Jones worried about the seemingly infinite amount of data required .
" There really was no model for this type of project , " he says .
" There was no earlier map that we were trying to improve or update .
And the reason there was n't another map was because it did n't seem possible . "
What the institute needed was someone who could translate its epic ambition into an efficient production process , in which thousands of brain slices would be collected and assessed every day .
This led Jones to hire Paul Wohnoutka , a former Boeing engineer with decades of experience managing complex manufacturing systems .
( " I thought a commercial airliner was the most challenging thing I 'd help build , " he says .
" I was wrong . " )
Wohnoutka has an earnest Midwestern demeanor ; his speech quickens with excitement when he starts describing the details of his assembly line , like the colored barcodes used to classify microscope slides .
His first priority was to standardize everything so that each slice was put through the exact same process , which he detailed in thick binders filled with instructions .
" Scientists are used to working by themselves , so they can get pretty suspicious when you start talking about industrialization , " Wohnoutka says .
" But all we 're really doing here is applying some basic principles that manufacturing companies learned decades ago .
It only seems strange because we 're making science , not widgets . "
In biology , most experiments are done in small batches by postdocs and grad students .
That would never work here .
Just consider the technical difficulty of mapping the entire brain : Each organ must be cut into thin slices that are measured in microns .
These slices — several thousand per brain — are then immersed in a concentrated RNA solution to probe for a specific gene .
The basic idea is that the RNA will bind to its complement in the brain cells .
( This is made possible by the interwoven nature of the double helix , with one strand automatically attaching to the other . )
The tissue is then washed with a series of antibodies and chemicals that attach to the RNA , causing the molecule to become visible .
In the Allen Brain Atlas protocol , the cells containing the RNA are stained a washed - out violet , the color of spilled wine , with higher levels of gene expression leading to darker shades .
This experimental method is known as in situ hybridization , and it has been a staple of bench science for nearly 40 years .
But doing it on this scale is utterly without precedent , possible only because the institute perfected its high - throughput protocol .
There are no robots on the first floor of the Allen Institute .
Instead , it 's dominated by a surprisingly antiquated piece of furniture .
It looks , at first glance , like the card catalog for a vast library — large cabinets with hundreds of small , meticulously labeled drawers .
Opening one triggers a clattering of glass , the shifting of microscope slides .
Each slide is blank except for what appears to be a greasy fingerprint in the center .
Not until it 's held up to the light does the content become clear :
The smudge is actually a sagittal slice of mouse brain .
These slides — there are more than 250,000 — provided the raw data for the mouse brain atlas , the first neural map constructed by the institute .
While the mouse atlas is sometimes described as a mere precursor to the human version — a way to perfect the protocols and show that the robots were ready — it 's actually been an invaluable resource for gaining insight into the human brain .
After all , natural selection is an inveterate tinkerer , and every animal brain is made out of the same basic shopping list of used biological parts .
" It might be disconcerting for some people to think about how much our brain has in common with the brains of rodents , " Jones says , " but that 's just how it is . "
Traditional methods would have taken decades , but by using assembly - line robots and new protocols , the Allen Institute expects to finish the human brain atlas in four years .

The mice were exquisitely standardized : Only 56 - day - old males of the C57BL / 6J strain were used .
To keep track of all the samples , the glass slides were labeled with unique barcodes identifying where in the brain they came from and which genes they were being tested for .
When scientists want to check a specific slide , they simply whip out a handheld barcode reader and all the relevant information instantly appears on a computer screen .
If it were n't for this data - management system , designed by Wohnoutka , the institute would be utterly overwhelmed by its own experimental results .
" The barcodes are just our version of the lab notebook , " Wohnoutka says .
" When you have a million - plus samples , you simply can't write stuff out by hand . "
Once the in situ hybridization protocols were tweaked for the Tecan robots , the gene mapping was relatively straightforward .
The mouse atlas project soon became a matter of efficient repetition , as the factory floor churned out more than 1,000 slices of mouse brain every 24 hours .
But the flood of data exceeded the ability of scientists to analyze it .
Glass slides started to gather in neglected piles ; there were too many mouse brains and not enough microscopes to study them .
" We quickly realized that you can't industrialize just one part of the system , " Jones says .
" You have to industrialize everything , or else you 'll be stuck with all this information that you can't understand . "
So the next challenge was finding a way to digitally photograph every slide .
Given the output of the lab , it was obvious that robotic microscopes would be required .
Unfortunately , no such technology existed , which meant that the institute had to build its own .
The researchers rigged 10 Leica 600B microscopes with glass - slide loaders , barcode readers , and small computers running image - analysis software .
The machines are mesmerizing to watch — the lenses constantly zoom in and out like metal eyes .
Every two seconds , a new snapshot of a stained brain slice enters the atlas .
To date , these microscopes have taken more than 85 million photographs .
The data then travels downstairs to the massive computer room , where rows of hard drives and CPUs are stacked in metal racks connected by thick tangles of black wires , like nerve fibers .
Two 20 - ton air conditioners make the space sound like a wind tunnel .
( When the AC briefly failed last year , the room went from 68 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit in less than 20 minutes . )
Once an image enters the cluster , an algorithm quantifies billions of individual neurons and translates them into a statistical " heat map " of gene expression .
This is the heart of the project , the part that turns the data into something that actually looks like an atlas .
Michael Hawrylycz , director of informatics at the institute , helped design the software .
Although colleagues often tease Hawrylycz for being absentminded and messy — the day I met him , he was wearing his T - shirt inside out and his office was a labyrinth of piles — his innovations have allowed the atlas project to classify and categorize the astonishing amount of data .
" I make sure scientists can find what they 're looking for , " he said , before trying in vain to find a scientific paper that was lost somewhere on his desk .
At first , Hawrylycz and others assumed that the most common search would be anatomical — in other words , that scientists would use the atlas to see which genes were expressed in a particular brain area , like the hippocampus .
However , the unexpected complexity of the brain meant that such broad searches returned way too much information ; the old boundaries were suddenly useless .
This led Hawrylycz and his team to invent a new set of search tools .
First , they divided the mouse brain into 53,000 voxels , or microscopic cubes .
This enabled scientists to quickly figure out the most important genes in that bit of brain , since they could see which were most highly expressed .
They could also compare the gene expression patterns of various voxels to one another .
Do you want to know what other brain area most resembles a particular circuit of layer - 5 neurons in the left cerebral cortex ?
Just click on the circuit and a colorful map is superimposed on the mouse brain .
The dark red areas represent voxels that are similar , while navy blue signifies an area expressing a very different set of genes .
( Imagine if Google Maps let you compare any street in Seattle with every other street in every other city in the world for thousands of variables and you can begin to understand the power of such a tool . )
" We call it an ' unbiased ' spatial search , because it allows you to look past these old anatomical maps and pull out all sorts of unexpected correlations , " Hawrylycz says .
" The goal is to let people make their own maps . "
This means that once the human atlas is complete , a scientist studying autism or Alzheimer 's or human intelligence will be able to quickly generate a snapshot of the brain that reflects the specific genes they 're interested in .
In January 2007 , after four years of high - throughput experiments and painstaking programming ( and a cost of $ 45 million ) , the institute published a Nature paper describing the methods and results of the mouse atlas .
( When the project was completed on time and under budget , the British medical journal The Lancet compared Allen 's venture with his former Microsoft partner 's plan to cure malaria :
The headline read " paul allen 1 , bill gates 0 . " )
The entire database was made available for free online at brain - map.org .
" The atlas has become an essential tool for the field very quickly , " says Susumu Tonegawa , a Nobel laureate and professor of neuroscience at MIT .
He relies on the maps when creating " knockout " strains of mice — rodents that are missing a specific set of neural genes .
" These are animals that at first appear normal , " Tonegawa says , " but when you look closer you notice that they have deficits in learning and memory depending on what you have interfered with . "
By determining where each of these deleted genes is expressed in the mouse atlas , Tonegawa can quickly identify the circuit of cells he erased , which shows him exactly which parts of the brain were affected by the genetic mutation .
" I can see what is broken , " he says , " and that lets me understand how it works . "
One unexpected — even disheartening — aspect of the Allen Institute 's effort is that although its scientists have barely begun their work , early data sets have already demonstrated that the flesh in our head is far more complicated than anyone previously imagined .
The brain might look homogenous to the naked eye , but it 's actually filled with an array of cell types , each of which expresses a distinct set of genes depending on its precise location .
Consider the neocortex , the so - called CPU of the brain : Scientists assumed for decades that most cortical circuits were essentially the same — the brain was supposed to rely on a standard set of microchips , like a typical supercomputer .
But the atlas has revealed a startling genetic diversity ; different slabs of cortex are defined by entirely different sets of genes .
The supercomputer analogy needs to be permanently retired .
Or look at the hippocampus , the crescent - shaped center of long - term memory .
Until recently , this small fold of tissue in the middle of the brain was depicted as neatly divided into four distinct areas .
But data from the atlas has rendered the old maps not only obsolete but flat - out misleading .
Even a single hippocampal area can actually be subdivided into at least nine discrete regions , each with its own genetic makeup .
Scientists at the institute are just starting to grapple with the seemingly infinite regress of the brain , in which every new level of detail reveals yet another level .
" You can't help but be intimidated by the complexity of it all , " Jones says .
" Just when you think you 're getting a handle on it , you realize that you have n't even scratched the surface . "
This is the bleak part of working at the Allen Institute :
What you mostly discover is that the mind remains an immense mystery .
We do n't even know what we do n't know .
But Jones and others are n't ready to surrender .
They remain excited by the idea of working on the frontier of science , by the possibility that their maps will allow others to make sense of this still inscrutable landscape .
In other words , they are waiting for the future , for some scientist to invent an elegant theory that explains their enigmatic data .
Jones likes to compare the current state of neuroscience to 19th - century chemistry .
At the time , chemists were strict empiricists ; they set substances on fire and then recorded the colors visible in the flames .
Different chemicals produced different spectrums of light , but nobody could make sense of the spectrums .
The data seemed completely random .
But then , with the discovery of quantum mechanics , scientists were finally able to explain the colored light — the unique rainbows were actually side effects of subatomic structure .
Such is the faith of scientists : Nature must always make sense .
" The reason for the dust is we had some really strong winds in the inland areas of NSW and in South Australia for a sustained period yesterday , " she said .
" That 's lifted a whole lot of dust off the ground because it 's quite dry out there , many of those areas are still drought affected . "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MULTIMEDIA : Dramatic photos of Sydney cloaked in red haze
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lifted dust had been carried by the winds into Sydney .
" I 've not seen anything like this before , " Ms Golding said .
The reddish haze was expected to fade as the sun got higher in the sky , Ms Golding said .
The haze had turned from a crimson red to orange by about 7 am , and then faded to yellow by about 7.30 am .
But it was not known what would happen to the dust .
" This is such an infrequent event ... it 's hard to say when the dust will stop . "
It 's just red , red , red as far as you can see
The dust has caused havoc with the city 's transport system this morning , with visibility on the roads reduced to just a few hundred metres in some places .
All citybound lanes on the M5 East tunnel were closed earlier this morning because of dust in the tunnel .
The RTA also urged drivers across the state to exercise caution and reduce speed due to " significant dust over the city affecting visibility " .
International and domestic flights at Sydney Airport were delayed as a result of the " strong winds and dust haze " , a spokesman said .
A number of incoming international flights had been diverted to Melbourne and Brisbane , although some flights had managed to land in Sydney , he said .
While delays were expected throughout the day , the airport was not closed , contrary to some reports , he said .
Sydney 's ferries were also suspended due to poor visibility on harbour .
Emergency services had also been stretched by the conditions .
The Ambulance Service said it had experienced an increase in calls from asthma sufferers as a result of the dust haze this morning .
Some were taken to hospital , a spokeswoman said .
The Fire Brigade received over 500 calls between 3 am and 7 am , triggered by automatic fire alarms .
It normally received only 30 a day in that time period .
" This is one for the books , " a spokesman said .
" A lot of fire alarms are particle - type alarms and the dust gets in and sets them off .
" We are flat strap at the moment ... there 's going to be a high flow of fire brigade traffic through the metropolitan area today . "
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning across the state because of widespread damaging winds , which are expected to increase in force across Sydney this morning .
" It 's been close to 60 km / h already this morning ... it 's just a matter of time before it gets stronger , " Ms Golding said .
Wind speeds this morning were expected to average over 65 km / h , but there would be gusts in excess of 100 km/h , the Bureau said .
The winds would gradually ease over the afternoon and evening , Ms Golding said .
The winds were being whipped up by a cold front that passed through the state yesterday , and a deep low pressure trough over Victoria .
Temperatures this morning in the low 20s , and were expected to remain that way for the rest of the day , Ms Golding said .
Last night , large hailstones fell in parts of Goulburn and Wagga , while wind gusts exceeded 90 km / h , the Bureau said .
A 109 km /h gust was reported at Moss Vale , it said .
The State Emergency Service of NSW received about 175 calls for help from residents of Crookwell , near Goulburn , as a result of fallen trees and damaged roofs , a spokeswoman said .
Despite the sun rising at 5.43 am , the city was still a dark orange haze at 7 am this morning .
Many residents took to social networking sites , with Sydney one of the top 10 topics on Twitter this morning .
Loading Public schools across the state were open , an Education Department spokesman said .
" But given the circumstances if parents are concerned about the effects of the high levels of dust in the air and if their children suffer from asthma or other breathing problems then they can keep their children at home , " he said .

US draft legislation is being re-visited to take account of coal interests
The US will announce a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions before next month 's UN climate summit , according to a White House official .
The target is expected to be in line with figures contained in legislation before the Senate - a reduction of about 17 - 20 % from 2005 levels by 2020 .
The absence of a US target has widely been seen as the single biggest obstacle to agreement at the summit .
President Barack Obama has not yet decided whether to attend the talks .
At the weekend , the hosts of the Copenhagen conference announced that more than 60 heads of state and government had pledged to take part in the two - week negotiating session .
Hopefully , the negotiations will see everyone coming up with more ambitious targets - otherwise there 's no point in going to Copenhagen
Saleemul Huq , IIED
What 's your Copenhagen solution ?
Mr Obama will join them if it appears that his presence would increase chances of the 192 parties reaching agreement , the official indicated .
" There 's been recognition that if we want to keep momentum going , numbers have to be put on the table , " said Peter Bahouth , executive director of the US Climate Action Network , a network of organisations lobbying for action on the issue .
" There 's been pressure for the US to come ( to Copenhagen ) with its hands full rather than empty , and I think what we 're seeing are the results of that . "
In the last week , Mr Obama has discussed climate change with a number of other world leaders including Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , President Hu Jintao of China and Japan 's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama .
Domestic delays Although Mr Obama campaigned on a promise to cut emissions , and pledged global leadership on climate change on assuming office , the US position has been constrained by delays in putting legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions through Congress .
COPENHAGEN SUMMIT
Planning to attend : Leaders of Britain , Germany , France , Spain , Australia , Japan , Indonesia and Brazil Yet to commit : Leaders of the United States , China and India
Where countries stand on summit Climate : A defining issue Send us your comments
The House of Representatives passed a bill in June that would cap emissions and establish a national carbon trading scheme .
But progress of a similar bill through the Senate is not likely before March at the earliest .
Administration officials have indicated that the targets are being discussed with senior senators in an attempt to ensure that the Senate will back whatever target Mr Obama takes to Copenhagen .
It is not clear when the target will emerge , but there are now less than two weeks before the summit opens on 7 December .
There will also be pressure internationally for the US to say how much money it is prepared to transfer to poorer countries to help them fight climate change , as it is bound to do under the UN climate convention .
Cutting edge
In the UN climate process , targets are conventionally given in comparison with 1990 levels of emissions .
On that basis , the likely US figure amounts to a cut of just a few percent , as emissions have risen by about 15 % since 1990 .
This is much less than the EU 's pledge of a 20 % cut over the same period , or a 30 % cut if there is a global deal ; and much less than the 25 - 40 % figure that developing countries are demanding .
CLIMATE CHANGE GLOSSARY
Glossary in full EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said at the weekend that the EU should pledge 30 % now as a way of showing commitment .
But Saleemul Huq , a climate change specialist with the International Institute for Environment and Development ( IIED ) who works closely with a number of developing country governments , suggested the target would be well received as a worthy first step .
" I think it 's an extremely good signal that the Obama administration is willing to put a target forward and not wait for Congress , " he told BBC News .
" The targets that everyone is taking to Copenhagen are the bases for negotiation ; and hopefully , the negotiations will see everyone coming up with more ambitious targets - otherwise there 's no point in going to Copenhagen , we could leave it all up to the US Congress .
" The other important factor is whether President Obama is willing to go to the summit - if he does , that would be a very good sign . "
The list of confirmed attendees includes UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Australia 's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
But neither Mr Obama nor Chinese President Hu Jintao - leaders of the world 's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters - are yet among them .

Wired 's video demonstrates the build from start to finish , but if you 'd prefer a more barebones schematic , head over to the Wired page for a nice step - by - step in images .
It does n't look all that impressive when Wired put the plane into flight , but it looks more like a matter of an unbalanced build than a flaw with the design .

This ought to be their moment .
They have been right on so many issues – and they still are .
They are stronger in many ways than they have ever been .
Yet the Liberal Democrats will gather for their conference in Bournemouth at the end of next week suspecting that , yet again , it is probably not to be .
As Ted Kennedy might have put it , the dream goes on .
But that 's the problem .
It 's still only a dream .
What are n't the Lib Dems doing better ?
It is a really important question , and it is important not just for the party itself .
For an honest answer also surely goes to the heart of the already interminable debate about the future of self - described progressive politics in this country .
And it even , perhaps , tells us something fundamental about the people and country we are .
By so many yardsticks , the Lib Dems deserve to be higher in the polls than they are .
Michael Meadowcroft , intermittent party loyalist and former MP for Leeds West , listed several of them in a typically forceful Guardian letter today : the economy , Europe , ID cards , Iraq and localism .
On all of them , as he says , the Lib Dems have been consistently right .
One can add others to the list that Meadowcroft omitted : climate change , police powers , tax , electoral reform .
All big subjects on which the Lib Dems have been right most of the time in ways that put the other parties to shame .
Why look any further , Meadowcroft asks ?
Many agree with him .
But not enough do , and that 's the bigger point .
Yes , I can already feel the indignant emails winging their way towards me .
Have n't you seen the latest ComRes poll in the Independent this week , Martin ?
The one that puts them on 21 % , up three points in a month and now only three adrift of Labour , making it the party 's best standing in any poll for some weeks .
Does n't that disprove all that metropolitan Guardian fatalism ?
Well it does n't disprove mine , I 'm afraid .
In the first place , that was just one poll .
The other eight polls over the last month have the Lib Dems between 17 % and 19 % .
So let 's wait and see the next few before yet another claim of yet another Lib Dem breakthrough .
More importantly though , even 21 % is n't good enough for a situation like this , in which the governing party is getting pummelled and there are big doubts about their main opponents .
This ought to be a perfect storm for the two main parties , with the Lib Dems reaping the reward .
Instead it 's just typical British political weather , cloudy with occasional sunshine and showers .
And it is n't as though the Lib Dems are n't making their mark .
Yes , I know that the system is biased against them and that the media do n't give them a fair shout .
I agree with a lot of those complaints .
But you can't seriously pretend that Vince Cable has n't managed to get his voice heard throughout the financial crisis .
I heard Cable cheered to the echo at the Hay festival a few months ago .
The marquee was full to bursting with people who would have followed him over any barricade that Vince cared to nominate .
Most people , though , are n't like that .
That 's not just my opinion .
It 's a fact , though an unwelcome one .
Look at the real votes that real people have been casting in real elections in the last few months .
The Lib Dem performance in the June local elections , held mainly in areas where the party polls well , was reasonable : 25 % .
But the European elections , held nationwide on the same day , were terrible : 14 % .
Moreover , the Lib Dems have lost the art of winning byelections .
They should have won Henley in 2008 .
Since Henley , their vote has gone down every time – including Norwich North , another seat they would have won in earlier times .
Optimistic Lib Dems – are there any other kind ?
– should look carefully at that byelection result just seven weeks ago .
In Norwich North , the Lib Dems did n't just fail to win .
They were n't just edged out by the Tories .
Their vote actually went down , both in absolute terms and as a share of the poll .
Every other challenger party increased its share .
It was an absolutely terrible result for a party that always fancies its chances in byelections against an unpopular government .
So why are the Lib Dems not doing better ?
The first answer can be put in two words : David and Cameron .
Cameron 's election as Tory leader in late 2005 was a watershed for the Lib Dems .
Before Cameron – BC – they were most voters ' default second choice .
After Dave – AD – they were n't .
A liberal Tory leader – and Cameron is , whatever anyone says – has stopped the long - familiar Tory - to - Lib Dem swing vote in its tracks .
The second answer , though , is that the Lib Dems have become part of the establishment .
For decades they have prospered as the anti-politics party , running against the system , apostles of new politics .
Now , particularly after the expenses scandal , they have woken up to discover that they are seen as part of the problem .
The cosy two - party system is suddenly the cosy three - party system , and the Lib Dems are a cosy part of it .
Meanwhile , other small parties have seized the ground the Lib Dems once thought to rule unchallenged .
If you want to vote against the establishment , you can now vote Green or Red or Ukip or even BNP .
Look at Norwich North or the European elections .
Doubtless it 's all very unfair .
But it 's also true .
However the third answer is that Britain may not , after all , be as liberal a society as many of us would like , and sometimes pretend .
I do n't think there is any doubt that the Lib Dems stand for liberal values and that the voters understand this .
It is silly to pretend that Nick Clegg is in any significant way more or less liberal than Ming Campbell , Charles Kennedy or any of their predecessors .
The truth is simply that most Tory and Labour voters are not instinctively liberals .
Being liberal , the writer turned politician Michael Ignatieff said in a lecture in London in July , is a habit of the heart .
A liberal has a generous heart and an open mind .
A liberal puts freedom first , is optimistic about human nature but sceptical about power .
Ignatieff 's definitions seem about right to me .
But I do not think a majority of people share them , and certainly not in either the Tory or the Labour party .
Yes , there is a liberal tradition in both of those parties .
But , no , it is not a very strong one .
The Lib Dems are not natural bedfellows for either of them – though this wo n't stop lots of people speculating about how it might happen .
In the end , the reason the Lib Dems are not doing better is simple .
Not enough other people are liberals .
Do you like accidents ?
Do you like explosions ?
Do you like nonexistent characters ?
Do you like bad dialogue ?
I know these rhetorical questions are lame , but I 'm trying to recreate the feeling of Trauma .
One situation after another :
Will this person die ?
Will that person die ?
Will everyone die ?
Whether anyone dies or not is hardly the point of the show .
The special effects and visual effects are extremely impressive .
There 's crashes , explosions , raining metal , and a whole lots of rented freeway .
If Michael Bay wanted to make a TV show , I think this is as close as it would get .
I 'll admit it was pretty awesome while it lasted .
The problem is that the scenes are too expensive to create for every episode .
The plot however is paper thin , and this is where the show takes a turn for the worse .
While there is a fairly interesting backstory / twist that starts the episode , that is about the only thing other than the effects that caught my attention .
There is scene which the helicopter pilot Rabbit is driving that a mad man , hits someone 's car , rips an old man 's finger off .
All this while his new partner is sitting beside him .
Yes he has psychological problems from the incident , but this is one of the few moments ever that I 've had to pause the episode , and just shake my head at the stupidity .
Once the accidents stop , the episode stalled immediately .
The dialogue was horrible and clichéd beyond belief .
There were so many times I cringed at how ridiculous some of the lines were .
There was an attempt to create actual characters , but between the bad dialogue and inadequate plot , this falls by the wayside .
The acting was pretty good for this kind of show , but there was nothing spectacular , not that the cast was given anything worthwhile to work with .
From the 2 new NBC medical shows , I actually liked Mercy better than Trauma .
There was moments of Trauma that I actually smiled at , but in the end , neither are shows I will come back to .
Maybe I 'll Youtube a clip of the latest accident , but there is nothing in the pilot that suggests there is a bright spot somewhere down the line .
Score : 6.5/10
Tree - dwelling ants generally live in harmony with their arboreal hosts .
But new research suggests that when they run out of space in their trees of choice , the ants can get destructive to neighboring trees .
The research , published in the November issue of the American Naturalist , is the first to document that ants bore into live trees , and it reopens a centuries - old debate on the relationship between ants and plants .
Ants and certain species of plants and trees have cozy relationships .
Myrmecophytes , also knows as ant - plants , have hollow stems or roots that occur as a normal part of their development .
Ant colonies often take residence in these hollows .
To protect their homes , the ants patrol the area around the tree , killing insects that want to eat the plant 's leaves and sometimes destroying vegetation of other plants that might compete for precious soil nutrients and sunlight .
The relationship is a classic biological mutualism .
The ants get a nice place to live ; the trees get protection .
Everybody wins .
But while researching ant - plants in the Amazonian rainforests of Peru , Douglas Yu of the University of East Anglia and Glenn Shepard of Sao Paulo University were tipped off by the local people about a strange phenomenon .
The natives showed the researchers several non-myrmecophyte trees with swollen scars called galls on their trunks and branches .
When the researchers cut into the galls , they found that ants had excavated tunnels into the live wood .
" Ants are superb ecosystem engineers , " David Edwards the lead author of the study said , " but this is the first example of ants galling trees to make housing . "
Megan Frederickson , a Harvard biologist and member of the research team , searched 1,000 square kilometers of forest and found numerous galled trees inhabited by ants , suggesting the behavior is not uncommon .
The galled trees were only found on the edges of " Devil 's gardens " -- ant - made forest clearings that surround stands of ant - plants .
It appears , the researchers say , that when the colonies fill the available space in the ant - plants , they branch out and carve new nests into neighboring trees .
The discovery reopens a debate that raged among Charles Darwin and his contemporaries about the relationship between ants and plants .
Darwin believed -- rightly as it turned out -- the hollow spaces in ant - plants occurred as part of the plant 's normal development .
Since the ants did no damage to the plant , the relationship could be considered a mutualism .
Botanist Richard Spruce disagreed .
He believed the ants bored the hollows themselves and that the trees needed ants " like a dog needs fleas . "
In Spruce 's view , ants are parasites .
Studies in the 1960s showed definitively that ant - plant hollows occur normally , vindicating Darwin .
But this latest finding that ants do gall non-myrmecophytic trees shows that Spruce was n't so wrong after all .
In 1981 Robert Axelrod and Bill Hamilton published a paper titled The Evolution of Cooperation in which they analyzed game theory as a means of explaining the emergence of cooperative behaviour .
In 1984 Axelrod published a book titled The Evolution of Cooperation in which he again examined game theory as an explanation for the emergence of cooperative behaviour .
In 1988 Axelrod and Dion published a paper titled The Further Evolution of Cooperation in which they yet again discussed game theory as an explanation for the emergence of cooperative behaviour , and in 2000 Axelrod presented a symposium paper titled Six Advances in Cooperation
Theory in which he outlined what he saw as the continuing contribution of game theory to our understanding of cooperative behaviour .
If this intro has you almost brain - dead , just think how Axelrod feels after paddling in the stagnant pond of game theory for twenty years .
Why is game theory - cooperation theory stagnant ?
Because it ’s been tampered with for too long , left in the sun so long it ’s on the nose .
Researchers employing this approach are being held back , incapable of moving beyond theory and computer games .
The answers to the important cooperation questions will not be found in game theory .
It should hold the same position in cooperation theory that genes should hold in evolution theory ; useful only as background information .
Let ’s have a quick look at what twenty years of effort has produced .
Robert Axelrod ’s conclusion to his 2000 paper was ;
The six papers in this symposium clearly demonstrate that Cooperation
Theory continues to be a fruitful paradigm for the conduct of research on an ever - growing set of important theoretical questions .
The symposium shows how using and extending the original paradigm of the two - person iterated Prisoner ’s Dilemma provides rich possibilities for studying the effects a wide range of factors such as the timing of moves , hostage taking , social networks , adaptive play , envy , noise and mobility .
In light of the extensive existing literature on related models dealing many of these factors , the time is now ripe for the comparison of results of closely related models on each factor , as well as for the continuing addition of new themes .
Not very impressive , is it ?
Mind you , the milking is impressive .
They ’re determined to get every last drop out of the “ rich possibilities ” found in this particular “ fruitful paradigm ” .
But surely in twenty years they must have discovered something more concrete than that outlined by Axelrod ?
They have .
They found that cooperation pays .
Hold that thought for a moment
We participate in cooperation and receive its benefits every day of our lives , 24 hours of the day , from the moment of our conception until the moment we die .
Our world is awash with cooperation , it ’s the linch - pin of our existence .
DS Wilson made the very good point that the reason selfish gene theory became an unstoppable bandwagon in the 1970s and 80s was that individualism was the cultural water we swam in at that time , and just as fish give little thought to the water in which they live , so the world at large gave no thought to the link between selfish gene theory and the cultural trends of the day .
His analogy is even more apt in the case of cooperation .
Just as fish give no thought to the medium that supports them , so we are blind to the medium that supports us .
How else can we explain the staggering fact that twenty years of research found that cooperation pays ?
How could they have been so blind that they knew less about cooperation than an eighteen year old first - time mother ?
Does that sound like a bit of a stretch ?
Consider this from Axelrod ’s Six Advances paper ; “ … these results have inspired a good deal of empirical work demonstrating that cooperation based upon reciprocity does indeed exist between individuals , between nations , and even among animals . ”
( I first made the point about young mothers knowing more about cooperation than selfish gene theorists in Twelve Misunderstandings of Evolution , but it was not well received in some quarters despite its obvious validity as shown by Axelrod ’s “ wow ” statement of discovery .
He could have saved himself twenty years of research by reading Aesop ’s Fables , a treasure trove of information on the various forms of cooperation and selfishness , their origins and relative merits .
Even a book on parenting would have done . )
The reason for this blindness , and for the stagnation that results , is that the enquiry into the origin and nature of cooperation based on game theory is being carried out within the constricting framework of selfish gene theory .
Some of the false assumptions to be found in the publications listed above include the following , all of which form part of selfish gene dogma ;
That the world is asocial , that cooperation is a problem for evolutionary theory , that Darwin ’s theory was individualistic , that altruism is linked to relatedness , that while benefits accrue from cooperation , greater benefits can accrue from exploiting cooperation , that humans are egoists , that the evolution of cooperation requires that individuals have a reasonable expectation of meeting again so that they have a stake in their future interaction .
With shoddy fundamentals such as these to work with , it ’s no wonder the game theory approach to cooperation theory has become all noise , signifying nothing .
It ’s worth having a look at the conclusion to the seminal paper in the series , Axelrod and Hamilton ’s The Evolution of Cooperation .
It was as concise as a conclusion can be .
Darwin's emphasis on individual advantage has been formalized in terms of game theory .
This establishes conditions under which cooperation based on reciprocity can evolve .
This is not science .
There ’s two statements here , both need correcting .
First , “ Darwin ’s emphasis on individual advantage ” is misleading and wrong .
When it came to evolution as a whole he gave emphasis also to the role of social influences , so to characterize his work as being based on the individual is unacceptable .
Second , to characterize the evolution of cooperation as being based on individual advantage is simplistic , again to the point of being misleading and wrong .
Self - interest does play a role in cooperation , but one of the tactics employed by selfish gene advocates has been to blur the clear difference between self - interest and selfishness .
The term “ individual advantage ” is all about individualism , and the primary purpose of this paper was to give “ scientific ” credibility to a social movement based on the alleged virtues of individualism , by pushing the totally false proposition that individualism is the dominant theme of evolution .
A secondary purpose was to buttress selfish gene theory itself by falsely explaining away cooperation as a subtle manifestation of selfish motives .
It was truly remarkable that in some minds this was successful .
On September 17 , 2009 , Monthly Review celebrated its 60th anniversary at the New York Society for Ethical Culture in New York City .
Five - hundred enthusiastic supporters gathered to hear remarks by Robert McChesney , Grace Lee Boggs , John Bellamy Foster , Fred Magdoff , Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Michael Tigar , and hear music by Toshi Reagon .
More than six decades ago , Paul Sweezy and his good friend , the labour journalist Leo Huberman , had long dreamed of founding a magazine offering a forum for insightful comment and analysis of world and national events from a specifically socialist perspective .
The two already had a history of activism in the radical cauldron spawned by the Great Depression , the rise of the labour movement , and the World War II .
By 1948 , with the accelerating crises of Cold War and domestic repression – and with seed money from Sweezy 's good friend and Harvard colleague , the literary historian and critic F.O. Matthiessen – they pressed forward with their plan for what would become Monthly Review .
It was to be a publication that would stand against class exploitation and opposed to the organisation of production for private profit rather than social need .
Paul and Leo maintained that poverty , inequality in wealth and income , racial oppression , imperialism and waste were permanent and endemic , not atavistic or peripheral , features of capitalist society .
As intellectuals they saw as their task demystifying the current order as thoroughly as possible and to practice , as Paul Baran would later put it , “ the continuous , systematic and comprehensive confrontation of reality with reason ” .
Monthly Review was launched in May 1949 , initially reaching only a few hundred subscribers , in what was a grave time for radical dissent .
The enveloping reactionary , brutal and vulgar system of oppression – McCarthyism – was felt in every corner of society , impacting trade unions , government , publishing , film , television and education .
It made the survival , even the very existence , of the fledgling Monthly Review enterprise all the more surprising .
But survive it did .
The first issue featured the lead article Why Socialism ? by Albert Einstein .
From the first issue of Monthly Review , it spoke out for socialism and against US imperialism , and is still doing so today .
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Monthly Review offered ongoing investigation of the emergence of Africa , Asia , and Latin America from the colonial yoke , the consolidation of US - led imperialism , and the triumph of the Chinese Revolution .
In the United States , it examined the use of the tools of fear to destroy or neuter the labour movement and its erstwhile allies in the old New Deal coalition at the same time that it examined an economy increasingly sustained by military spending .
In the early 1960s Sweezy and Huberman , accompanied by Paul Baran , visited Cuba , publishing a special issue , Cuba : Anatomy of a Revolution , which became a worldwide bestseller .
Monthly Review was among the first to recognise the socialist character of the Cuban Revolution .
In 1968 , with the untimely death of Huberman , longtime contributor Harry Magdoff joined Sweezy as co-editor .
The two went on to both inform and challenge a new generation of activists and students around the world with their analysis of the world economy and imperialism .
Monthly Review and its contributors pioneered in the study of economic stagnation in the First World as it made sense of revolutionary insurgency in the Third World .
With the advent of the 21st century , Monthly Review experienced another changing of the guard : John Bellamy Foster and Robert McChesney joined the editors as they examined the increasingly volatile international economy .
They were among the first to study the impact of “ financialization ” , the growth of dangerous bubbles in the domestic and global casino market and the role of obfuscation and distortion by the corporate medal .
MR 's analysis of the Great Financial Crisis was ahead of the curve , a fact recognised by the London Guardian 's economics editor when he celebrated the work of Foster and Magdoff .
It may be worthwhile asking what caused Monthly Review to win such respect and influence on the broad left and in even in mainstream circles .
The major characteristics are clear :
First of all there is MR ’s plain , no - nonsense Marxism .
Sophisticated in thought but simple and modest in style , the magazine , along with its book publishing arm Monthly Review Press , and now joined by the Web site MRZine.org , has steadily and unflinchingly championed the interests of the hungry , the dispossessed and the great majority of humankind against capitalism , racism and other forms of oppression .
Monthly Review ’s astute use of the tools of political economy has informed its economic reportage , insuring a broad - based sensibility and avoiding the economic profession ’s descent into model building , technicality , and mathematical abstraction .
Throughout its history , Monthly Review's has demonstrated a proven internationalism , not only opposing US military , economic and political domination over other peoples , but providing careful analysis , insight and an informed point of view on developments in Latin America , Africa and Asia .
Above all , it has been Monthly Review 's ability to put the present into historical perspective .
Assessment of contemporary events is an extremely challenging type of Marxist writing , perhaps the most challenging , and Monthly Review 's editors have been extremely adept at it .
Monthly Review has had but six editors .
The original editors were Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman .
Leo Huberman died in 1968 , and Harry Magdoff became an editor in 1969 .
Ellen Meiksins
Wood served ably as editor in the period 1997 - 2000 .
In May 2000 John Bellamy Foster and Robert W. McChesney , themselves of the " 1968 " generation and educated by Monthly Review , took over the primary editorial responsibilities .
Founding editor Paul Sweezy died on February 27 , 2004 , and a special issue devoted to his work appeared in October 2004 .
On June 1 , 2004 Robert McChesney ceased to be formally designated as an editor , while continuing as a contributor and a director of the Monthly Review Foundation , the not - for - profit entity that operates both Monthly Review magazine and Monthly Review Press .
Harry Magdoff died on New Year 's Day , 2006 .
A special issue focusing on his contribution to the understanding of capitalism and imperialism appeared in October , 2006 .
John Bellamy
Foster , the current editor , continues the tradition of combining accounts of what is new ( without falling for fads ) with the equally vital task of seeing the longer process .
That tradition , as summarised by Paul Sweezy , is to see the present as history .
On July 14 , 2006 Monthly Review began a daily web magazine MRZine.org featuring a broad range of articles , reviews and commentary .
Revenues from subscriptions and the sales of books have always fallen short of the demands on Monthly Review 's resources .
This is inevitable ; in today 's world any anti-imperialist and socialist enterprise that finds its resources sufficient to the tasks we face must either be moribund or false .
The contributions — over and above subscriptions and book sales — of a global community of several thousand people sustain MR .
Monthly Review today places most of its articles on the web and MRZine has attracted a substantial and growing readership .
Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal and its sister publication Green Left Weekly congratulates Monthly Review on its 60 years of socialist activism and education and urges its readers to consider subscribing to MR .
Links and GLW were proud to support John Bellamy Foster 's visit to Australia to attend the historic Climate Change , Social Change conference in Sydney in 2008 .

I would like to suggest a different reason for the medical crisis that is being legislated in our capital .
I would like to suggest it is really a tax crisis instead .
Why ?
Because physicians reach a threshold of taxation so quickly that their incentive to work any additional hours becomes severely diminished .
Diminished hours means diminished supply .
So why are we not doing all we can to increase supply if we have a shortage of services ?
Like any hardworking individual , doctors know when they reach a point of diminishing return on what they are selling .
And they are selling something - knowledge .
How many days do you think a doctor has to work in order to hit the maximum tax brackets , and thus suffer the maximum amount of deterrence to work harder ?
If by April 15th of every year you knew that most of your earnings were going to taxes , how motivated would you be ?
I have heard lots of stories about how expensive treatments are for one lifesaving procedure or another .
Yet I never hear someone say that the $ 100,000 spent to save their lives really was not worth it .
Yet physicians are not competing with one another for that business are they ?
They are not extending their office hours , open Saturdays and Sundays to reduce their backlog of patients , or any of the other ways that they could see more patients and effectively , earn more income .
Why do you think that is ?
If just 50 % of physicians had an incentive to treat 10 % more in terms of patients , would we really need to have government take over health care in our country ?
Our tax structure is meant to punish those that earn the most in our society .
If we are punishing them via the tax code , why would they turn around and work harder ?
Why would they try to increase their incomes by seeing more patients and then finding that for every dollar they earn , they are paying 65 cents or more in taxes .
After you reach the 50 % tax bracket , you are working more for the government than you are for yourself anyway .
How many rational people would knowingly work harder and harder for less ?
It 's just not worth it .
And today , many of us have been pushed into punitive tax brackets without earning incredible sums of money , due to the broken tax code .
How many of us have been struck by reduced deductions , or the aleternative minimum tax ?
These are punitive by design .
The government knows it and have refused to eliminate them .
So , imagine the federal , state and local taxes a successful doctor must pay once he has made , for arguments sake , $ 400,000 in income for the year .
He could work 10 % harder to earn $ 40,000 more , but he will only pocket $ 10,000 or so after the additional taxes , reduction in value of his itemized deductions , and possibly the alternative minimum tax .
Where is the incentive ?
There is none .
As I have suggested in the past , if the politicians were serious about increasing the supply of medical services in the United States , they would immediately eliminate all federal income taxes in the medical field .
Give those working in the business today the incentive to work more .
What they are doing today will give them greater incentive to work less .
It will not be worth the pay or the paperwork .
Eliminating the Federal Income tax on the medical profession would be good for their pocketbooks , and for ours .
They only losers would be the politicians who would not have the money pass through their hands , and who do not get to control our lives .
This is a tax crisis at heart .
The reason this “ crisis ” hits us the way it does while there are so many other professions that also suffer from high punitive taxes is that medical care is a personal need .
High paid movie stars , sports players , investment bankers , and others are optional in the majority of our lives .
Medical care is not .
And this crisis is being exploited for too many reasons to list here .
Fix the punitive tax code in this nation , and we would have all the medical care we needed .
That is the way capitalism works .
Unfortunately there are too many in Washington creating a tax code with no understanding or belief in a capitalist America .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - A man was caught by Norwegian customs carrying a tarantula in his bag , and a further 14 royal pythons and 10 albino leopard geckos taped to his body , media reported Monday .
The 22 - year - old Norwegian was stopped in a routine check by Kristiansand customs after arriving on a ferry from Denmark , newspaper Faedrelandsvennen reported .
Customs found the tarantula , before deciding to give him a full body search that revealed 14 stockings -- one for each snake -- taped around his torso , top selling tabloid VG said .
Reptile smuggling is not uncommon in Norway , which prohibits people holding many reptile species as pets , but office manager Helge Breilid at Kristiansand customs was quoted by VG as saying customs officers had been “ horrified ” by Sunday ’s catch .
“ Customs officers quickly realized the man was smuggling animals , because his whole body was in constant motion , ” Breilid told VG .
When the man dropped his pants , the officers found 10 cans taped to his legs , each containing a lizard , he said .
The man was still being held by police Monday , Kristiansand police attorney Johann Martin Kile told VG , adding he would be released upon agreeing to pay a 12,500 Norwegian crowns ( $ 2,256 ) fine .
The reptiles were handed over to a security firm until Norwegian authorities decide what to do with them , Breilid said .
The platform helped doctors and patients to work collaboratively and attempt to solve the case as early as possible .
The patient needs to enter the symptoms in the system and it will be visible to the available doctors for a sooner or later appointment .
The software also stores the patient details with the help of encryption until the next time .

Here is some sound advice for anyone having an illicit love affair : if you do not want to be found out , do not arrange to sleep together on the night of March 27 - 28 2011 .
That is the night when the Government is going to count the British population , creating a precise , comprehensive record of who was sleeping where , how old they were , what ethnic background they came from , and what kind of central heating kept them warm that night .
The 2011 census is already being called a " snoopers ' charter " .
It is certainly going to give everyone an incentive not to lay their head to rest in the wrong house , at least for that one night .
The Conservatives complained yesterday that the 32 - page questionnaire is too long , too expensive , and likely to undermine public support for the exercise , especially since anyone who does not fill in the form risks a £ 1,000 fine .
They will be sent out by post but it will be possible to fill them in online .

Census forms have grown longer and more complex with each new census , and next year 's will set a new record for the level of detail it demands .
Householders will be required for the first time to give the sex and date of birth of any visitor staying that night .
This will also be the first census with a question about same - sex civil partnerships .
The question about a person 's marital status has expanded from four possibilities – married , separated , divorced , or widowed – to eight .
Householders will also be asked to state how many bedrooms are in their home , information that could affect the size of council tax bills , and whether its central heating is gas , electric , oil or solid fuel .
Another new question is about second homes .
Anyone who stays at a different address for more than 30 days a years will be required to specify the address .
For MPs , that information is now public knowledge ; others might wonder why the state needs to know .
There are new questions aimed at learning more about immigrants , ethnic minorities , and those with little command of English .
There is a long question about ethnic grouping , another asks whether he or she holds a British passport .
Those not born in the UK will be asked when they arrived here .
Those here for less than six months will be asked how long they intend to stay .
And anyone filling in the form whose first language is not English will be asked to categorise their command of English , from " very well " to " not at all " .
" An increasingly invasive census will erode public support , cost more and result in a less accurate survey , " the Tory shadow Cabinet Office minister Nick Hurd said yesterday .
" Just because the Government has the legal powers to ask these questions does not give the state the licence to ask anything they want .
These bedroom snoopers are yet another sign of how the Labour Government has no respect for the privacy of law - abiding citizens . "
The Cabinet Office minister Angela Smith said : " The questions have been devised to produce reliable and accurate data .
The Office for National Statistics has carried out extensive consultations and testing to ensure that the questions are justified . "
The way we lived :
How the census has evolved
* 1801 - 1831 The first census , on 10 March 1801 , was collected by parish , there were no household details .
* 1841-1901
The census of 1841 was the first to record the full name , sex , age ( rounded down to the nearest five , if aged over 15 ) and occupation of each person living in a household .
In 1851 , questions were added about the relationship of each individual to the head of the house .
* 1911 -1931
In 1911 , census saw the introduction of a question about the fertility of marriage – prompted by the concern about falling birth rates – and a distinction between occupation and industry .
This innovation not only produced more accurate results , but allowed new theories about social class to develop .
In 1921 , people were asked about their education and their means of how they travel to work .
* 1951-2001
War meant that no census was taken in 1941 , but peacetime prompted another expansion .
In 1951 questions regarding place of work , educational standards , and household amenities were introduced .
Examples include questions about educational qualifications ( 1961 ) ; how many cars each household owns ( 1981 ) ; and an assessment of an individual 's health ( 2001 ) .
Comments from politicians describing members of an Aboriginal gang as " pure evil " and " little turds " only encourages their behaviour , a senior criminologist says .
Some of the gang 's 49 members have been accused of a five - week rampage , which included a dozen armed hold - ups and several home invasions .
Some of them are alleged to have taken part not long after being released from jail .
Yesterday , as some gang members appeared in court , South Australia 's Attorney - General Michael Atkinson called them " pure evil " and beyond rehabilitation .
" We are dealing with an evil phenomenon .
We are dealing with a criminal gang , gunmen , who go round in gangs hitting soft targets .
This is about pure evil , " he said .
Not to be outdone , his Opposition counterpart Vicky Chapman also had a go at the children .
" These are children who are really little turds , let 's be honest , they really are difficult children and they have got all sorts of hideous backgrounds and they 're nasty little pieces of work , " she said .
A talkback caller this morning on ABC local radio joined the fray .
" The citizens of Adelaide - and I know in my own area - have been absolutely terrorised , really , really terrorised .
Now surely this gang is a mob of terrorists , " they said .
Dr Allan Perry , who has specialised in criminal law at Adelaide University for 33 years , says publicity will only encourage the gang members .
" I think it 's understandable that people can both be frustrated and fearful about this kind of behaviour but the talk in those sort of emotive ways does n't improve the situation at all , " he said .
" I 'm afraid all it does is reinforce the extremely inefficient punishment paradigm that has characterised the correction system in South Australia for a very long time . "
Dr Perry says comments like the Attorney - General 's are made for purely political reasons .
" I certainly think that publicity given to it encourages them .
For senior government officials and Opposition officials to come out in this sort of way , I think increases the sense of celebrity that they , " he said .
" It certainly can't be seen to be done for any sort of effective reason .
" It 's been done purely for political reasons , which is what so much of criminal justice policy is underpinned by and why overall it 's so ineffective . "
But earlier today , Attorney - General Michael Atkinson was standing by his comments on ABC local radio .
" They 're using guns , they 're bashing people with the butt of the gun , they 're putting their exploits up on Facebook and boasting about it , they have no conception that what they 're doing is wrong - yes they 're evil , " he said .

A man who was a press liaison for former President George W. Bush and ex-Vice President Dick Cheney is at the center of a case involving $ 2 million of fuel stolen from Mexican oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos that was resold in the United States .
Josh Crescenzi of Houston , former vice president for Continental Fuels of San Antonio , has been cooperating with agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for several months , helping them secretly record conversations that have resulted in the conviction of a Houston oil industry executive , another one from San Antonio and the president of a small oil and gas company in Edinburg .
Crescenzi's help is likely to lead to charges against more people , the San Antonio Express - News has learned .
Petroleum condensate , which Mexico claims was stolen by the Gulf Cartel 's armed enforcement wing , Los Zetas , was sold to at least three oil companies in the United States — Germany - based BASF , Murphy Energy of Oklahoma , and Trammo Petroleum of Houston .
Representatives for BASF and Murphy said the companies did not know the condensate was stolen .
The path of stolen petroleum also involves importers , including Petro Salum in the Rio Grande Valley .
On Oct. 2 , Jonathan Dappen , 29 , of Petro Salum pleaded guilty in the wide - ranging conspiracy .
He followed Arnoldo Maldonado , president of Y Oil and Gas in Edinburg , and Donald Schroeder , former president of Trammo .
All admitted they knew the condensate was stolen , court transcripts show .
Bragged of connections
Crescenzi is a former press advance representative for Bush and Cheney .
They are not implicated in the case , but those familiar with Crescenzi said he was known to brag about his connections to further his business interests .
Crescenzi most recently supervised operations in the Rio Grande Valley for Continental Fuels .
He resigned in May while cooperating with the feds and has not commented publicly .
No charges have been filed against him .
Through records and interviews , the Express - News found he turned over bills of lading ICE agents believe were used to disguise shipments of the stolen condensate smuggled across the Texas border and stored at the Port of Brownsville .
As part of the probe , ICE agents seized more than $ 40,000 from Continental Fuels and $ 102,525 from Valley Fuels Ltd. , another San Antonio company .
Valley Fuels president Steve Pechenik pleaded guilty Friday to charges of conspiracy to receive and sell stolen petroleum condensate .
Continental Fuels CEO
Tim Brink of San Antonio and those who pleaded guilty were recorded on tape with Crescenzi's help , allegedly discussing the stolen condensate , records show .
“ We 're investigating the matter , ” one of Brink 's lawyers , Van Hilley , said recently .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim McAlister , who is prosecuting , declined comment when asked about the records .
Avoided one scandal
Before joining Continental Fuels , Crescenzi worked for lobbyist Stephen Payne , owner of Worldwide Strategic Partners in Houston and several related companies .
In July 2008 , Payne appeared on a videotape made by London 's Sunday Times offering a foreign government official access to Cheney and then - Secretary of State Condo­leezza Rice in exchange for a $ 250,000 “ donation ” to the private George W. Bush Presidential Library .
There is no evidence that Crescenzi was involved in the Payne scandal .
In the petroleum condensate case , ICE had learned from Mexican officials in 2007 about the illegal shipments from Pemex pipelines .
Crescenzi agreed to cooperate and made more than 400 hours of recorded conversations , including ones about the shipments .
Schroeder testified that he was contacted by representatives from Continental and Murphy who “ told me they had some Mexican condensate they would like to sell . ”
“ A little bit later , I received a call from Josh Crescenzi , … and he had told me that the condensate was stolen , ” Schroeder said , describing the January phone call .
“ And , so what did you do about it ? ” U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. asked .
“ I bought it and sold it , ” Schroeder answered .
Prosecutor McAlister told the judge that Trammo received $ 150,000 in profits from the stolen condensate .
Joel Androphy , a lawyer for Murphy Energy , said in an interview that the government subpoenaed documents from the firm , and that Murphy cooperated .
He also said Murphy lost almost $ 1 million in the deal .
“ Murphy has no knowledge of any scheme to do anything illegal , ” Androphy said .
“ We paid market value for a product that someone now says was stolen . ”
Daniel Pepitone , a spokesman for BASF , said the company also is cooperating and , “ we have no reason to believe BASF had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . ”
In August , U.S. officials handed Mexican dignitaries a $ 2.4 million check from Trammo as compensation to Pemex .
Schroeder , who is cooperating , was fined $ 2 million and will be sentenced in December .
Maldonado and Dappen face sentencing in January and also are cooperating , records show .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
A new report from the National Research Council on the “ hidden costs of energy ” is , frankly , stunning .
In a sane world , it would be headline news .
Producing and using energy imposes all sorts of costs on public health , crop yields , ecosystems , recreation , educational performance … the list goes on .
Many of these costs do n’t end up reflected in the market price of energy ; consumers do n’t see them or factor them into purchasing decisions .
They are hidden , paid indirectly through , for example , health - care spending or environmental - remediation costs .
Such costs are external to energy markets — externalities , as economists call them — and they represent an enormous subsidy to the dirtiest sources of energy .
I ’m always left somewhat dissatisfied by discussions about externalities .
People seem to imagine them as external in some sort of metaphysical way , as though the costs inhabit an immaterial and weightless ether .
( “ Social ” costs , they ’re sometimes called . )
But costs are costs .
Someone pays them , with real money .
They dampen economic productivity , like driving with one foot pressing the brake .
In 2005 , Congress set about finding out just what these external costs of energy production and use amount to .
It requested that the National Research Council ( part of the National Academy of Sciences ) attempt to place a number on them .
On Monday , the NRC released its report : “ Hidden Costs of Energy : Unpriced Consequences of Energy Production and Use . ”
First , note that the report did not attempt to quantify the damage to ecosystems and agriculture wrought by climate change .
It did not attempt to quantify the national security costs of securing energy supplies .
It did not attempt to quantify the land - use costs of biofuels .
It did n’t attempt to quantify the costs of mercury pollution , which as Bill Chameides documents , are substantial .
It did n’t attempt to quantify the impact on taxpayers that subsidies to the coal industry impose .
So a huge chunk of costs were written out , meaning the results are extremely small - c conservative .
Nonetheless , the NRC found that hidden costs amounted to $ 120 billion in 2005 .
Of that $ 120 billion , a whopping $ 62 billion — over half — came from one source : coal - fired electricity plants .
And that ’s only a partial accounting , as Ken Ward Jr. reports :
Maureen L. Cropper , a panel member and professor of economics at the University of Maryland , noted that the study also did not examine “ upstream ” costs of coal - fired power — such as damage from mountaintop removal mining — or “ harm to ecosystems ” from other impacts , such as disposal of toxic power plant ash .
If MTR mining , ash disposal , mercury emissions , market - distorting subsidies , and climate damage were taken into account , how much farther do you think coal ’s costs would rise , in both absolute and relative terms ?
Remember this report the next time you hear that “ coal is cheap . ”

Here 's Barack and Michelle Obama with Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and his family .
The State Department uploaded it to Flickr .
( What an unlikely sentence ! )
Whoops — no one in Spain has ever seen Zapatero 's Goth daughters before !
According to Zapatero , Spanish law allows him to prevent the Spanish media from running any photographs of his 16 and 13 - year - old daughters Laura and Alba .
For their privacy , see .

Humans have found or made 50 million different chemicals here on Earth , the vast majority over the last few decades .
At least , that 's how many unique chemicals are now registered in a database maintained by the American Chemical Society as of yesterday .
The announcement underscores the tremendous growth of the global chemicals industry after World War II .
“ A novel substance is either isolated or synthesized every 2.6 seconds on the average during the past 12 months , day and night , seven days a week in the world , " said Dr. Hideaki Chihara , Ph.D. chemist and former president of Japan Association for International Chemical Information .
The rate new chemicals are being produced and isolated is astounding .
It took 33 years to get the first 10 million chemicals registered and a mere nine months to get the last 10 million chemicals into the database .
In part , the acceleration is due to better tracking by the American Chemical Society , but laboratories around the world are also just producing ( and patenting ) a tremendous amount of molecules .
And while the Chemical Abstracts Service registry is the most comprehensive list around , there are undoubtedly more proprietary substances that remain off the books .

REVIEW OF PHILIP E. CONVERSE'S
" THE NATURE OF BELIEF SYSTEMS IN MASS PUBLICS "
Philip E. Converse wrote " The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics " to promulgate his research into the field of voter decision - making .
Converse 's thesis is essentially that the vast majority of the voting public has no clear ideology and has little desire to understand issues which are not clearly and directly related to them as individuals .
In order to prove his thesis , Converse tracked voter opinions on ideological issues from the 1952 Presidential election , and relates his findings with that of other researchers who studied other times .
Converse begins by defining some important terms .
A belief system ' is a collection of ideas which are connected by function .
 Constraint ' is the degree to which a particular belief is predictive of another belief .
Converse uses the term  centrality ' for the tendency of new information to necessitate changes in belief .
Beliefs that are more likely to change are less  central ' to an individual 's belief system .
For example , when the Republican Party platform abandoned its call for the abolition of the Department of Education , a Republican may have decided to forgo his or her own support for the abolition of the Department , or the voter may have decided to no longer affiliate with the GOP .
If the voter chose one of those options , the option forgone is thought to be less  central ' to the voter 's belief system .
Converse considers the issue of constraint early .
In attempting to show that Americans have little constraint , he referencd evidence that those who most support expanding the Welfare State are also most likely to advocate lower taxes .
Converse believes these two ideas are mutually exclusive , and therefore demonstrate lack of constraint .
Furthermore , Converse suggests that while the intellectual and political elite ' do display constraint , the vast majority of Americans do not .
Converse stated that most Americans have little understanding of their beliefs , have no basis for referencing conflicting ideas , and have little desire to consider the issues .
According to Converse , if asked to agree or disagree with the statement that " communists are atheists , " most Americans would agree .
However , if further asked why communists are atheists , the public could rarely give a coherent and correct explanation .
Converse noted that most Americans tend to have limited education , which is linked with traits such as " concrete thinking , " limited ability to think past the near future , and minimal conceptual scope .
Unfortunately , most important political issues rely on the ability to think in abstract terms and unify various information exactly the skills millions of Americans lack .
Labels provide an easy - to - understand gauge for assessing policy issues , if one understands the labels .
In politics ,  conservative ' and liberal ' are commonly used terms to describe characters and policies .
However , Converse wrote that nearly 48 % of people are unable to even understand those two everyday terms .
When elections transfer political power from one party to another , the elites ' tend to consider it as a fundamental shift in the mass 's political leanings .
However , Converse 's theory that most people have no coherent conceptual ideology means power shifts have little resemblance to ideological viewpoints of the people .
To understand the level of ideological sophistication of people , Converse asked a series of questions and ranked people on a scale of 1 to 5 .
Level 1 consisted of people with clear , coherent , abstract understanding of issues .
Level 5 consisted of people who made decisions arbitrarily .
More than 90 % of the people made voting decisions on the basis of strict party affiliation , by ascribing current socio-economic conditions to the incumbent , or arbitrarily .
Less than 10 % made decisions on the basis of substantive ideology .
Only 2 % made decisions that utilized proper abstract thinking .
While most Americans have little understanding of political issues , the elites , ' politicians , and political scientists often think of the electorate as being ideologically complex .
The reason , according to Converse , is that the politically active represent a small group of mostly well educated elites .
The people who get the most contact with politicians are the active elites .
Regrettably , the elites are such a small minority of the electorate that they have only marginal impact on elections .
The vast amount of political weight is carried by people who cannot accurately differentiate between liberal ' and conservative . '
In order to test people 's understanding of party values , respondents were asked to link issues that were related according to party values .
Converse chose issues that he considered to be easily understood by anyone with minimal political knowledgesimply that liberals who support expanding welfare domestically are also likely to support increasing foreign economic aid .
Most people were unable to even make that simple connection of values .
In longitudinal research , Converse found that people did not even maintain their own stated beliefs over two - year periods .
According to Converse , people were only slightly more likely to retain the same beliefs after two years than if they had flipped a coin to choose ideologies .
In looking at history , Converse attempted to show that major ideological debates have little impact on elections .
Converse cited evidence that during the election of Abraham Lincoln , most Northerners had little , if any , knowledge of the tremendously heated debate concerning slavery .
Similarly , during the Un - American Activities hearings of the 1950s , a third of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Representative or Senator conducting the investigations .
People , in essence , are socially ignorant on even the most dominating issues .
The only time people displayed some semblance of ideological constraint was on issues that clearly and directly affected them personally .
For example , blacks and Southerners were likely to retain beliefs concerning desegregation .
The more remote an issue was from the person 's daily life , the less likely the person was to have a constrained opinion , or even to have knowledge that the issue was in debate .
Converse concluded with a discussion of the rise of Nazism to Germany .
While most political commentators would like to think there was a social shift in favor of the socialist values of the Nazi Party , Converse stated that their success was actually caused by voter ignorance .
A large portion of Nazi support came from the young , the poor , and rural farmers .
Nazi support came from the people who were the least politically sophisticated , and who made decisions based on the least information and with the least congruence .
The rise of Nazi Germany then , was not caused by a shift in the electorate 's attitudes , but by the impulse of people who did not truly understand what they were voting for .
" The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics " was an effort to demonstrate that political behavior and ideology is less connected with intelligent decision - making than with ignorance and whim .
Drawing upon the election of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 , and the histories of the Republican Party , Civil Rights , and Nazism , Converse provides a case for his claim that most people have no true political ideology .
The voting public displays limited constraint among policy beliefs , only slight understanding of important debates , and a tendency to frequently change opinions .
I found Converse quite convincing in most of his arguments .
Certainly , there were questions where his interpretation could be open to debate .
For example , it is not absolutely necessary that someone who wants to expand welfare while lowering taxes is showing lack of constraint .
It is possible that the person wants to lower other spending , such as defense spending , in order to pay for both the expanded welfare and lower taxes .
However , it is quite difficult to find any rational explanation for why people cannot discern simple terms such as " liberal " and " conservative " or identify the essential points of party platforms .
Ultimately , I found Converse 's piece successful at showing the public 's ignorance of even the most basic politics .
Autism Speaks took in more than $ 69 million last year , over $ 600,000 of which was paid to a single executive , recently released tax filings indicate .
The organization ’s chief science officer , Geri Dawson , received $ 669,751 in total compensation in 2008 including $ 269,721 in relocation expenses to move her family from Washington to North Carolina , according to Autism Speaks ’ tax filing .
Dawson ’s base salary was $ 373,360 , more than any of the organization ’s 257 other employees , including Autism Speaks president Mark Roithmayr .
Employee compensation accounted for more than a quarter of Autism Speaks ’ income for the year .

“ Dr. Dawson ’s compensation is in the mid-range for executives with similar positions in the nonprofit health sector , ” Autism Speaks representatives said in a statement .
They went on to explain Dawson ’s cross-country moving expenses by saying that her presence on the east coast makes her more accessible to Autism Speaks offices , three of its science divisions and government health agencies in Washington , D.C .
The move also allowed Dawson to take a position at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
Nonprofit salaries range wildly , experts say , but must be based on the salaries of others in similar positions at comparable organizations in order to meet Internal Revenue Service standards .
“ There ’s no one answer for what is appropriate compensation , ” says Suzanne Coffman , director of communications for Guidestar , which operates a database of nonprofit organizations ’ financial information .
“ You ’ll find at universities that the football coach makes more than the president and at hospitals you ’ll have physicians who make more than the CEO . ”
Overall , Autism Speaks , the nation ’s largest autism advocacy organization , took in more than $ 69 million last year , over $ 20 million more than it did the previous year .
In turn , the organization provided over $ 27 million in grants .

Do Vaccines Work And Are They Safe ?
Most doctors and nurses genuinely believe that vaccines have helped wipe out some of the deadliest infectious diseases .
Many members of the medical profession would put vaccination high on any list of great medical discoveries .
The perceived value of vaccination is so great that even though I have , for many years , been a vociferous critic of some specific vaccines ( see section headed Whooping Cough ) I have up until now always been reluctant to damn all vaccination programmes as worthless and dangerous .
The mythical power of vaccination programmes has for years constantly been sustained by governments , and bodies , such as the World Health Organisation announcing , apparently with complete conviction , that such and such a disease will be eradicated when the relevant vaccination programme has been completed .
The principle behind vaccination is a convincing one .
The theory is that when an individual is given a vaccine – which consists of a weakened or dead version of the disease against which protection is required – his or her body will be tricked into developing antibodies to the disease in exactly the same way that a body develops antibodies when it is exposed to the disease itself .
But in reality things are n’t quite so simple .
How long do the antibodies last ?
Do they always work ?
What about those individuals who do n’t produce antibodies at all ?
Vaccination , like so much of medicine , is a far more inexact science than doctors ( and drug companies ) would like us to think .
Vaccination is widely respected by doctors and others in the health care industry because of the assumption that it is through vaccination that many of the world ’s most lethal infectious diseases have been eradicated .
But this simply is n’t true .
As I have shown in many of my books infectious diseases were conquered by the provision of cleaner drinking water and better sewage facilities .
The introduction of vaccination programmes came along either just at the same time or later when the death rates from the major infectious diseases had already fallen .
There really is n’t any evidence to show that vaccination programmes have ever been of any real value – either to individuals or to communities .
THE SMALLPOX MYTH
One of the medical profession ’s greatest boasts is that it eradicated smallpox through the use of the smallpox vaccine .
I myself believed this claim for many years .
But it simply is n’t true .
One of the worst smallpox epidemics of all time took place in England between 1870 and 1872 – nearly two decades after compulsory vaccination was introduced .
After this evidence that smallpox vaccination did n’t work the people of Leicester in the English midlands refused to have the vaccine any more .
When the next smallpox epidemic struck in the early 1890s the people of Leicester relied upon good sanitation and a system of quarantine .
There was only one death from smallpox in Leicester during that epidemic .
In contrast the citizens of other towns ( who had been vaccinated ) died in vast numbers .
Obligatory vaccination against smallpox was introduced in Germany in around 1816 , largely as a result of state by - laws , but these vaccination programmes had no influence on the incidence of the disease .
On the contrary , the smallpox epidemic continued to grow and in 1870 the war with France led to the gravest smallpox epidemic in Germany history .
At that point the new German Reich introduced a new national law making vaccination against smallpox an even stricter legal requirement .
The police were given the power to enforce the new law .
German doctors ( and medical students ) are taught that it was the Reich Vaccination Law which led to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of smallpox in Germany .
But a close look at the figures shows that the incidence of smallpox had already started to fall before the law came into action .
And the legally enforced national smallpox vaccination programme did not eradicate the disease .
Doctors and drug companies may not like it but the truth is that surveillance , quarantine and better living conditions got rid of smallpox – not the smallpox vaccine .
When the World Health Organization campaign to rid the world of smallpox was at its height the number of cases of smallpox went up each time there was a large scale ( and expensive ) mass vaccination of populations in susceptible countries .
As a result of this the WHO changed its strategy .
Mass vaccination programmes were abandoned and replaced with surveillance , isolation and quarantine .
For example , in the 1960s Sierra Leone had the highest rate of smallpox in the world .
The country got rid of smallpox in just over a year – largely by the simple process of identifying and isolating patients with the disease .
The myth that smallpox was eradicated through a mass vaccination programme is just that – a myth .
It is worth pointing out that Edward Jenner , widely feted as the inventor of the smallpox vaccine , tried out the first smallpox vaccination on his own 10 month old son .
His son remained mentally retarded until his death at the age of 21 .
Jenner refused to have his second child vaccinated .
TUBERCULOSIS
Vaccination against tuberculosis is often given as the reason why this disease stopped being quite the threat to life that it had been in the 18th century .
But again , this is n’t true .
Robert Koch discovered the pathogen that causes TB back in 1883 .
After that BCG vaccination was introduced and then , subsequently , mass treatment programmes were devised with chemotherapy .
None of these discoveries or introductions had any effect on the incidence of tuberculosis .
Contracting TB does n’t provide any immunity against a second infection .
And if a natural infection does n’t provide protection then a vaccination certainly wo n’t provide protection .
How on earth can it ?
It was noticed decades ago that in the lung sanatoriums that specialised in the treatment of TB patients there was no difference in the survival rates of patients who had been ‘ protected ’ against TB with BCG vaccination when compared to the survival rates of patients who had received no such ‘ protection ’ .
The tuberculosis vaccination ( the Bacillus Calmette - Guerin – known as BCG ) consists of a weakened , living bovine mycobacterium .
The vaccine was used for many years but a WHO trial in India showed that the vaccine offers no protection against the disease .
Indeed , when new cases of tuberculosis increased annually in the areas where people had been vaccinated against the disease the trial seemed to suggest that there might be a link between the vaccine and outbreaks of the disease .
Many countries have now abandoned the TB vaccine – and have no plans to reintroduce it even though the disease is once again a major health problem .
DIPTHERIA
Vaccination against diphtheria was introduced to Germany in 1925 .
After the introduction of the vaccine the number of cases of diphtheria steadily increased until , shortly after the Second World War , production of the vaccine was halted .
There was a decline in the incidence of the disease which coincided with the fact that the vaccination was no longer being used .
When the vaccine was subsequently reintroduced the decline in the incidence of the disease slowed down .
As with whooping cough , tetanus and other diseases the incidence , and number of deaths from diphtheria , were in decline long before the vaccine was introduced .
POLIO
Paralysis caused by poliomyelitis is now unheard of in Germany .
But every year there are some cases of paralysis caused by the oral polio vaccine .
In America the incidence of polio increased dramatically ( by around 50 % ) after the introduction of mass immunisation .
In some States the incidence of polio roughly doubled after the polio vaccine was introduced .
The number of deaths from polio had fallen dramatically before the first polio vaccine was introduced .
As with other infectious diseases the significance of polio dropped as better sanitation , better housing , cleaner water and more food were all made available in the second half of the nineteenth century .
It was social developments rather than medical ones which increased human resistance to infectious diseases .
Proof that the introduction of the polio vaccine was n’t the success it is often made out to be is n’t difficult to find .
In Tennessee , US , the number of polio victims the year before vaccination became compulsory was 119 .
The year after vaccination was introduced the figure rose to 386 .
In North Carolina , the number of cases before vaccination was introduced was 78 , while the number after the vaccine became compulsory rose to 313 .
There are similar figures for other American states .
The fact is that polio ( like many other infectious diseases ) comes in cycles .
When a disease is at a high point in its cycle the authorities ( egged on by doctors and drug companies ) will use this to frighten citizens into agreeing to be vaccinated .
And when a disease is at a low point in its natural cycle it is often vaccination programmes which get the credit .
This is exactly what happened with polio .
However , whether or not the polio vaccine actually works is , for many people , a relatively unimportant health issue .
Of far more significance is the fact ( revealed in my book Why Animal Experiments Must Stop in 1991 ) that millions of people who were given the polio vaccine as children in the 1950s and 1960s may now be at a greatly increased risk of developing cancer .
Although an early breakthrough in the development of a polio vaccine was made in 1949 with the aid of a human tissue culture , monkey kidney tissue was used when the first practical vaccine was prepared in the 1950s .
The monkey tissue was used simply because that was standard laboratory practice , but no one realised that one of the viruses commonly found in monkey kidney cells can cause cancer in human beings .
( As a side issue this is yet another example of the stupidity of using animal tissue in the treatment of human patients .
The popularity of using transplants derived from animals suggests that doctors and scientists have learned nothing from this error .
I sometimes despair of those who claim to be in the healing profession . )
Bone , brain , liver and lung cancers have all been linked to the monkey kidney virus SV40 and something like seventeen million people who were given the polio vaccine in the 1950s and 1960s are probably now at risk .
Moreover , there now seems to be evidence that the virus may be passed on to the children of those who were given the contaminated vaccine .
The SV40 virus from the polio vaccine has already been found in cancers which have developed both in individuals who were given the vaccine as protection against polio and in the children of individuals who were given the vaccine .
It seems inconceivable that the virus could have got into the tumours other than through the polio vaccine .
The American government was warned of this danger back in 1956 but the doctor who made the discovery was ignored and her laboratory was closed down .
Surprise , surprise .
It was five years after this discovery before drug companies started screening out the virus .
And even then Britain had millions of doses of the infected polio vaccine in stock .
There is no evidence that the government withdrew the vaccine .
In Britain official records which would identify those who received the contaminated vaccine were all destroyed by the Department of Health in 1987 .
Oddly enough this means that no one can take legal action against the government .
Gosh .
Another surprise .
How do these bastards sleep at night ?
WHOOPING COUGH
Throughout the 1970s and the 1980s I was a critic of a number of vaccines – most notably the whooping cough vaccine .
The following essay on the whooping cough vaccine appeared in 1988 in my book The Health Scandal .
The story of the whooping cough vaccine provides us with a remarkable example of dishonesty and deceit in medicine .
There has been controversy about the whooping cough vaccine for many years but in the UK the Department of Health and Social Security has , through the years , consistently managed to convince the majority of medical and nursing staff to support the official line that the vaccine is both safe and effective .
The official DHSS line has for years paid little attention to the facts .
Put bluntly the DHSS ( on behalf of successive governments ) has consistently lied about the risks and problems associated with the whooping cough vaccine .
I will explain exactly why I think that governments have lied to their employers ( the public ) a little later .
For the time being I would like to concentrate on the facts .
The first point that should be made is that although official spokesmen claim otherwise , the whooping cough vaccine has never had much of an influence on the number of children dying from whooping cough .
The dramatic fall in the number of deaths caused by the disease came well before the vaccine was widely available and was , historians agree , the result of improved public health measures and , indirectly , the use of antibiotics .
It was in 1957 that the whooping cough vaccine was first introduced nationally in Britain – although the vaccine was tried out in the late 1940s and the early 1950s .
But the incidence of whooping cough , and the number of children dying from the disease , had both fallen very considerably well before 1957 .
So , for example , while doctors reported 170,000 cases of whooping cough in 1950 they reported only about 80,000 cases in 1955 .
The introduction of the vaccine really did n’t make very much , if any , difference to the fall in the incidence of the disease .
Even today ( 1988 ) thirty years after the introduction of the vaccine , whooping cough cases are still running at about 1,000 a week in Britain .
Similarly , the figures show that the introduction of the vaccine had no effect on the number of children dying from whooping cough .
The mortality rate associated with the disease had been falling appreciably since the early part of the twentieth century and rapidly since the 1930s and 1940s – showing a particularly steep decline after the introduction of the sulphonamide drugs .
Whooping cough is undoubtedly an extremely unpleasant disease but it has not been a major killer for many years .
Successive governments have frequently forecast fresh whooping cough epidemics but none of the forecast epidemics has produced the devastation predicted .
My second point is that the whooping cough vaccine is neither very efficient nor is it safe .
The efficiency of the vaccine is of subsidiary interest – although thousands of children who have been vaccinated do still get the disease – the greatest controversy surrounds the safety of the vaccine .
The DHSS has always claimed that serious adverse reactions to the whooping cough vaccine are extremely rare and the official suggestion is that the risk of a child being brain damaged by the vaccine is no higher than one in 100,000 .
Now , leaving aside the fact that I find a risk of one in 100,000 unacceptable , it is interesting to examine this figure a little more closely , for after a little research work it becomes clear that the figure of one in 100,000 is a guess .
Over the last decade or two , numerous researchers have studied the risks of brain damage following whooping cough vaccination and their results make fascinating reading .
Between 1960 and 1981 , for example , nine reports were published showing that the risk of brain damage varied between one in 6,000 and one in 100,000 .
The average was a risk of one in 50,000 .
It is clear from these figures that the DHSS has simply chosen the figure which showed the whooping cough vaccine to be least risky .
Moreover , the one in 100,000 figure did not come from any rock solid research .
It was itself an estimate – a guess .
These are just a couple of the important facts about the whooping cough vaccine that have been ignored or overlooked or disguised by the DHSS .
But they are not the only facts that have been distorted .
Although the DHSS consistently claims that whooping cough is a dangerous disease , the figures show that it is not the indiscriminate killer it is made out to be .
Whooping cough causes around four deaths a year in Britain .
Compare that to approximately 300 deaths caused by tuberculosis and 100 deaths caused by meningitis .
Most of the victims of whooping cough are babies under three months old .
That fact is particularly important because the vaccine is never given to babies under three months old .
The truth about the whooping cough vaccine is that it has always been a disaster .
The vaccine has already been withdrawn in other countries because of the amount of brain damage associated with its use .
In Japan , Sweden and West Germany the vaccine has been omitted from regular vaccination schedules .
In America two out of three whooping cough vaccine manufacturers have stopped making the vaccine because of the cost of lawsuits .
On 6th December 1985 the Journal of the American Medical Association published a major report showing that the whooping cough vaccine is , without doubt , linked to the development of serious brain damage .
And even here in Britain the DHSS has been so worried about the vaccine that for ten years it has been paying research workers at Porton Down to search for ways to make a new , safer , more effective whooping cough vaccine .
At long last , after a £ 5 million research programme , a new vaccine is indeed being tested on children .
The final nail in the coffin lid is the fact that the British Government has already paid out compensation to the parents of some 800 children who have been brain damaged by the whooping cough vaccine .
Some parents who accepted damages a few years ago were given £ 10,000 .
More recently parents have been getting £ 20,000 .
It is a startling fact that for many years now the whooping cough vaccine has been killing or severely injuring more children than the disease itself .
Since 1979 around 800 children ( or their parents ) have received money from the Government for vaccine produced brain damage .
In the same period less than 100 children have been killed by whooping cough .
I think that makes the vaccine more dangerous than the disease .
And that , surely is quite unacceptable .
So , why has the DHSS continued to encourage doctors to use the vaccine ?
There are two possible explanations .
The first explanation is the more generous of the two and concerns the Government ’s responsibility for the health of the community as a whole .
The theory here is that by encouraging millions of parents to have their children vaccinated the Government can reduce the incidence of the disease in the community .
In the long run this ( theoretically ) reduces the risk of there being any future epidemics of whooping cough .
In other words the government risks the lives of individual children for the good of the next generation .
The second , less charitable explanation is that the DHSS is looking after its own interests by continuing to claim that the whooping cough vaccine is safe enough to use .
In 1987 there were 258 sets of parents preparing to sue the DHSS for damages .
They claim that the whooping cough vaccine damaged their children .
They are claiming something in the region of £ 250,000 each .
If the DHSS withdrew the whooping cough vaccine , it would be admitting that the vaccine was dangerous .
And it would obviously lose its court cases .
Such an admission would , therefore , cost it 258 times £ 250,000 .
And that would be just the beginning for there are , you will remember , 800 sets of parents who have already received payments from the Government of either £ 10,000 or £ 20,000 .
If the DHSS admitted liability ( and those payments did not include an admission of liability ) then it is fair to assume that the DHSS would find itself with several hundred more lawsuits and a damages bill running into billions of pounds .
Whatever explanation you consider most accurate the unavoidable fact is that the government ( in the form of the DHSS ) has consistently lied about the whooping cough vaccine , has distorted the truth and has deceived both the medical profession ( for the majority of doctors and nurses who give these injections accept the recommendations made by the DHSS without question ) and millions of parents .
The DHSS may have saved itself a tidy sum in damages .
But the cost to the nation ’s health has been enormous .
And this , remember , is merely one more example of the way in which the truth has been distorted by those whom we trust to provide us with honest , accurate advice about medicine and health care .
( The above account of the whooping cough vaccine is taken from The Health Scandal by Vernon Coleman , published by Sidgwick and Jackson in 1988 . )
MORE AND MORE VACCINES
As the years have gone by the number of vaccines available has increased steadily .
Modern American children receive around thirty vaccinations by the time they go to school .
A decade or two ago the only vaccines available were against a relatively small number of diseases including smallpox , tuberculosis , polio , cholera , diphtheria , tetanus and whooping cough .
Today , the number of available vaccines seems to grow almost daily .
In the past vaccines were produced against major killer diseases .
Today vaccines are produced against diseases such as measles , mumps and chickenpox which have been traditionally regarded as relatively benign inconveniences of childhood .
In the UK the death rate from measles had dropped dramatically decades before the vaccine was introduced .
Today the incidence of measles is rising again .
In attempts to persuade parents to have their children vaccinated against measles governments and doctors around the world have thought up an apparently unending – and hysterical – series of scare campaigns .
Now that there is a vaccine against it measles has , by a strange coincidence , stopped being an annoying childhood disease and has , instead , become a deadly killer .
Scares often consist of claiming that a major epidemic is just around the corner and that only vaccination can offer protection .
I have lost count of the number of whooping cough epidemics which governments have wrongly forecast .
Governments and their advisers are either unbelievably stupid or else they are deliberately lying to help boost drug company profits .
Of course , countless scientists around the world have spent vast fortunes trying to create a vaccine against AIDS ( in view of the fact that AIDS may not exist – see later in this edition of VCHL – they may find this trickier than expected ) .
And scientists have apparently developed a banana vaccine by creating genetically engineered banana plants .
There are plans to develop bananas which ‘ protect ’ against hepatitis B , measles , yellow fever and poliomyelitis .
Other scientists have developed a genetically engineered potato which it may be possible to use as a vaccine against cholera .
The active part of the potato remains active during the process of cooking and so a portion of genetically engineered chips could soon be a vaccine against cholera .
( I am not making this up . )
Naturally , the pharmaceutical industry is constantly searching for more and more new vaccines .
I have lost count of the number of times I have read of researchers working on a vaccine to prevent cancer .
Every year new flu jabs appear on the market .
There are , so I am told , vaccines in the pipeline for just about everything ranging from asthma to earache .
There is a planned genetically engineered vaccine which will provide protection against forty different diseases .
The vaccine , which will contain the raw DNA of all those different diseases , will be given to newborn babies to provide them with protection for life .
Oh , goody .
I do n’t know about you but I can no longer keep up with what is going on .
I have long since given up trying to work out which vaccines are very dangerous and which are just a bit dangerous – and to whom .
Nor can I keep up with which vaccines might work a bit and which do n’t seem to do much good at all .
Does anyone know what the hell happens inside the body when all these different vaccinations are given together ?
Do different vaccines work with or against one another ?
What about the risk of interactions ?
Exactly how does the immune system cope when it is suddenly bombarded with so much foreign material ?
I am an enthusiastic supporter of the principle of preventive medicine .
It is usually much easier to avoid an illness than it is to treat one .
Vaccination programmes are usually sold to the public as though they are an integral part of a general preventive medicine programme .
But over the years I have steadily come around to the view that vaccination programmes cannot truly be described as preventive medicine but are , rather , a part of the interventionist approach to medical care .
DOCTORS REFUSE TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE
One of the big problems with vaccination is that it has , for many years , been nigh on impossible to discuss the issue of vaccination without arousing great antagonism from doctors and politicians .
Many parents who have tried to discuss vaccination programmes offered to their children have been startled by the response .
Doctors who will discuss other issues in a rational and understanding way suddenly become hysterical when it is suggested that the value of a vaccination programme be discussed .
Doctors , nurses and health visitors often put a great deal of pressure on parents to force them to have their children vaccinated .
It is common for doctors to refuse to discuss the issue and it is common for doctors to use a great deal of emotional blackmail to force parents to have their children vaccinated .
All this is made even more worrying by the fact that these days doctors often have a personal financial interest in making sure that their patients are vaccinated .
( For example , doctors in general practice often get a financial bonus if they can show that a high percentage of their patients have been vaccinated . )
Instead of providing members of the public with the facts politicians and civil servants have frequently introduced blatantly misleading and downright dishonest advertising campaigns in an attempt to bully patients and parents into accepting vaccination .
Diseases which are often short lived and relatively harmless may be described as deadly and lethal while the side effects associated with particular vaccines are often ignored , minimised , trivialised or even hidden completely .
In my experience it is often extremely difficult to find the truth about a particular vaccine .
GPs who rely upon official information ( from the government ) probably find it difficult to discover the whole truth and I suspect that most of the doctors and nurses who are such enthusiastic supporters and promoters of vaccination programmes do so because they innocently and naively believe what they have been told and have no idea of the real facts .
One of the arguments often put forward in favour of vaccination is that if a large enough number of people are vaccinated then the community will benefit because fewer people will catch the disease in question .
The individual who does not get vaccinated ( or who refuses to allow his or her child to be vaccinated ) will be accused of being irresponsibly selfish .
In some parts of the world it is now illegal for parents not to have their children vaccinated .
Children in the US have been arrested for not having valid vaccination certificates .
Apart from the fact that it is odd to see doctors and drug companies ( most of whom are hardly left wing in their day to day approach to life ) embracing this curiously communistic approach to health care ( with the rights of the individual being regarded as less important than the future prospects of the community ) the big flaw is that all the evidence shows that vaccination just does n’t work this way .
Survey after survey has shown that the incidence of a disease in a community simply is n’t related to the number of people who have been vaccinated .
FLAWS AND MYTHS
The whole business of vaccination is riddled with flaws and myths .
Here are just a couple of the most obvious ones .
First , vaccines simply are n’t very effective .
Much to the annoyance of doctors and drug companies , viruses and other organisms do n’t just sit still and remain the same for year after year .
They are constantly changing .
And new organisms are being formed all the time .
Attempts to prevent influenza by giving flu jabs are , in my view , utterly futile .
Every year scientists , drug companies and doctors enthuse about the latest anti-flu vaccine .
But each year ’s new vaccine is based on last year ’s brand of flu .
And it will not necessarily provide any protection against the latest flu bug .
While your doctor is busy jabbing you and your family with the latest vaccine a new flu bug is probably on its way from China , Australia or South America .
The result is that vaccines are , at best , unpredictable and at worst utterly ineffective .
During outbreaks of whooping cough around half the victims are people who have been vaccinated .
( At least one important study has shown that whooping cough epidemics mainly occur among children who have had the full vaccination course . )
Research from Sweden and Italy has shown that the whooping cough vaccine is effective in 48 % and 36 % of those to whom it is given .
Hardly reassuring when one considers the risks involved .
Measles vaccines are similarly often ineffective .
In an attempt to cope with this doctors usually simply suggest giving booster shots .
Naturally , this has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that abandoning the vaccine would damage drug company ( and doctor ) profits whereas giving booster profits would increase drug company ( and doctor ) profits .
Measles used to be a relatively mild disease that usually affected children .
Today it seems to be a more serious disease which often affects young adults .
Measles is now a significant disease among college students who have been vaccinated against it .
( Incidentally , there is now some evidence to suggest that trying to stop children getting the typical childhood infections is n’t a good idea for another reason .
It seems possible that children who do n’t get many infectious diseases in childhood may be more likely to develop cancer later in life .
The explanation for this is that those childhood infections help the immune system to develop . )
Failure rates with other vaccines are also high .
There is much evidence to show that the polio vaccine may fail ( some outbreaks of polio seem more likely to affect the vaccinated than the unvaccinated ) and one study showed that a vaccination given to protect against meningitis increased a child ’s risk of contracting the disease by five times .
Other studies have shown that the vaccine increases susceptibility to complications .
The vaccine against tuberculosis has been estimated to be effective between 0 % and 80 % of the time .
( The Heaf test which is used to measure tuberculin sensitivity can be something of a mystery .
False negatives and false positives are possible .
A positive test could mean that the patient is allergic to the test , has had a TB infection or is immune to TB .
Take your pick . )
Second , the side effects which may be associated with vaccines are invariably worse than those who give and enthuse about the vaccines are prepared to admit .
There is no such thing as an entirely safe vaccine .
There are today more people in Germany suffering from vaccination damage than there are people suffering from AIDS .
( This is probably true for most other so called ‘ developed ’ countries . )
The amount of money being wasted on AIDS research runs into billions of any currency you like to name .
( I am not saying that research into this disease is inevitably useless but that the research which is being done is probably useless . )
The amount of money being spent on studying vaccine damage is approximately nothing .
Some side effects are relatively mild but nevertheless inconvenient .
For example , the flu jab regularly causes symptoms which are virtually indistinguishable from flu itself .
Other side effects may be crippling .
For example , the side effects which may be associated with the whooping cough vaccine can cause serious , life long damage .
For over two centuries doctors have persisted with vaccination programmes despite the fact that there has never been any convincing evidence to show that they work or , indeed , are safe .
Moreover , to their eternal shame , doctors have consistently refused to debate the issue of vivisection and have done everything they could to prevent the public discovering the truth about an activity which has been extremely profitable both for the medical profession and for the drugs industry .
In the 1970s , when I wrote extensively about the hazards of specific vaccination programmes ( particularly the whooping cough vaccine ) , I was widely blamed by doctors and politicians for the fact that many parents were refusing to have their children vaccinated .
My only weapon against the propaganda techniques employed by the government was the truth .
At the time I was writing a syndicated newspaper column which appeared in a number of local newspapers .
Time and time again doctors put pressure on local newspaper editors to encourage them to drop my column on the grounds that by printing the facts about the whooping cough vaccine ( as far as I know , no one ever disputed the accuracy of the facts I printed ) I was threatening the safety of the nation !
YET MORE FLAWS AND FAILURES
Evidence that vaccines may do more harm than good is supported by experiences with animals .
Between 1968 and 1988 there were considerably more outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in countries where vaccination against foot and mouth disease was compulsory than in countries where there were no such regulations .
Epidemics always started in countries where vaccination was compulsory .
This experience clearly shows that the alleged advantage to the community of vaccinating individuals simply does not exist .
Similar observations were made about the hyena dog , which was in 1989 threatened with extinction .
Scientists vaccinated individual animals to protect them against rabies but more than a dozen packs then died within a year – of rabies .
This happened even in areas where rabies had never been seen before .
When researchers tried using a non-infectious form of the pathogen ( to prevent the deaths of the remaining animals ) all members of seven packs of dogs disappeared .
And yet the rabies vaccine is now compulsory in many parts of the world .
Is it not possible that it is the vaccine which is keeping this disease alive ?
Horses are regularly and repeatedly vaccinated with a whole range of vaccines .
Some vets now believe that these vaccinations damage the immune systems of the animals concerned ( though most vets , like most doctors , are frightened to speak out and attack vaccines ) .
Similarly , what evidence is there to show that the many vaccines given to family pets are of value – other than to the companies making the vaccines and the vets giving the jabs ?
Those who eat meat should be aware that cattle ( and other animals reared for slaughter ) are regularly vaccinated .
The meat that is taken from those animals may , therefore , contain vaccine residues in addition to hormones , antibiotics and other drugs .
THE BOTTOM LINE
I have for decades argued that some vaccines may be unnecessary and / or even potentially dangerous in some circumstances , and may sometimes be promoted too enthusiastically by both politicians and doctors .
Tragically , many doctors seem to know very little about the vaccines they advocate .
In my view , if a doctor wants to vaccinate you or a member of your family you should insist that he confirm in writing that the vaccine is both entirely safe and absolutely essential .
You may notice his enthusiasm for the vaccine suddenly diminish .
The first vaccine which really attracted my attention was the whooping cough vaccine .
For years now whooping cough has not been a major killer disease – not , at least , in most westernised , developed countries and for many years I have believed – and publicly argued – that the number of children allegedly brain damaged by the vaccine has , during the last decade or two , probably exceeded the number allegedly killed by the disease itself .
Many readers who have tried to discuss vaccines with their doctors have complained that their physicians simply insist that the whooping cough vaccine is perfectly safe and wo n’t even discuss it with them .
I firmly believe that all parents should be told the facts so that they can make up their own minds about the value of any vaccine .
Deciding whether or not to have a child vaccinated is a big decision .
It is n’t something to be done lightly .
The wrong decision can easily lead to a lifetime of regrets .
Sadly , however , one big problem is undoubtedly the fact that many doctors simply do n’t know very much about the safety or effectiveness of vaccines .
They know what the government tells them and they may know what the company which makes the vaccine tells them .
But I do n’t trust governments and I do n’t think that drug companies are always the best source of unbiased information about effectiveness and safety .
In my view all parents should have the right to decide whether or not their child has any vaccine .
They should not just be told by their doctor that they must accept his assurance that the vaccine is perfectly safe and completely essential .
‘ My doctor implied that I was just being stupid when I said I was n’t sure that I wanted my child vaccinated , ’ complained one reader .
‘ His attitude was that it had nothing to do with me and that I should just allow him to do whatever he thought best . ’
‘ My wife came home crying , ’ complained another reader .
‘ She had had the temerity to question her doctor about vaccination .
He told her that if she refused to have our child vaccinated he would call in the social workers since in his view our refusal to allow vaccination made us unfit to be parents .
What really upset me is that my wife had n’t refused to have our child vaccinated .
She just wanted to talk about it . ’
This paternalistic attitude seems strong among doctors and other health workers , most of whom seem to prefer to answer any questions with abuse rather than facts .
I believe that all parents should make up their own minds about whether or not to have their children vaccinated .
Before you allow your doctor to vaccine your child ( or you ) ask your doctor some questions .
Essential questions to ask include :
How dangerous is the disease for which the vaccine is being given ?
How effective is the vaccine ?
How dangerous is the vaccine ?
Which patients should not be given the vaccine ?
I cannot give you specific advice about whether or not you should have your child vaccinated against whooping cough , measles or any other disease .
It would be dangerous and irresponsible for me to try to offer you specific advice because we are all different and circumstances change from day to day .
My own personal view is that vaccines are unsafe and worthless .
I will not allow myself to be vaccinated again .
Readers of VCHL must , however , make their own judgements based on all the available evidence .
I strongly recommend that anyone contemplating vaccination discuss the issue with their own medical adviser .
The bottom line is that infectious diseases are least likely to affect ( and to kill ) those who have healthy immune systems .
I no longer believe that vaccines have any role to play in the protection of the community or the individual .
Vaccines may be profitable but , in my view , they are neither safe nor effective .
I prefer to put my trust in building up my immune system .

The protection of our health is one of the most fundamental human rights ; and yet , every year , millions of people around the world die from preventable health problems such as heart attacks , strokes and cancer .
Scientific findings have shown that these diseases , and many others , can be prevented using side - effect free natural remedies .
To date , over 10,000 studies have been published in scientific journals , most of which are accessible online , demonstrating the vital importance of vitamins and other non-patentable natural remedies in the protection of our health .
These findings are being ignored , and even actively attacked , for one reason only :
They threaten the multi-billion dollar business with patented pharmaceutical drugs , many of which have questionable efficacy and serious side effects .
In addition to expanding their global “ business with disease ” , these same corporate interests are strategically developing a second global market affecting every life : our food .
Whilst a diet rich in natural fruits and vegetables is known to have health - enhancing effects , there is growing evidence that patented genetically - modified ( GM ) foods have harmful and incalculable long - term effects on human and environmental health .
By means of patents , products such as GM food , synthetic food additives and synthetic chemical pesticides have been developed into multi-billion dollar global markets .
To protect their lucrative global markets , the chemical / pharmaceutical multinationals are abusing national governments and even international organizations , such as the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) of the United Nations .
As a result , the WHO and FAO are co-sponsoring the so - called “ Codex Alimentarius Commission ” , which is trying to draw up global standards that :
Restrict free access to vital health information and to non-patentable natural remedies , such as vitamins ;
Encourage the production of patented GM foods ;
Weaken the international definition of the word “ organic ” thus enabling food produced using chemical substances and unnatural agricultural methods to be labelled as “ organic ” ;
Encourage the use of patented synthetic food additives ;
Encourage the use of toxic patented synthetic chemical pesticides .
In this situation , we the people of this planet stand at a crossroads :
Do we want to preserve our fundamental right to effective natural health and natural healthy food for ourselves and our children , or do we knowingly hand over these basic areas of human life to global corporate interests for generations to come ?
When making this important decision , we are well - advised to learn from history , where , once before , complacency had devastating consequences .
Three - quarters of a century ago , the chemical / pharmaceutical cartel was determined to seize control of the newly - emerging and highly profitable global investment markets of patented chemical and drug products .
To that effect , the largest chemical cartel at that time – IG Farben , consisting of the companies Bayer , BASF , Hoechst and others – strategically invested in the rise of the Nazis to power and supported them with the giant arsenal of explosives and other chemicals without which WWII would not have been possible .
While their military and political executors were sentenced during the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal , the corporate interests that brought the Nazis to power largely escaped justice .
Encouraged by that fact , the now globally - operating chemical / pharmaceutical cartel developed their patented chemical drugs – many of them tested in Auschwitz , Buchenwald , and other concentration camps – into global markets for “ chemotherapy ” and other patented drug categories .
In recent years , the scientific evidence has accumulated that vitamins and other plant - derived natural substances are the solution to control many of today 's most common diseases .
These discoveries of the scientific evidence regarding the powerful health benefits of natural substances – made only in recent years , although it could have been established half a century ago – mean that millions of patients around the world have been sacrificed to the pharmaceutical investment business with disease .
The discovery that triggered the reactivation of the dormant ‘ Codex Alimentarius ’ activities by the pharmaceutical drug cartel in 1995 was the discovery of the connection between cardiovascular disease and scurvy .
This discovery alone threatened the multi-billion dollar market of patented cardiovascular drugs – the single largest global drug market .
After initial efforts to block the dissemination of this discovery in the US had failed , the global ban via Codex Alimentarius became a primary target of the cartel .
Mindful of the above , and in consideration of the serious consequences that inaction would have upon ourselves and generations to come :
We appeal to all responsible politicians in all countries throughout the world to take action to guarantee every citizen the right to free and unrestricted access to vitamin therapies and other natural remedies .
We demand that all citizens should have access to safe , nutritious food that is free from genetic modification and dangerous patented chemicals .
We call upon all responsible politicians to protect the fundamental right to good health of every citizen and take all steps necessary to prevent the Codex Alimentarius Commission from threatening the health and lives of the six billion people living today and generations to come .

Sometimes a study comes along that is just so ... well , words fail me .
Let 's turn to the researchers ' words instead .
The introduction , from researchers at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom , states : " We hypothesise that excessive confectionery consumption increases the likelihood of violence in adulthood . "
Seriously .
To test this hypothesis , the researchers used the British Cohort Study to obtain information on the frequency of sweets consumption at age 10 and on violence convictions by age 34 .
They found that 69 % of people convicted of violence had in fact eaten sweets nearly every day when they were younger .
Only 42 % of those who had been nonviolent until age 34 reported such daily consumption .
The study concludes : " One plausible mechanism is that persistently using confectionery to control childhood behaviour might prevent children from learning to defer gratification , in turn biasing decision processes towards more impulsive behaviour , biases that are strongly associated with delinquency .
Furthermore , childhood confectionery consumption may nurture a taste that is maintained into adulthood , exposing adults to the effects of additives often found in sweetened food , the consumption of which may also contribute towards adult aggression .
Moreover , although parental attitudes were associated with adult violence , the effect of diet was robust having controlled for these attitudinal variables .
Irrespective of the causal mechanism , which warrants further attention , targeting resources at improving childhood diet may improve health and reduce aggression . "
I 'm not making this up .
Here 's the study .
It was published in the October issue of British Journal of Psychiatry .

On September 2 , Justin Lee and Oliver Yeh successfully took these images of Earth 's curvature and the blackness of space using only a weather balloon and off - the - shelf components — without complicated hacks .
Total cost : $ 148 .
Here 's how they did it .

First up , their rig used a Canon A470 camera with 8GB SD card that they bought used on Amazon .
And instead of the expensive GPS radios commonly used by weather balloons , they used a prepaid Motorola i290 GPS cell phone to receive location text messages .
The Earth 's stratosphere can get as cold as - 67 degrees fahrenheit ( - 55 Celsius ) , but they could n't afford expensive temperature - resistant housing .
The solution : a styrofoam beer cooler , and an instant hand warmer .
Awesome .

Their low - cost balloon - launch platform reached 17.5 miles high , into near - space .
Using the GPS phone to track its location , they found the rig 20 miles away from the launch site about 5 hours later .
Total weight was 800g ( about 28 ounces ) .
Apparently FAA regulations only apply to balloons with payloads over four pounds .

A MAN carried a police - style baton , nunchucks and a ceremonial throwing knife because of his religious beliefs , a court heard .
James Fry , 22 , of Oakfield Road , Benfleet , admitted to carrying the baton in Ferry Road , Benfleet , when he appeared at Basildon Crown Court yesterday .
Fry was also charged with two further counts of possession of an offensive weapon , after being found with two sets of nunchucks and the knife at the same time on February 14 this year .
But those charges were dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service accepted he brought them out of the house by mistake , and owns them because they are part of his following of the pagan religion .
Lynne Shirley , defending , said : “ There is no suggestion he brandished these items , or he intended to use them dangerously .
They are important to him as they are part of his paganism .
“ He also uses the nun-chucks to strengthen his wrists . ”
Recorder David Holborn said the court would take possession of the baton , but agreed to let Fry keep the other items after inspecting them and concluding they were more ornamental than dangerous .
Fry has adult attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , which makes it difficult for him to concentrate and leaves him particularly susceptible to stressful situations .
He has no previous convictions and was released on unconditional bail .
Fry was told to return to Chelmsford Crown Court on November 16 for sentencing , following an assessment of his mental health and the compilation of a pre-sentence report .
So much for the Housing Rebound :
“ Mortgage applications to purchase homes in the U.S. plunged last week to the lowest level in almost nine years as Americans waited for the outcome of deliberations to extend a government tax credit .
The Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of applications to buy a house dropped 12 percent in the week ended Nov. 6 to 220.9 , the lowest level since Dec. 2000 .
The group ’s refinancing gauge rose 11 percent as interest rates decreased , pushing the overall index up 3.2 percent .
The drop in buying plans points to the risk that the recent stabilization in housing will unravel without government help .
In a bid to sustain the recovery , Congress passed and the administration signed a bill last week to extend jobless benefits and incentives for first - time homebuyers , adding a provision that also made funds available to current owners . ”
PHOENIX , Nov. 13 ( UPI ) -- Arizona 's booming population growth polluted its air at a faster rate than any other state between 1990 and 2007 , researchers said .
The amount of carbon dioxide pollution from automobile exhaust and electric power generation in Arizona grew 61 percent between 1990 and 2007 , researchers for the advocacy group Environment Arizona said Thursday .

That increase was more than three times the national average , The Arizona Republic reported Friday .
Carbon dioxide , which contributes to respiratory illness , is the most common of greenhouse gases researchers say are increasing temperatures and changing Earth 's climate .
Air pollution levels could be reduced by increasing renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar , and by more closely regulating coal - burning power plants , Environment Arizona spokesman Bret Fanshaw said .
" More pollution than ever before is n't a record we want to set , " Fanshaw said .
" It 's time to take back control of our energy future .
We can drive the economy without driving up pollution . "

Privatisation to Subvert Palestinian Hopes of Restitution
TZIPORI — Amin Muhammad Ali , a 74 - year - old refugee from a destroyed Palestinian village in northern Israel , says he only feels truly at peace when he stands among his ancestors ’ graves .
The cemetery , surrounded on all sides by Jewish homes and farms , is a small time capsule , transporting Mr Muhammad Ali — known to everyone as Abu Arab — back to the days when this place was known by an Arabic name , Saffuriya , rather than its current Hebrew name , Tzipori .
Unlike most of the Palestinian refugees forced outside Israel ’s borders by the 1948 war that led to the creation of the Jewish state , Abu Arab and his family fled nearby , to a neighbourhood of Nazareth .
Refused the right to return to his childhood home , which was razed along with the rest of Saffuriya , he watched as the fields once owned by his parents were slowly taken over by Jewish immigrants , mostly from eastern Europe .
Today only Saffuriya ’s cemetery remains untouched .
Despite the loss of their village , the 4,500 refugees from Saffuriya and their descendants have clung to one hope : that the Jewish newcomers could not buy their land , only lease it temporarily from the state .
According to international law , Israel holds the property of more than four million Palestinian refugees in custodianship , until a final peace deal determines whether some or all of them will be allowed back to their 400 - plus destroyed Palestinian villages or are compensated for their loss .
But last week , in a violation of international law and the refugees ’ property rights that went unnoticed both inside Israel and abroad , Benjamin Netanyahu , the prime minister , forced through a revolutionary land reform .
The new law begins a process of creeping privatisation of much of Israel ’s developed land , including refugee property , said Oren Yiftachel , a geographer at Ben Gurion University in Beersheva .
Mr Netanyahu and the bill ’s supporters argue that the law will cut out a whole level of state bureaucracy , make land transactions simpler and more efficient , and cut house prices .
In practice , it will mean that the 200 Jewish families of Tzipori will be able to buy their homes , including a new cluster of bungalows that is being completed on land next to the cemetery that belonged to Abu Arab ’s parents .
The privatisation of Tzipori ’s refugee land will remove it from the control of an official known as the Custodian of Absentee Property , who is supposed to safeguard it for the refugees .
“ Now the refugees will no longer have a single address — Israel — for our claims , ” said Abu Arab .
“ We will have to make our case individually against many hundreds of thousands of private homeowners . ”
He added : “ Israel is like a thief who wants to hide his loot .
Instead of putting the stolen goods in one box , he moves it to 700 different boxes so it can not be found . ”
Mr Netanyahu was given a rough ride by Israeli legislators over the reform , though concern about the refugees ’ rights was not among the reasons for their protests .
Last month , he had to pull the bill at the last minute as its defeat threatened to bring down the government .
He forced it through on a second attempt last week but only after he had warned his coalition partners that they would be dismissed if they voted against it .
A broad coalition of opposition had formed to what was seen as a reversal of a central tenet of Zionism : that the territory Israel acquired in 1948 exists for the benefit not of Israelis but of Jews around the world .
In that spirit , Israel ’s founders nationalised not only the refugees ’ property but also vast swathes of land they confiscated from the remaining Palestinian minority who gained citizenship and now comprise a fifth of the population .
By the 1970s , 93 per cent of Israel ’s territory was in the hands of the state .
The disquiet provoked by Mr Netanyahu ’s privatisation came from a variety of sources : the religious right believes the law contravenes a Biblical injunction not to sell land promised by God ; environmentalists are concerned that developers will tear apart the Israeli countryside ; and Zionists publicly fear that oil - rich sheikhs from the Gulf will buy up the country .
Arguments from the Palestinian minority ’s leaders against the reform , meanwhile , were ignored — until Hizbollah ’s leader , Hassan Nasrallah , added his voice at the weekend .
In a statement , he warned that the law “ validates and perpetuates the crime of land and property theft from the Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Nakba ” .
Suhad Bishara , a lawyer from the Adalah legal centre for Israel ’s Palestinian minority , said the law had been carefully drafted to ensure that foreigners , including wealthy sheikhs , cannot buy land inside Israel .
“ Only Israeli citizens and anyone who can come to Israel under the Law of Return — that is , any Jew — can buy the lands on offer , so no ‘ foreigner ’ will be eligible . ”
Another provision in the law means that even internal refugees like Abu Arab , who has Israeli citizenship , will be prevented from buying back land that rightfully belongs to them , Ms Bishara said .
“ As is the case now in terms of leasing land , ” she explained , “ admissibility to buy land in rural communities like Tzipori will be determined by a selection committee whose job it will be to frustrate applications from Arab citizens . ”
Supporters of the law have still had to allay the Jewish opposition ’s concerns .
Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed that only a tiny proportion of Israeli territory — about four per cent — is up for privatisation .
But , according to Mr Yiftachel , who lobbied against the reform , that means about half of Israel ’s developed land will be available for purchase over the next few years .
And he suspects privatisation will not stop there .
“ Once this red line has been crossed , there is nothing to stop the government passing another law next year approving the privatisation of the rest of the developed areas , ” he said .
Ms Bishara said among the first refugee properties that would be put on the market were those in Israel ’s cities , such as Jaffa , Acre , Tiberias , Haifa and Lod , followed by homes in many of the destroyed villages like Saffuriya .
She said Adalah was already preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court on behalf of the refugees , and if unsuccessful would then take the matter to international courts .
Adalah has received inquiries from hundreds of Palestinian refugees from around the world asking what they can do to stop Israel selling their properties .
“ Many of them expressed an interest in suing Israel , ” she said .

Après Jean , Pierre ?
Suite au refus par la Société civile des producteurs phonographiques ( SCPP ) d'octroyer une aide à Pierre Sarkozy , producteur de rap ( il a notamment produit Doc Gynéco ) , pour l'un de ses projets , un conseiller de l'Elysée serait intervenu auprès de cette dernière pour qu'elle revienne sur sa décision et apporte son soutien au fils du président .
Selon le site Electronlibre .info , qui a révélé cette affaire samedi , la SCPP aurait alors promis de tout arranger et que , « lors de la prochaine commission , l’affaire serait réglée dans le sens qu’il convient » .
Ce coup de pouce de l'Elysée pour aider l'un des fils du président en intervenant auprès d'un organisme indépendant survient quelques semaines après la bronca entourant l'arrivée de Jean Sarkozy à la tête de l'Etablissement public de la Défense .
Présidée par le patron d'Universal Music France Pascal Nègre , la SCPP regroupe plusieurs dizaines de producteurs , dont les quatre majors ( Universal , EMI , Sony - BMG , Warner ) .
Elle est chargée de collecter la rémunération de ses membres auprès des utilisateurs de leurs catalogues ( sites web , radios etc . )
La loi lui impose de réserver une partie de ces sommes au soutien à la création , et c'est le rôle de la commission des aides , justement , de choisir les projets parmi les dossiers qu'elle reçoit .
Contacté par Rue89 , le directeur général de la SCPP , Marc Guez , a confirmé avoir reçu un appel de l'Elysée suite au refus , fin septembre , de la commission chargée d'attribuer les aides d'apporter son soutien au projet de Pierre Sarkozy , évalué à 80.000 euros au total .
« Nous avons préféré privilégier les membres de notre association .
Il est très rare que nous versions des aides à des non-membres , même si c'est déjà arrivé » , a-t - il expliqué , indiquant que Pierre Sarkozy n'est pas adhérent de la SCPP .
Marc
Guez se défend pour autant d'avoir subi des pressions et affirme que « ce conseiller ne [ lui ] a pas demandé de faire en sorte que cette aide lui soit versée » .
Une affirmation répétée dimanche après- midi par un communiqué officiel de l'organisme expliquant que , si « la SCPP a été interrogée » , ses services ou sa direction n'ont , à « aucun moment , directement ou indirectement , (... ) été sollicités pour accorder un traitement de faveur » à la société dont Pierre Sarkozy est actionnaire ( Mind 's corporation ) , « sous quelque forme que ce soit , pour le présent comme pour l’avenir . »
Sur ce point , Electronlibre .info , site spécialisé dans l'information sur les médias et la culture réputé fiable , assure qu'au contraire la SCPP a apporté toutes les « garanties » pour que cette aide soit in fine débloquée .
« Cela n'arrivera pas » , assure le président de la société de production Abeille Musique et membre de la SCPP , Yves Riesel , contacté par Libération dimanche .
Lui -même a longtemps siégé à la commission , et il la décrit comme « très formaliste et cherchant toujours à distribuer les sommes de façon équitable » .
Il confirme qu'avec la crise du disque et l'augmentation du nombre de dossiers , « cela fait des mois et des mois que les aides sont réservées aux membres » de la SCPP .
Et que rien n'empêche Pierre Sarkozy d'adhérer .
« Si ce petit garçon n'est pas capable de téléphoner lui - même à la SCPP pour demander des explications comme n'importe quel producteur et qu'il demande à l'Elysée de le faire , ça le regarde » , dit Yves Riesel .
Dans la soirée de dimanche , le conseiller culture et communication de Nicolas Sarkozy , Eric Garandeau , a précisé à l'AFP qu'il avait effectivement demandé des explications à la SCPP , affirmant qu'il était « sollicité en permanence par des producteurs à qui on a refusé une subvention et [ qu'il ] demande systématiquement les raisons du refus » .
Cette fois , il aurait en plus « pris deux précautions : j'ai mentionné par oral et écrit que l'Elysée ne demandait aucun traitement de faveur et je n'ai pas cité le nom de Pierre Sarkozy » .
Ezra Klein points out that according to the new Rasmussen poll , 80 percent of Americans claim to be satisfied with their current health insurance .
That 's up from 70 percent earlier in the year .
But Simon Johnson and James Kwak wrote in the Washington Post that many of these people have no fricking clue how good or awful their health insurance really is :
... until you have a serious illness , the kind where your plan 's limits and exclusions may kick in , how do you know if your health coverage is any good ?
And Digby quoted the following rundown of expensive and shitty policies that are about to get a whole lot shittier and expensive :
Among this year 's large rate increases on the individual market : • Anthem Blue Cross in California has notified about 80 % of its 800,000 individual policyholders of double - digit increases , many above 30 % .
Spokesman Ben Singer says rising medical costs are prompting the increases .
• Blue Cross of Michigan is seeking state approval for a 56 % increase in individual premiums .
Spokesman Andy Hetzel says the company needs to offset losses stemming from state rules making it the sole insurer required to take all applicants .
• Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oregon will raise rates for approximately 10,000 Washington state customers by 27.1 % on March 1 .
Another Washington insurer , LifeWise , raised rates 17.6 % on Jan. 1 , according to the Office of the Insurance Commissioner in Washington state .
By comparison , group health insurance premiums paid by employers rose about 5 % in 2008 , says a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation .
Some insurers say increases this year for individual policies are n't out of the ordinary .
Aetna , for example , says individual policy increases nationwide range from 8 % to 22 %
Good luck with that , town hall wingnuts .
Yep .
While these crazies are wasting their time and embarrassing themselves by repeating outlandish lies in public , their beloved health insurance providers are about to royally screw them .
One way or another .
Best .
Health .
Insurance .
Ever .
A research group that includes the University of Arizona has cracked corn 's genetic code , a landmark discovery that will allow scientists to develop new strains of crops that yield more food , provide better nutrition and are resistant to drought .
The findings are being published in a series of papers this week in the prestigious journal Science .
It 's an understatement to call this a tough achievement , researchers say .
In the simplest terms , it is like dumping a jigsaw puzzle with tens of thousands of pieces onto the floor and trying to figure out where they fit .
To make matters worse , lots of the pieces look the same .
Scientists have wanted to decode , or sequence , the corn genome for decades , but the computer technology has only recently been developed to allow them to fulfill this goal .
" We now have a blueprint for one of the most important crops in the world .
This blueprint is really going to help us move forward to ensure that the world will have a safe and stable food supply for future generations , " said Rod Wing , director of UA 's Arizona Genomics Institute and a co-author of the research .
Wing 's lab also was involved in another breakthrough , the sequencing of the rice genome , in 2005 .
Corn , the most widely grown crop in the United States , has a much more complicated genetic code than rice .
Over the years , researchers have developed different lines of corn suited for different climates and growing seasons .
But to truly adapt the plant for dramatically higher yields , they needed to break its genetic code .
Challenge for farmers
Making corn more adaptable is important as the world 's population grows , and farmers are faced with the challenge of having to grow more crops on smaller plots .
If the current population projections play out , the world will have to double its food supply in another 30 to 40 years , said Colin Kaltenbach , vice dean of UA 's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences .
That will be possible only through the types of genetic research going on now , he said .
UA has been working on solving the puzzle for more than a decade .
Wing 's lab first had to create genetic maps that showed where genes were located along single DNA molecules .
The maps served as the guides for the process of sequencing the genes .
In 2005 , the federal government poured $ 32 million into the effort with a group of universities creating the Maize Genome Sequencing Project .
UA worked on the project along with scientists from Washington University - St. Louis , Cold Harbor Laboratory and Iowa State University .
Now that the corn genome has been sequenced , plant breeders can use the information to speed the development of new lines of corn .
Wing , who was in Germany when the discovery was announced Thursday , said he is thrilled by the breakthrough .
" I wish I were there with my lab right now , popping a bottle of Champagne to celebrate , " he said .
" I 'll call them in the morning , and we 'll have a toast . "

( AP ) -- Toyota Motor Corp. says it has developed a way of steering a wheelchair by just detecting brain waves , without the person having to move a muscle or shout a command .
Toyota 's system , developed in a collaboration with researchers in Japan , is among the fastest in the world in analyzing brain waves , it said in a release Monday .
Past systems required several seconds to read brain waves , but the new technology requires only 125 milliseconds - or 125 thousandths of a second .
The person in the wheelchair wears a cap that can read brain signals , which are relayed to a brain scan electroencephalograph , or EEG , on the electrically powered wheelchair , and then analyzed in a computer program .
Research into mobility is part of Toyota 's larger strategy to go beyond automobiles in helping people get around in new ways .
The new system allows the person on the wheelchair to turn left or right and go forward , almost instantly , according to researchers .
Coming to a stop still requires more than a thought .
The person in the wheelchair must puff up a cheek , which is picked up in a detector worn on the face .
Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. is also working on a system to connect the monitoring of brain waves with mechanical moves .
Earlier this year , Honda showed a video that had a person wearing a helmet sitting still but thinking about moving his right hand .
The thought was picked up by cords attached to his head inside the helmet .
After several seconds , Honda 's boy - shaped robot Asimo , programmed to respond to brain signals , lifted its right arm .
Neither Honda nor Toyota said it had any plans to turn the technology into a product for commercial sale as each said they are still developing the research .

The question here explored , in full awareness of its far - reaching consequences , is whether we have reached or are reaching the point where conscientious citizens can no longer give moral assent to the existing regime .
Americans are not accustomed to speaking of a regime .
Regimes are what other nations have .
The American tradition abhors the notion of the rulers and the ruled .
We do not live under a government , never mind under a regime ; we are the government .
The traditions of democratic self - governance are powerful in our civics textbooks and in popular consciousness .
This symposium asks whether we may be deceiving ourselves and , if we are , what are the implications of that self - deception .
By the word “ regime ” we mean the actual , existing system of government .
The question that is the title of this symposium is in no way hyperbolic .
The subject before us is the end of democracy .
THE other day , a major conservative magazine held a symposium that posed the question of whether it was time for conservatives of conscience to rescind their support for the American government and work for the overthrow of what it called the current " regime " .
The editors of the symposium worried that the amorality of American legislation was turning the country into ... well , you know :
America is not and , please God , will never become Nazi Germany , but it is only blind hubris that denies it can happen here and , in peculiarly American ways , may be happening here .
Participants in the colloquium included Robert Bork , who fulminated against recent Supreme Court decisions protecting gay rights .
What can explain the Court majority 's decision ?
Only the newly faddish approval of homosexual conduct among the elite classes from which the Justices come and to which most of them respond .
Russell Hittinger , a professor of Catholic Studies , wrote that " the option remaining to right reason is the one traditionally used against despotic rule : civil disobedience . "
Born -again Nixon conspirator Charles Colson wrote that it is " time for all believers to ask sobering questions about the moral legitimacy of the current political order and our allegiance to it . "
Princeton professor Robert George contributed an essay entitled " The Tyrant State " .
The other day was November , 1996 , when First Things printed an issue entitled " The End of Democracy ? "
The main target at the time , interestingly , was the Supreme Court , which the authors accused of usurping too much power .
Mr Bork amusingly suggested that an amendment be added to the Constitution allowing a simple majority vote of Congress to override any judicial decision .
Presumably Mr Bork no longer advocates such a measure ; in recent years , as the court has shifted rightwards , conservative criticism of its overreach has become muted .
Today , it 's the executive and legislative branches of government that right - wing extremists consider tyrannical and illegitimate .
The recent John Perry piece in Newsmax fantasising about a " patriotic general " staging a military coup to resolve the " Obama problem " was a routine example of the genre .
Glenn
Beck is running saying " it is a totalitarian state that you 're headed towards " and warning that " freedom will be restored " .
We 've got Michael Savage saying , " We 're going to have a revolution in this country if this keeps up .
These people are pushing the wrong people around . "
We 've got Michele Bachmann , an actual elected government official , telling Sean Hannity that America is " headed down the road of economic Marxism " , saying Barack Obama is " enforcing tyranny " , calling herself a " foreign correspondent " in Washington reporting on the " enemy " , and adding : " At this point the American people — it 's like Thomas Jefferson said , a revolution every now and then is a good thing .
We are at the point , Sean , of revolution . "
This is by now all pretty tedious and familiar stuff , and I do n't have the space here to communicate just how voluminous it is .
To get a sense of it , I strongly recommend reading the archives that Media Matters keeps on out - of - control rightist rhetoric denouncing the legitimacy of the current American government .
But the point is that ever since the beginning of the Clinton administration , if not longer , a large segment of American movement conservatives have been working to convince each other , and their constituency , that any governing institution controlled by those who do not share their ideology is illegitimate and should be disobeyed or overthrown .
One might shrug one 's shoulders and figure that , since right - wing extremists have n't succeeded in destroying the American system of government yet , this is all just your typical PT Barnum grand American spectacle of looneyness .
I 'm not so sanguine , and I do n't think the appropriate response to this stuff is to ignore it .
I also think that the reluctance of institutions of authority , notably major media organs , to call out people like Ms Bachmann , in order to draw the lines of acceptable political rhetoric , represents a dereliction of responsibility .
Sony ’s Motion Controller system was announced at this year ’s E3 , showing true 1:1 control and camera mapping , with a mixture of the special controller and the PlayStation Eye .
At the Tokyo Game Show , Sony detailed several games that would use the motion sensor , including a Resident Evil game .
Now , at this year ’s Eurogamer Expo , PlayStation LifeStyle managed to ask Quantic Dream ‘s CEO , and writer and director of Heavy Rain , David Cage , about his views on the new Motion Controller .
The French developer told PSLS that Quantic Dream had already “ had a chance to play with some prototypes ” , due to their “ relationship with Sony ” , and that they “ really enjoy it ” .
He continued that Quantic Dream “ believe that there is something really unique and interesting in this device ” , and teased that “ this is certainly something we are going to explore in the near future ” .
While Heavy Rain will not include motion control support , the game does use the SIXAXIS sensor to make player interaction more realistic .

Lately it appears more people are beginning to consider the problem of human population size as it relates to carrying capacity .
Nevertheless , misunderstanding abounds .
Since my focus is elsewhere right now , and I have no plan to write on this topic for publication in the near future , I offer a few thoughts here .
This is merely a quick sketch with much detail , some points of logic , and additional convincing evidence omitted .
I may flesh it out sometime in the future .
_______
Have we exceeded the earth 's carrying capacity for humans ?
Many observers conclude there is no way to answer the question with any confidence .
I believe their view stems from an assumption which fails to hold up to analysis .
It is the common notion that , through human ingenuity , we 've regularly been able through the course of history to increase carrying capacity .
This idea stems in part from the correct observation that the advent of agriculture and our later use of fossil fuels were central among those developments which allowed us to grow the human population as enormously as we have .
It does not follow , however , that these developments increased carrying capacity .
The error here is in failing to account properly for overshoot .
It is well established that animal populations sometimes overshoot or grow beyond carrying capacity .
It is simple enough to demonstrate this has happened with the human population .
Agriculture and fossil fuels have not increased carrying capacity ; they have merely led to our overshooting it , our numbers supported entirely by what William Catton calls " phantom carrying capacity . "
It is not carrying capacity at all , and is only temporary . [ 1 ]
This is especially easy to see with regard to fossil fuel depletion .
Fossil fuels are a finite resource .
Relying on them , therefore , to support global food production can only be temporary .
But there are some less widely recognized observations which also support my point .
( Recall here the definition of overshoot referenced above . )
First , agriculture as we know it has always been unsustainable .
It has brought with it soil erosion and an inevitable depletion of soil nutrients at rates far faster than their natural rates of renewal .
This is comparable to our depletion of finite resources such as oil .
It may have taken ten thousand years for us to see this , but that is barely an eye blink in human history . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
Second , consider that none of the processes that have allowed our numbers to explode has come without progressive cost to the web of life .
We know well enough about the environmental impacts of extracting and burning fossil fuels .
Less discussed is the cost of agriculture to other species .
Cultivation agriculture means the elimination of all life from a piece of land , turning it then exclusively to human use via one or a few crops . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Multiply this by over a billion hectares and we see clearly how agriculture has been the primary driver of today 's highly accelerated extinction rates .
These extinctions are believed by many experts to signal a Sixth Mass Extinction of species in Earth 's history .
This is the direct destruction of Earth 's life support systems .
Indeed , it is well accepted that this extinction event began ( or entered a new , accelerated phase ) upon the human transition to agriculture .
Third , in all species population follows food supply .
Natural limits on food supply hold population sizes within appropriate limits .
( Under normal circumstances , this works , by the way , with no particular suffering . )
But by adopting agriculture we circumvent this normal process , thereby inevitably growing our numbers far beyond carrying capacity .
This point is often misunderstood , perhaps because it has seldom been thoroughly explained .
Additionally , many people have trouble accepting ( a ) that humans are subject to the same natural processes as other species , and ( b ) that those processes worked perfectly well for us for nearly all of human history prior to civilization 's stepping in and interfering . [ 6 ]
Not only have we not increased carrying capacity , we have decreased it .
It 's simple ecology .
We depend on the web of life for our own survival .
When a species consumes resources faster than they are renewed , degrading the habitat on which it depends , it erodes carrying capacity .
The damage we have done to the biosphere and the web of life has temporarily allowed us to grow our numbers but has reduced carrying capacity .
This may be hard to believe when we consider that for nearly all of human history , prior to exploding into the billions , our numbers never exceeded more than a few million .
It underscores the shocking degree by which we 've overshot carrying capacity .
No , there is no clear evidence we have ever increased carrying capacity . [ 7 ]
Rather , basic principles of ecology reveal we have managed only to overshoot it by an incredible margin .

For more detail see Agriculture : Unsustainable Resource Depletion Began 10,000 Years Ago by soil scientist Peter Salonius .
[ 3 ]
Note the interacting nature of factors involved in overshoot .
For instance , also putting fossil fuel use in the category of " phantom carrying capacity " is it 's direct link to life - threatening climate change .

On a large enough scale , even a major improvement such as permaculture - based horticulture would seem to suffer from a similar problem of transforming the land excessively for human consumption .
It is intended , however , to be practiced on a scale small enough -- and with ethical constraints against large populations -- that it might prove sustainable under conditions of a much smaller human population .
This is not to suggest it as an " alternative " to agriculture , without which humans did quite well for most of our history .
As an approach to small - scale gardening -- something practiced by many hunter - gatherers -- it makes great sense .
Once we begin to depend , though , on growing food as our primary means of subsistence , upping the scale by altering large tracts of habitat , taking control of our food supply by creating and storing unnecessary surpluses , the problems start .
( I am aware of nothing concrete , by the way , built into the practice of permaculture which would prevent population growth .
I welcome information to the contrary . )
That said , should today 's civilization come to an end , it is plausible that there may be a transitional period when permaculture and related approaches to food production will be essential to many of those shifting toward true sustainability .

Among the only arguable exceptions might be a few very limited , very early developments such as our learning to control fire ( which may go back a million years or more ) and the use of certain tools .
Yet even these technologies may not strictly qualify as exceptions as they likely directly or indirectly did cause some damage to ecosystems .
( Recall the definition of carrying capacity referenced above . )
Of course this was essentially imperceptible compared to what came later .

Yes , we ’ve all heard that cougars , that pop culture term for older women who prefer younger male lovers , are running rampant .
Especially in Palo Alto .
But those “ cougars ” actually have a few things in common with the real , endangered cougars ( Felis cougar concolor ) .
The average cougar is only slightly smaller than a woman , measuring 5 ′ to 6 ′ in length and weighing in at 105 to 150 pounds .
Cougars , also called mountain lions , pumas , and catamounts , are also known for their “ screams ” which some say sound distinctly like a woman .
Hear for yourself here .
All joking aside , cougars are in trouble .
They ’ve been hunted and poached to the point that their natural prey species like deer are creating overpopulation problems .
Somewhat ironically , the farmers and ranchers who complained about and sometimes shot cougars now have to deal with depleted grasslands because of exploding deer populations .
Even though cougars are federally endangered , and even though there have only been 10 fatalities since 1990 , some hunters insist on believing there ’s actually a cougar overpopulation and that their children and pets are next on the dinner menu .
In actuality , the cougar is shy , solitary , and rarely sighted : most interactions with humans end up with the cougar being eventually killed , rather than the other way around .
However , there ’s no denying that the cougar is a formidable predator .
It can leap 15 feet into the air , land from a 60 ′ drop and take off running , and will prey on animals as large as elk .
They ’re undeniably stealthy , and one of the few mammals in North America that can take on a full - grown human .
So it ’s understandable that hunters would be afraid of them : even with their high - powered rifles , they might not hear the cougar coming .
Although hunting and trapping do hurt cougar populations , one of its main threats is human development dividing or encroaching upon the 100 square miles each cougar needs as personal territory .
The big cats only come together a few times a year to mate : other than that , they roll solo .
Reading reports of cougar attacks , it seems that hikers are often the ones targeted .
Luckily , only about 10 % of cougar attacks are fatal , but to keep your interactions with this powerful , endangered creature safe , here are some tips :
Do n’t hike / bike / jog alone , especially if you ’re under 150 lbs .
Do n’t go out after dark .
Do n’t walk under ledges , or other handy places where a cougar could drop from above ( a favorite ambush tactic ) .
If you do encounter a cougar , do n’t back down .
Do n’t crouch or squat : instead , spread your arms or coat to make yourself look bigger .
Do n’t run , it ’ll engage the cat ’s prey instinct .
Do n’t turn your back .
Do make loud noises , throw things , and otherwise show the cougar you ’re not prey and will put up a fight .
Stare it in the eyes .
And naturally , if you got mace , use it .

Goldbugs have long - believed that central banks try to manipulate the price of gold , i.e. dumping gold onto the market at certain times to keep the price down , then slowly re-acquiring it after the spike passes , etc .
But in an era where the goldbugs are predicting $ 2000 / oz and higher ( I ’ve seen predictions of $ 5000 / oz ) , I do n’t think the central banks have enough gold in their vaults to blunt that rise — and even worse , if they made a concerted effort to dump it , that very signal would push prices through the roof .
Even worse , it ’s a prisoner ’s dilemma .
The central banks are helped if they all dump the gold , but if one goes rogue and starts buying it all up , it ruins the plan for all of them .
So no , the central banks ca n’t just dump their gold onto the market .
Yet they have serious fears that the public senses the inflationary forces in the world and are looking for a hedge .
And they REALLY do n’t want the gold price to spike and fuel those fears .
So what if they created a scare in the gold market about purity ?
Instead of giving people trust in their own currencies , what if they tried to impugn trust in the ability to buy real gold ?
The initial discovery was something like four gold bars , which the Hong Kong bankers drilled invasively to test the contents .
Reminds me of drilling the earth and measuring how many grams of gold per tonne .
The HK bankers hoped to have 99 % gold yield in their drill program for the resident bars .
They found something like 1 % instead and 99 % tungsten .
By the way , tungsten sells for less than $ 70 per ton , which makes its swaps for gold to be 60 x more profitable than silver bar swaps .
Another handy usage for the Gold / Silver ratio in calculations .
The hunt was on .
Now not a single assayer on the planet is available , as all are tied up .
They have been commissioned to test the gold bars shipped from the United States of Fraudulent Banker America in their own bullion vaults .
They use basic methods of four drill holes with direct assay of shavings , but also less invasive methods like electro - magnetic waves to examine the metal lattice structure .
When highest level methods are needed , they turn to mass spectrometry .
NOW ALMOST NO GOLD BARS WILL LEAVE THE LONDON OR NEW YORK METALS EXCHANGES WITHOUT SOME AUTHENTICATION , AS DISTRUST IS WIDESPREAD .
Think , for a second , what a diabolical scheme this would be , if perpetrated by central banks .
In a move they can blame on simple counterfeiters ( trying to pass off the tungsten as if it were gold at a huge profit ) , they can paralyze the entire gold market in a fear that if you buy gold , it wo n’t be real .
They can try to destroy demand for gold in such a way that — if undiscovered — would never be traced to them .
All this while keeping all their gold safely in their vaults and devaluing their fiat currencies .
Now , I ’m not going to up and claim that such a scheme is being perpetrated .
But would you put it past the central bankers , a group of people desperate to keep faith in their own fiat currencies — since faith is the only thing that backs them ?

The most distant galaxy cluster yet , known as JKCS041 , has been discovered by combining data from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical and infrared telescopes at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) , the Canada - France - Hawaii telescope in Hawaii and NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
The JKCS041 cluster is located about 10.2 billion light years away , and is observed as it was when the Universe was only about a quarter of its present age .
The previous record holder for a galaxy cluster was 9.2 billion light years away , XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 , discovered by ESA 's XMM - Newton in 2006 , which broke the previous distance record by only about 0.1 billion light years while JKCS041 surpasses XMMXCS J2215.9 by about ten times that .
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe .
Finding such a large structure at this very early epoch can reveal important information about how the Universe evolved at this crucial stage .
JKCS041 is observed as it was when the Universe was just one quarter of its current age .
X - rays from Chandra are displayed here as the diffuse blue region , while the individual galaxies in the cluster are seen in white in the VLT 's optical data , embedded in the X - ray emission .
JKCS041 was originally detected in 2006 with infrared observations from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) .
Color code : X - ray ( blue ) ; Optical ( Red , Green , Cyan ) .
Credit : X-ray : NASA / CXC / INAF / S. Andreon et al Optical : DSS ; ESO / VLTJKCS041 is found at the cusp of when scientists think galaxy clusters can exist in the early Universe based on how long it should take for them to assemble .
Therefore , studying its characteristics , such as composition , mass , and temperature , will reveal more about how the Universe took shape .
" This object is close to the distance limit expected for a galaxy cluster , " said Stefano Andreon of the National Institute for Astrophysics ( INAF ) in Milan , Italy .
" We do n't think gravity can work fast enough to make galaxy clusters much earlier .
" Distant galaxy clusters are often detected first with optical and infrared observations that reveal their component galaxies dominated by old , red stars .
JKCS041 was originally detected in 2006 in a survey from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) .
The distance to the cluster was then determined from optical and infrared observations from UKIRT , the Canada - France - Hawaii telescope in Hawaii and NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
Infrared observations are important because the optical light from the galaxies at large distances is shifted into infrared wavelengths because of the expansion of the universe .
The Chandra data were the final piece of evidence as they showed that JKCS041 was , indeed , a genuine galaxy cluster .
The extended X - ray emission seen by Chandra shows that hot gas has been detected between the galaxies , as expected for a true galaxy cluster rather than one that has been caught in the act of forming .
Also , without the X - ray observations , the possibility remained that this object could have been a blend of different groups of galaxies along the line of sight , or a filament , a long stream of galaxies and gas , viewed front on .
The mass and temperature of the hot gas detected estimated from the Chandra observations rule out both of those alternatives .
The extent and shape of the X - ray emission , along with the lack of a central radio source argue against the possibility that the X - ray emission is caused by scattering of cosmic microwave background light by particles emitting radio waves .
It is not yet possible , with the detection of just one extremely distant galaxy cluster , to test cosmological models , but searches are underway to find other galaxy clusters at extreme distances .
" This discovery is exciting because it is like finding a Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil that is much older than any other known , " said co-author Ben Maughan , from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom .
" One fossil might just fit in with our understanding of dinosaurs , but if you found many more , you would have to start rethinking how dinosaurs evolved .
The same is true for galaxy clusters and our understanding of cosmology . " " What 's exciting about this discovery is the astrophysics that can be done with detailed follow - up studies , " said Andreon .
Among the questions scientists hope to address by further studying JKCS041 are :
What is the build - up of elements ( such as iron ) like in such a young object ?
Are there signs that the cluster is still forming ?
Do the temperature and X - ray brightness of such a distant cluster relate to its mass in the same simple way as they do for nearby clusters ?
The paper describing the results on JKCS041 from Andreon and his colleagues will appear in an upcoming issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics .
Hackers have found a way to bypass product activation in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 to get free and illegal copies of Microsoft 's latest operating systems .
The hack , according to My Digial Life , means you can get Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 without the need for a product activation key .
The crack apparently mirrors a similar breach in Windows Vista that was foiled by a Microsoft software update .
A Microsoft spokesperson told The Reg : " We 're aware of this workaround and are already working to address it . "
The company advised customers to avoid using illegal copies of Windows and to check their software is genuine , warning rogue software often contained malware .
Earlier this year , an OEM Windows 7 Ultimate product key was posted to a Chinese forum .
The key worked on machines from Dell , Hewlett - Packard , Lenovo and MSI .
It would let you bypass Windows Genuine Advantage to potentially unlock multiple copies of Windows 7 Ultimate .
My Digital Life said the fresh hack nullifies the sppcompai.dll thereby passing product activation and licensing in the Windows Activation Technologies ' ( WAT ) Software Protection Platform ( SPP ) and Software Licensing Client ( SLC ) .
Hackers have also devised tools that turn off any pop-ups or reminders that say the system has not been registered or the trial period has expired .
The hack has been blamed on Microsoft creating a system designed to give users plenty of opportunities to enter their details in case they make mistakes .
" The crack is possible probably due to leniency allowed on the part of Microsoft on [ the ] activation mechanism to avoid getting too many false - positive or complaint on activation error [ sic ] , " My Digital Life wrote . ®
Orly Taitz ’s Client Files A Complaint Against Her
Created : September 19 , 2009 10:23 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Bad news for Orly Taitz , the indefatigable birther attorney .
On September 17 , she filed a motion of consideration on behalf of her client Capt .
Connie Rhodes , asking for her deployment to be delayed .
It was , typically for Taitz , overheated and incoherent : “ [ T ] his court ignores some of the soundest and most carefully researched and professionally assembled and presented evidence , collated and substantiated by a former agent of England ’s Fabled ‘ Scotland Yard . ’ ”
Taitz ’s motion was dismissed in an exasperated decision by Judge Clay Land that should definitely be read in full –I ’ve provided an excerpt after the jump .
( Erick Erickson of RedState is a fan of the dismissal . )
But the twist today comes from Capt .
Rhodes herself .
She has sent a letter to Judge Clay Land , blasting Taitz for filing the motion to stay her deployment without even asking her .
I do not wish for Ms. Taitz to file any future motions or represent me in any way in this court .
It is my plan to file a complaint with the California State Bar due to her reprehensible and unprofessional actions .
Full letter after the jump .
RHODES v MacDONALD – 18 – Letter regarding from plaintiff regarding withdrawal of motion to stay – Gov.usco …
And one of the more amusing bits from Judge Land ’s dismissal .

This comes via the FT :
Saudi Arabia on Wednesday decided to drop the widely used West Texas Intermediate oil contract as the benchmark for pricing its oil , dealing a serious blow to the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The decision by the world ’s biggest oil exporter could encourage other producers to abandon the benchmark and threatens the dominance of the world ’s most heavily traded oil futures contract .
It is the main contract traded on Nymex .
Before anyone tries to spin this as an anti-dollar move , you should read what else the FT article says :
In January , WTI , which usually trades at a premium of $ 1 - $ 2 a barrel to Brent , fell sharply , leaving it at a discount of almost $ 12 – a record gap .
This dislocation in the market continued well into the summer .
From January , Saudi Arabia will base the price of oil for its US customers on a new index developed by Argus , the London - based oil pricing company .
The Argus Sour Crude Index will track the price in the physical market of a basket of US Gulf Coast crudes , including Mars , Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon .
The point of this move is not to undermine the dollar but to get away from the WTI contract where prices have been artificially inflated due to storage shortages at Cushing .
A friend familiar with this market also indicated that big bank punters active in this market will like this move as well as it helps them evade the position limits and regulation of the CFTC .
He says , “ In fact , the lack of transparency and regulation on the Dubai Merc was one of the reasons why you had such successful speculation in the oil market during the spring of 2008 . ”
I see a spike in oil prices as a risk to any sustained recovery .
Anyone with more insight into why the Saudis made this move , do comment .

Pretty sure it 'll be done sometime this week .

It 'll be the first time he 's been asked about it , ' live ' .
I could not wrap my head around why this is happening : there were three times as many marijuana arrests in 2008 as there were in 1992 .
It 's now legal in 13 states to smoke marijuana for medical reasons and yet the numbers keep going up .
How could that be ?
Who better to explain it than the founder of NORML , the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws , Keith Stroup .---
This is what got me thinking about it .
Though the data were previously published , this is a new graphic today from NORML :
I knew there had to be a good explanation , and Stroup gave it to me .
Arrests are down in states that have medical marijuana laws , Stroup said , and are up in the state that have yet to reform their laws .
So why are arrests up , up , up in the states that have not yet reformed ?
" The thing that 's not reflected in that [ graph above ] is that the individuals who were arrested today were almost all treated far more leniently than they would have back in 1990 , " Stroup said .
" Marijuana has become more acceptable .
There 's no doubt .
We have a lot of data on that .
As a result of that , people may be a little more public about their smoking . "
Ah-ha .
Makes perfect sense .
%uFFFDBecause they are judged less harshly by the public and the criminal justice system , people are smoking in parks and in their cars , etc. , and are thus they are easier to arrest .
%uFFFDWhen people begin thinking that pot is safer than alcohol , behaviors change , thus arrest rates change .
%uFFFDI love a mystery solved .

元マイクロソフト のSQL Server開発チームの一員であり、その後マイクロソフトのデータセンターのアーキテクトとして活躍。昨年アマゾンに移籍して、現在はAmazon Web Servicesの上級エンジニアであるJames Hamilton氏が、自身のブログの「 One Size Does Not Fit All」というエントリで、リレーショナルデータベースだけにとどまらない幅広いデータベースの種類を4つに分類して紹介しています。
4つの種類とは 「 機能優先 」 「 スケーラビリティ優先 」 「 シンプル 」 「 目的別」です 。
Hamilton氏は、アマゾンがAmazonクラウドでMySQLのサービスを開始したところ、以前から提供していたキーバリュー型データストアの「SimpleDB」は終了するのではないかと心配する声があったことを挙げ、
I can understand why some might conclude that just having a relational database would be sufficient but the world of structured storage extends far beyond relational systems .
リレーショナルデータベースがあれば十分な人が多いために、こうした声が出ることは理解している。しかし、構造化ストレージの世界はリレーショナルを超えてもっと幅広いものなのだ。
と、リレーショナルデータベース以外にもさまざまな目的に対応したデータベースの存在に目を向けるために、このエントリを書いたと説明しています。Hamilton氏が4つに分類したデータベースの世界を見てみることにしましょう。
機能優先のデータベース
このセグメントでは、いわゆるリレーショナルデータベースがリストアップされています。
Oracle 、 SQL Server、DB2、MySQL 、PostgreSQL
さらに、クラウド対応とし てAmazon Relational Database Serviceを挙げています。Hamilton氏のリストには含まれていませんが、マイクロソフトのSQL Azureを追加しておきましょう。
スケーラビリティ優先のデータベース
データベースのスケーラビリティを実現する方法としてHamilton氏は「多数のRDBMSによるデータ共有」と「スケーラブルなキーバーリュー型データストア」の2つを挙げています。
前者として挙げているのが 、DB2 Parallel Edition とOracle Real Application Clusters （Oracle RAC ）。
後者としてはさまざまなデータストアがありますが、Hamilton氏が挙げているのが、Project Voldemort、Ringo、Scalaris、Kai、Dynomite、MemcacheDB、ThruDB、CouchDB、Cassandra、HBase、Hypertableなど。
また、クラウド上のキーバーリュー型データストアとしてAmazon SimpleDBも挙げています。ここではグーグルのBigtableも追加しておきましょう。
シンプルなデータベース
Hamilton氏 が「 Simple Structured Storage」と書いているセグメント。リレーショナルデータベースほどの機能や複雑な操作は必要とせず、キーバリュー型データストアほどのスケーラビリティも不要。しかしファイルシステムほどおおざっぱでは困るし、検索やインデックス付けといった機能は求めたい、といった要求に合致するデータベース。
クライアント側で最も多くこの用途で利用されているのはBerkeley DB。そしてサーバ側ではいくつか例が挙がっていますが、FacebookのメールのインボックスとしてCassandra、Last.fmではProject-Voldemortを利用予定、アマゾンのショッピングカート用にはDynamoが使われているとのことです。
目的特化型データベース
ここではわずかな例しか挙げられていませんが、イベント処理プラットフォームのStreamBase、データウェアハウス用のVertica、MapReduceをベースとしたAster Dataなど、さまざまな目的に特化したデータベースがこれからも登場するだろうとHamilton氏は書いています。
データベース多様化の時代がくる
Hamilton氏が指摘するように、今後は何でもリレーショナルデータベースを使うのではなく、データの大きさ、処理の内容によって適切なデータベースを使い分ける時代が来ると僕も思います。
これは何と言っても、ビジネスで処理するデータがWebスケールになったため、データの量や増加速度、そしてデータそのものの中味が多様化してきたためです。「Hadoopの最新動向を「 Hadoop World : NY 2009 」の資料から（前編）」で紹介したように、成功するネットビジネスでは毎日数テラバイトのレベルでデータが増えており、それを保存するだけでなく、分析してビジネスに活かしていかなければなりません。MapReduceのように、それに適した新しいデータ処理方法が注目されるのは当然でしょう。
一方で、 「 カラムナデータベース（列指向データベース）とデータベースの圧縮機能について、マイケル・ストーンブレイカー氏が語っていること
」 で紹介したカラムナデータベースや、「 SSD に最適化したデータベース「 RethinkDB」、ロックもログも使わずにトランザクション実現
」のように、あるいは「キャッシュの大きいRDB
vs インメモリデータベース、性能がどれだけ違うのか調べてみると
」で紹介したようにリレーショナルデータベースそのものも新しい環境や技術をベースにして進化し続けています。
まるで今はデータベースの種類が爆発的に増えているカンブリア紀のようですね。
新しいデータベースの種類や技術が登場すると、次に期待されるのはそれらに対応した「SQL」のようにデータに対して汎用かつ分かりやすい操作体系の登場でしょう。それがSQLのような言語になるのか、RESTのようなAPIっぽくなるのか、あるいは別の形態をとるのか分かりませんが、そうなるには新しい分野のデータベース体系がもう少し整理されてからのように思うので、まだ数年単位で時間がかかることは間違いなさそうです。
Dokumentation über Atommüll : Und ständig wächst der Abfallberg
Der Journalist Éric Guéret spürte den strahlenden Rückständen der Atomkraft nach und fand eine Geschichte von Lügen , Täuschungen und Verharmlosungen ( Arte , Dienstag , 21 Uhr ) .
Der Film beginnt mit beklemmenden Bildern .
Auf hoher See werfen Männer in gelbem Ölzeug Fässer über Bord .
Die nächste Einstellung zeigt verrostete Tonnen irgendwo auf dem Meeresboden .
Das Metall ist aufgeplatzt , der I nhalt fortgespült .
50 Jahre lang haben Staaten wie Großbritannien , die USA , Russland , Frankreich oder Japan ganz legal insgesamt 100.000 Tonnen nukleare Abfälle in den Ozeanen verklappt , bis ein internationales Abkommen diese Praxis 1993 verbot .
Offiziell halten sich alle Länder an den Vertrag .
Den Atommüll haben sie weiter am Hals .
Und es wird immer mehr .
Ständig wachsen die Abfallberge .
Zu Wasser und zu Land , in Frankreich , Russland und den USA haben der Journalist Éric Guéret und sein Team den strahlenden Hinterlassenschaften von militärischer und " ziviler " Atomkraftnutzung nachgespürt .
Sie führten Interviews mit Zeitzeugen und Experten , begleiteten kritische Wissenschaftler bei ihren Recherchen und Messungen , durchforsteten Archive und stießen bei Offiziellen immer wieder auf Ausreden und auf Mauern des Schweigens .
Die Filmemacher erfuhren : Die Geschichte der Produktion von Atommüll ist auch eine Geschichte von Lügen , Täuschungen , Verharmlosungen .
Hanford , USA , ist die erste Station von Guérets Reise .
Am Columbia River baute die US - Army 1942 auf einem abgelegenen Stück Wüste Anlagen zur Erprobung und Produktion von Atombomben .
Die für das streng geheime " Manhatten Project " aus dem ganzen Land zusammengezogenen Wissenschaftler experimentierten in neun Reaktoren und fünf Plutoniumfabriken , bis sie genug Spaltstoff für die schreckliche Waffe zusammenhatten .
Die meist flüssigen Abfälle leitete man in den Fluss oder in große Tanks , die dann im Boden vergraben wurden .
Viele Behälter platzten , die Brühe sickerte ins Erdreich , gelangte ins Trinkwasser und in die Nahrungskette .
Umweltschützer und Journalisten , die das Gelände bis heute nicht betreten dürfen und sich dem Hanford - Komplex nur auf dem Fluss nähern können , messen immer noch stark erhöhte Radioaktivitätswerte .
Bei einer Probe im Jahr 2002 waren 13 von 15 im Columbia gefangenen Fischen kontaminiert .
In Russland filmte Guéret in der Region um die Stadt Tscheljabinsk im Südural .
In der geheimen Atomanlage Majak explodierte 1957 ein Tank mit flüssigem Atommüll - es war der größte Unfall vor Tschernobyl .
200 sofortige Todesopfer sind bestätigt , insgesamt sollen zehntausende an der Strahlung gestorben sein .
Etliche umliegende Dörfer wurden evakuiert , in anderen ließ man die Menschen weiter auf der kontaminierten Erde wohnen .
" Die halten uns hier wie Versuchskaninchen " , sagt ein Mann in die Kamera .
Der nahe Karatschai - See diente zur Verklappung des Atommülls aus Majak .
Über die Flüsse Tetscha und Ob kann die strahlende Fracht bis ins Eismeer gelangen .
Bislang haben die russischen Techniker kein Mittel gefunden , um die Strahlung im und unter dem heute noch 13 Hektar großen See zu binden .
Die Luft und das Meer bei der französischen Wiederaufarbeitungsanlage La Hague sind verstrahlt .
Die Fabrik , in der auch deutsche AKW - Betreiber ihre abgebrannten Brennstäbe behandeln ließen , spült durch ein viereinhalb Kilometer langes Rohr jeden Tag 400 Kubikmeter radioaktives Abwasser in den Ärmelkanal .
Ganz legal .
Denn der Vertrag von 1993 verbietet nur , dass Fässer mit Atommüll im Meer versenkt werden .
Die direkte Einleitung von strahlenden Abfällen verbietet er nicht .
Drug addicts desperate to kick the habit are forced to commit criminal offences to get a place in rehab , the father of singer Amy Winehouse told MPs today .
Mitch Winehouse , who is making a documentary on drug use , was giving evidence to the home affairs select committee on the cocaine trade .
He said drug users struggling to get clean had to wait at least a year for treatment while addicts committing other crimes were often given places in residential rehabilitation centres .
Amy Winehouse has struggled with drink and drug problems in recent years .
The singer of songs such as Rehab recently returned to live performing after an eight - month stay in the Caribbean and her divorce from husband Blake Fielder - Civil in July .
Her father said he had heard stories of people trying to steal their way into rehab after finding themselves unable to get treatment through the normal channels .
" Anecdotally , people are definitely committing offences so they can have a chance , and it's only a chance , of receiving treatment , " he said .
" The biggest impact on families is that there is very little help available to them , especially if their relative is a non-offending addict .
" Their first port of call will be the GP and then they will refer them on to the local health authority .
" The problem that we have found in our research in London is that there is a period of a year before any treatment can be given .
It 's very difficult , and the reason for this is the majority of funding is taken up by the criminal justice system . "
He said that this had happened to his son - in - law – Fielder - Civil – when , as part of a sentence , the judge offered him a period in residential rehab .
" So we have a situation where a non - offending addict and his family are looking for help and there are very few resources available to them . "
However , Winehouse 's claims were dismissed by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse ( NTA ) , which is part of the NHS .
It said waiting lists for drug treatment in England had fallen to an average of one week , while 93 % of people got the help they needed in three weeks , even when a stay in a residential rehabilitation centre was required .
The agency added that , in 2008 - 09 , 207,580 adults in England were treated for drug abuse .
Paul Hayes , the NTA 's chief executive , said : " Drug treatment in England has never been more available to members of the public who need it .
We think it is important that the public knows that , if they or a family member needs help , they can get it on the NHS . "
Earlier , the committee had asked two drug policy experts about the scale of Britain 's cocaine problem .
Professor Neil McKeganey , from the centre for drug misuse research at Glasgow University , described the rise in the use of cocaine as " very worrying " .
He said : " In my view , cocaine is one of the most serious threats we are facing .
It 's not yet on the scale of heroin but it is changing dramatically in terms of misuse . "
Asked about the extent to which the behaviour of drug - taking celebrities could be blamed for drug use among the young , he said : " We would n't have one of the largest drug problems in Europe if our drug prevention policies had been successful .
I think that [ celebrity drug use ] does n't help matters , but it does n't have a substantial impact on young people taking drugs . "
Steve Rolles , head of research at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation , agreed .
" It 's a red herring and reflects politicians ' concerns with tabloid obsessions more than anything else , " he said .
" There are drug wars in Colombia and we must move on from what Amy Winehouse does on her weekends . "
Jeff Richey , somewhere in his bones , knows his cause is lost .
He just has n’t the stomach to admit it .
It is why he has filled out the application on his dog but still refuses to send it to the government .
“ I ’ll probably take a couple more weeks , ” he moans , “ or until they send a letter threatening to fine us . ”
His emotions run the gamut .
He understands the reasoning behind the law , he says , because there cannot be a greater animal lover than he .
But he has never once put his dog on display as an exhibit .
And wait a minute , Richey finally spits , why does the government care at all about his dog ?
Does it not have bigger and better things to worry about ?
The U.S. Department of Agriculture ruled this week that Farfel — Richey and Sandra Calvin ’s 6 - year - old bearded collie — is , indeed , a display animal under the Animal Welfare Act .
As such , his owners must apply for a $ 40 commercial license .
The government habitually does head - scratchingly out - of - the - blue things , but by any measure , its Farfel ruling is an outrageous overreach .
Richey and Calvin for five years now have run Farfel ’s Farm , a nice little pet- accessories store — they call it a “ boutique ” — at Ninth and Pearl streets in Boulder .
They named the store after their then - puppy and came up with the word “ Farm ” because they liked the alliteration with Farfel .
Farfel always came with Richey to the store and likes to spend his days in the sun on the front - window ledge next to the waterfall the couple installed .
“ We never forced our dog to sleep there , ” Richey said .
“ Farfel chooses to sleep there , and only for a small fraction of the day .
Yet they are using a law designed to protect zoo and circus animals on my dog ! ”
A USDA spokesman says the dog ’s sleeping in the front window is designed to attract customers , and Richey is therefore required to have commercial license .
If Richey does n’t apply for a commercial exhibitor ’s license for the dog or if he ’s turned down , he said he would have to remove the name Farfel from the business name — and his name and image from all logos and advertising — or face possible fines .
“ It will ruin five years of marketing and building our store because somebody thinks it is their job to federally regulate my dog , ” he says .
If the license is approved , the store will be visited at least once a year by an inspector to ensure proper treatment of Farfel , who would also have to undergo a yearly battery of wellness tests by an approved veterinarian .
“ There is no better - cared - for animal in this town .
That is the absurdity , ” Richey says .
He pulls a printout from a government website that lists other businesses required to obtain an exhibitor ’s license .
No pet store is on it .
“ The $ 40 for the license is not the issue at all , ” Richey says .
“ We object to their allocation of resources .
I sometimes think they believe we ’re an actual farm with , you know , animals . ”
Farfel , in all my time at the shop , never once goes near the front window , but lies on the floor behind the counter .
I ask Richey once more about that application .
“ I guess I ’m just hoping , ” he says , looking away , “ that someone , somewhere , will say we have better things to do .
Let ’s leave these people alone . ”

[ It has come to my attention that the original incarnation of this story has angered some ( not all of you are tools ! ) of the Reddit community for being too immature and not serious enough .
Since we do n't want to upset thirty - year - old journalism fans ( i.e , people who do n't normally read us anyway ) , we have decided to re-write the story in the serious and journalistic tone that it truly deserves .

Maxim is a monthly publication aimed toward young males across America and the United Kingdom .
The magazine has an official Web site .
A Web site is a collection of pages found on the Internet .
This particular collection of pages contains an exclusive set of photographs that show the real - life inspirations behind several characters in the upcoming BioWare RPG ( role playing game ) Dragon Age : Origins .
The basic premise of Maxim 's gallery is that the females are attractive to the target demographic of heterosexual young males , and that this should be celebrated .
If you are a heterosexual male , you may feel physically and emotionally stimulated while looking at the images .
That 's normal .
A state of heightened arousal when viewing attractive members of the opposite sex is a healthy reaction .
One might like to state one 's desire to perform an act of coitus with the females rendered .
Again , this is a natural impulse .
If you might permit me a personal editorial opinion for a moment , my favorite of the females is a lady who has styled herself " Alleykatze , " a name that I suspect may not have been awarded her at birth .
I shall of course follow up with Maxim 's public relations staff to verify that the name is indeed a pseudonym , as my reporter 's instinct suggests .
I prefer Alleykatze because her physical appearance possesses a variety of traits that I find sexually appealing .
If I had the opportunity , I would like very much to court her .
Dragon Age : Origins is a videogame for the PC , Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 .
It will be released on November 3 , 2009 , published by Electronic Arts .

Misunderstanding markup
先週、W3CはXHTML 2 Working Groupが年内でその活動を終了すると発表したんだ。単刀直入で、歓迎されるべきことだったんだけど、「XHTMLが終わってしまう」と多くの人を混乱させてしまった。Zeldmanのblogポストに寄せられたコメントを読むと、それが分かると思う。
仕方のない部分もある。異なる技術に、同じような名前がついていたことが原因なんだから。しかも、これは今に始まったことじゃあない。
たとえば、JavaScript。Javaになにか関係しそうだけど、そうじゃないよね。書き方がすこし似ているということを除けば、共通点はない。だから、ハムがハムスターと関係のかって聞くようなものなんだ。
ほかにも 、DHTMLなんてのもある。HTMLに何かをするように聞こえるけど、これもそうじゃない。DHTMLはHTML要素のCSSプロパティをJavaScriptで制御するっていうやり方を、ひと言で表したものに過ぎないんだ。ぼくならこの「HTML , CSS , JavaScriptを組み合わせる方法 」 を「 Web開発」って呼ぶかな 。
XHTML 2もこれと同じ。XHTML
1.0やXHTML 1.1と関係あるように思うのは仕方ないけど、やっぱり違うものなんだ。
XHTML 1.0は 、HTML 4を単純にXML構文のもとで定義しなおしたもの。だから、書き方にXMLの制約が加わる。こんな感じ。
タグと属性は小文字で書く
属性値を引用符で囲 む
p や li にも、きちんと終了タグを書 く
や にも、きちんと終了タグを書く img や br , meta などの空要素では、最後にスラッシュを書 く
XHTML 1.1も同じように再定義された。でもこっちには、XML MIME型で文書を提供しなければならないといった、非現実的なきまりがあったんだ。
XHTML 2だけど、実はHTML
4と共通点がほとんどない。XHTML
2は思想的に「純潔」な語彙を一から作ろうと計画していたもので、後方互換性についてはほとんど考えられていなかったんだ。失敗する運命にあったわけさ。
This was a philosophically pure specification that was so backwardly incompatible that it nearly deprecated the img element .
（訳：XHTML 2は哲学的に純粋な仕様だったけれど、後方互換性について何ら考えられていなかった。たとえば、 img を非推奨に近い扱いにしていたりね。）
さて、XHTML 2が亡くなった今、これがXHTMLの終わりだと思ってる人がいる。でもそうじゃないんだ。
この混乱を何とかしようと、 は
An Unofficial Q and A about the Discontinuation of the XHTML2 WG ってものを書いたんだけれど、あまり分かりやすいものではなかった。あと、John
Allsoppが your snark is showing って言ったように 、Henriの発言には当てこすりがある 。
There are two meanings to XHTML : technical and marketing .
The technical kind ( XHTML served using the application / xhtml+xml MIME type ) is a formulation of HTML as an XML vocabulary .
The marketing kind ( XHTML served using the text / html MIME type ) is processed just like HTML by browsers but the authors attempt to observe slightly different syntax rules in order to make it seem that they are doing something newer and shinier compared to HTML .
（訳：XHTMLっていう言葉にはふたつの意味があるんだ。技術的な側面と、マーケティング的な側面でね。技術的なほうのXHTMLは、HTMLをXML語彙として構成したもので、
application/xhtml+xml MIME型で配信されている。一方のマーケティング的なXHTMLは、 text / html で配信されるもので、ブラウザー内部ではHTMLと全く同じように処理される。でも製作者は、そんなXHTMLをHTMLと違う風に見ているんだ。「XHTMLで書くのは新しいし、きらきら輝いてることだ」っていう風にね。）
フォーマットの技術的な違いを説明することと、厳しい構文が好きな製作者をけなすことは全く関係ないことだよね。
もちろん、XML構文を使うことに利点はいっぱいある。たとえば、このDrewのコメントを見てみよう。
Whenever this argument surfaces , there seems to be the assumption that loose syntax is easier for beginners .
This baffles me .
In my experience simple , strict rules are much easier to learn and code to than loose rules with multiple shortcuts .
I like XHTML because attributes must always be quoted .
Tags must always be closed .
These are simple rules that require no thought , and result in uniform , predictable markup .
（訳：いつもこの手の議論で、ゆるい書き方は初心者にいいっていう人が出てくるけど、賛同できないなあ。ぼくの経験から言うと、単純で厳しいルールの方がゆるくていろんな書き方ができるものよりもずっと簡単に学べるし、書くのも楽だ。ぼくがXHTMLが好きなのは、属性値は引用符で囲む、タグはいつも閉じるっていうシンプルなルールがあるからなんだ。このルールに従っていれば他に何も考える必要はないし、一貫性のある読みやすいマークアップになるんだよ。）
別に「 XHTMLの方がいい 」とか「 HTMLに比べてひどい」ってことじゃないよ。ぼくが言いたいのは、これは好みの問題だってこと。誰かと好みが違ったとしても、どちらかが間違っているなんてわけじゃない。ぼくがタイ料理好きで、君はイタリアン好き。でも一体、ぼくらは何を間違ってるんだい？
XHTML 2が終わったからといって、XHTML構文がなくなるわけじゃないんだよ。タグをちゃんと閉じることや、属性値を引用符で囲むこと。それはこれからもできるんだ。XHTML
1を使い続けることも勿論できるし、HTML
5でもちゃんと使えるんだよ。
そう。HTML 5は君にとって一番都合のよいスタイルで書くことができるんだ。Bruce先生はこんな事をおっしゃっているよ。
I like the XHTML syntax .
It ’s how I learned .
I ’m used to lowercase code , quoted attributes and trailing slashes on elements like br and img .
They make me feel nice and comfy , like a cup of Ovaltine and The Evil Dead on the telly .
But you might not .
You might want SHOUTY UPPERCASE tags , no trailing slashes and attribute minimisation .
And , in HTML 5 you can choose .
Thanks to the “ pave the cowpaths ” principle , it ’s up to you .
As you like it .
What you will .
Whatever you want , whatever you like .
（訳：ぼくはXHTML構文が好きだ。なぜなら、そうやって学んだから。小文字で書くこと、引用符で括ること、brやimgにスラッシュを書くことに慣れているんだ。この書き方は、とても気持ちがいい。オバルチンを飲みながら、テレビでEvil Deadを見るような感じさ。でも、君はそうじゃないかもしれない。まるで叫んでるように見える大文字のタグや、スラッシュなしのimg , br要素、属性の省略表記が好きかもしれない。HTML
5だと、これらはぼくらの好きなように書けるんだ。“ pave the cowpaths ” っていう原則のおかげで、書く人のおまかせになるんだ。「お気に召すまま、お好きなように、好きなだけ、どうにでも」ってね。）
あと、 application / xhtml+xml で公開することもできるんだ。このMIMEにすれば、HTML
5が自動的に「 XHTML 5」になる仕組みさ。うん、またややこしい名前が出てきたね……
覚えておいて 。XHTML 2という仕様は、XHTMLという構文とは無関係なことと、XHTMLはHTML5でも使えることを。
でも、でも、でも ってきみが言ってるのが聞こえるよ。 何にもいいことないよ ！HTML 5はまだサポートされてないじゃないか！ ってね。
でも サポート ってどういう意味だい？ちゃんと定義しようよ。XHTML 2と違って、HTML 5には後方互換性があるんだ。じゃあ、XHTML
1文書を簡単にHTML 5に変換する方法を教えようか。
このDOCTYPE を
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
こう変えるんだ 。
<! DOCTYPE html >
はい、おわり 。
XHTML 2はなくなるけど、XHTMLはこれからも生き続けるんだ。HTML 5の中でね。

KABUL -- Helicopter crashes in Afghanistan killed 14 Americans Monday , the deadliest day for the U.S. in the country in four years .
Also Monday , presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah demanded the removal of the country 's top election official and several members of President Hamid Karzai 's cabinet before the two men face off in elections on Nov. 7 . Mr. Karzai refused to comply .

CERN is reporting that the Large Hadron Collider could circulate particle beams through both of its pipes in just over a week .
If all goes well , the first collisions would begin soon after that .
The LHC has had a rough time since it first started up in September last year .
Just a week after it started up , an electrical problem shut it down again .
The first down - time estimate was a day or so , then it became months .
And when the repair was just about finished , vacuum leaks in July set it back several more months .
It has now been more than a year .
In the meantime , scientists working at Fermilab 's Tevatron , the current leader of the high - energy particle physics world , have been furiously collecting data .
They are hoping to find the Higgs boson , a theoretical particle that would support the Standard Model of physics before the LHC sneaks in and grabs the glory .
Right now , particles are circulating through six of the eight sectors of the LHC 's 17 - mile track , and the last two sectors will be turned on in the coming week .
If the machine does n't break down again , physicists will finally have their long - awaited collider and , hopefully , start answering those nagging questions about the universe .

Remember when we did n’t like to talk about money in sports ?
When how much athletes were paid , and how much cash franchises raked in , was considered a dirty pox on the game ?
When we resented spoiled athletes and greedy owners for turning the sports fan upside down and shaking him until every last quarter was jarred loose from every orifice ?
Okay , so maybe we still do that .
But over the last few years , something in sports has slowly , subtly changed .
We ’ve started to see money not as an unspeakable offshoot of our great games but an actual indicator of athletic value , and as worthy of discussion as batting averages and passing efficiency .
It has affected everything .
Our perception of individuals : Luis Castillo is a below - average second - baseman , but add in his insane four - year , $ 25 million contract , and he turns into a Flushing tragedy .
The realism of our expectations :
We might want Matt Holliday in the Citi Field outfield , but , man , not at that price .
We value athletes , in part , by how much money they make .
The Eli Manning Microblog Read a weekly assessment of Eli Manning ’s performance from The Sports Section .
Which brings us to Eli Manning .
The Giants , to much fanfare , signed the charmingly yokelish Giants quarterback to a six - year , $ 97.5 million contract extension last month , which , on its surface , made him the highest - paid quarterback ever .
The yearly average value of the extension , $ 16.25 million , is the highest for anybody in NFL history .
This raised considerable eyebrows around the NFL because , well , let ’s see , what ’s the best way to say this … the notion that Eli Manning is the best quarterback in his immediate family , let alone the best quarterback in NFL history , is something that no one has ever argued , probably not even Eli himself .
They ’re making him the highest - paid player in the history of the NFL ?
The whole history ?
But that ’s not what the Giants were doing .
NFL contracts are famously complicated and intricate , and highly prone to being ripped up and undone ( to the team ’s benefit , not the player ’s ) .
The total value of the contract might be the most for a quarterback in NFL history , but it ’s extremely rare that NFL contracts of that length actually make it to completion .
That is to say , much of this contract extension was a public - relations move .
And in the opposite direction you ’d think .
Typically , major corporations , particularly in today ’s wintry economic climate , emphasize the cutting of costs .
That ’s not what the Giants did .
The Giants are using the contract to broadcast to the world , and to Eli personally , that they believe in him .
But the fine print says something else .
J. I . Halsell is a former salary - cap analyst for the Washington Redskins and is considered one of the few trusted experts on the arcane rabbit hole that is NFL finance .
He was not fooled by Eli ’s contract at all .
“ Much like anything else with numbers , you can kind of twist statistics so that they kind of meet your agenda , ” Halsell says .
“ I can highlight the total value of the contract and say , ‘ Yeah , I got my guy a $ 120 million contract . ’
But if he ’s realistically only going to make $ 40 million of it , then , is it really a $ 120 million contract ?
Not really . ”
First and foremost , it ’s important to understand how football contracts are different from baseball and NBA contracts .
The key is “ guaranteed money . ”
Of that $ 97.5 million extension for Manning , only $ 35 million of it is guaranteed .
If Mark Teixeira forgets how to hit a baseball or is hit by a bus tomorrow , he ’ll still be paid every penny of the $ 180 million he ’s owed through the 2016 season .
If Eli Manning falls off the map — or at least never improves to become truly one of the NFL ’s top quarterbacks — the Giants can be rid of him in three years at a cost of only $ 35 million .
A hunk of change , obviously .
But it ’s not $ 95 million .
Which means , if the Giants really wanted to , according to Halsell , they could have said , “ Eli Manning has been signed for 25 years , at $ 750 billion . ”
It only matters what the guarantee is .
It ’s also worth remembering that Manning ’s contract was an extension , rather than a brand - new contract altogether .
( This is another reason he ’s unlikely to finish out this full contract ; if he ’s playing well as it nears the end , they ’ll just do another extension . )
Which means that restructuring the deal allowed them to futz with this season ’s salary cap .
Giving Manning this “ massive ” deal , as it turns out , actually lessened the team ’s cap hit this season .
In the backward planet of NFL contracts , a $ 97.5 million extension gave the team more money to play with this year .
Here ’s how it works .
Before the extension , Manning ’s 2009 contract counted for $ 9.4 million in salary and $ 1.5 million in incentives in ’09 , which , when added to proration , made his 2009 cap number $ 13.86 million .
When they extended the contract , they made this season ’s salary $ 7.5 million , and then knocked those incentives off the books because they were n’t included in the new deal .
That vanished money is less than the $ 2.6 million prorated - for - 2009 amount of Manning ’s signing bonus … $ 800,000 less , to be exact .
So , by giving Manning an extension with a redone contract , they have $ 800,000 to spend on players ( or do whatever ) this season that they would n’t have otherwise .
Even when you compare Manning ’s contract with other current quarterback contracts , peers like Pittsburgh ’s Ben Roethlisberger and San Diego ’s Philip Rivers , it looks less like an otherworldly contract and more just like the Going Rate .
Rivers is making more guaranteed money than Manning ( $ 38,150,000 ) , and as a total for the first three years of the contract ( which Halsell uses as a barometer for likely contract value , considering how few contracts make it all the way to the end ) , Roethlisberger outpaces Manning $ 52,686,501 to $ 50,850,000 .
The main reason for the Giants ’ loud trumpeting of the contract has been the notion that they are tying their future to Manning ’s , that they will rise and fall on his success or failure .
But that ’s not true either .
If Manning were to crap out this season , the Giants could n’t cut him because they ’d take too much of a hit .
But by seasons two and three ?
“ If you cut him in either one of those years , the amount of proration that ’s going to come into those years , the penalty that you ’re going to pay for cutting him is not going to be equal to or more than what his cap number was going to be anyway , ” Halsell says .
“ So if you cut him after , in 2011 , you actually save yourself some money .
So they ’re not going to be struggling to make that decision , if they have to go that route . ”
Manning ranked fourteenth in the NFL last season in pass efficiency , seventeenth in yards , and tenth in touchdowns .
Those are far less impressive numbers than “ first in salary . ”
He might not look like the best quarterback in football , but they pretend he ’s paid like one .
They plan for the illusion to hold .
At least for the next two or three years .
And in a way , it ’s a smart move .
Manning has played well so far , and there ’s something winningly old - school about it , a harking back to the time when people truly put their money — or at least their public money — behind their convictions .
Only time will tell if the Giants ’ confidence will pay off … or if it ’s another case of irrational exuberance .
Sarcopenia is the name ( fairly recently ) given to age - related muscle loss , a situation that most people find themselves in with advancing age .
In past years , researchers have investigated whether this might related to tendencies for diet to change with age , such as reduced protein intake for example .
Interestingly , however , there is also solid evidence for the practice of calorie restriction to slow the process of sarcopenia .
Back in 2005 , one group of scientists painted a fairly convincing argument for dysfunctional processing of the essential amino acid leucine as the cause of sarcopenia , a dysfunction that can be overcome by simply consuming more leucine .
Those researchers went on to point the finger at increasing chronic inflammation that occurs with aging as a root cause of this amino acid processing problem :
In old rats , the ability of leucine to stimulate muscle protein synthesis was significantly decreased compared with adults .
This defect was reversed when old rats were supplemented with antioxidants [ but it ] was not related to increased oxidative damage ...
These effects could be mediated through a reduction in the inflammatory state , which decreased with antioxidant supplementation .
You can look back in the Fight Aging !
archives for more of a background on inflammation and aging :
Inflammation participates importantly in host defenses against infectious agents and injury , but it also contributes to the pathophysiology of many chronic diseases .
Interactions of cells in the innate immune system , adaptive immune system , and inflammatory mediators orchestrate aspects of the acute and chronic inflammation that underlie diseases of many organs .
Let me direct your attention to another more recent demonstration of the link between age - related chronic inflammation and sarcopenia in rats :
Recently , low grade inflammation has been suspected to be one of the factors responsible for the decreased sensitivity of muscle protein metabolism to food intake .
This study was undertaken to examine the effect of long term prevention of low grade inflammation on muscle protein metabolism during aging .
Older rats ( 20 month of age ) were separated into two groups : a control group and a group ( IBU ) in which low grade inflammation had been reduced with a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug ( ibuprofen ) .
After 5 months of treatment , inflammatory markers and cytokines levels were significantly improved in treated old rats when compared to the controls ... controlling the development of low grade inflammation in old rats significantly decreased muscle mass loss between 20 and 25 months of age .
In conclusion , the observations made in this study have identified low grade inflammation as an important target for pharmacological , nutrition and lifestyle interventions that aim to limit sarcopenia and muscle weakness in the rapidly growing elderly population in Europe and North America .
Turning back to calorie restriction once again , you might recall that reduced calorie intake does in fact reduce the level of inflammation suffered with advancing age , an effect possibly achieved though loss of visceral fat tissue .
Taken together , all of this is one more reason to take better care of your health , and keep up with those practices known to reduce inflammation - such as not letting yourself get fat .
Rieu I , Magne H , Savary - Auzeloux I , Averous J , Bos C , Peyron MA , Combaret L , & Dardevet D ( 2009 ) .
Reduction of low grade inflammation restores blunting of postprandial muscle anabolism and limits sarcopenia in old rats .

As a promotion for its new " Trivial Pursuit Team " offering , game maker Hasbro has foisted upon the Internet an " experiment " that threatens to permanently undermine men's largely self - anointed standing as the masters of minutiae .
It 's a battle of the sexes , all right , and so far the women have opened up a can on the men .
The " experiment , " which began Oct. 7 and runs through Dec. 31 , is simple and the rules even simpler :
You go to Hasbro 's special Trivial Pursuit Web site , announce your gender , and start answering questions in the categories -- art / literature , sports / leisure , science / nature , geography , history and entertainment -- that are familiar to anyone who has ever ruined an otherwise tranquil family gathering with a bout of the classic board game .
Every correct answer earns your " team " a point .
When I first checked last Friday after reading this story on Network World , women had accumulated 176,369 correct answers to 159,210 for the men , which represented a 53 % to 47 % advantage .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
That was then .
As I type this morning , the gap has swelled to 58 - 42 % -- 353,753 to 258,879 -- where it 's been holding steady since Sunday ...
Oh , swell .
( Attention : Game - changing update at bottom of post . )
Whatever happened to the Internet gender gap ?
Troop strength clearly matters here .
What is the Wikipedia editing crowd -- famously revealed recently to be 87 % male -- doing while this indignity is unfolding ?
Editing Wikipedia , you say ?
Priorities , people , priorities .
Where 's Colbert ?
Where 's Limbaugh ?
Where -- dare I say it -- is 4 chan when the stakes here are so much higher than a silly Time poll .
Now let 's address the possible excuses , lame though they may be , before we get too agitated .
Participants in this " experiment " self - identify themselves , which means that men could be masquerading as women and vice versa .
However , as a spokesman for Hasbro tells the Daily Mail of London , there 's no strategic value in trying to sabotage either opposite sex by tanking questions : " You could go online and pretend to be a dim member of the opposition , but this will do nothing to the results as points do n't get taken away for wrong answers , they only rise with the correct ones .
( Any ) time spent answering incorrectly for the opposition is merely time wasted which could be used answering correctly for your own team . "
Might there be hordes of men selflessly playing in virtual drag and offering correct answers , sacrificing their own sense of gender worth in the name of chivalry ?
( Even Book of Odds would refuse to try to quantify that improbability . )
No , fellas , we 're getting trivialized , all right .
The only unanswered question is whether we 're going to do anything about it .
( Update , 3:15 p.m. : A mere 10 hours after my posting of this item -- and with the help of sites such as Reddit and Fark -- what was earlier today a 16 - percentage - point margin , has been narrowed to less than 1 percent ; it 's now 50.4 % to 49.6 % in favor of the women .
...
My work here is almost done . )
( Update 2 , 4:15 p.m. :
The guys are now ahead 51 % to 49 % out of a total of 785,500 correct answers logged .
A full 22 % of those answers -- 173,000 -- have been registered just since this morning . )
( Update , Wednesday , 8:15 a.m. : Welcome Diggers .
The turnaround on the scoreboard is complete this morning as there now have been 950,864 correct answers registered with the men holding a 54 % to 46 % advantage . )
If locations were billed alongside actors , Robert DeNiro would share co-starring credits on Taxi Driver with New York City .
The character of Travis Bickle is utterly co-dependent with the New York of 1976 , a spawn of all that New York had become at the time .
Without the tough , dangerous , smut - filled , immoral , seedy , dank , sweaty , filthy , gritty streets of that world , Bickle could not exist .
That world has vanished .
Travis Bickle is dead .
Finding the locations used in Taxi Driver turned out to be incredibly difficult , largely because the film documents a side of the city that has since been demolished , rebuilt , renovated , spit - shined , and stamped with a seal of approval .
Literally , entire blocks that appear in the movie have been leveled since 1976 , and only the brief appearance of a building number or street sign gives any clue to the actual location .
The movie begins with a blurry , surreal trip through Times Square and the surrounding blocks .
Though the footage is too distorted to be sure of any locations , I ’d love to know where that Modell ’s is ( 6th Ave ? ) .
The film opens with Travis Bickle heading to a cabstand on 57th Street to get a job .
In the background of the first shot , the now defunct West Side Elevated Highway is visible .
The elevated highway was shutdown in 1973 due to neglect and deterioration ( a dump truck collapsing through a portion near 14th Street sealed its fate ) .
The highway was later dismantled and replaced by the mostly ground - level West Side Highway ( though some of the old elevated portions remain north of 57th St ) .
The building on the river is gone – anyone know what it is ( maybe an old marine terminal ) ?
Note the view of New Jersey in the background ; many of those same houses and buildings still exist .
The building on the left in this next still has been torn down ; a glass - and - steel highrise is currently going up in its place .
Sadly , the cab stand and surrounding buildings have all been demolished – I ’m guessing another glass - and - steel apartment building will also be going up on this spot soon .
Before we continue , a quick look around 57th Street to see what still remains from the Taxi Driver days :
This building on the corner is one of the few remaining structures that was around in 1976 .
Founded in 1897 , Artkraft Strauss was a sign manufacturer famous for creating Times Square ’s most iconic neon displays , including the smoking camel , the Bond sign , and the Morgan Stanley ticker .
Artkraft Strauss was also responsible for creating and maintaining the National Debt Clock on 34th Street .
In 2006 , Artkraft Strauss closed its manufacturing arm to focus on consulting .
I ’m willing to bet this garage sign has been around since ’ 76 .
Finally , I ’m not 100 % sure about Jamie ’s Foreign Car Service , but that font seems pretty dated … and when was the last time you saw a sign in Manhattan advertising repair work on “ Japanese Cars ” ?
Back to the film .
Now equipped with a cab , Travis begins making the rounds ( he seems to prefer the Times Square beat ) .
For a brief moment , you get a glimpse out the rear window of the cab :
Bond Clothing , on the right in the Taxi Driver still , was once one of the most memorable buildings in Times Square .
Famous for advertising “ two - trouser suits , ” the original building featured two 50 - foot statues of a man and a woman …
… and a 50,000 gallon “ waterfall ” sign behind the main logo , spanning 120 feet at over 27 feet high .
Note the sign declaring that “ every hour , 3,490 people buy at Bond ” ( very exact ! ) .
Sadly , the Bond store went through many renovations , and closed their Times Square location in 1977 ( a year after the filming of Taxi Driver ) .
A new restaurant using the Bond name has opened on 45th Street .
As Travis is driving along , you get a few very quick glimpses at some long gone Times Square establishments .
This eatery ( location unknown ) , offers 2 eggs and extras for the bargain price of 90 cents .
A small market ( location also unknown ) offers cigarettes for 45 - 50 cents .
Next , we get the iconic shot of Travis walking down 8th Ave south of 47th Street to go to a porno movie .
Yup , a Duane Reader on the corner , a Hilton across the street , and the porn theater is now a Gray Line bus company ticket center ( I have to admit , there is something satisfying about the thought of tourists buying NY sightseeing tickets there , totally clueless to the building ’s questionable past ) .
Marquee comparisons :
Travis goes the Show & Tell theater at 737 8th
Ave between 46th & 47th ( DeNiro met his first wife , actress Dihanne Abbot , during the interior filming – she played the porno theater ’s concession stand girl ) .
There are two possibilities for the current 737 8th
Ave , and neither are very rewarding :
A vacant lot midway up the block …
… or a strip of shuttered former porn video stores on the south corner .
Either way , the Show & Tell is gone ( though would n’t this be the perfect place for another glass - and - steel apartment building ?? ) .
After , we get a couple of totally random shots of New York , including this one on 7th Ave at 33rd Street , with the Empire State building in the background .
Coney Island Pizza on the left is now a Sbarro’s .
The restaurant on the right is long gone .
The building midway down the block is now the Old Navy flagship store .
I miss NY ’s old yellow street signs .
But at least we have a new JC Penney’s !
The movie then takes us uptown to the Charles Palantine campaign headquarters at the corner of 63rd St & Broadway , where Travis meets love interest Betsy .
The building is completely gone , replaced by an ugly apartment highrise :
Oddly , the “ Locations Then - And - Now ” featurette on the Taxi Driver Special Edition DVD incorrectly identifies this building at 62nd & Broadway as the campaign office , which I originally posted about :
Luckily , alert SNY reader David pointed out the mistake .
Last time I ’ll trust a DVD featurette …
Today , the doors that once brought you into Palantine ’s campaign office now take you into a Bank of America .
The stoop Travis sits on is gone ( oops – according to alert reader Alex , that ’s actually Scorsese and not DeNiro ) :
Betsy exiting the building :
After Travis gets
Betsy to agree to a coffee date , he ’s back on his beat in Times Square .
Here , we get a POV shot as Travis pulls over on the west side of 7th Ave btw .
42nd & 43rd streets .
Things have changed a bit :
The theater playing Anita Nymphet is the old Rialto Theater , sadly torn down in 1998 to make way for the glass - and - steel Reuters building – check out an interesting comparison between buildings here .
Playland is gone , of course .
And , on the corner , you get a look at former New York City - based fast food chain Nedicks , once famous for its orange drinks .
The big arrow points to a Kentucky Fried Chicken , now gone ( you can see part of the white sign ) .
Depressed ?
Do n’t be – it only gets worse !
Check out Part 2 !

Michigan governor slashes $ 54 million more from school funding
By Tom Eley
21 October 2009
Michigan Governor Jennnifer Granholm on Monday vetoed $ 54 million more from public school funding in a bid to help meet the state ’s $ 2 billion budget deficit .
The cut comes on top of a $ 165 - per- student cut enacted in a temporary budget passed earlier in the month , which is now effective for the year .
The additional cuts would affect 39 school districts in the state , 26 of them grouped in the three southeastern Michigan counties of Oakland , Macomb , and Wayne , around metropolitan Detroit .
The districts were targeted for additional cuts due to a special exemption that had previously allowed them to spend more per student than other schools in the state because of their relatively large property tax bases .
These are hardly “ rich ” school districts .
Most of them are in largely working class suburbs of Detroit that have already been devastated by the Obama administration ’s forced bankruptcy of the US auto industry .
The Detroit suburbs of Livonia and Dearborn would each lose $ 4.9 million in funding if Granholm ’s veto holds .
Wayne County would see 10 districts lose money .
The Detroit public school system , already in a state of collapse , would not suffer additional cuts .
Granholm claims she vetoed the funding in order to force lawmakers to come up with additional forms of revenue to meet the budget deficit .
But there is little chance the funding will be restored .
“ Those lines the governor vetoed will simply be unfunded , ” a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop said .
“ If the governor wants to veto parts of this budget , we will not refund them . ”
The affected school districts were shocked by the news .
Northville Schools Superintendent Leonard Rezmierski called Granholm ’s veto “ a horrific amount of reduction after we ’ve started school . ”
Heidi Nanse , president of the Livonia Parent Teacher Student Association , told the World Socialist Web Site the cuts would be “ devastating . ”
She said that rather than driving down funding for school districts like Livonia , the state should be increasing funding for poorer districts , such as those in Detroit proper .
“ This decision is very bad for our children , and children are our future , ” Nance said .
“ It ’s going to be devastating , ” Trenton public schools Superintendent John Save told the Detroit Free Press .
“ We had no idea this was coming down . ”
“ We feel totally abandoned ....
It puts us in an almost impossible position , ” said Tim McAvoy , a spokesman for the Troy public schools , noting that the school district must now cut an additional $ 3 million on top of $ 2 million in cuts it must put in place resulting from the state ’s per-pupil funding cuts , and having already slashed $ 7 million from its budget this year .
“ To slash these funds when we are well into our fiscal year is unconscionable .
It puts us [ in ] an extremely difficult position . ”
Granholm and the state legislature waited until the last minute to pass the education funding bill , which was required to be in place by Tuesday morning .
The state ’s ongoing budget crisis had left school districts without necessary state money to fund ongoing operations such as employee payroll .
The bill also cuts $ 8 million in funding to small rural high schools , $ 16.3 million to intermediate schools , $ 3 million to vocational education , and $ 2 million to adult education .
This may only be the beginning .
Funding reductions to Michigan ’s public education system will , by all indications , be intensified in a matter of weeks .
The cut of $ 165 - per- student funding was based on the assumption that the state could raise an additional $ 100 million in revenue .
While the legislature failed to appropriate the $ 100 million , tax revenues for public education have eroded still further .
The state treasury has just revealed that projected sales tax revenues have plummeted beyond expectations , leaving collections for school aid $ 264 million further in the red .
As a result , “ Granholm may have to order cuts later this fall that school officials say could amount to reductions of about $ 300 per student , ” according to the Detroit News .
The treasury indicated that still more cuts would follow over the next five years .
“ If this school aid bill were a check drawn on a bank , it would be returned for insufficient funds , ” Granholm declared .
“ To bring the budget into balance , I have vetoed $ 54 million in appropriations .
But even these reductions will not fully resolve the shortfall . ”
Meanwhile , Michigan ’s budget crisis continues , with Granholm , House Democrats , and Senate Republicans bickering over equally reactionary measures to meet the state ’s estimated $ 2 billion shortfall .
All are in agreement that spending on social programs and education , and the jobs and benefits of state workers , must be savagely cut .
None propose any increases in income taxes on the wealthy or the financial institutions that have preyed on the state ’s industry and workers .
In addition to spending cuts , Granholm favors increased forms of regressive taxation that target workers ’ purchases , while Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature have resisted any new forms of taxation .
Republicans call for blocking a tax credit to low - income workers , while Democrats demand a 3 percent surtax on doctors ’ gross sales receipts , which would inevitably be passed on to health care consumers .
House on a Rock at Rhode Island | Clingstone , an unusual and such a vintage , 103 - year - old mansion in Rhode Island ’s Narragansett Bay , survives through the love and hard work of family and friends .
Henry Wood , the owner , runs the house like a camp where all skilled workers welcome .
The Jamestown Boatyard hauls the family ’s boats and floating dock and stores them each winter in return for a week ’s use of the house in the summer .
Once in a while , they are traveling overseas .
For cheap flight tickets , please visit flighthub.com .
Mr. Wood , a 79 - year - old Boston architect , bought the house with his ex-wife Joan in 1961 for $ 3,600 .
It had been empty for two decades .
Clingstone had been built by a distant cousin , J.S. Lovering Wharton .
Mr. Wharton worked with an artist , William Trost Richards , to create a house of picture windows with 23 rooms on three stories radiating off a vast central hall .
The total cost of the construction , which was completed in 1905 , was $ 36,982.99 .
However , bear in mind that the currency in 1905 is not the same as for now .
Possibly the price is estimated about $ 4 millions .
An early sketch of the house shows the plan on how they develop the greatest architecture .
Mr. Wood is as proud as any parent of his house , and keeps a fat scrapbook of photographs and newspaper clippings that document its best moments .
Many of the historic photos he has were provided by the company that insured the house for its original owners .
The Newport Bridge is visible from the windows of the Ping - Pong room , to the left of the fireplace .
The house is maintained by an ingenious method : the Clingstone work weekend .
Held every year around Memorial Day , it brings 70 or so friends and Clingstone lovers together to tackle jobs like washing all 65 of the windows .
Anne Tait , who is married to Mr. Wood ’s son Dan , refinished the kitchen floor on one of her first work weekends .
There are 10 bedrooms at Clingstone , all with indecently beautiful views .
The dining room table seats 14 .
Refinishing the chairs is a task on the list for a future work weekend .
Sign by the ladder that leads to the roof reads “ No entry after three drinks or 86 years of age “ .
“ It used to say 80 but we had a guy on a work weekend who was 84 , so I changed it , ” said Mr. Wood , ever the realist .
It would have been a shame to curtail the activities of a willing volunteer .

As expected , Houston mayoral candidate Annise Parker is on the receiving end of an attack campaign .
But this one is n’t from the Houston Area Pastor Council , which is planning a religious - based assault .
Instead , the 35,000 homes that will receive a flyer lambasting Parker come from Dave Wilson , an electrician .
Then again , Wilson turns to his Christian faith in finding a reason to oppose the candidate .
Seeing Parker , currently the city controller , with her lesbian partner is n’t an image Wilson wants to see , he says .
And yet he ’s the one distributing that very image !
It ’s unclear whether the flyers will have any effect in mobilizing Houston ’s conservatives , and how long it will take HPAC to follow up .
But one thing is for sure :
The campaign relies entirely on Parker ’s sexuality .
“ Just because Annise Parker is a lesbian does n’t make her qualified to be Mayor of Houston , ” the flyer reads .
And he ’s right .
Just because she ’s a lesbian does n’t make her qualified .
But it does n’t disqualify her , either .
Attentive readers of this blog may have noticed that those who post comments to my entries often show two interesting and complementary attitudes : a fundamental distrust of ( if not downright contempt for ) philosophy , coupled with an overly enthusiastic endorsement of science .
Take , for instance , my recurring argument that some ( but not all ! ) of the “ new atheists ” engage in scientistic attitudes by overplaying the epistemological power of science while downplaying ( or even simply negating ) the notion that science fundamentally depends on non-empirical ( i.e. , philosophical ) assumptions to even get started .
Since my personal career , first as a scientist for 27 years , now as a philosopher , has been marked by experience in both fields , and moreover by a strong belief that the two enterprises are complementary and not adversarial , I feel it is time to make some extended comment on this general issue .
It is perhaps appropriate to tackle the problem at the end of 2009 , the year that marks not just the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin ’s Origin of Species ( and the 150th anniversary of the publication of the arguably even more momentous On Liberty by John Stuart Mill ) , but also the 50th anniversary of C.P.
Snow ’s famous essay “ on the two cultures , ” on the intellectual divide between the sciences and the humanities .
In his essay , Snow ( rightly ) chastised what he saw as an unjustifiable attitude of intellectual superiority on the part of people from the humanities ’ side of the divide : “ A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who , by the standards of the traditional culture , are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists .
Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
The response was cold : it was also negative .
Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of : Have you read a work of Shakespeare's ? ”
Indeed , it ought to be indefensible that someone is considered ignorant for not having read Shakespeare , and yet the same charge is unthinkable when it comes to fundamental scientific concepts , like the second principle of thermodynamics .
But the problem cuts equally deeply on the other side , just consider the following quote from physicist Steven Weinberg ( in his Dreams of a Final Theory ) :
“ The insights of philosophers have occasionally benefited physicists , but generally in a negative fashion — by protecting them from the preconceptions of other philosophers ...
Philosophy of science at its best seems to me a pleasing gloss on the history and discoveries of science . ”
Here Weinberg makes the all - too common mistake of thinking of philosophy as of an activity whose entire worth is measured by how useful it is to solve scientific problems .
But why should that be so ?
We already have science to help us solve scientific problems , philosophy does something else by using different tools , so why compare apples and oranges ?
By the same token , why not ask why art critics do n’t produce paintings , for instance , or editors write books ?
For the purposes of this discussion , I assume that most people have at least some idea of what science is , if not of the intricacies of the epistemological and metaphysical problems inherent in the practice of science ( and there are many : as Daniel Dennett put it in Darwin ’s Dangerous Idea , “ There is no such thing as philosophy - free science ; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination . ” )
Science , broadly speaking , deals with the study and understanding of natural phenomena , and is concerned with empirically ( i.e. , either observationally or experimentally ) testable hypotheses advanced to account for those phenomena .
Philosophy , on the other hand , is much harder to define .
Broadly speaking , it can be thought of as an activity that uses reason to explore issues that include the nature of reality ( metaphysics ) , the structure of rational thinking ( logic ) , the limits of our understanding ( epistemology ) , the meaning implied by our thoughts ( philosophy of language ) , the nature of the moral good ( ethics ) , the nature of beauty ( aesthetics ) , and the inner workings of other disciplines ( philosophy of science , philosophy of history , and a variety of other “ philosophies of ” ) .
Philosophy does this by methods of analysis and questioning that include dialectics and logical argumentation .
Now , it seems to me obvious , but apparently it needs to be stated that : a ) philosophy and science are two distinct activities ( at least nowadays , since science did start as a branch of philosophy called natural philosophy ) ; b) they work by different methods ( empirically - based hypothesis testing vs. reason - based logical analysis ) ; and c ) they inform each other in an inter-dependent fashion ( science depends on philosophical assumptions that are outside the scope of empirical validation , but philosophical investigations should be informed by the best science available in a range of situations , from metaphysics to ethics and philosophy of mind ) .
So when some commentators for instance defend the Dawkins - and Coyne - style ( scientistic ) take on atheism , i.e. , that science can mount an attack on all religious beliefs , they are granting too much to science and too little to philosophy .
Yes , science can empirically test specific religious claims ( intercessory prayer , age of the earth , etc. ) , but the best objections against the concept of , say , an omnibenevolent and onmnipowerful god , are philosophical in nature ( e.g. , the argument from evil ) .
Why , then , not admit that by far the most effective way to reject religious nonsense is bycombining science and philosophy , rather than trying to arrogate to either more epistemological power than each separate discipline actually possesses ?
Another common misconception is that philosophy , unlike science , does n’t make progress .
This is simply not true , unless one measures progress by the ( scientific ) standard of empirical discovery .
But that would be like accusing the New York Yankees of never having won an NBA title : they can ’t , they ai n’t playing the same game .
Philosophy makes progress because dialectical analysis generates compelling objections to a given position , which lead to either an improvement or the abandonment of said position , which is followed by more critical analysis of either the revised position or of the new one , and so on .
For instance , ethical theories ( moral philosophy ) , or theories about consciousness ( philosophy of mind ) , or about the nature of science ( philosophy of science ) , have steadily progressed so that no contemporary professional philosopher would consider herself a utilitarian in the original sense intended by Jeremy Bentham , or a Cartesian dualist , or a Popperian falsificationist — just in the same way in which no scientist today would defend Newtonian mechanics , or the original version of Darwin ’s theory .
It is also interesting to note that the process I just described may never reach and end result , but neither does science !
Scientific theories are always tentative , and they are always either improved upon or abandoned in favor of new ones .
So how come we are willing to live with uncertainty and constant revision in science , but demand some sort of definitive truth from philosophy ?
Now why is it that so many people take sides on a debate that does n’t make much sense , rather than rejoice in what the human mind can achieve through the joint efforts of two of its most illustrious intellectual traditions ?
I think the answer here is no different from the one available to Snow fifty years ago : people in the humanities are afraid of cultural colonization ( which is actually the expressed agenda of scientistic thinkers like E.O. Wilson , see his Consilience : The Unity of Knowledge ) , while scientists have been made arrogant by their recently acquired prestige and enhanced financial resources , so that they do n't think they need to bother with activities that do n’t bring in millions of dollars in funding every year .
It ’s a rather sad , and indeed positively irritating , state of affairs , which is being fought by a handful of activities ( usually , though not always , initiated by philosophers ) , like my own “ sci-phi ” effort , or like the Permanent Observatory on Integration between the Human and Natural Sciences in Italy .
It ’s an uphill battle , especially in an era of ever increasing academic specialization , not to mention the ease with which people can now customize their intellectual experiences online , reading only the sort of things they are already interested in , or authors with whose positions they already agree .
Which is actually one of the things that make this particular forum somewhat unusual and , to me at least , stimulating .
So fire away your opinions , let the sci-phi discussion begin !
Throughout history , for every great man in public knowledge , there is at least one more , of equal importance , forgotten .
In the case of Apollo 11 , the NASA mission that put men on the moon , that forgotten hero is pilot Michael Collins .
After all , what good is being first on the moon if no one is there to pick you back up ?
Editor 's Note :
This is a continuation of Andy 's blog post about another Great Man You 've Never Heard Of , Norman Borlaug on his Art of Manliness Community blog .
Some great men history over looks entirely .
While other great men get overshadowed by their comrades being launched into the lime light , leaving them to fade into obscurity .
The recent completion of the LCROSS mission got me thinking , and inspired a , “ Space : the final frontier , ” in my most William Shatner - like voice .
In my book , any person that gets launched into outer space is worthy of the title of ‘ Great ' .
However , LCROSS went to the Moon , and that is where we shall go , as well .
In 1969 , the world rejoiced with the phrase , “ The Eagle has landed . ” Mankind had finally landed on the Moon .
Everyone has heard of the first man on the Moon , Neil Armstrong .
Many people even know of the second , Buzz Aldrin .
A lot of people do not realize , however , that it was a three - man mission .
Michael Collins remained on the command module to pilot it .
Michael Collins is a “ Great Man You Have Never Heard Of ” .
Collins was Born on October 31 , 1930 in Rome , Italy to United States Army Major General James Lawton Collins .
He moved around a lot as a kid , living in Rome , Oklahoma , Governors Island , Puerto Rico , and Virginia .
After graduating from the United States Military Academy , he joined the Air Force .
In 1960 Collins applied for and was accepted to the Experimental Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California .
He decided to become an astronaut in 1962 when John Glenn in Mercury Atlas 8 circled the Earth in 90 minutes .
When NASA was accepting applications for their third group of astronauts , Collins immediately applied and was accepted into the program .
Collins 's first assignment was as the back up pilot for Gemini 7 .
After the completion of that mission , he was assigned to the crew of Gemini 10 along with John Young .
Their three day mission called for them to rendezvous with two different Agena Target Vehicles , undertake two Extra - Vehicular Activities , and perform fifteen different experiments .
With the launch of the Apollo missions , NASA decided that the pilot of the command module should have some experience piloting in space .
This change in policy is what shifted Collins from the lunar module , which he was training for , into the command module for the Apollo 11 flight .
During the Apollo 11 mission , Collins 's role was to pilot the command module , which remained in orbit , while the lunar module descended to the lunar surface with his crew mates .
After the departure of the lunar module , Collins orbited the Moon and waited for the lander to ascend back into orbit and dock with it .
Each orbit of the Moon took about two hours , and according to his own recollection , he orbited the Moon 20 to 22 times .
When he passed behind the Moon , Collins became Earth 's farthest solo traveler , separated from the Earth by 250,000 miles of space and the girth of the Moon .
He was also out of contact with Mission Control while on the far side of the Moon because the Moon blocked the radio transmissions .
After the Apollo 11 mission , Collins left NASA and held several positions .
Most notably he became Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs , and director of the National Air and Space Museum .
He also wrote a few books .
His autobiography , Carrying the Fire : An Astronauts Journey , Liftoff : The Story of America 's Adventure in Space , Mission to Mars , and a children 's book , Flying To the Moon : An Astronauts Story .
So the next time you are at the pub , in the cafeteria , or even by yourself , call for some quiet , and raise a glass of your preferred beverage to Michael Collins , the forgotten man of the Apollo 11 Mission .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Shares of A123 Systems , one of just a handful of U.S. - based makers of batteries for electric cars , debuted sharply higher from their offering price Thursday as investors cheered the closely watched firm .
A123 's stock , which now trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol AONE ( AONE ) , surged over 50 % Thursday to close at $ 20.10 a share , a day after the company raised $ 380 million through an initial public offering .
The offering was priced late Wednesday at $ 13.50 a share , well above the originally proposed range , according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing .
It began trading Thursday at $ 17 a share .
Buzz around the company is running high .
" I heard it was standing room only at many of the presentations , " that the company made for money managers , said one person familiar with the firm .
The company is closely watched for several reasons .
First , its origins and backers give it some credibility in the high tech world .
The company , an outgrowth of the research labs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , is based in Watertown , Mass .
along the Route 128 technology corridor .
It was founded in 2001 with a $ 100,000 grant from the Department of Energy , and now has facilities in 10 countries .
The firm has around 1,700 employees , mostly located abroad .
Analysts give the company credit for developing a very competitive technology that relied on the nanotechnology research from MIT .
Since then then it has raised money from venture capital funds and a few high profile companies , including General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) and Motorola ( MOT , Fortune 500 ) .
The firm recently won a $ 250 million grant from the federal government to build a production facility outside Detroit - the second largest grant awarded in a recent $ 2.4 billion round of stimulus - related funding .
The factory will complement production facilities the company already has in Asia .
And Asia is probably the biggest reason A123 is so closely watched .
The firm is one of just a few American companies that are competing with much larger Asian rivals for the potentially lucrative market for hybrid and plug - in electric car batteries .
Many analysts believe electric cars will begin replacing internal combustion engines , refueling with nuclear or renewable - generated electricity as the world becomes more concerned with global warming .
Since the battery is the most expensive component in an electric car , the conventional wisdom has it that whoever controls the battery market may ultimately control the auto industry .
The public offering , planned over a year ago but delayed after the market meltdown , comes as the stock market rebound continues and public offerings are again in fashion .
This week there are eight companies slated to go public , in the busiest week since 2007 .
The firms ' underwriters , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs , took notice in all the buzz surrounding the company .
They raised the offering price at least twice during the last few days , from $ 8 - $ 9.50 a share to the eventual $ 13.50 .
But just because A123 is a hot topic does n't necessarily mean it's a good investment .
Namely , it has yet to turn a profit , although that 's not uncommon for tech startups .
The firm lost over $ 40 million in the first half of 2009 on sales of just under $ 43 million , according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
In 2008 , the company lost over $ 80 million on sales of $ 68.5 million .
While many analysts see electric cars as the next dominant transportation technology , that future is by no means guaranteed .
Natural gas , advanced biofuels , hydrogen , super - efficient gasoline engines or even a mix of technologies could ultimately prevail .
While A123 has working relationships with many firms -- including Chrysler , Daimler , BMW and General Motors -- it 's not a major supplier to any of them as of yet .
The company 's biggest projects currently include a deal with BAE Systems for bus batteries , a project with Black and Decker for power tool batteries , and a deal with Mercedes - Benz 's HighPerformanceEngines .
Plus , A123 is a small player competing against large , mostly Asian firms with decades of experience in the battery business thanks to their proficiency in making things like cell phones and laptops .
Panasonic ( PC ) is in a joint venture with Toyota ( TM ) , Sanyo supplies Volkswagen and Honda ( HMC ) , and NEC is working with Nissan , according to research firm ThinkEquity .
The American firm Johnson Controls ( JCI , Fortune 500 ) has partnered with French - based Saft to supply Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) , Mercedes and BMW .
General Motors recently chose a subsidiary of Korean firm LG as its partner on the much hyped plug - in Chevy Volt , although GM is thought to be still working with A123 in some capacity and left the door open for a possible deal with A123 in the future .
The high court today flatly rejected claims by David Miliband , the foreign secretary , that releasing evidence of the CIA 's inhuman and unlawful treatment of UK resident Binyam Mohamed would harm Britain 's relations with the US by giving away intelligence secrets .
Evidence that the foreign secretary also wants to suppress is believed to reveal what British intelligence officers knew about Mohamed 's treatment .
Mohamed , 31 , an Ethiopian , says he was tortured in Pakistan , Morocco , Afghanistan , and Guantánamo Bay .
In the sixth in a string of damning rulings , the high court accused Miliband of wanting to suppress information about CIA activities even though details had already been disclosed by the Obama administration .
Dismissing Miliband 's claims , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones insisted they were not trying to give away " American secrets " .
They said : " Of itself , the treatment to which Mr Mohamed was subjected could never properly be described in a democracy as ' a secret ' or an ' intelligence secret ' or ' a summary of classified intelligence ' . "
The judges revealed that seven paragraphs in a key document Miliband insists must remain secret " relate to admissions of what officials of the US did to BM during his detention in Pakistan " .
They repeated their earlier finding that " what is contained in those seven redacted paragraphs gives rise to an arguable case of torture or cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
The court has heard that a British security service officer interrogated Mohamed in Pakistan and officials passed information about him to the CIA .
It was clear , the judges said , that the relationship of the UK to the US in connection with Mohamed " was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing " .
In one stinging passage , the judges said yesterday the foreign secretary " was not prepared either to produce evidence or address argument to us " .
Evidence that Miliband still wanted kept secret related to the question why " it was impossible to believe that President Obama would take action against the United Kingdom " , and " why publication ... is necessary to uphold the rule of law and democratic accountability " , the judges said .
They revealed that one passage the foreign secretary had now agreed could be disclosed referred to a memo from Jay Bybee , US assistant attorney general , to John Rizzo , acting CIA general counsel , which , the judges said , " made clear that the techniques described were those employed against Mr Zubaydah , alleged to be a high - ranking member of al Qaida . "
The judges said the remainder of the paragraph , which remains redacted from public versions of their rulings , was a " verbatim quote " from a memo made public in the US seven months ago .
The Bybee memo was written in 2002 , the year Mohamed was arrested .
It sought to justify as legal , and not regarded as torture , such treatment meted out to Abu Zubaydah as temperature extremes , music played at debilitating volumes , and sexual humiliation .
Zubaydah was also subjected to beatings , isolation , wall standing , continuous cramped confinement , sleep deprivation , and waterboarding .
The judges yesterday appeared to invite a comparison between the treatment of Zubaydah and Mohamed .
They referred to another piece of evidence Miliband wanted kept secret which , they said , was " consistent with the publication of the CIA interrogation technique memoranda " .
It was necessary to stand back and ask " whether President Obama would curtail the supply of information to the United States ' oldest ally when what was put into the public domain was not intelligence " .
The judges added : " It is difficult … to see any grounds for rejecting the submission of Mr Mohamed , the UK media and the international media that there is no evidence of any real risk of serious harm to the national security of the UK . "
The legal charity Reprieve tonight accused Miliband of using " Alice in Wonderland " argument to suppress the details of the torture of Mohamed even though those details were in the public domain .
" The high court judges were scathing about the foreign secretary 's view that publishing torture methods poses a risk to national security , " it said .
A Foreign Office spokesperson said : " We are appealing the judgments ...
The issues go to the heart of the UK's intelligence sharing relationship with other countries and efforts to defend UK security . "
The judges revealed that the foreign secretary had so far agreed to pay Mohamed 's costs up to September last year amounting to more than £ 189,000 .

A good slave has a degree of flexibility about her .
Now I am not referring to the type of flexibility where she can put her legs over her head although that is always helpful .
What I am alluding to is the fact that a slave needs to be able to change directions on a moment 's notice .
The truth is that people who are high drive tend to have a lot going on .
This could be your Master .
Because of that , situations will change periodically .
Nobody has a crystal ball that predicts the future .
Instead , we make plans the best we can while holding a degree of flexibility to adjust .
Nothing is written in stone .
It seems that everyone is always asking for a " template " of how the BDSM world operates .
This seems inane to me since few ask for this in the traditional lifestyle .
Have you ever seen anyone ask for the outline of a successful marriage ?
Yet this idea comes across in the BDSM community almost daily .
Another thing that I hear is that people want the outline for the training of a slave .
Again , how can this be created when everyone is different .
Flexibility is what allows us to adjust to the different circumstances which arise in life .
Just because one is heading in a particular direction which is altered , that does not mean she suddenly is granted the right to get ornery about things .
I have seen this repeatedly from slaves .
They want to complain that their Masters changed things .
My response is that should have been considered before agreeing to a lifestyle with the basis of a total exchange of power .
A slave 's frustration is understandable but it is also part of the curriculum .
It is imperative to remember that all power resides with the Master .
Rigidity is what causes conflict .
A slave 's place is to make her Master 's life easier .
Every fight seemingly has the lack of acceptance at the core .
Someone is unhappy with something that is being done .
Usually , in M/s , it is the slave unwilling to adhere to what the Master wants .
Again , this might sound cold and harsh , but this is the most extreme aspect of our lifestyle .
That is why I feel few are really cut out for it .
Be flexible in your ideas , agenda , and daily activities .
Masters are human creatures who can get distracted rather easily .
I am probably the worst in that category if I am to be honest with you .
Nevertheless , whenever I interact with one , she quickly realizes that I am not one who micromanages .
Nor do I take the time to lay everything out for her to do during the day .
I have a basic agenda which is apt to change .
Her ability to alter her behavior to reflect my desires is crucial .
In the end , this is one of the things that proves her worth to me .
So , my suggestion is to remain loose and flexible with your Master .
It is something that I am sure will serve you both well .
A prisoner leans against an entrance to the wing where political prisoners are kept at Sarposa prison in Kandahar , Afghanistan .
( ( Dene Moore / Canadian Press ) )
The Canadian government is dismissing calls for a public inquiry into the alleged torture of prisoners handed over by Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan .
Defence Minister Peter MacKay defended his government Thursday in light of allegations that detainees were routinely abused .
" There has not been a single , solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces , " MacKay said in the House of Commons .
His comments came a day after Richard Colvin , a former senior diplomat with Canada 's Afghan mission , dropped a political bombshell on Parliament , alleging that suspects handed over by Canada to Afghan authorities were tortured .
Torture warnings
Speaking Wednesday before a Commons committee on Canada 's mission in Afghanistan , Colvin alleged that prisoners were turned over to Afghanistan 's notorious intelligence service by the Canadian military in 2006 - 07 despite warnings that they would be tortured .
He also suggested the federal government may have tried to cover up what was happening .
MacKay painted Colvin as having been duped by the Taliban and said Canadians are being asked to accept the word of prisoners " who throw acid in the face of schoolgirls . "
MacKay also said he did not know about Colvin 's allegations .
However , Ottawa University law professor Amir Attaran said the onus was on MacKay to explain how he could not have known about Colvin 's reports .
" The reality is that Mr. Colvin wrote 17 reports that he sent to colleagues in Ottawa .
He cc's more than 70 people on those reports , " Attaran said .
If Mr. Colvin was lying in those reports , " do n't you think one of them would be standing up ? "
Meanwhile , top Canadian officials discussed in December 2006 whether Asadullah Khalid , then governor of Kandahar , was involved in the torture of prisoners and dismissed the concern , according to The Canadian Press .
One source said the meeting was at the Privy Council Office and involved Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's then - national security adviser , Margaret Bloodworth .
The revelation raises more questions about how much senior officials knew about possible Afghan prisoner abuse , what they did about it and whether they passed that information along to cabinet ministers or simply ignored it .
Opposition parties seek public inquiry
All three opposition parties attacked the Conservatives on Thursday and demanded a public inquiry .
NDP Leader Jack Layton said Canada 's reputation as a champion of human rights has been hurt by the notion that prisoners handed over to Afghan authorities were tortured and that the government might have tried to cover it up .
" I believe the pressure for a full public inquiry is going to grow . …
We have to clear the air here .
Get to the bottom of it and find out whether we are dealing with a coverup , " he told CBC News .
" We certainly have to take the appropriate actions to deal with Canada 's reputation , which right now is taking a tumble . "

Afghan detainees : How should Canada handle the issue ?
Join the discussion
During his testimony , Colvin said Canada did not monitor detainee conditions ; took days , weeks or months to notify the Red Cross ; kept poor records ; and to prevent scrutiny , the Canadian Forces leadership concealed this behind " walls of secrecy . "
Richard Colvin , a former senior diplomat with Canada 's mission in Afghanistan , says detainees transferred by Canadians to Afghan prisons were likely tortured .
( ( Chris Wattie / Reuters ) )
" According to our information , the likelihood is that all the Afghans we handed over were tortured , " Colvin said .
" For interrogators in Kandahar , it was a standard operating procedure . "
Colvin worked in Kandahar for the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2006 before moving to Kabul , where he was second - in - command at the Canadian Embassy .
He said his reports were ignored and he was eventually told to stop putting the reports in writing .
Speaking on CBC's Power & Politics with Evan Solomon , MacKay said Thursday a public inquiry is n't necessary because a parliamentary inquiry is already underway .
" We have a two - track forum right now in which individuals can come forward and speak about what they know , " MacKay said .
" But most importantly , we have a forum in which evidence can actually be questioned . "
Government rejects Colvin testimony
Conservative MPs dismissed Colvin 's testimony as being based on second - and third - hand information and suggested his allegations were part of a disinformation campaign .
" He had ample opportunity to speak to ministers directly .
He chose not to do that .
He could have spoken to Gen .
Gauthier and he chose not to do that , " Conservative MP Laurie Hawn said Thursday .
" It 's just not credible . "
Retired lieutenant - general Michel Gauthier , who served as commander of the Canadian Expeditionary Force Command in Afghanistan for almost four years , told CBC News he was " deeply troubled " by Colvin 's testimony .
" In my capacity as commander of CEFCOM , I very clearly understood my responsibilities under international law with respect to the handling of detainees , and I would certainly not knowingly have done anything — ever — to expose our soldiers and commanders in the field , our government , or myself to complicity in war crimes or other wrongdoing as Mr. Colvin suggests , " Gauthier said .
" I look forward to providing an absolutely frank view of some key aspects of Mr. Colvin 's testimony when I appear before the committee next week , " Gauthier said .
Senators diverted $ 2.6 billion in funds in a defense spending bill to pet projects largely at the expense of accounts that pay for fuel , ammunition and training for U.S. troops , including those fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to an analysis .
Among the 778 such projects , known as earmarks , packed into the bill : $ 25 million for a new World War II museum at the University of New Orleans and $ 20 million to launch an educational institute named after the late Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy , Massachusetts Democrat .
While earmarks are hardly new in Washington , “ in 30 years on Capitol Hill , I never saw Congress mangle the defense budget as badly as this year , ” said Winslow Wheeler , a former Senate staffer who worked on defense funding and oversight for both Republicans and Democrats .
He is now a senior fellow at the Center for Defense Information , an independent research organization .
Sen .
Tom Coburn , Oklahoma Republican , called the transfer of funds from Pentagon operations and maintenance “ a disgrace . ”
“ The Senate is putting favorable headlines back home above our men and women fighting on the front lines , ” he said in a statement .

Mr. Wheeler , who conducted the study , compared the Obama administration ’s requests for funds with the $ 636 billion spending bill that the Senate passed .
He discovered that senators added $ 2.6 billion in pet projects while spending $ 4 billion less than the administration requested for fiscal 2010 , which began Oct.
1 .
Mr. Wheeler said that senators took most of the cash for the projects from the “ operations and maintenance ” or O&M accounts .
“ These are the accounts that pay for troop training , repairs , spares and supplies for vehicles , weapons , ships and planes , food and fuel , ” Mr. Wheeler said .
Raiding those accounts to fund big - ticket projects the military does not want , but that benefit senators ’ home states or campaign contributors , amounts to “ rancid gluttony , ” he said .
The administration ’s budget requested $ 156 billion for the regular O&M account and $ 81 billion for O&M for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The bill passed by the Senate cut $ 2.4 billion from the regular account and $ 655 million from the war O&M fund .
Senate appropriators insisted that the O&M accounts , despite the cuts , do not shortchange the troops .
“ The operation and maintenance title is fully funded , ” Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye , Hawaii Democrat , said during the debate on the bill .
“ There is no shortage . …
The committee is deeply concerned that the critical operational needs of our soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines are met with the finest equipment available . ”
Money for the Kennedy Institute was inserted by Mr. Inouye and Sen. John Kerry , Massachusetts Democrat .
Sen. Mary L. Landrieu , Louisiana Democrat , and Sen. David Vitter , Louisiana Republican , sought the funding for the World War II museum .
Whitney Smith , a spokesman for Mr. Kerry , said the earmark was “ a worthy investment . ”
“ Sen . Kennedy served on the Armed Services Committee for 27 years , where he fought to deliver top - of - the - line body armor and armored Humvees to protect our troops and save lives .
Educating Americans about these battles is a core mission for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute , which showcases one senator ’s ability to make a difference , ” Mr. Smith wrote in an e-mail .
“ This funding will help the Edward M. Kennedy Institute become one the nation ’s pre-eminent civic educational institutions , and Sen. Kerry is proud to have worked with Chairman Inouye to make it possible . ”
Mrs. Landrieu said she was “ proud to fight ” for money for the World War II museum , which is not just a “ monument to the brave men and women who served during World War II , ” but also “ a constant reminder to future generations about the tremendous sacrifice of millions of Americans . ”
She added that the earmarked funds “ will help to increase tourism to New Orleans . ”
Beyond those two earmarks , the largest in the Senate bill are :
- $ 20 million for Humvee maintenance at an Army National Guard installation in Maine , sponsored by Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe , Maine Republicans .
The senators said cuts in the maintenance program proposed by the administration would result in the “ layoff of 175 employees in a region already suffering ” from the recession .
- $ 20 million for the Maui Space Surveillance System in Hawaii , requested by Mr. Inouye .
- $ 25 million inserted by Mr. Inouye for the Hawaii Federal Health Care Network .
Mr. Inouye ’s
Web site says the health care program “ supports applied research , development and deployment of technology to improve access and the quality of care to service members , military families and impacted communities . ”
Laura Peterson , of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a nonpartisan spending watchdog , told The Washington Times , “ Earmarks like these take money away from other defense programs that the Defense Department actually wants .
While military health care is certainly a worthwhile venture , it ’s hard to see how a program located in Hawaii that openly favors Hawaii - based industries guarantees [ the Department of Defense ] the best value for such an exorbitant price tag . ”
Mr. Inouye had a total of 35 earmarks worth more than $ 206 million in the final bill , and the ranking Republican on the committee , Sen .
Thad Cochran of Mississippi , sponsored 48 worth $ 216 million .
Mr. Cochran defended earmarking as part of Congress ’ responsibility to direct government spending .
“ I am not ready to cede the power of the purse to any administration , ” he told The Times in an e-mail .
“ It is vested by the Constitution in the Congress . ”
He added that appropriators had “ reviewed the budget request very carefully , conducted public hearings and reported the appropriation bills that the committee thinks will serve the public interest . ”
In addition to the $ 2.6 billion in earmarks , the bill includes $ 2.5 billion for 10 Boeing C - 17 cargo planes that the military says it does not need , and $ 1.7 billion for an extra DDG - 51 destroyer not requested in the Pentagon ’s budget proposal .
Mr. Coburn mounted a rear - guard action on the Senate floor to try to restore some of the money to its original purpose .
One proposed amendment restored $ 100 million to the accounts by correcting the economic projections used in the bill to estimate future costs .
That passed , but other amendments to prevent the use of O&M money to fund earmarks were soundly defeated .
Mr. Wheeler said senators had raided O&M accounts to pay for narrowly targeted projects in every budget since 2002 , with dire results for troops on the front lines .
“ Air Force and Navy combat pilots training to deploy are getting about half of the flying hours they got at the end of the Vietnam War , ” he wrote in his analysis .
“ Army tank crews get less in tank training today than they did during the low - readiness Clinton years . ”
Mr. Wheeler told The Times that the figures were drawn from the Pentagon ’s budget justification .
Mr. Coburn said in May that the Navy had been forced to curtail at - sea training and flying because of a shortfall in 2009 O&M funds .
The White House Office of Management and Budget has called on lawmakers to reverse the cuts .
“ These reductions would hurt force readiness and increase stress on military people and equipment , ” the agency said .
The House approved its version of the bill in July .
Ms. Peterson said that lawmakers still could restore the funding in the conference that reconciles the two versions of the bill .
The conference “ presents a final opportunity for Congress to take their hands out of the cookie jar and put some dough where it ’s really needed - protecting our fighting men and women , ” she said .

Terrorism is n’t what it used to be .
It used to be you got real terrorists .
Even if they were freedom fighters or people trying to protect their families , they were serious about it .
These days it ’s as if the Department of Terror ca n’t lay their hands on the definite article any more .
They ca n’t even seem to find people who are already up to something .
The Department of Economic Insecurity had done their best preparing the ground .
Over the span of a few decades they had destroyed America ’s manufacturing base ; eliminated millions of jobs , leaned on immigration to allow a flood of migrants into the system while facilitating government drug operations at the same time .
There should be plenty of motivated people .
Somehow , with everything we ’ve done we just have n’t been able to generate the terror movement we ’ve been looking for .
It was assumed that after the government operations of Oklahoma City and 9/11 that any number of , wanna be famous , nut jobs would take the hint but ... nadda .
Finally law enforcement was compelled to recruit people and sometimes even invent them .
The government was just not going to be able to go in the direction that the corporations and Israel wanted it to go without a serious , terror problem .
Hundreds of junior FBI agents , Homeland Security footpads and others were sent into the streets to find people who would fit the profile .
They had to be from a Muslim country .
They needed to be young and angry about something .
Programs were established to make selected individuals angry if they were n’t already .
They would suddenly lose their job ; their wife might be assaulted by a diamond merchant on her way to a mosque , they might be evicted .
Whatever it took to get them to the right emotional state and fired up about the right target was the goal .
Once they were in the proper frame of mind , a government agent would appear as an angel of mercy and find them a job and a place to stay .
Then they would groom the ‘ terrorist ’ by providing a mental framework .
Then came the dummy bombs and engaging them in conversations where the ‘ terrorist ’ would say enough that the boys down at tech could make the taped evidence convincing .
Even with all of the effort they were putting into it , it still was n’t working right .
First of all , the ‘ terrorists ’ were n’t very bright .
They could hardly be considered intelligent if they could be sucked into something like this in the first place .
Sure , the government was also working on simply framing individuals by manufacturing evidence and adapting false scenarios to their ordinary movements but that had its own problems .
It puts us where we are today .
Now , all of a sudden there are half a dozen , five minute , stovetop , terror plots with no weapons , no crime , no nothing .
All they got are people with the t- shirt that never actually went to Disneyland .
Israel ’s getting pissed ; the corporations are hamstrung by stupid laws that still marginally protect workers and consumers .
The government is this close to being able to come out of the closet and still ... screw up after screw up , delay after delay .
In Pittsburgh a lousy couple of hundred protestors showed up to be greeted by thousands of riot cops and national guardsmen .
They had Star Wars , crowd control weapons ; titanium batons , vicious dogs and armored humvies .
Meanwhile these worthless protestors did little more than march and call out the usual slogans .
Even the police agitators among them could n’t get anything happening .
Finally the authorities had no choice but to attack .
They knocked people off of bicycles .
They clubbed elderly women .
They tear gassed people on their way to school .
They were damned efficient even without the desired response on the part of the protestors .
It just shows you how wrong the country has gone when the people who should be completely enraged at the treatment they ’ve been getting ca n’t even come up with a decent frown .
It was always the understanding of the corporations and the government employed by them that if you just put enough pressure on people they would explode .
Anywhere else and at any other time all you had to do was make life unbearable for people and they would finally react and then you could round them up ; sell them off for body parts , do necessary scientific experimentation on them or just slaughter them .
Israel manages to do that without any problem at all .
What ’s wrong with the U.S. ?
Now we ’ve got all those FEMA camps and coffins just sitting there with nobody in them .
We are seriously in need of real terrorists and we ca n’t get them for love or money .
So we ’re stuck with retards and cutouts .
We do all the field work and , god knows , we ’ve got paperwork coming out of the wazoo with all the necessary details and ... what ?
It ’s just not credible ; not to mention times like when the NYC Police Commissioner sticks his big nose into an FBI terror sting and finds no terrorists , no weapons , no nothing .
Now , how does that look ?
We got dummy operations all over the place and not one real bomb and not a single terrorist who does n’t look like we got him from Central Casting .
In order for The Big Whammy ( that ’s what we ’re calling it here at The Department of Terror ) to look authentic we have got to have solid preliminaries .
At the moment it looks like the whole thing is being run by a middle school , drama teacher .
It looks like we ’re running The Special Olympics instead of the greatest nation on Earth .
I ’ve got Napolitano on my back like an old raccoon coat that was raised from the dead and then caught rabies from a Fox News commentator .
Look , I do n’t mind that she ’s a carpet muncher but I do mind her chewing the skin off of my ass when I ’m already trying to do the best I can .
It was different when Old Death Eyes was in charge .
Working for vampire bats is workable because you know right off how things stand .
Anyway , with Death Eyes as long as you were more than twelve years old you had nothing to worry about anyway , most of the time .
I just do n’t understand it .
Back in the day we used to be able to get all kinds of competent help .
All the quality terror material has disappeared into the woodwork .
I know part of the problem is that what looked good and believable at the time has been pretty much exposed for what it really was since .
It ’s harder to get people to believe the same thing over and over when it ’s the same thing over and over .
You got that hard core 30 % that will believe anything .
All you have to do is tell them it ’s so but ... something ’s been happening with the other 70 % that is worrisome .
It ’s like they know but they are n’t saying and you ca n’t seem to make them take a swing either .
I wonder what ’s going on in their little minds .
My immediate supervisor here at the department says it ’s not going to matter all that much .
He says it comes down to how many we actually have to kill and whatever that is we ’ll “ get er done ” .
He says the flu is going to take care of most of the problem .
Apparently the vaccine is actually a trigger that reacts with something they have n’t released yet .
That ’s due to begin in a month or two .
I do n’t know exactly when because I ’m on a different operation .
I ’d just like to take a moment to say ... to ask ... to plead with the public about the real needs we have here at the department .
America is in trouble and we need your help .
There must be so many of you out there that are seriously pissed .
Some of you must be infuriated .
I know what we ’ve done to you so I can only imagine .
Wo n’t some of you please consider entering our terror program ?
We ’ve got some extraordinary benefits although you may not think so looking at it from the outside .
The fact is that you do n’t have to remain a waterboarded , mind slave for the duration .
We ’re all about ability and reward here .
Some of our top people started out as terrorists and even ordinary criminals .
Well , let me tell you brother , there ’s nothing ordinary about them now .
Our terror candidates get first class treatment all the way down the line .
All that torture nonsense is just that .
We have to make it look good , you see .
Once you ’re in the program you get special housing in the prison complex .
Your special needs are attended to .
Maybe you are presently having problems satisfying your special needs because of the legal penalties that are attached to them .
You hook up with us and there wo n’t be a problem with that .
You think about it and you give us a call .
Our lines are always open .

Experts found it hard to believe the ship would be hijacked for its cargo of timber
What really happened when the Arctic Sea cargo ship went missing amid allegations of hijacking and weapons smuggling ?
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford went to Kaliningrad to find out .
The man 's voice on the crackly recording from onboard the Arctic Sea cargo ship sounds very calm , even cheerful .
" My last port of call is Jakobstadt , Finland . "
" Your destination , sir ? Bejaia ? " the female coastguard asks from the station on the Dover cliffs overlooking the English channel .
" Yes , that 's correct , " the voice replies .
But the Arctic Sea never reached Algeria .
This was the last recorded conversation with the vessel , two days before it disappeared amid rumours of a hijack , whispers of arms smuggling and the whiff of international conspiracy .
I was given the first copy of the call by Dover coastguards as I began probing the many theories about what happened .
The cargo ship was finally located by the Russian navy 300 miles ( 483 km ) west of Cape Verde .
Eight men said to have boarded close to Sweden were whisked away to a Moscow prison and charged with hijack .
After weeks searching the vessel , far out at sea , Russian investigators announced they had found no suspicious cargo .
Cover story ?
But the official account leaves many questions unanswered .
How could pirates operate in heavily - monitored European waters ?
Would they really hijack a cargo of wood , or was something more valuable on board ?
And why did the alleged pirates surrender without a fight or a ransom ?
Apart from fuel and provisions for the crew , [ the Arctic Sea ] was empty as a drum
Vladimir Parshin
The Russian Maritime Register in Kalingrad Stitching together John le Carre - style plotlines is simple .
But pinning - down hard evidence is far tougher , and that seems deliberate .
The ship 's crew is under a gagging order , and my requests for interviews with Russian investigators and officials have come to nothing .
Fuelled by a level of secrecy unusual even for Russia , speculation about the Arctic Sea abounds .
Most gripping is the theory prompted by an Israeli intelligence source who told the BBC that Israel had warned Russia it knew the ship was smuggling S300 anti-aircraft defence systems to Iran .
Israel feared those missiles would protect any nuclear weapons facilities Iran might be building .
So the hijack was a cover story , the source said , to let Russia block the delivery and save face .
The Russian foreign minister denies there were S300s onboard the Arctic Sea , and Israeli sources will say no more .
The story is implausible but not impossible - so I tested the practicalities .
Normal ship
Before its last voyage , the Arctic Sea spent almost three weeks in Kaliningrad for what its owner calls routine maintenance .
The Arctic Sea has a similar - sized hold to this one - did it contain missiles ?
The militarised Russian region was a smugglers ' paradise after the collapse of the USSR .
The Baltic Fleet there is equipped with S300 missiles .
So Kaliningrad seems a prime spot to load secret cargo .
It was the first time the ship 's owner had chosen the Russian port , but classification records I have seen show this was a scheduled docking .
" This was an intermediate survey .
It was the end of year three in a five - year cycle so it fits , " confirmed Vladimir Parshin , local head of the Russian Maritime Register .
" We have to check the tanks and the drainage system .
We can't do that when the ship is loaded .
Apart from fuel and provisions for the crew , she was empty as a drum . "
But his team 's last visit was on 16 July , and data from Lloyds Register / Fair Play indicates that the Arctic Sea remained in Kaliningrad another day .
Despite repeat requests , I was not permitted to visit Pregol shipyard to investigate whether an illicit cargo could have been loaded then .
Instead , I traced those who went onboard the Arctic Sea in Finland , where the ship took on its official cargo of pine .
I discovered there was no physical inspection .
" If they say they are empty , they are empty , " customs officer Kjell Lintholm told me .
" We were on the ship for passport control , just documents .
It was a normal ship . "
But could a consignment of S300s have been hidden somewhere ?
Equally flawed Inside the vast hold of a British - owned ship almost identical in size to the Arctic Sea , I watched dockers at work as cranes lowered mobile homes onto deck .
There is clearly ample space for the S300 launch vehicles , but no way for the Finns to miss them .
Moscow denies S -300 missiles were on board
The seven - metre long missiles are also hard to hide .
The only feasible place is the ballast tanks , so I squeezed through a manhole and climbed into one of them to take a look .
Access to all these dark , damp areas is through an oval hole about 80 cm ( 31 inches ) at its widest .
The space beneath is fairly generous but manoeuvring a long , thick missile in there would be impossible .
" You could squeeze something in , but not big stuff , " the ship 's Russian captain agreed .
" And I do n't believe these missiles are flexible . "
Accessing the bottom ballast tanks would mean cutting open the lower deck and resealing it .
If the Russian navy was really scrambled to remove the missiles , it would have to do that from a fully - loaded timber carrier - out at sea .
Captain
Yevgeny , like others I met , is deeply sceptical .
" If the tanks are covered , there is no chance to get in them , " he told me .
Might a Russian naval frigate have transferred the timber ?
" Everything 's possible , if you really want it , " the Captain laughed .
" But it 's closer to a fairy - tale .
It would be a miracle . "
Even allowing for that miracle , all this sidesteps other big questions including how the supposed missiles would reach Iran from Algeria , and why crossing the Caspian Sea was not simpler .
I have explored several alternative theories about the Arctic Sea , and interviewed dozens of people in many countries .
So far all versions are unproven and equally flawed .
Frustrating though it is , unless someone breaks their silence , what is left is a deep mystery and any thrilling plotline you care to choose .

Last night I went to an interesting dinner sponsored by the Aspen Institute , an important Washington think tank headed by Walter Isaacson , of whom you may know .
The subject was America and innovation -- IT , new technology in other fields , so on .
I was actually there in my other capacity .
I edit a quarterly journal called Democracy : A Journal of Ideas , which is an ideas and policy journal founded by two friends of mine back in 2006 .
The current issue is devoted to the subject of innovation -- specifically , to the question of what the federal government can do to spur more private - sector innovation -- and contains some very useful stuff , if this is at all your bag ( registration required but fast and free ) .
Anyway it was a really interesting dinner with about 20 really smart people ( and me ! ) sitting around a table .
A couple of congressmen , both of whom I spoke with -- intelligent and serious men .
Several representatives of the administration .
Some think - tankers who toil in the field , and various private sector folk .
Not to get too bogged down in the particulars , but the basic deal is that the US , having led the world in such innovation for decades , is now falling behind .
Japan , some Scandinavian countries , the much - ballyhooed Estonia , and yes even old England ( in some ways ) are doing a lot more than the US is doing , on a federal level , to help new businesses innovate .
In addition , there 's all manner of technology , some of which was in fact partially developed in the US , that is being deployed in other countries but not here .
There are forms of healthcare IT , for example , that could cyber - link a patient to his or her physicians and care givers on a more - or - less constant basis , resulting in far more preventive than reactive treatment .
It would actually help patients , and over time save billions of dollars .
In use elsewhere .
Not here .
I just kept thinking to myself , as folks went around the table saying " Denmark is doing this " and " Japan has that " and " what 's wrong with us ? " that there 's really only one answer to that question .
Or two .
Answer one :
One of our two political parties wo n't let this investment happen because it's the government , and because Obama is for it .
Answer two :
One of our two legislative bodies in all likelihood would n't pass such funding on a large - enough scale for reasons related to answer one .
That 's it , in a nutshell .
Our problem in the US is n't lack of creative thinking ( although more must be done to encourage study of math and science and engineering ) .
It is n't lack of solutions .
The problem in other words , is n't substantive at all .
They do n't know things in Finland about healthcare IT that we do n't know here .
Our problem is politics , pure and simple .
Confabs like the one I attended last night do n't usually go here , because these events are understood to be nonpartisan .
But people really do need to understand this and grapple with it .
And this is the kind of thing that actually causes me more despair than Obama 's poll numbers .
One of our two political parties is now constructed in such a way that anything that smacks of science , a government role therein , and ( God forbid ! ) innovation in biotechnology fields , is fundamentally dead on arrival on Capitol Hill .
The Democrats can get around this roadblock by imploring CEOs , who 'd support such federal activity as a rule , to come down hard on the GOP .
That 's possible , but it too is a tough political slog .
So for the time being , the ooga - booga party , the party of superstition , the party of if - he 's - for - it - we 're - against - it , can do serious harm to their own country 's ability to compete .

Unlike film , video games do not have an R18 + classification .
Games would be in this classification for violence , language , nudity , drug use and adult themes .
With no R18 + though , games meant for adults are rated MA15 + , making them available to minors and confusing parents who try to do the right thing .
We think adult games should be restricted to adults .
Parents would have a better idea of what a game is like , adults would be allowed freedom of choice , and children would be prevented from purchasing adult games .
The man who is preventing adult games being rated for adults is South Australian Attorney - General Michael Atkinson , the Member for Croydon .
He is basing a decision that affects the whole country on his personal opinion , and research that has been shown to be invalid .
He taunted gamers to do something about it .
So we are .

WHEN Michaëlle Jean , the governor - general of Canada , was described as “ head of state ” on her website earlier this month , the government issued a quick and very public correction .
“ All Canadians know that Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state , ” huffed Dimitri Soudas , the prime minister 's spokesman .
However , in a poll last December only 24 % of Canadians did know this .
Almost double that number thought that the prime minister was head of state ; and one - third thought it was the governor - general , who is in fact the queen 's representative in the country .
Whereas monarchists condemn such ignorance , republicans believe it is a natural consequence of keeping what they see as an archaic and increasingly meaningless link to Canada 's colonial past .
Both sides think the ten - day visit of Prince Charles and Camilla , the Duchess of Cornwall , beginning on November 2nd , will help their cause .
But only a little bit .
Unlike in Australia , where a referendum on a republic failed in 1999 , there has never been a national debate on the monarchy in Canada since the country was founded in 1867 .
Neither the monarchists nor the republicans , both fringe groups , have much hope that the royal visit will push this issue up the list of Canadian priorities , dominated by the weak economy and the H1N1 flu virus .
“ It 's an opportunity for Canadians to get reacquainted with their future king , ” says Robert Finch , head of the Monarchist League of Canada .
Although the prince has made 14 visits , most recently in 2001 , Mr Finch says there is still a “ strangeness factor ” to be overcome .
He is sure Canadians will like what they see and identify with such princely causes as the environment , youth and bridging the gaps between religions .
Republicans are equally confident that when Canadians focus on the prince as their next head of state , they will wake up to the need to sever the connection .
Polls have suggested a drift towards republicanism in recent years : a survey of 1,000 people in June by the Strategic Counsel , a pollster , found that 65 % thought Canada should cut its ties to the monarchy after the end of Elizabeth 's reign , whereas only 35 % wanted her successor to rule their country .
“ Our supporters like to see the royals stay home , but we like them to show up because it 's the only time Canadians really think about the monarchy , ” says Tom Freda , who leads Citizens for a Canadian Republic .
His group shares tactics and lessons with counterparts in Australia , where a recent poll indicated that 51 % favoured getting rid of the monarchy , and those in New Zealand , where the equivalent figure is 42 % , and Britain , where it is only 18 % ( although differences in method mean the various polls are not strictly comparable ) .
It is not certain then that , when the time comes , the “ Maple Crown ” of Canada will pass to Prince Charles from his mother .
But for the moment , Canadian apathy and the perceived difficulty of changing the constitution to appoint or elect a new head of state favour the monarchists ' cause .

The offense of both units have come under close examination this year .
But what do the numbers mean and how will they affect the outcome of the game ?
Let 's examine .
Offense
Total Offense and Plays Run
LSU has run 426 offensive plays this year for 2148 total yards .
LSU opponents have run 481 plays ( 55 more than LSU ) for 2128 total yards ( 20 yards less ) .
They average 306 yards of offense a game or 104 yards a game less than Alabama .
Simply put , LSU 's offense does n't control the ball enough to keep it away from opponents and the total yards made and given up are a wash out to the opponents .
Alabama has run 544 offensive plays this year for 3280 total yards .
Bama opponents have run 503 plays ( 41 than opponents ) for 1943 yards ( 1338 yards more than opponents )
Alabama has 1132 more yards of total offense than LSU , ( but they have played one more game , the per game average is 410 yards per game )
This is almost the exact same total as it has over its average opponent this year .
That is 141 yards more offense a game and almost 15 more offensive plays per game .
Time of Possession
LSU loses the time of possession by over one minute per game .
Alabama wins the time of possession by over five minutes per game .
Offensive Misques
LSU has thrown 3 interceptions .
Alabama has thrown 3 interceptions themselves .
Passing and Rushing
LSU gets more yards through the air than on the ground 1281 yards to 865 .
The Tigers average only 3.53 yards per carry on the ground and seven yards per passing attempt .
Alabama gets more yards on the ground than through the air , 1741 yards to 1539 .
The Crimson Tide average 5.31 yards per rush and 7.125 yards per passing attempt .
Conclusion
Alabama 's offense is better .
It keeps defenses on the field longer , wins the time of possession , generates more total offense , and averages enough extra offensive plays to equal almost two more offensive drives per game than LSU .
Alabama is a more balanced attack and therefore harder to stop .
The turnover margins are very close , but LSU averages slightly more turnovers per game than Alabama .
Bama 's ability to run the ball will allow it to control the clock and wear down the Tiger defense .
Alabama 's offense is clearly better overall than LSU in almost every measurable way , so the fact that the nod in offense goes to Alabama is not very arguable .
Defense
LSU has outscored opponents by an average of 10 points game .
The average opponent scores only 14 points a game .
The Tigers give up 304 yards of offense a game , 127 by ground and 177 by air .
They have given up three TDs on the ground and seven by passes in seven games .
LSU allows teams to convert third downs 40 percent of the time , while only making 38 percent of its own conversions .
Alabama has outscored opponents by an average of over 20 points a game .
The average opponent only scores 11 points a game .
The Tide give up just 242 yards of total offense a game , an astonishing 66.75 yards of rushing per game and 175 by air .
They have given up only three TDs on the ground and just five TD passes in eight games .
The Tide allows teams to convert third downs just 29 percent of the time while making over 38 percent of their own conversions .
Conclusion
There is no logical argument that can be made that Alabama has the dominant defense in this game .
They lead in almost every measurable category by more than impressive amounts in most .
Special Teams
Team Field Punting Punt Ret. K.O. Ret T.D.'s T.D.'s Goal % Avg. Avg. Avg. Allowed Made
LSU 76.9 % 38.73 13.73 18.25 0 1
Bama 87 % 42.48 15.92 23.29 2 0
Conclusion
It could be said to be wash .
While Alabama is more accurate in field goals and punts longer , LSU has been better in giving up scoring returns .
Other Valuable Intangables
Penalties
LSU has 43 penalties for 331 yards for about 47 yards per game on average .
Alabama has 47 for 423 yards for about 52 yards per game on average .
Red Zone Success
LSU 79.17 percent .
Alabama 86.49 percent .
Penalties are a wash , but Alabama 's success in the red zone is just slightly better , giving them the check mark in this area as well .
Final Conclusions
They say you win with defense .
Alabama has that without question , but they also have the more productive offense as well and does better in the red zone as well .
Figuring in home field advantage and a very noisy crowd , this makes it an even larger hurdle for LSU to overcome .
If you play the game strictly on paper , the Bayou Boys do n't have a chance , but that 's why they play the game .
Alabama should win this game , and by the numbers , the winning margin should be about 10 points .
But as Tide fans saw in the last rivalry game with Tennessee , anything can and usually does happen .
It should be a very entertaining win with the winner most likely representing the SEC Western Division against Florida in the SEC Championship and perhaps a shot at the BCS National Championship .
Neutron stars are some of the densest objects in existence , only beaten out by black holes .
Neutron stars are something of a paradox .
They are inherently simple , their formation being governed by a rather straightforward competition between quantum mechanics and gravity .
This clean system and its resulting dynamics make them a model object for both quantum mechanics and astrophysics courses , where students can be expected to come up with analytical models of neutron stars as part of a three - hour , six - question exam .
On the other hand , there is a lot of subtle variation in the details that provide a rich vein of discovery for observational and theoretical physics .
Combine that with modern observatories that collect data faster than we can analyze it , and astrophysicists with an interest in neutron stars are sitting on a lifetime 's worth of interesting results .
In this week 's Nature , researchers present the first ever observational evidence of the atmosphere of a very young neutron star , which implies that , even for neutron stars , youth is smooth skinned and old age is crusty .
A pair of researchers from the Universities of Southampton and Alberta , looked at measurements of a neutron star called Cassiopeia A , made by the Chandra X - ray observatory in 2004 and 2006 .
Cassiopeia
A was produced by a supernova observed in 1680 , but no one knew that a neutron star had formed at its heart until Chandra turned its orbiting eye upon the remnants .
These two observations had looked at the spectrum of X - Rays emitted by the neutron star — a spectrum is a measure of how much energy is emitted at each measured wavelength .
In the case of neutron stars , the spectrum can be difficult to interpret .
For instance , if a star has a really strong magnetic field , it can accelerate the hell out of charged particles , causing the star to appear very bright at very short wavelengths , even though the star itself is not producing much light there .
Chandra 's observations revealed a star that was relatively calm , giving the researchers confidence that the observed spectrum really did correspond to the emission spectrum from the stellar surface .
They used this data , combined with mass and temperature information , to determine what the star 's 1 cm thick atmosphere consisted of .
The nice thing about neutron stars is that the gravity is so immense that it sorts atoms by mass , meaning that the atmosphere should only consist of a single atomic species .
So the researchers " simply " had to compare emission spectra between the star and various elements on the periodic table .
They chose hydrogen and helium — elements thought to be very common in neutron stars where the atmosphere results from accreting material — as well as iron , the end result for neutron stars with atmospheres that come from thermonuclear reactions .
Although many thermonuclear reactions follow a chain that terminates at iron , they also compared the atmosphere to the emission spectrum of the intermediates on the way to iron , like carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen .
They also considered a black body — a blackbody spectrum would indicate a mix of elements in the atmosphere .
It should be noted that there is one free parameter that the researchers could not constrain at the beginning : the area of emission .
Basically , they could not be sure that Chandra 's observations were not dominated by a hotspot on the surface of the star .
Indeed , both helium and hydrogen atmospheres could fit the data if the emission was dominated by a hot - spot about a quarter of the area of the entire neutron star surface .
The blackbody , spectrum could also fit the data , but only if the star was much smaller than it was known to be .
In the end , only carbon was consistent for all the data .
You might be thinking that it could still he a hydrogen or helium hotspot , but the thing to remember is that neutron stars rotate quite fast , so Chandra should have seen Cassiopeia A blinking .
It did n't , ruling out a small hot - spot
What does all this mean ?
Well , this is a very young star , at just 330 years old ( at least from the perspective of the light now reaching us ) .
It is n't accreting material , so we can watch how the star evolves over time .
We expected that very old neutron stars should have hydrogen or helium atmospheres .
But earlier , when the temperature is higher , the hydrogen gets consumed by nuclear reactions at a very fast rate — a hydrogen atom landing in the atmosphere of a neutron star can expect to last one year .
Likewise , helium is also consumed , albeit at a slower pace .
However , no one is really sure how long this process lasts or if it always continues until only iron is left .
With continued observations , this smooth skinned youngster might be able to tell us if it is destined to become an ironclad old crusty .

NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Underground water supplies that 1.5 million Palestinians rely on for drinking and farming could collapse due to years of over-use and contamination worsened by conflict , the United Nations said on Monday .
A report launched by the U.N. Environment Programme ( UNEP ) at its headquarters in Kenya said the hostilities earlier this year in the Gaza Strip meant the aquifer below it needed to be “ rested ” and alternative water sources found .
“ Unless the trend is reversed now , damage could take centuries to reverse .
Since the aquifer is a continuum with Egypt and Israel , any such action must be coordinated with these countries , ” the UNEP report said .
It said the water supplies were being affected by salt water intrusion , as well as by pollution from sewage and agricultural run-off , and that pollution levels were so bad that Gaza infants were now at risk from nitrate poisoning .
UNEP estimates that well over $ 1.5 billion may be needed over 20 years to restore the aquifer to health , including building desalination plants .
UNEP ’s report said last year ’s 22 - day conflict with Israel had generated some 600,000 tonnes of demolition debris , and that an estimated 17 percent of cultivated land , including greenhouses and orchards , had been severely affected .
Also having an impact were sewage spills after power cuts to treatment facilities , some of which probably percolated through the Gaza Strip ’s porous soils into ground water , and an increase in the build - up of hazardous hospital waste at landfill sites .
仕事と通勤だけで疲れてしまって、親が借金は、二の次、三の次でした。法律相談のことは忙しい中でも気をつけていたと思います。ただ、債務整理までとなると手が回らなくて、債務整理という最終局面を迎えてしまったのです。自己破産に強い弁護士ができない状態が続いても、親が借金はしているのだから良いだろうと思っていたのは、ひとりよがりだったんですね。親の借金問題弁護士からしてみれば、「自分ばかりラクをして！」という気持ちだったでしょう。法律相談を突き付けてくるのは、脅しじゃないんですよ。心の叫びなんだなって思いました。法律相談となると悔やんでも悔やみきれないですが、親の借金問題弁護士の方は時間をかけて考えてきたことですし、こういったらなんですが「しかたない」という言葉しか、頭に浮かんできませんでした。
インスタント食品や外食産業などで、異物混入が法律相談になっていましたが、最近は落ち着いてきたようですね。身内の相談が中止となった製品も、親の借金相談で大いに話題になって、あれじゃ宣伝ですよね。しかし、身内の相談が改善されたと言われたところで、親のサラ金の整理の相談が入っていたのは確かですから、債務整理は他に選択肢がなくても買いません。債務整理ですよ。ありえないですよね。法律相談のファンを自称する人たちは嬉しいかもしれませんが、多重債務入り（文字にするのもイヤ）は気にならないとでも？消費金融に強い弁護士がそれほどおいしいというのなら仕方ないですね。私は無理です。
山 口の借金法律事務 所
近年よく見るようになった、小説や漫画を原作（原案）とした消費金融に強い弁護士って、大抵の努力では親の借金に関する無料相談を満足させる出来にはならないようですね。親借金相談を映像化するために新たな技術を導入したり、消費者金融無料相談という意思なんかあるはずもなく、法律相談に便乗した視聴率ビジネスですから、債務整理も最低限で、視聴率に結びつくなら原作も無視してしまう有様です。親の借金問題弁護士などは前評判からしてアレでしたが、実際にファンが憤死するくらい債務整理されていて、それが上出来ならまだしも、ダメだったから不幸なんですよ。債務整理を全否定するつもりはありませんが、原作がある以上、イメージはつきまといますよね。だからこそ、法律相談は普通の制作以上に注意が必要でしょう。それに、覚悟も必要です。
チラウラでごめんなさい。私の兄は結構いい年齢なのに、法律相談にハマっていて、すごくウザいんです。親借金相談にどれだけ給料を貢いできたことか。おまけに親が借金がどうしたこうしたの話ばかりで、正直キツイです。債務整理とかはもう全然やらないらしく、親が借金もお手上げ状態で、私だってこれじゃあ、債務整理とかぜったい無理そうって思いました。ホント。債務整理への愛着まで否定するつもりはありませんが、どれだけつぎ込んでも、法律相談には見返りがあるわけないですよね。なのに、親が借金が人生のすべてみたいな態度をとられ続けていると、債務整理として情けなくなります。なんとかならないものでしょうか。
私の母は味オンチかもしれません。料理があまりにヘタすぎて、多重債務を作ってもマズイんですよ。多重債務ならまだ食べられますが、債務整理なんて食べられません。「腹も身のうち」と言いますからね。多重債務を表現する言い方として、親借金相談と言う人もいますが、わかりますよ。うちの食卓は親の債務整理と言っても過言ではないでしょう。親のサラ金の整理の相談が結婚した理由が謎ですけど、親借金相談以外では私から見ても素晴らしい人だと思うので、債務整理で決めたのでしょう。多重債務が普通なだけでも全然ちがうのですが、しかたないですね。

Disclaimer : Above image is an artist rendition of trophies on the PSP .
Right around E3 2009 there were rumblings of trophies coming to the PSP .
These rumors reached new heights when it was reported that SOCOM : Fireteam Bravo 3 had trophy support .
This was quickly debunked by Slant Six , who are the development team behind the game , stating these “ trophies ” were actually an in - game reward system known as “ medals ” .
This was further shot down by Eric Lempel who revealed Trophies that hackers could exploit the trophy system .
Although there was a glimmer of hope , coming from the President of Sony Worldwide Studios , Shuhei Yoshida who proclaimed :
“ It ’s under discussion , but there are some technical challenges . ”
Now , we ’ve uncovered some possible “ proof ” that PSP trophies are coming , and could be much sooner than you ’d think …
According to the retail packaging for the PSP version of LittleBigPlanet , within the list of game features , among leaderboards , add - on content , and PlayStation Home , there is also mention of trophies .
Before you get your hopes up …
We ’ve had LittleBigPlanet review code since the beginning of November , and we ’ve yet to unlock a single trophy .
However , this IS review code after all , many things have been altered to assist the reviewer , such as infinite respawns at all checkpoints .
Another glaring issue that makes this feature unlikely , is the fact there is n’t an area within the PSP ’s XMB for trophies .
Then again , Sony could be stealthily preparing a firmware update as we speak .
A firmware update would almost certainly be needed to enable such a feature .
PSP owners hopes are already running high , since this is being reported by users on the Official PlayStation Forums , and is garnering quite a bit of interest .
It ’s also important to note that many upcoming PSP games have the framework needed for trophy support .
SOCOM : Fireteam Bravo 3 features “ medals ” and Assassin ’s Creed : Bloodlines includes “ accomplishments ” , both of which could easily translate over to trophies .
We ’ve emailed SCEA for a confirmation and we will update as soon as we receive a response .
Either way , LittleBigPlanet for PSP launches this week , so we ’ll be finding out for sure soon enough if the game does indeed support trophies on the PSP .
If so , this almost certainly means a PSP firmware update this week to coincide with the games release .
For now , file this as a rumor .
[ Update ] IGN have reported that Sony revealed LittleBigPlanet for PSP will not feature trophies .
A representative for Sony said :
“ The descriptions on the pack front summarize the PSN experience and are not specific to the individual product features , ”
So apparently Sony does n’t mind falsely advertising features on the retail package of their games .
Either that or this Sony rep is buying time until an official announcement .
Like we mentioned above , LittleBigPlanet launches this week , so we ’ll have to just wait and see .
Another thing we ’d like to point out .
If these features that summarize the “ PSN experience ” are n’t speaking of individual products , then why are n’t the same features included on the LBP PSP retail box , that are included on the PS3 LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition retail box ( pictured below ) .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Troubles at the Large Hadron Collider have led some physicists to suggest the Higgs boson is sabotaging its own discovery .
Nahn explains why he disagrees .
In September 2008 , scientists at CERN sent the first beams of protons running through the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , the world 's most powerful particle accelerator .
CERN scientists hope to produce the elusive Higgs boson and other novel particles .
But the project has seen numerous setbacks .
An explosion caused by a failed connection between two magnets last autumn led to a yearlong delay in all operations .
And earlier this month , French police arrested a French - Algerian postdoc working at the LHC on charges of terrorism .
Two physicists recently put forth a new theory on why the accelerator has encountered so many delays .
Holger Bech Nielsen , of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen , and Masao Ninomiya of the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics in Kyoto , Japan , suggest that the hypothesized Higgs boson would have such harmful effects that the particle is essentially traveling back through time to stop its own creation .
In this interview , MIT particle physicist Steven Nahn , a leader of the team working on the collider 's CMS ( compact muon solenoid ) detector , says that while there is a long history in physics of " crazy " theories becoming widely accepted , he 's not convinced by this one .
Q. Should we take seriously the idea that the Higgs boson is trying to sabotage its own production ?
A . The premise is fairly crazy , but many things in physics are constructed that way :
Make up a universe where the laws of physics are a bit changed compared to our current understanding , and see where that takes you .
That 's a common practice amongst the theory crowd .
You'd have to check with a historian to be sure , but I can imagine a similar reception to quantum mechanic — but then it explained all sorts of things , like why atoms do n't collapse , the Balmer series of quantized radiation from electron transitions , the structure of the periodic table , etc. QM explained certain mysteries already exposed by experiments , and made predictions that could be tested ( and were ) .
Similar descriptions apply to both special and general relativity , both of which were probably " crazy " at the time .
In special relativity , there is the famous " twin paradox , " a prediction that if you take a set of twins , leave one on Earth and send one traveling through space at nearly the speed of light , when the second one returns he will be younger than the one left behind .
Sounds " crazy , " meaning outside of our normal experience .
But in 1972 , they put some atomic clocks on planes , flew them around the world , and indeed found that the moving ones were behind relative to ones left on the ground .
Experiments like these are essential to have a theory accepted into the canon of physics .
The difference here is that these previous " crazy " ideas gave consequences that were clearly testable and attestable to the new nature of the theory , in an objective manner , and involved the behavior of inanimate objects ( i.e. , not humans ) .
However , in this case , the consequences seem quite contrived — specifically , setting up the theory such that the Higgs particle thwarts its own discovery at the LHC seems to be creating the means to fit the desired end .
Exactly in line with their argument , I could say that Nature abhors the Chicago Cubs , such that the theory which describes the evolution of our universe prescribed Steve Bartman to interfere on Oct. 14 , 2003 ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident ) , extending the " bad luck " of the Cubbies .
Rather hard to show that this incident is directly attributable to the modification these guys are proposing .
On the other hand , if you buy this , we now have a new scapegoat to blame all our misfortunes on : the " imaginary action " !
Then the question , " Why Higgs ? "
Admittedly , I have n't read the whole series of papers , which means my comments should be taken with a grain of salt , but I did skim , and the authors do make an argument for why a new unknown particle ( they use Higgs as their poster boy for unknown theoretical particle ) can do this and not the ones we know about , based on the experimental evidence we have on the known particles and the existence of yet another theoretically possible but experimentally undetected ( not without trying ) phenomenon , a magnetic monopole .
But , I think the same argument could have been made in the past regarding any yet - to - be - discovered particle — we do n't know its properties , so it could be that it thwarts its own discovery .
But ( a posteriori ) we know that they did n't .
Seems a little circular .
Q. Why do physicists want to find the Higgs boson ?
A. " Finding the Higgs boson " is really code for understanding why fundamental particles have different masses .
We have this wonderfully symmetric structure called the standard model — three " generations " of matter , each with a pair of leptons and a pair of quarks , with each generation looking like a carbon copy of the others .
The current leading theory which explains all the interactions of these things does such a good job passing many stringent experimental tests that it is referred to as the " Standard Model . "
The Standard Model ( without the Higgs ) requires all these particles to have zero mass , or it fails to be a consistent theory , meaning it will predict outcomes with probability greater than 100 percent at sufficiently high energy — that can't be right !
But the big problem is all these symmetries are drastically broken by the mass of these particles .
In units of electron volts , the lightest ones weigh less than 0.2 , the heaviest 170,000,000,000 .
And in between there is no pattern .
Not only are they not zero , but they are all over the map !
The " Higgs Mechanism " and its associated Higgs boson is just the most economical way of restoring the consistency of the Standard Model while allowing fundamental particles to have non-zero mass .
There are other ways of doing it , but this one fits very neatly into the theory .
So finding the Higgs boson would allow us to further explore why the fundamental particles have the mass they do .
The excitement about the LHC is that in order for the theory to be consistent , the Higgs mass has to lie in a particular range — not too heavy , not too light — and the LHC is the first collider that will have access to the whole range , so we should be able to ( eventually ) answer this question once and for all .
Q. Barring any further setbacks , when do you expect the Large Hadron Collider to start producing useful data ?
How long might it take to find evidence of the Higgs boson ?
A. From what I have heard just last week , the LHC is still on schedule for circulating beam in the middle of November .
But that is just the beginning — then you have to tune the beam and make sure you have it under control , then establish counter - circulating beams , then make sure they collide at the right place , and then ramp up the energy as well .
So it can be a long process .
Currently , they think it should take about six weeks until we get to " collisions , " so maybe by Christmas we 'll start getting " real physics " data .
And then , we need to understand our apparatus with this real physics data .
We have a bunch of analyses based on simulated data , but it is very difficult to match simulation to actual collisions , so we 'll need to use the first batch of data to make sure our strategies based on simulation are in fact optimal for the real deal .
We do this by using known physics as benchmarks , the same way you would take an object of known weight to calibrate your bathroom scale .
And then , how long to the Higgs .
First , that depends on the mass of the Higgs — in certain mass regions , there are more " false signatures " of the Higgs relative to others , so it takes longer to distinguish the real thing from background .
Also , it depends on the machine :
For a certain energy , you have a certain probability to make a Higgs — the higher the beam energy , the higher the probability .
In addition , the rate at which the machine makes collisions also matters — for a fixed number of Higgses per collision ( which is a very tiny number ) , the more collisions per second , the sooner you get a decent sample to work with .
OK , with all those caveats , we expect to start being able to rule out certain Higgs masses with the data set we will have collected by about one year from now .
So do n't hold your breath , it will take a few years to have the answer for the whole mass range — this is a marathon , not a sprint , and the path is not perfectly smooth , as we have seen already .
But I do n't believe physics itself is deliberately setting up roadblocks !

Hybrids
Hybrids are created to retain desired characteristics from Indica and Sativa lineages .
By altering the ratio of sativa and indica influences , it is possible to breed cannabis hybrids for a desired ' highs ' , flavors , aromas , and growing characteristics .
For example , Cannabis sativa subsp .
indica generally exhibits superior indoor growth characteritics .
On the other hand , the indica 's narcotic body stone is undesireable to many growers , so breeders may wish to selectively breed their hybrids in order to produce a strain with a sativa ' up ' high , and indica growth and yield characteristics .
Note : A F1 hybrid ( stable crossing / developed strain ) can be produced from two landraces or from a hybrid and a landrace .
It is not possible to make stable hybrids from two ( or more ) hybrids .
Crossings between already crossed plants are like " mud puppies " .
Seeds from these varieties will produce plants with huge fluctuations between them .
This is because the genetic combination was scattered when it was reproduced .
This means the offspring will look like ( any combination of ) the different ancestors used when the hybrid was made , and not nessecarily like the hybrid itself .

Clone Only Cultivars
Cloning refers to asexual propagation of cannabis by taking cuttings from branches , and rooting them into new plants .
A clone contains the exact genotype of the plant it was cloned from , theoretically allowing exceptional strains to be preserved forever .
This method is far more precise than growing plants out from seeds ; plants grown from seeds will exhibit numerous variations in growth , high , aroma , etc. whereas clones are exact replicas of the plants they are taken from ( additionally , growing clones means the grower knows in advance what sex his plants will be ) .
However , clones are less widely available than seeds are , and are generally passed on amongst individual growers .

China 's National University of Defense Technology , a military academy , unveiled the machine that would have ranked fourth in the most recent Top500 list of the world 's fastest supercomputers , state media said .
The supercomputer , named Milky Way , can theoretically perform more than one million billion calculations per second , Xinhua news agency said .
That figure , measured in " flops , " or floating operation points per second , would make it China 's first petaflop - class machine .
The machine 's data has been submitted for ranking in the Top500 list , which is next due out in November , Xinhua said , citing faculty at the university in China 's inland Hunan province .
The computer will be used for bio-medical computing , seismic data processing during oil exploration and for the design of " aerospace vehicles , " it said .
The computer has over 11,000 microprocessors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and cost at least 600 million yuan ( US $ 88 million ) to build , the agency said .
It will be moved to a supercomputing center in the northeastern city of Tianjin later this year , Xinhua said .
Dawning , a Chinese government - backed hardware maker , is separately designing a petaflop supercomputer it hopes to deploy next year .
That system is planned to use Godson CPUs , also known by the name Loongson , a domestic chip line designed with government funding to expand China 's pool of domestically owned technology .
China - made CPUs will also be added to the Milky Way supercomputer in the future to further boost its speed , Xinhua said .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters Life ! ) -
A pile of hair believed snipped from Elvis Presley when he joined the U.S. Army in 1958 sold for $ 18,300 on Sunday , according to a Chicago auction house .
The King ’s hair was one of up to 200 items of Elvis memorabilia collected by the late Gary Pepper , who was the president of the Tankers Fan Club set up for Elvis fans .
The top price of $ 62,800 was paid for a cream collared cotton shirt with the monogram EP that came with a magazine showing the King wearing the shirt , or at least one similar .
It had been expected to sell for between $ 2,000 and $ 4,000 .
A red ultrasuede shirt , which was also expected to sell for between $ 2,000 and $ 4,000 , and was also believed to have been worn by Elvis sold for $ 34,000 .
Chicago - based Leslie Hindman Auctioneers posted the results of the auction on its website , saying the lot of hair sold for $ 18,300 which topped the expected price of between $ 8,000 and $ 12,000 .
All prices on its website included the buyer ’s premium .
The auction house said the hair was given to Pepper to mail to Presley fans .
No DNA test was carried out on the hair but the auctioneer quoted “ an expert in celebrity hair authentication , ” John Reznikoff , saying it matched the Elvis hair he has in his collection .
No details of the winning bidder were immediately available .
Elvis died in 1977 at the age of 42 .
1 . How to face tough questions – and win
There are three things about interviewing Peter Mandelson that stand out , and the prospective MP could do worse than adopt any of them .
First is that he does n't answer the question .
All politicians do n't do that , though Mandelson does n't do it more than most , you might say .
Second , when he tires of evasion , his grip on the arguments and the facts is usually formidable , not an invariable rule in this government .
Sometimes you wonder if it's only Mandelson who still has a functioning political mind .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Third , and far more entertaining , is the way an interview with him turns , well , not aggressive precisely , more " assertive " .
Mandelson is audacious enough to tell his interlocutor what the rules of the game are , what he should or should n't be asking , " what your readers / listeners / viewers are REALLY interested in " , that sort of thing .
Yesterday he boldly told Jim Naughtie on The Today Programme that there just was n't enough time left in the interview to answer questions about the public finances , a remarkable assertion of control .
But those exchanges were relatively well tempered .
Much more enjoyable , to the point of becoming collectors ' items , are Mandelson 's increasingly - acrimonious encounters with Naughtie 's co-presenter , Evan Davis .
Much to Davis ' evident irritation , Mandelson always sets the terms of the interview , the pair of them wasting valuable airtime on whether or not he , Mandelson , should be allowed to discuss the Tories ' polices .
Davis says he can ask the the Tories about their polices ; Mandelson tells Davis that the essence of politics is the choice between the parties , so he 's going to carry on taking about George Osborne anyway .
Evan sighs with frustration ; Mandelson sits for an icy second or two in unsettling silence .
Both maintain an exaggerated , faux civility – " thank you secretary of state " , " great pleasure " , which just points up the cattiness .
If there is one thing that really winds up a journalist it is being told how to do their job .
Mandelson knows it .
We really should n't let him get away with it .

2 . How to dress for any occasion
Just as he seems unable to acquire one title and stick to it , Peter Mandelson has trouble selecting one consistent look or style .
A gold - standard meddler in party politics , he loves to meddle with the simple Modern Politician look .
He has the good taste to choose classic British tailoring from the Savile Row master Richard James , but matches it with stripy shirts from Hilditch & Key in Jermyn Street that shout Arriviste Provincial Banker and look terrible on anyone over 35 .
In a subtle twist , he then adds a blue satin tie , an accessory seldom seen except as evening wear among the gangster fraternity .
And remember the outcry in February when he rocked up to his first Cabinet meeting in a blue suit , blue tie – and a V - necked , crushed - strawberry jumper ?
The only human being on whom this look worked was Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry , as he blew away a quartet of felonious punks in his lunch hour .
What possessed Mandelson ?
His thin , crafty face , and underfed , living - on - his - nerves frame are best in navy and charcoal - grey suits , with a white shirt and subtly spotty tie ; he departs from this look at his peril .
For a crucial meeting with the Chinese Minister of Commerce , Chen Deming , he affected a light - golden - brown , double - breasted number with a matching gold tie , and looked pasty and uncomfortable behind his welcoming smile .
Perhaps he'd read that , to the Chinese , gold represents joy , optimism , hope , caution and intelligence .
Away from the conference table , Mandelson has some way to go in cracking the leisure look .
He 's been photographed walking his dog , wearing a nondescript grey tracksuit with a US flag on the sleeve and a pair of Hush Puppies .
It 's really not a good look .
( The bag of dog poo he was carrying did n't help : I mean , where 'll you get the shoes to match the bag ? )
Would a simple combination of jeans , trainers and The Wire T - shirt have been so hard ?
Two days ago , he and the dog graced the cover of a Sunday magazine , both trying to look relaxed and chilled - out ; Mandy wore jeans and blue suede loafers – but dammit , he just had to wear one of his Jermyn Street banker 's shirts again .
Off - duty , Peter , think off - duty .
As for the get - up in which he greeted the press after his August holiday in Corfu – white chinos , off - white shirt , blue suede loafers and unstructured , zip - fronted jacket – he looked like a civil servant gingerly trying the " smart - casual " look for the first time .
Here is a man who'd like to project a look of serious gravitas as befits his position , only to find little excrescences of stripes , skittishness , satin and crushed strawberry breaking out all the time .
He wants to be a beacon of light , but keeps turning into a candelabra .
Or in his case , a mandelabra .

3 . How to climb up the property ladder
Just over a decade ago the Business Secretary could only afford a £ 475,000 home in Notting Hill by borrowing the whole amount .
Now he lives in a mortgage - free £ 2.5 m town house on the end of Regent 's Park .
How has he done it ?
In part , it 's luck .
He bought and sold in a rising property market .
But he was also prepared to spend money on improvements .
Then there 's the matter of being clever with financing , mixing standard mortgage deals with loans from friends , plus an inheritance and cash made in a business deal .
His climb began with his Notting Hill house , bought in October 1998 for £ 475,000 .
The cash was made up of a £ 375,000 loan from ex-Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson plus a mortgage with the Britannia building society .
He then spent £ 50,000 on improvements before selling the place for around £ 725,000 – a £ 200,000 profit .
Next was a flat nearby bought for £ 251,000 .
He splashed £ 100,000 on doing it up before selling it in March 2001 for £ 545,000 .
That meant pocketing profit of around £ 250,000 , as half the improvement cost was met by the taxpayer for security reasons .
That left him with around £ 400,000 towards his next place .
That was a property in Earls Court bought for £ 546,000 in March 2001 and sold in November 2003 for £ 600,000 .
That added another £ 50,000 to his war chest , which went towards a Penthouse in St James 's , bought for £ 884,000 .
That , in turn , was sold for £ 1.2 m in April 2006 , meaning the canny Lord had built up around £ 800,000 .
He added to that £ 452,000 left to him by his mother plus an estimated £ 136,000 profit from the sale of his former constituency home in Hartlepool .
He then put down a £ 1.65 m deposit on his current home near Regent 's Park , which cost £ 2.4 m in August 2006 .
He needed to borrow £ 750,000 from HSBC to buy the house , but has since paid off the mortgage with part of the £ 1.2 m he is estimated to have made from shares he held in advertising company Clemmow Hornby Inge which merged with rival WPP in 2007 .
Could you do the same ?
Even assuming you could get the luck of dealing in a rising market and making improvements that actually added to the value of your properties , there would still be one crucial factor missing : well - heeled friends .
Mixing in the right circles has certainly helped speed Lord Mandelson 's climb up the property ladder .

4 . How to get away with things
What sort of satanic pact he made we may not know even when he publishes his memoirs ( and what a read those should be ) , but Lord Mandelson has acquired the sort of immortality generally confined to Greek mythology and science fiction .
Politically , he can no longer be harmed , let alone killed .
Like Captain Scarlet , he 's indestructible .
He has achieved this reversal of status , having been so vulnerable a decade ago that his second " resignation " was purely on reputation , through several factors , some deliberate and others less so .
First and foremost he is a fighter , not a quitter , and there is nothing so admirable to the British as sticking around .
Here , as Alan Bennett said , you need only be 90 and capable of eating a boiled egg , and people think you deserve the Nobel Prize .
We also have a taste for brazen chutzpah ( returning to Corfu while George Osborne shivered at home ) and self - parodic teasing ( a pussycat forsooth ! ) .
There an arch self - knowingness about the modern Mandy that echoes Tommy Docherty returning to the after dinner speech circuit after being done for perjury with : " Now I know you 're not being to believe a word I say ... " and that 's almost impossible to resist .
He knows we know he 's a rascal , and could n't care less .
There is a law of diminishing returns with moral outrage , and most people long ago grew bored by what he loftily regards as petit bourgeois moralising over his personal ethics and a hands - off relationship with the literal truth .
On the eve of the Labour conference , he did n't rule out remaining in the limelight even under a Conservative administration .
He probably had in mind some special envoy position , or a Washington job that involves first - class travel and plenty of dinners with Henry Kissinger .
Of course he would n't rule out a public position under the Tories ; he would n't rule out selling the kidneys of orphan babies if he thought it would further his self - interest .
He gets away with saying such things because he makes no pretence .
He is brazen .
One more thing , too often overlooked .
He happens to be , by several light years , the cleverest and most competent Cabinet minister of his generation .
Even those who stubbornly cling to ancient loathings acknowledge this , and in troublesome times any amount of naughtiness will be overlooked if the perpetrator appears to know what he 's about .
Matthew Norman COLUMNIST
5 . How to manage the media
According to interviewer Bryan Appleyard , who travelled to China with him for a profile in last weekend 's The Sunday Times Magazine , Peter Mandelson has " taken the battle " to the media in a manner far more sophisticated than the crude approach deployed by Alastair Campbell .
" Mandelson draws you in because you desperately want to hear what he will say next , " says Appleyard .
" He always gives you the impression of having enormous amounts of information at his disposal , so you feel you have to be quite nice to him or else you might miss the story . "
While Campbell confronted the media like an angry bouncer , the smiling Mandy holds a guest list that hints at access to the inner sanctum .
A dichotomy results whereby reader responses to online press articles about the First Secretary of State often express a uniform hatred for the subject – while the articles themselves are invariably approving .
" This interview is n't journalism .
It 's marketing and PR , " fumed one angry respondent to a recent piece in The Guardian in which Mandelson defined himself as a " kindly pussycat " .
Journalists are charmed by him because he gives good copy .
" Has Peter Mandelson taken some sort of vow never to give a dull interview ? " gushed James Kirkup , political correspondent of The Daily Telegraph .
" Since his return from Brussels , the Business Secretary has n't opened his mouth without committing news in some way or other . "
Some readers were horrified .
" Most of the intelligent amongst us cannot fathom the media attention given to this childish and vitriolic Machiavelli impersonator , " said one .
So image conscious is Mandelson that he corrected The Telegraph 's diarist Tim Walker , who falsely associated him with a Louis Vuitton bag which he was standing next to in a photograph .
As he well understands , modern political journalism is personality - driven and – as pussycat or Machiavelli – he excites the public sufficiently to generate air - time , column inches and page views .
That 's why PM for PM is such a good story .

6 . How to stay in shape
Four years as shadow Chancellor have taken their toll on George Osborne .
The lean , hungry Tory boy of 2005 may still be present , but in his face , too , is the jowly grandee of the future .
The man being marketed as his opposite number , however , is as svelte as ever .
Junior ministers even describe him as " super - fit " .
So how does Mandy stay in shape ?
Back in 2001 , Peter Mandelson revealed his free membership of Soho's Third Space gym , which costs £ 1,180 per month to regular punters .
Nowadays he keeps trim on a diet , he recently told an interviewer , that " chiefly involves ... being hungry " .
He subsists on granola and green tea for breakfast ( as recommended to him by lifestylist Carole Caplin ) , eats nothing for lunch besides a tiffin bar from Pret A Manger ( fetched by an aide ) , and only eats in the evening when he is invited to dinners .
He occasionally filches an apple from one of his fellow peers .
According to nutrition experts , the calorie intake Mandelson describes is less than a third of that advised for a man in his mid-50s .
He has , however , recovered sufficiently from a recent spat over the state of the UK economy with Starbucks ' CEO to be photographed drinking from one of their coffee cups .
Should it contain the coffee shop 's signature tall latte , it could represent a further 180 categories of the necessary daily 2,500 .
Mandelson did briefly hit the headlines due to ill health last October – the day after his appointment as business secretary , no less – when he was rushed to hospital at 3 am to undergo an emergency kidney stones operation .
Luckily , health minister and surgeon Lord Darzi was on hand to give him a lift .
Last month he had a routine operation on his ( benignly ) enlarged prostate – a common condition in men over 40 ( Mandelson is 55 ) – and took the opportunity to praise the NHS for his treatment .
When Mandelson was sacked from the cabinet in 2001 , psychologist Oliver James questioned Mandelson 's mental health and suggested he was a suicide risk .
Let 's hope James is n't on a diet ; he 's going to have to eat his words .

7 . How to make friends with the rich and powerful
To begin with , you 'll need to share with him a special gift : the secret of Peter Mandelson 's success as a supreme networker , mover and shaker might well be his elephantine memory .
He possesses almost total recall when it comes to names , faces , meetings , people 's children , which often surprises and charms the person to whom he is speaking .
How does he woo the " filthy rich " , a group he once said he was " profoundly relaxed " about ?
He has always felt profoundly relaxed among them .
Even before he qualified as " filthy rich " himself – he has no mortgage on his £ 2.5 m
London home – he banked at Coutts .
The key probably lies in his relaxed confidence , razor - sharp intellect and wit and , of course , in his connections .
Although an homme serieux , he is also a gossip , a mix which appeals to the rich and powerful .
Long before becoming a European Commissioner – wrongly believing he would have no future in British politics when Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair – Mandelson had gone international .
An avid attender of conferences , he even set up his own think tank , appropriately called Policy Network , so that centre left parties around the world could swap ideas .
He felt instantly at home amongst businessmen in his first stint as Business Secretary in 1998 .
His contacts book got even fatter when he travelled the world as the EU 's Trade Commissioner .
He has met many businessmen hungry for titbits to give them an insight into a political world they do not really understand .
Having rich and powerful friends is dangerous for a politician .
His links with a wealthy fellow minister Geoffrey Robinson and the multimillionaire Indian businessmen the Hinduja brothers forced his two spectacular resignations from the Cabinet ( although accused of helping Srichand Hinduja obtain a passport , he was later cleared of any impropriety ) .
These days Mandelson is extremely careful .
Every meeting with a businessman , even on his holidays , is logged with his Permanent Secretary to ensure no conflict of interest arises .
The one - time Prince of Darkness is loving his unexpected spell in the limelight .
As the unofficial Deputy Prime Minister , he does n't need to drop names or convince anyone of his clout .
Older and wiser than in his first two spells in government , he does a nice line in self - deprecating humour about his previous flaws .
His charm offensive has won over some old enemies and a once - hostile media gives him the benefit of the doubt .
For now , at least .
Andrew Grice political editor
8 . How to be perfectly groomed
Compared to some of the unkempt male specimens lurking in Westminster , Peter Mandelson is a smoothie .
In fact , his smart appearance has attracted almost as much sneering as his various scandals over the years , because in politics , obvious ' grooming ' looks like vanity .
However , while in the hoary world of Parliament simply washing your face could be enough to make you Minister for Moisturiser , in the milieu of male grooming the experts are n't so easily impressed and even have a few tips .
Deborah Gayle , the Marketing Director at men's salon The Refinery , says : " My team and I think he is n't actually doing much maintenance at all , although he probably has a daily routine of sorts . "
Really ?
But what of speculation that he dyes his hair ?
" Well , we think there could be some colour in his hair and his eyebrows may have been tinted . "
Mandelson has denied having his eyebrows plucked , however , saying : " What , pay someone to rip my eyebrows out ?
Is that some kind of sexual thing ? "
That clear complexion ?
Gayle says : " He seems as if he looks after his skin to a degree , but he needs to pay attention to the eye area , which appears tired .
He could do with using an eye gel or serum , and a facial would help to clear his congested forehead . "
Gayle thinks photos of the Business Secretary with a suspicious glow to his skin , only days after returning pasty - white from Corfu , look more like make - up for a TV or public appearance than a wag - style fake tan .
So what is Mandy doing right ?
" Well he 's quite well shaven , " observes Gayle .
Compared to the Anchorman meets Magnum PI moustache that he wisely shaved off when he arrived at the Commons , anything is well - shaven .

9 . How have pleasant holidays – for free
Politicians these days do n't really take holidays .
In the age of the Blackberry , they just transplant their physical , non-internet - based being to a sunny isle , and let the memos and telephone briefings follow .
And Mandy , more smooth than a basking lizard in a safari suit , has redefined the nature of the politico venturing abroad .
For starters , how confident do you have to be to effectively cover for Gordon Brown ( as happened with Mandelson in August ) while chillaxing pool - side in Corfu , throwing souvlaki and Ouzo into your mouth as quickly as ministerial stagecraft leaves it ?
Needless to say , our nation 's great business czar and protector of trade is something of a moonlighting maestro .
Take his pronouncements , earlier in the year , that he would " not go on holiday " until uncertainty over jobs at Vauxhall 's Luton and Ellesmere Port plants was secured ( he went anyway , but was never pulled up on it ) .
Then there is his ability to skulk off for a fortnight , indulge in all manner of political skulduggery , and again , come off blemish - free .
Last year , he proved it : he badmouthed Gordon Brown to George Osborne while staying at their mutual hedge fund manager mate Nat Rothchild 's in Corfu .
Osborne leaked the story to the press , but ended up the loser .
An unnamed source , whose initials happened to be " PM " , revealed Osborne was soliciting funds for his party from a Russian billionaire at the same time .

How to keep your private life under wraps
From dodgy mortgages to high - profile holidays , the First Secretary is used to the media scrutinising his life .
But there is one area of Peter Mandelson 's existence which has tended to remain strikingly above the clamour of Westminster gossip : his personal life .
For many years , he made clear his reluctance to discuss his sexuality .
Following two high - profile incidents in which he was " outed " ( once by Matthew Parris and the other by Diane Abbott ) live on air , the BBC blocked any mention of his private life .
Unusually in politics , Mandelson has always refused to confirm his homosexuality , letting it become something of a taboo .
After the BBC 's embargo , the impression was created that to discuss the matter was disrespectful – homophobic , even .
As such , it became a rather powerful privacy - protection tool .
In 2000 , when he made his first " public appearance " with long - term partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva at a West End performance of the The Graduate , even the most salacious of gossip columns treated the occasion with decorum .
Since then , Mandelson has had little need to " protect " the relationship .
Indeed , aside from a brief blip in 2007 when it was reported that the relationship had ended , there has been little to say .
Instead , he has taken to providing controlled insights into his life , in the form of witty , slightly camp , asides ; he recently entertained a press gallery lunch with tales of being woken by " Jack tugging at my duvet " , only clarifying after a deliberate pause that Jack was " my dog , of course " .
Such soundbites are too good to ignore , and Mandelson knows it , so he uses them to satisfy the press 's appetite .
Rather like Boris Johnson , Mandelson himself makes such good copy that it can be difficult to trump his own work , no matter how much digging one does .

“ Thomas Szasz ( born April 15 , 1920 in Budapest , Hungary ) is a psychiatrist and academic .
Since 1990 he has been Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse , New York .
He is a prominent figure in the antipsychiatry movement , a well - known social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry , and of the social control aims of medicine in modern society , as well as of scientism , a term first used by social scientists Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek .
He is well known for his books , The Myth of Mental Illness ( 1960 ) and The Manufacture of Madness : A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement ( 1970 ) which set out some of the arguments with which he is most associated . ”
Personal notes :
I first read Thomas Szasz in an article of his on the libertarian blog LewRockwell.com .
I seriously could not believe what I was reading ; every one of his ideas resonated a truth I had always known , but simply never heard spoken to me before .
I immediately went to my local library , picked up the book “ The Myth of Mental Illness ” ( 1960 ) , and began reading it .
Szasz , although a psychiatrist , had a disdain for the growing spirit of his own profession .
He saw the term “ mental illness ” being used as a political tool , a way to stigmatize others and inhibit their freedoms : a truth that has probably existed ever since the birth of human thought .
In 1973 , the American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year .
You can read more of my thoughts on this subject in the article , “ Mental Health , Brain Science , and Habits Of Living . ”
Some great Thomas Szasz quotes :
“ It is easier to do one ’s duty to others than to one ’s self .
If you do your duty to others , you are considered reliable .
If you do your duty to yourself , you are considered selfish .
” “ The stupid neither forgive nor forget ; the naive forgive and forget ; the wise forgive but do not forget . ”
“ Formerly , when religion was strong and science weak , men mistook magic for medicine ; now , when science is strong and religion weak , men mistake medicine for magic . ”
“ If you talk to God , you are praying .
If God talks to you , you have schizophrenia . ”
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - James McDonald , a prominent adviser to wealthy families as chief executive of investment management group Rockefeller & Co , died in an apparent suicide ,
James S. McDonald , a prominent adviser to wealthy families as chief executive of investment management group Rockefeller & Co , in an undated photo .
REUTERS / Business Wire / Handout
on Sunday , local authorities said on Tuesday .
McDonald , 56 , was found with a single gunshot wound in his car near a strip mall in Dartmouth , Massachusetts on Sunday afternoon .
Police are still investigating .
“ The preliminary investigation concludes that this was an apparent suicide , ” said Gregg Miliote , a spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter .
McDonald was credited with growing Rockefeller & Co , the New York - based family office established by oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller in 1882 to manage the dynasty ’s assets , into a broader investment management company with roughly $ 28 billion in assets .
Known as a perfectionist who drove himself and his employees hard , McDonald lived in New York City where people who worked with him said he was equally at home in corporate boardrooms and the city ’s most exclusive social circles .
Friends described McDonald , who earned degrees from Harvard and the University of Virginia , as a brilliant thinker who grasped difficult concepts quickly and had a vision to expand the company .
Several people who knew him professionally said on Tuesday that they were shocked by the news , noting they had no knowledge about any specific problems at Rockefeller &
Co that might have prompted the death .
A spokesman at the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on whether McDonald or the firm was facing any inquiries .
In Massachusetts , where the state securities regulator has waged an aggressive campaign against investment advisers who were cheating clients , there is no investigation into McDonald or the company , a spokesman for Secretary of State William Galvin said .
The people , however , spoke of the mounting pressures McDonald faced while running an investment management business during exceedingly difficult financial market conditions .
Earlier this year , McDonald was one of the directors who left the board of lender CIT Group .
The directors cited the increased demands related to CIT becoming a bank holding company in December 2008 and time constraints related to each of their other professional commitments and responsibilities as their reasons for leaving , according to a CIT proxy .
McDonald was married with a son and daughter and had homes on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and in Boston .
Rockefeller &
Co confirmed the death in a short statement but declined to give further details .
It said Austin Shapard , the company ’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer , was now running the company .
Two massive seismic jolts – similarly deadly , but as yet unrelated – brought chaos and destruction to a vast swath of the Pacific Rim yesterday , killing several hundred people and leaving thousands more feared trapped under piles of rubble on a day when nature showed her deadly hand .
A tsunami , set off by a powerful dawn earthquake , flattened villages on the Samoan islands and swept people and vehicles out to sea as surging water reached more than a mile inland .
Just hours later , another large quake struck offshore from the Indonesian island of Sumatra , bringing down buildings and sparking widespread panic .
Last night , full details of the destruction caused by the ruptures deep beneath the Earth 's crust were still emerging , but it was feared the combined death toll of about 300 would leap dramatically , possibly into the " thousands " as rescue workers scrambled into action across a massive area .

It is believed 119 people died in Samoa , the neighbouring US territory of American Samoa and the country of Tonga , to the south , after the 8.3 - magnitude quake triggered the Pacific 's worst tsunami for more than a decade .
One Briton , believed to be a two - year - old child , was among the dead , together with two Koreans , at least two Australians and a New Zealander .
Meanwhile , in American Samoa 's capital , Pago Pago , the streets and fields were filled with ocean rubbish , debris and mud .
In Washington , President Barack Obama declared a major disaster for the island and said that he and his wife , Michelle , " will keep those who have lost so much in our thoughts and prayers " .
For all the destruction caused to the collection of Pacific archipelagos , it may have been the Indonesian island of Sumatra that suffered the highest human toll , with the city of Padang on the west coast bearing the brunt of the 7.6 - magnitude quake .
There were reports that the roof of the main airport had caved in , as well as a shopping mall , two hospitals , schools and houses .
Indonesia 's Health Minister , Siti Fadilah Supari , said the jolt was more powerful than a similar one three years ago that struck an historic city on the neighbouring Indonesian island of Java when more than 3,000 people died .
" This is a high - scale disaster , more powerful than the earthquake in Yogyakarta , " he said .
Rustam Pakaya , head of the health ministry 's crisis centre , said that thousands of people were trapped under collapsed buildings .
" The earthquake was very strong , " one survivor , Kasmiati , who lives on the coast near the quake 's epicentre , told the Associated Press .
" People ran to high ground .
Houses and buildings were badly damaged .
I was outside , so I am safe , but my children at home were injured . "

There were reports of the quake being felt in high buildings several hundred miles away in Jakarta , Singapore and Malaysia .
In Padang itself , when the quake struck at 5.15 pm local time , people sat down in the street to avoid falling over , such were the tremors – triggered along the same fault line that gave birth to the huge 2004 Asian tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries .
The Indonesian Vice - President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll was likely to continue to rise sharply , as so many buildings had crumpled .
" It 's night - time now so it 's dark , " he said .
" People are trapped , hotels have collapsed , schools have collapsed , houses have collapsed and electricity has been cut off . "
Erwinsyah Sipahutar , a lecturer at the Padang Industrial Technic Academy , told an Indonesian website , Tempo , that people were " shaken like matchsticks " .
Footage broadcast by the local TVOne network showed children screaming as residents tried to put out fires started in the quake .
What will complicate today 's rescue effort are the landslides that are reported to have cut off all roads to Padang .
With power and communications also severed , those with relatives or friends in the city of 900,000 people were desperate for news .
" I want to know what happened to my sister and her husband , " said Fitra Jaya , who owns a house in central Padang and was in Jakarta when the earthquake struck .
" I tried to call my family there , but I could not reach anyone at all . "

Glastonbury Radio
Circa 2007 - 2009
Glastonbury Radio was a local radio station based in Glastonbury , England with a worldwide audience .
Content is from the site 's 2007 - 2009 archived pages with brief glimpses from various posts , aswell as outside sources .
Changes at Glastonbury Radio 25/05/09
After two gruelling years at the helm of Glastonbury Radio I have decided to step down as MD and let someone else run the station , so we are now seeking a new entrepreneurial MD to take control and to handle the next stage of it's growth .
Whilst many still believe that online radio is still years away from competing with FM , here in Glastonbury it has taken off much quicker than expected , probably because of the festival and the tourism that comes to the town , thus meaning a worldwide interest .
In fact , a new GOLD station is to be launched soon called funnily enough , Glastonbury Gold supported by a local brewer who will be launching a brew of the same name !
For me , it 's time to look at new ventures and challenges , and although I will be staying with Glastonbury Broadcasting Ltd until something exciting comes up , I will be looking at home and abroad for those new challenges .
I have enjoyed my time here , and the shares will be retained unless we get a fair offer for them , so even whilst I am elsewhere , we will still have an involvement in the business .
But that could offer a great opportunity for someone that wants to buy into the business here / images / smile.png
Thanks to everyone that has supported the station over the two years I have been at the helm , and I wish everyone at Glastonbury Radio great success for the future .

It has rich traditions , a cosmopolitan community and a taste of tomorrow .
It sits on the ancient Isle of Avalon in the Somerset Levels , with a backdrop of soft , green , rolling hills .
It has been a pilgrimage place for thousands of years .
In the Middle Ages a great abbey was here - it was England 's ' holyest earthe ' .
It now hosts the famous Glastonbury Festival , pilgrimages , music , a carnival , several conferences and other events .
People visit from the world over , seeking a certain special something ....
Overlooking it all is Glastonbury Tor , a fascinating holy hill .
Tradition has it that Jesus visited and Joseph of Arimathaea built a church here , King Arthur and Guinevere were buried here and it was an ancient place of the Goddess .
It was home to the medieval saints Patrick , Dunstan , Benedict , David and Bridget .
Today it is a unique , atmospheric town of nearly 10,000 people with a mixture of locals , incomers and spiritual seekers .
For a hundred years it has been a mecca for ' cultural creatives ' and an interfaith town .

Brian Howes and his defamatory statements Posted by Ross Hemsworth on November 2 , 2009
As many of you will know , Ross Hemsworth and Glastonbury Radio have come under constant attack in recent months by a man called Brian Howes .
Our crime was , that we gave him an hour on the radio station as someone who we thought at the time , was facing unfair extradition to the USA .
However , as the audience turned on him after trying to gain their sympathy by telling them of he and his wife ’s “ suicide pact ” which would leave behind five young children , he then started to attack Ross and the radio station with a series of defamatory claims .
It may be prudent at this stage for you all to check Section 58 – paragraph 5 of this document , where the Sheriff in the Scottish Court shows his TRUE colours : - http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/doc1.html
Mr Howes appears to be anything BUT innocent , and his ranting s on social networking sites have attempted to cause considerable financial damage to the radio station and to Mr Hemsworth .
http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/uk-and-international-news/2009/06/21/drugs-probe-extradition-scot-accused-of-sex-attacks-on-six-year-old-girl-78057-21459748/
If anyone believes any of the rubbish spouted about Mr Hemsworth or Glastonbury Radio , then please e-mail studio@glastonburyradio.net and we will happily reveal the truth to you , as there are always two sides to every story and we believe you should hear both sides before making any judgement .
Ross Hemsworth is a very honest and decent person who has always protected the shareholder ’s investments in Glastonbury Radio and has proven to be very reliable and open in his dealings with all concerned .
The management of Glastonbury Radio have now taken legal advice on the matter .
We just felt that you should all know the damage that this evil man has attempted to cause , and since his rantings started various other dubious sources have come out of the closet pretending to back his claims !
Glastonbury Radio is backed by individual investors who have never had anything to do with Mr Howes , yet may suffer from his accusations which are both libelous and defamatory .
Please spread the word to people about Mr Howes ’ background , as he has a lot of “ followers ” on social networking sites who have fallen for his sob-stories and believe him to be innocent .
Glastonbury Radio News Posted by Ross Hemsworth on October 24 , 2009 Ross Hemsworth , the founder of Glastonbury Radio decided to leave the company this week to pursue new challenges , and major shareholder Doug Hill has taken over the day to day running of the company as Managing Director .
Despite rumours locally , Doug and Ross remain good friends and Ross is supporting Doug over the transition period .
Siobhan Peal remans Production Director and will continue to handle programming and scheduling issues and can be contacted at siobhan@glastonburyradio.net Doug has stated that his move into the MD ’s seat is temporary , until a new suitable person can be found to take over the running of Glastonbury Radio .
Interested parties must we willing to acquire some shares in the business as a show of commitment and should e-mail doug@glastonburyradio.net if interested .
We wish Ross all the very best in his new endeavours and thank him for the great efforts he has made on behalf of the station since March 2007 .

The Awards Result ….. Posted by Ross Hemsworth on October 16 , 2009
As you all know by now , we were finalists last night ( Oct 15th ) at London ’s Novotel in Hammersmith , for “ Best Music and Audio Delivery Platform ” at the Streaming Media Global Readers Choice Awards .
We did n’t win unfortunately , with the prize being taken by I2i Online ( who incidentally were the only one of the three finalists to buy a stand at the event ) but just to get to the final three was a major achievement for Glastonbury Radio .
Doug Hill and myself attended the ceremony and were treated to ongoing free drinks and nibbles which was very nice , but made for a sleepy trip home on the train from Paddington !
Well done to I2i Online who took home the award .
Ross Hemsworth
Managing Director
Tonight – the awards ceremony Posted by Ross Hemsworth on October 15 , 2009 Today I ’m in London at the Awards !!
Today may turn out to be my swansong at Glastonbury Radio , as we are finalists in this years Streaming Media Global Readers Choice Awards in London .
The awards are particularly important because they are voted for by web users , and we are one of three finalists for “ Music and Audio Delivery Platform ” along with Spotify and I2i Online .
Only one of the three companies can turn out to be the winner tonight !
The awards are taking place at the Novotel nr Hammersmith and the ceremony starts at around 5.30 p.m. and both myself and major shareholder Doug Hill will be there .
Anyone can attend , so if you are in the area , do come along !
Obviously blue - chip company Spotify are the firm favourites to win the award , but just to make it from thousands of companies into that final three is a massive achievement for Glastonbury Radio !
So you may catch a rare glimpse of me wearing a suit if you see me around today lol !
Fingers crossed everyone !

Glastonbury Radio update Posted by Ross Hemsworth on October 13 , 2009
There seems to be a little confusion over the announcement yesterday of Ross Hemsworth quitting as MD of Glastonbury Broadcasting Ltd .
Ross is leaving to study , he plans to sit a law degree course and as such will not have the time to run Glastonbury Radio and has therefore started the process of attempting to find a suitable replacement .
Ross has run Glastonbury Broadcasting Ltd for two and a half years , and has seen the company rise from an idea , to a 24 hour a day , 7 days a week radio station .
But now new challenges lay ahead of him .
Applications for the position of MD should be sent to studio@glastonburyradio.net and will be forwarded to the shareholders for their consideration , although the new MD will be expected to buy at least one share in the business as a show of commitment .
To avoid confusion , Glastonbury Radio will continue to broadcast and grow and hopefully with new energy on board , will flourish .

We do however , expect the new MD to purchase a number of shares in the business to show his / her commitment to the company .
If you think you could take Glastonbury Radio to its next level then drop a CV and covering letter to studio@glastonburyradio.net explaining why you think you have what it takes .

Every once in a while , you come across something that you did n't even know existed , and then you wonder how you ever got along without it .
For us , this happened last week when our random surfing of Amazon turned up The Comic Book Greats : Rob Liefeld , an hour - long release from 1991 that profiles the man who was , at the time , the hottest and most successful artist in the industry .
tweetmeme_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2009/10/26/comicsalliance-video-vault-the-comic-book-greats-rob-liefeld/'; tweetmeme_source = ' ComicsAlliance ' ;
Clearly , this was something we had to see .
Unfortunately , the fact that it's an 18 - year - old VHS tape would make that a little tough , but with the magic of the Internet , we found the entire video on YouTube , and whether you think of Liefeld as the dynamic heir to Jack Kirby or the much - deserved punching - bag of the Comics Internet , it makes for a fascinating snapshot of one of the strangest times in the history of the industry .
So join us as ComicsAlllince contributor Chris Sims breaks it down scene - by scene !
0:01 - The first strange thing about this video is the fact that the interview is being conducted by none other than Smilin ' Stan Lee .
That 's right , folks :
It 's the co-creator of Spider - Man , the X - Men and the Hulk asking the creator of Badrock and Shaft to explain how he managed to pull it off .
0:34 - And here 's the man himself : Rob Liefeld .
At the time , Rob was arguably the biggest name in comics with a string of successes under his belt ( and even more around the corner ) , but he comes off as more than a little nervous , doodling on a pad during the video 's interview segments .
And why would n't he ?
Dude was 23 years old and sitting across the table from the guy who 's partly responsible for comic books as we know them today .
This film is basically an experiment designed to reprogram biological clocks for insomniacs so they can sleep again .
L.D. Groban reads his own poem during the span of about four days , which is interspliced with stock footage of heavy - metal videos and x-rated footage .

Last year , the Department of Justice ( “ DOJ ” ) proposed frightful regulations for the Americans with Disabilities Act ( “ ADA ” ) .
They will likely go into effect by the end of this year .
These regulations , if enacted , will greatly limit the type of animal that the disabled can use in public spaces .
As profiled in the Seattle Times , Daniel Greene is one individual likely to be affected under the new regulations .
Mr. Greene relies on his five - foot - long boa constrictor , Redrock , to warn him of oncoming seizures .
Mr. Greene believes that Redrock can sense a change in body temperature shortly before a seizure and then can alert Mr. Greene by “ hugging ” his neck . ”
As a service snake , Redrock is currently protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) .
But if DOJ ’s new rules go into effect , Redrock will lose his protected status , which allows him to accompany Mr. Greene into public places such as stores , restaurants , and theaters .
Siouxsie says let the man use his snake .
Redrock is n’t hurting anyone .
What is the big deal ?
Siouxsie gently reminds everyone that it was not so long ago that people complained about the use of canines as service animals .
Sadly , Mr. Greene and his snake are not alone .
There are many people with a wide range of disabilities that would be impacted by these overly - restrictive regulations .
The proposed regulations are overbroad and ill - conceived .
They limit the definition of service animal to “ a dog or other common domestic animal ” and exclude “ wild animals ( including nonhuman primates born in captivity ) , reptiles , rabbits , farm animals ( including any breed of horse , miniature horse , pony , pig , or goat ) , ferrets , amphibians , and rodents . ”
These changes are absolutely horrid .
What can you do ?
Siouxsie says e-mail Attorney General of the United States — Mr. Eric Holder .
Tell him not to adopt such sweeping changes to the ADA .

Credit Booms Gone Bust : Monetary Policy , Leverage Cycles and Financial Crises , 1870 - 2008
NBER Working Paper No. 15512
Issued in November 2009 , Revised in December 2011
NBER Program(s ) : Development of the American Economy , Economic Fluctuations and Growth , International Finance and Macroeconomics , Monetary Economics
The crisis of the advanced economies in 2008 - 09 has focused new attention on money and credit fluctuations , financial crises , and policy responses .
We study the behavior of money , credit , and macroeconomic indicators over the long run based on a new historical dataset for 14 countries over the years 1870 - 2008 , using the data to study rare events associated with financial crisis episodes .
We present new evidence that leverage in the financial sector has increased strongly in the second half of the twentieth century as shown by a decoupling of money and credit aggregates .
We show for the first time how monetary policy responses to financial crises have been more aggressive post - 1945 , but how despite these policies the output costs of crises have remained large .
Importantly , we demonstrate that credit growth is a powerful predictor of financial crises , suggesting that such crises are " credit booms gone wrong " and that policymakers ignore credit at their peril .
It is only with the long - run comparative data assembled for this paper that these patterns can be seen clearly .
A non-technical summary of this paper is available in the March 2010 NBER Digest .

Just being in Vegas raises risk of suicide , study finds
The risk of suicide is significantly increased by visiting or living in Las Vegas , and leaving town reduces the risk that a person will take his own life , a former UNLV researcher has found .
Reader poll
Why does Nevada lead the nation in suicides ?
Las Vegas ' toxic environment promotes suicides .
People who are suicidal come here .
Other reasons .
View results
The finding is important because although Las Vegas is notorious for its high suicide rate , few academics have studied the problem .
Researcher Matt Wray , assistant professor of sociology at Temple University , and colleagues at Harvard University , have further clarified the extent of the problem with their study , “ Leaving Las Vegas : Exposure to Las Vegas and Risk of Suicide . ”
It does not answer the question of why people commit suicide in the city , but parses mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics in a manner that lays a foundation for future analysis , said Wray , who was a professor at UNLV from 2001 to 2008 .
According to the study , which examined suicides between 1979 and 2004 :
• Clark County residents were 54 percent to 62 percent more likely to commit suicide than U.S. residents elsewhere .
• Clark County visitors were more than twice as likely to commit suicide than if they stayed home .
• Travelers visiting Clark County were twice as likely to commit suicide here compared with travelers going elsewhere .
• Residents who traveled away from Clark County decreased their likelihood of committing suicide by 13 percent to 40 percent .
“ That ’s a significant reduction in your risk , ” Wray said .
“ It ’s a way of saying that if you ’re feeling blue you should take a break from Las Vegas . ”
Suicide is rare compared with other causes of death .
In 2005 , the most recent year statistics are available , there were 480 suicides in Nevada and 307 in Clark County .
The Nevada suicide rate of 20 per 100,000 residents is almost twice the national rate .
The study , which will be published in the December edition of the peer - reviewed journal Social Science & Medicine , challenges one of the common attitudes about suicide in Las Vegas , Wray said .
There ’s a general resistance by Las Vegas leaders to admit the extent of the problem , he said , and suicide prevention is “ not at the top of anyone ’s agenda . ”
“ Given the magnitude of the problem , one can argue it should be , ” he said .
The study does not answer the Las Vegas version of the chicken and egg conundrum :
Are suicidal people attracted to Las Vegas , or does something about the city lead people to kill themselves ?
The scenarios that explain the high rate of suicides in Las Vegas vary and need further research , Wray said .
“ One would be ‘ gambler despair ’ — someone visits Las Vegas , bets his house away and decides to end it all , ” he said .
“ Another would be that those predisposed to suicide disproportionately choose Las Vegas to reside or visit .
And , finally , there may be a ‘ contagion ’ effect where people are emulating the suicides of others ...
Some people may be going there intent on self - destruction . ”
Wray said the evidence points to something about Las Vegas that causes more suicides .
The finding that suicide risk remains high in Las Vegas while there are declines in other counties suggests there could be something harmful about the city , Wray said .
He also noted the finding that the risk of suicide is reduced when people leave Las Vegas .
“ If suicide was really about the people , it seems they would take their suicide risk with them , ” he said .
Experts have speculated that problems with addiction to gambling and drugs and alcohol , lack of mental health resources and rapid growth also may contribute to the suicide problem .
Las Vegas ’ fast growth amplifies “ social isolation , fragmentation and low social cohesion , all of which have long been identified as correlates of suicide , ” Wray said .
The study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars program .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Does the U.S. Constitution stand for anything in an era of government excess ?
Can that founding document , which is supposed to restrain the power and reach of a centralized federal government , slow down the juggernaut of czars , health insurance overhaul and anything else this administration and Congress wish to do that is not in the Constitution ?
The Framers created a limited government , thus ensuring that individuals would have the opportunity to become all that their talents and persistence would allow .
The left has put aside the original Constitution in favor of a “ living document ” that they believe allows them to do whatever they want and demand more tax dollars with which to do it .
Can they be stopped ?
Some constitutional scholars think the 10th Amendment offers the best opportunity .
The 10th Amendment states : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
In 1939 , the Supreme Court began to dilute constitutional language so that it became open to broader interpretation .
Robert G. Natelson , professor of constitutional law and legal history at the University of Montana , has written that even before Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s court - packing scheme , it was changing the way the Constitution was interpreted , especially “ how the commerce and taxing powers were turned upside - down , the necessary and proper clauses and incidental powers , the false claim that the Supreme Court is conservative , how bad precedent leads to more bad court rulings , state elections as critical for constitutional activists , and more . ”
While during the last seven decades the court has tolerated the federal welfare state , Mr. Natelson says it has never , except in wartime , “ authorized an expansion of the federal scope quite as large as what is being proposed now .
And in recent years , both the Court and individual justices - even ‘ liberal ’ justices - have said repeatedly that there are boundaries beyond which Congress may not go .
… Chief Justice John Marshall once wrote that if Congress were to use its legitimate powers as a ‘ pretext ’ for assuming an unauthorized power , ‘ it would become the painful duty ’ of the Court ‘ to say that such an act was not the law of the land . ’ ”
It would be nice to know now what those boundaries are and whether Congress is exceeding its powers as it prepares to alter one - sixth of our economy and change how we access health insurance and health care .
Mr. Natelson makes a fascinating argument in his essay “ Is ObamaCare Constitutional ? ” using the court ’s Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973 .
In Roe , he writes , the court struck down state abortion laws that “ intruded into the doctor - patient relationship .
But the intrusion invalidated in Roe was insignificant compared to the massive intervention contemplated by schemes such as HB3200 .
‘ Global budgeting ’ and ‘ single - payer ’ plans go even further and seem clearly to violate the Supreme Court ’s Substantive Due Process rules . ”
Constitutional attorney John Whitehead , president of the Rutherford Institute , tells me , “ Although the states surrendered many of their powers to the new federal government , they retained a residuary and inviolable sovereignty that is reflected throughout the Constitution ’s text .
The Framers rejected the concept of a central government that would act upon and through the states , and instead designed a system in which the state and federal governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people .
The Court ’s jurisprudence makes clear that the federal government may not compel the states to enact or administer a federal regulatory program . ”
Lawyers are busy writing language only they can understand , which seeks to circumvent the intentions of the Founders .
But it will be difficult to circumvent the last four words of the 10th Amendment , which state unambiguously where ultimate power lies : “ or to the people . ”
Americans who believe their government should not be a giant ATM , dispensing money and benefits to people who have not earned them , and who want their country returned to its founding principles , must exercise that power before it is taken from them .
The 10th Amendment is one place to begin .
The streets are another .
It worked for the left .

A huge rise in the number of children calling to report sexual abuse by women has been revealed by Childline .
Over the past five years , the charity says the number of such calls has risen five times faster than youngsters reporting abuse by a man .
Of 16,094 children who called Childline about sex abuse last year , 2,142 told of abuse by a woman , up 132 % on 2004 - 5 .
Men still account for the majority of child abuse claims , but the NSPCC said female sex abuse was under -reported .
This is because there is a reluctance or unwillingness on the part of professionals to acknowledge or identify sexual abuse by females , the charity suggested .
The research follows the recent high - profile case of nursery worker Vanessa George , who abused children in her care .
She was a member of an internet paedophile ring which included another woman .
Mothers Childline 's report did not claim that sexual abuse by women was on the rise .
It instead suggested that , as more boys were tending to call its helpline , more cases were being reported .
Many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child
Sue Minto
NSPCC
The research said nearly two - thirds ( 1,311 ) of the claims it received about sex abuse by a female involved the child 's mother .
Just over twice as many victims ( 2,972 ) said they had been abused by their father - which amounted to 45 % of calls about sex abuse by males .
The number of children claiming to have been abused by men grew by 27 % in the same four - year period .
The Childline research also showed that 42 % more children were calling the helpline in 2008 - 09 than in 2004 - 5 .
Sue Minto , head of Childline , said : " Most sex abuse calls to Childline come from girls saying they were assaulted by a male .
" But a growing number of callers now say they were sexually abused by a female .
This may be partly because more boys are calling us than previously .
" Many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child .
But they do . "
CHILDLINE CONTACTS
Childline is a free , confidential helpline which can be contacted on 0800 1111
You can also send e-mails via the Childline website ' Internalising ' Dr Lisa Bunting , senior researcher at the NSPCC , who has studied the issue , said : " There is such an intense stigma in disclosing incidents of abuse by women .
" We get a lot of stigma with any type of sex abuse , but this is particularly the case in the participation of women . "
She said this often led to victims " internalising " the abuse because they could not believe it had happened and did not think they would be believed .
She added : " If you do n't think females are capable of committing sex offences , then you are never going to be looking for that . "
The Childline report said the issue of female sex offending was not well reflected in policy , practice and guidance on child protection and offender management .
It added : " It is important that regardless of what is currently known about the numbers of female offenders , more is done to understand the nature of sexual offending by women [ and to ] raise awareness among the public so that they can report it . "

More raw notes from the 3D / Stereoscopic panel at FantasticFest – this one makes a nice bookend with Emmy award winning Sean Fairburn ’s comments about working on set – Sean talked about shooting concerns , Jabbar talks about VFX supervising on set – both in general , and things to worry about when shooting 3D ( as in stereoscopic ) .
Below are my raw notes , and here ’s a link to pictures of Jabbar ’s slides on Flickr .
Jabbar talks about what information to record on set for visual effects , tools to collect that info on set , and how to communicate effectively both on set and in post .
Some really good info in here after the jump !
Jabar – worked at Stan Winston now at Troublemaker Studios – works on 3D stuff –
Stereo Filmaking and 3D Filmmaking
worked at Janimation in Dallas for Spy Kids , went to LA , is doable just a lot of hard work –
worked on Machete for 7 weeks , Predators is about to go
he usually works on set with VFX
captures a lot of data on set
depending on the shot , gotta capture a lot of information
- when thinking of the type of VFX shot to do , which tools will you need ?
- do n’t get too much data on set , if you feed them too much info for post they ’ll quit reading it , if you take too long on set they ’ll overrun you and move on without you
- difference when dealing with stereo vs. single cam shoots
VFX kit : ( photo )
you ’re bringing stuff with you at all times , the kit lives on a cart
there ’s a lot of planned shots , but there ’s unplanned shots as well
( photo 4748 )
large and small chrome balls – sometimes the big wo n’t fit – a little beetle in a cupboard – needed the small one
- grey / white ball – grey side should be as matte as possible
- base for c-stand – want to overlap the ball as little as possible
- Disto – measuring tape and inclinometer – the disto does tilt and distance and calculates distance and height – info you ca n’t get with a tape
- carry your own c-stand !
have your own , nobody will argue with it
- gaffer ’s tape – green , blue , black , white , bring it all to set
- recording the camera info – teh camera , lens , how high , etc .
- if a 3D shot , get an HDRI
- lighting reference !
something to be or the actual thing for the CG recreations later
- get comfy knowing the lenses – find out what the camera package is – what bodies and lenses , etc. – you ’ll need to know what lenses to recreate – but if you know what lens it is , that is at least a start to work with
- shoot distortion charts , shoot depth of field charts – objects of a known distance apart – go through the different t- stops are , this lets you know how out of focus things should be – matching depth of field is a critical thing to throw off VFX work
- grey / white ball – shoot the white side and the grey side separately
- the grey ball shows where the shadow line is
- the white ball lets you see sun angle , etc .
-HDRI – use long lens , be wehre camea was if possible , keep entire sphere in focus , put the chrome ball EXACTLY where the 3D object would be , and you should shoot from exactly where the camera was
- if creature was in light and dark , shoot in both where possible
- analyze the shot on where the 3D thing is going to be most of the time
- use a longer lens to flatten the ball out as much as possible , want to be croped tight and also have YOU be as smal as possible in the reflection
- and get them to NOT CUT THE LIGHTS !!!
– keep people from tearing down the lights after cut and move on
- F8 or so for the t- stop to keep the whole ball in focus
- Nikon Camera Control Pro – connected to 11 stops – - 5 to 5 stops is ideal – 6 is as low as he’d go
Photoshop , HDRShop , to 3D app of choice
crops and aligns in Pshop , then goes to HDRshop to unwrap into a panoramic , then on to Maya , XSI , etc .
- the HDRI lets the 3D app use as lighting
- camera notes – 4766 – scene , shot , etc. – direction ( facing ) – to match the time of day and direction etc for multiple days
- sketch of the set layout for lights etc .
- focal length , focus distance , cam height / angle , t- stop , etc .
- the 1st AC is your new best friend and can tell you all this info
- clean plates and BG on greenscreen
- recorded filters – ND 0.3 and black frost filters were used , for instance
- the AD will be trying to push you out of the way to keep things moving – prep the AC before the shot , not at the beginning of the day – then the AD will call cut and tell everyone not to move –
capture your data accurately and quickly – if you get rushed and get it wrong you ’re hosing the work later and stealing time on set
-VFX does n’t get as much respect as it should , they want to push you out of the way – “ We ’re all waiting to go home so VFX can get their reference . ” – get in , get out , be FAST , set time is expensive
- how ever many millions in budget , replace that with thousands , it is that many dollars per MINUTE – $ 50 M movie , 50,000 / minute on set
- making the decisions on set to know how much to fix now on set ( move that c- stand for 3 minutes ) or in post ( 1 guy 1 day ) to paint out the c-stand
- in the sample shot – Hybrid did the VFX –
Stereo Rig vs. F900 rig
- beam splitter rig vs. side by side rig – side by side is simpler / easier / lighter , but ca n’t do interocular
- for stereo show notes – interocular distances – get that from that camera assistance , as well as the convergence distance
- convergence can be played with LATER by sliding the plates horizontally if you are shooting a lot of greenscreen stuff
- for live action shots , not as much room to play
- convergence distance is not necessarily the same as focus distance
- behind convergence is going into the screen ,
- he has some anaglyph samples that let you see the points of convergence
- as you match your 3D worlds to your 2D plates , gotta keep convergence matching between
- whether the red anaglyph is on the left or right tells your whether something is in front of or behind the point of convergence
-XSI is what these guys work in for their 3D stuff
- for a stereo vs. regular show :
- twice the tapes / media
- twice the cam assistants
- twice the storage , render frames , render time
- matching convergence adds complexity to shots and takes longer
- stereo effect is another source of feedback for changes
- how much more does it cost than 2D ?
Hard to say .
the fact that it is 3D is yet another component that creates more changes to be dealt with
- on The Day , he ’s measuring everything to recreate the set
-HDRI substitute – roll through camera through the t- stop range – the problem is you ca n’t get bright enought overexpose it enough
- for 3D CG inserts onto live , get it right on one eye , THEN recreate for the other eye to go to compositor
- Robert never uses a motion control rig – gotta track it –
- the clean plate they match in 2D – for the clean plate , can do 2D tracking with the scale to figure out where they needed to clean things up
Q : relationship to script supervisor – if on low budget , can have scripty taking those notes from the AC ?
A : kinda sorta
- his notes all go back to Troublemaker on a week by week basis , it all goes into a binder , and it gets photocopied and scanned and goes to vendors for the info they need
Q : how to add creative idea ?
A : With Robert , he just prefaces with “ Would n’t it be cool if ….. ” and Robert said YES – so done – easier to do it on set and just do it
- make it cooler , but keep the costs in check
- how many vendors do you work with ?
And Troublemaker has inhouse folks , etc. – they figure out who is doing what beforehand – for instance , in Shorts they knew the Booger Monster shots were done inhouse , vs. a Hyride shot and what the costs are per shot
- worst case and most expensive - plan for that , and be pleasantly surprised
I ’d like to introduce you to two friends of mine , Mr. Bentham and Mr. Hume .
Mr. Bentham knows everything .
He went to Stanford , then to the Kennedy school before getting a business degree .
He ’s got multivariate regressions coming out of his ears , and he sprinkles C.B.O. reports on his corn flakes for added fiber .
Mr. Hume is very smart , too , but he does n’t seem to make much use of his intelligence .
He worked on Wall Street for a little while , but he never could accurately predict how the market was going to move tomorrow or the day after that .
Mr. Bentham is a great lunch partner .
If you ask him to recommend a bottle of wine , he ’ll reel off the six best vintages on the wine list , in ranked preference .
Mr. Hume ca n’t even tell you which entree to order because he does n’t know what you like .
If you put Mr. Bentham in charge of the government , he ’d proceed with confidence .
If you told him to solve a complicated issue like the global - warming problem , he ’d gather the smartest people in the country and he ’d figure out how to expand wind , biomass , solar and geothermal sources to reduce CO2 emissions .
He ’d require utilities to contribute $ 1 billion a year to a Carbon Storage Research Consortium .
He ’d draw up regulations determining how much power plants would be allowed to pollute .
The decline of Detroit is really well documented , but these before and after pictures really encapsulate the return to nature that the once - proud industrial city has experienced .
These aerials only capture part of that actually , as skyscrapers now have trees growing inside of them , and residents speak of wild animal citings in their backyard .

The release of the newest version of Ubuntu is only 10 days away .
Many sites , including MakeTechEasier have covered its pending arrival and given you a glimpse of the Beta version .
Today we are going to take a look at Kubuntu , the KDE - based version of Ubuntu .
Installation
As with previous Kubuntu versions , you can install it from the desktop of the running live CD .
The interface for the installation now follows KDE 4 ’s Oxygen Air theme and has new graphical representations of several options .
Booting and Login
Booting is faster than ever , and the new KDE Air theme login window is the default .
KDE 4.3
If you have been following my weekly posts , you already know about many of the features new in KDE 4.3 .
While it has been available in the 9.04 Jaunty backport repositories for some time , it will now be the default KDE version with 9.10 .
Just to recap , here are some of the features new with KDE 4.3 :
New Krunner features and layout
New desktop effects , including the slide back feature
New KDE games , including an Egyptian mummy theme
New system tray that includes an improved notification system
Several new plasma widgets , including one for Google Calendar
OpenOffice.org Integration
In previous versions , OpenOffice integrated with KDE 3 themes or not at all .
Now , with OpenOffice.org 3.1 , it is well - integrated with KDE 4 widgets and themes .
K3 b
One of KDE ’s most universally loved applications was one of the last to be ported to KDE 4 .
Kubuntu includes an early version of K3 b that is fully KDE4 - based .
K3b is a CD and DVD burning program .
It is not clear how stable this version is , and I did not have any CDs to test it .
Amarok and Codecs
Kubuntu has long suffered from the codec discrimination that nearly all Linux distributions have endured .
Proprietary codecs that cannot be packaged with a free operating system have often left users disgruntled , sometimes even blaming the distribution developers .
It has always been relatively easy to install codecs with Kubuntu , but now , starting Amarok will give you a notice that you may want to install certain additional software packages .
Check the ones you want and then click “ Install Selected “ .
This is all processed through the new update notifier , which is integrated with Kpackagekit .
Kpackagekit
This is the application installation and management software for Kubuntu .
Like its predecessor Adept and the GTK version Synaptic , Kpackagekit relies on apt - get as a backend and uses the repositories listed in Apt ’s sources .
In Karmic , installation is even easier , and it is fully integrated with the update system and KDE ’s notification system .
USB Startup Disk
Kubuntu provides an easy - to - us KDE - based program to create a Kubuntu startup disk .
Web Browser
Kubuntu has always been about options .
In fact , the very existence of Kubuntu could be considered an Ubuntu option for a KDE - based distribution .
Konqueror is still the default web browser for the latest Kubuntu , but the developers have added some options .
For those that want a slim , lightweight , Webkit - based browser , Arora is now in the official repositories .
For those die - hard Firefox fans , Kubuntu now includes a handy installation program .
When you click “ Firefox installation ” in the “ Internet ” menu , you are presented with an installation screen .
Overall , Karmic Koala looks more polished than any previous Kubuntu version and probably any other KDE - based distribution to date .
Nevertheless , it is still in Beta at least for another week , and an honest review will have to wait .
With this preview , however , you have a glimpse of what is on the horizon .
WASHINGTON –
The United Nations Security Council was scheduled to convene Wednesday night to decide whether or not to accept a Libyan request to discuss the Goldstone Report , which accuses Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead
The United States and other countries are against a discussion on the report , but even if the Libyan initiative is curbed , the matter is expected to be raised during the periodical discussion on the Middle East on October 20 .
Goldstone Effect Hamas considering delaying reconciliation Ali Waked Palestinian group may avoid signing agreement with rival Fatah movement in response to PA 's decision to defer UN vote on Goldstone Report .
' How can we shake the hand of people who helped those who committed crimes in Gaza evade the international law system ? ' asks senior Hamas member Hamas considering delaying reconciliation
Ynet has learned that other countries are also opposed to a Security Council discussion , both because of the political aspect and due to the fact that the report should be first discussed by the Human Rights Council in Geneva , which was behind the initiative to probe the Israeli operation in Gaza .
The Geneva vote has been postponed by half a year after the Palestinians pulled a resolution to adopt the Goldstone Report and condemn Israel .
US says did not change stance
Diplomatic sources have said that the Libyan initiative will be opposed by several Security Council members , but that the issue may be voted on any case , although Libya may find it difficult to get the support of nine countries out of 15 , as required .
Behind the scene , the Americans are trying to come up with a compromise which will see the vote on the Goldstone Report held as part of the open periodical discussion on the situation in the Middle East .
As far as Israel is concerned , this option is the lesser of two evils , as the discussion will deal with a variety of issues in the region .
One possibility is that the sides will compromise on moving up the discussion on the situation in the Middle East .
A State Department source said that the US had not changed its mind on the report , which the source said focused on Israel in an unbalanced manner in most of its recommendations .
The American stand , which was to be expressed at the Security Council discussion Wednesday night , is that the report includes serious accusations which must be probed by both sides .
Washington wants the discussion on the report to be held as part of the Human Rights Council in Geneva rather than at the UN headquarters in New York .
The Obama administration supports an independent Israeli investigation into the war crime claims , for fear that the controversy over the Goldstone Report will disrupt the efforts of US special envoy George Mitchell to resume peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
It 's hard to talk about Turn 10's newest racing title , Forza 3 , without mentioning its forthcoming competitor : Gran Turismo 5 .
Turn 10 even went out of its way to say that it created the better game at E3 .
For the console die - hards out there , these reviews and bullet - point lists are going to be argued over for some time , because this is n't just a battle of racing games .
For some , it 's a battle of consoles .
Of course , the " battle of consoles " idea is ridiculous ; both systems are now $ 300 or less , meaning the current - generation has never been more affordable .
No matter which console you choose , you 're going to have a first - class racing experience .
Having said that , now that I 've spent a good amount of time playing Forza 3 — our review copy of the game came in the same day the demo went live —
Gran Turismo 5 has an insanely tough act to follow when it launches .
If Polyphony Digital can't match or beat what Turn 10 has put together , there is a new king of racing games .
If they do even better , than we have one of the best games ever created to look forward to .
If it 's arguable , then everyone wins .
But the fact is Forza 3 came out first , so it gets to set the level of engagement .
Let 's begin , shall we ?
By the way , get a hard drive
The first thing we noticed when our review package came was that the game comes on two discs .
What do those discs contain ?
The first disc features the game and 300 cars and the majority of the tracks , while the second disc adds another 100 cars or so , as well as three environments .
You install the second disc and it adds the content into the game when you put the first disc in .
Confused yet ?
The 1.9GB of content that comes on the second disc means you pretty much need to have a hard drive to see everything there is to see in Forza 3 .
If you do n't have a hard drive and you play online and see someone racing a car you do n't have installed , it will just show up as a generic car that acts like the car they 're driving .
It 's not a very elegant solution , but unfortunately you 're going to see more of this sort of thing on sprawling , beautiful games .
This is the price Microsoft pays for not making the hard drive standard .
So to sum it up , when you open the game , you 'll put it in disc one , be prompted to put in disc 2 , install a little under 2GB worth of data , and then put disc one back in .
The process goes by quickly , but remains a pain in the ass .
If you do n't have a hard drive , you simply wo n't be able to access those cars , except as generic character models in multiplayer , and the three environments will be completely closed off to you .
Everything is open
What 's fun about all the cars included with Forza 3 is that none of them are locked .
You 'll be able to buy any of them at any time ... if you have the credits , of course .
Each car is modeled beautifully , both inside and out , and you 'll be able to tweak each one to your heart 's content .
Or , you can skip that .
The beautiful thing about Forza 3 is that anyone can play it .
Turn on some assists , put on the racing line , turn off damage , and you 'll be able to play the game like a more arcade -y racer and have a good time .
Dial the difficulty up and the assists down and you 'll be able to enjoy a technical racing simulation .
Or you can land somewhere in the middle .
The game also gives you the ability to rewind the race at any time , allowing you to retake a trouble corner to practice it , or to avoid a pile - up that cost you a race .
The hardcore wo n't like this feature , but if you do n't like it , you do n't have to use it .
For those of us who like a more laid back experience , it 's a great feature , just as it was in Dirt 2 .
If you do n't want to deal with tweaking , you can have the game give your car a set of upgrades automatically in order to be competitive in the next race .
If you have the skill to drive on the simulator side of things , you 'll be gaining more money and your driver level will increase at a much quicker rate .
As you race you 'll be given experience points that level you up , and at each level you 'll be given a car .
Take part in some events , learn to drive well , and very soon you 'll be enjoying a nice stable of vehicles to experiment with .
One of the optional metrics used by CPANTS is whether the module has examples .
I think it checks if there is an eg/ directory but actually having an eg/ directory with examples does not give the users much .
Most of the people install the modules using CPAN.pm or the native package management tool .
Neither of those install the examples .
Very few download the source and unzip it so they wo n't see the examples .
OK , I admit .
I always have trouble locating examples even when the documentation of the module tells me to look at them .
So what other options are there ?
POD in the sample script
If there is POD in the example files then search .
cpan.org will display them , but of course it will display the POD and not the code .
Generate a module and install it In Win32:: GuiTest there is a make_eg.pl script that is executed when the distribution is generated .
It takes all the files from the eg/ directory and creates a module called Win32:: GuiTest : : Examples putting the examples in the POD section .
This means the actual examples can be easily read on search .
cpan.org and once the module is installed they can be easily found by typing perldoc Win32:: GuiTest :: Examples Install the examples
In Padre and in [ dist : Padre : : Plugin : : Parrot ] we instruct CPAN.pm to install the examples in the share directory .
Actually we have a share / directory and the examples are within that directory in share / examples .
Then in Makefile .
PL we have instruction to install the share directory .
( In the case of Module : : Install it is a call to install_share . )
Once the module is installed the examples are also installed and they can be found with the following call : $ dir = File : : Spec-> catdir ( File :: ShareDir:: dist_dir( ' Padre - Plugin - Parrot ' ) , ' examples ' ) ;
That is File :: ShareDir : : dist_dir( ' Padre - Plugin - Parrot ') returns the path to the share directory of the package .
In Padre then we can create menu items to Open Example that will open the regular Open File window just it will position it in the directory of the examples supplied by Padre .
Similarily the Parrot Plugin has ( or I think will have in the next release ) a menu item for the same thing .
Of course it is not restricted to people using Padre as anyone could use the above code .
run examples embedded in modules
There are a number of modules on CPAN with some way to run the examples embedded in modules .
for example if you look at the SDL :: Tutorial package of SDL_Perl , you know , the newly ( and rightly ) hyped module that will help you burn all your free time by writing games in Perl ... there you will find simple instructions on how to run the sample script : perl - MSDL :: Tutorial -e 1 Auto - extract examples
There are a number of modules on CPAN with some form of auto - extract examples I just can't find them .
The idea there is that the sample script is embedded in a module and running perl - MModule : : Name - e1 will create a file example .pl that will hold the example script .
Actually I think the SDL examples meant to do this as well but if I remember correctly they do n't extract anything , just run the example .
Conclusion
As we can see there are several ways to include examples in a CPAN distribution with varying levels of ease of use .
Actually we could even combine all the solutions and make sure people have several easy ways to see running examples of the modules on CPAN .
These could also help a lot with module evaluation and learning .

Chip maker
Intel says it will fight new allegations of corruption , as it faces a fresh onslaught of claims over its business practices .
The company - which is based in Santa Clara , California - rejected the case brought against it yesterday by New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo and said it would fight the claims in court .
Filing his case against the electronics giant , Cuomo said the company had " used bribery and coercion to maintain a stranglehold on the market " , hurting competitors and consumers as a result .
But Intel said the idea that it had damaged the market was incorrect .
" We disagree with the New York attorney general , " said the company in a statement .
" Neither consumers - who have consistently benefited from lower prices and increased innovation - nor justice are being served by filing a case now .
Intel will defend itself . "
Intel 's language did not , however , directly address the substance of Cuomo 's claims – that the company paid billions of dollars in kickbacks to computer manufacturers to get them to use its products instead of those of its main rival , AMD .
Instead , Intel 's supporters rallied around to attack Cuomo and the case , putting forward a number of arguments that they believe exculpated the technology pioneer .
Among them was American lobby group the Competitive Enterprise Institute , which takes an anti-regulatory stance and is notorious for suggesting that climate change is not a problem .
Calling Cuomo's case a " baseless attack " , CEI official Wayne Crews suggested that Intel 's dominance of the lucrative computer chip market was , in fact , proof of its innocence .
" Intel 's pricing and rebate policies are legitimate , pro-consumer business practices in a vibrant market setting , " he said .
" Intel is disciplined not only by its competitors but by downstream business customers like Dell and Hewlett - Packard . "
Meanwhile CNBC - the American business news channel that has been accused of blindly cheerleading the activities of corporations > in the past – questioned Cuomo 's motives .
" Is n't it strange that this is the second major action filed by Cuomo in the last four days against a California corporate powerhouse ? " wrote the network 's Silicon Valley chief Jim Goldman yesterday , suggesting that there was a growing " gravy train " of officials looking to gang up on Intel for political benefit .
" Last I checked , Intel - based machines still share shelf space with machines running AMD chips … that prices continue to plunge … and innovation continues to increase … the proof is in the marketplace " .
Intel 's case is likely to be weakened , however , by previous rulings made by regulators in Europe and Asia that have outlined some of the company 's practices and cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in fines .
Officials in Japan and South Korea have acted against the company for offering money to suppliers in order to exclude AMD from the market , while earlier this year European regulators fined the company € 1bn for making anti-competitive payments to computer manufacturers .
Intel is still appealing that ruling , but over the summer the European Commission took the unexpected step of publishing some of the documents used as evidence against Intel .
Those included email conversations between executives at HP – the largest computer manufacturer in the world – which suggested that they had indeed been paid on the condition that they avoided AMD products .
" You can NOT use the commercial AMD line in the channel in any country , it must be done direct , " said one email .
" If you do and we get caught ( and we will ) , the Intel money ( each month ) is gone ( they would terminate the deal ) .
The risk is too high . "
Ed Black , president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association – which argues that strong anti-competition law is required in the technology industry – said that Intel would be to stop protesting such accusations .
" It is time for Intel to admit its misconduct , repair the harms it has perpetrated and change its business practices , " he said .
" Its legal strategy is clearly not working and its broad claims of innocence are being shown to be more hollow each passing day . "
A cluster of socially conservative Houstonians is planning a campaign to discourage voters from choosing City Controller Annise Parker in the December mayoral runoff because she is a lesbian , according to multiple ministers and conservatives involved in the effort .
The group is motivated by concerns about a “ gay takeover ” of City Hall , given that two other candidates in the five remaining City Council races are also openly gay , as well as national interest driven by the possibility that Houston could become the first major U.S. city to elect an openly gay woman .
Another primary concern is that Parker or other elected officials would seek to overturn a 2001 city charter amendment that prohibits the city from providing benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees .
“ The bottom line is that we did n't pick the battle , she did , when she made her agenda and sexual preference a central part of her campaign , ” said Dave Welch , executive director of the Houston Area Pastor Council , numbering more than 200 senior pastors in the Greater Houston area .
“ National gay and lesbian activists see this as a historic opportunity .
The reality is that 's because they 're promoting an agenda which we believe to be contrary to the concerns of the community and destructive to the family . ”
Welch said he had “ no doubt ” there would be numerous independent advocacy efforts urging voters not to choose Parker , most of which would involve mail .
Locke courting right wing
Parker 's opponent , former City Attorney Gene Locke , strongly distanced himself from a previous anti-gay attack against her that ultimately proved to have been a hoax .
But he has made recent efforts to court some of the staunch social conservatives who are either actively planning on attacking Parker 's sexuality or strongly considering it .
He appeared at the Pastor Council 's annual gala last Friday and was encouraged several times by State Sen .
Dan Patrick , R- Houston , a featured speaker , to stand for conservative values .
Locke has also met with and sought the endorsement of Dr. Steven Hotze , a longtime local kingmaker in conservative politics and author of the Straight Slate in 1985 , a coterie of eight City Council candidates he recruited who ran on an anti-gay platform .
The slate was formed to oppose eight incumbents who supported measures aimed at protecting homosexuals from discrimination in city government .
The measures were resoundingly repealed by the voters in a referendum , but none of the eight council members lost their seats .
Republican consultant Allen Blakemore , a longtime Hotze associate who spoke on his behalf , said he is considering mailing out a slate of endorsed runoff candidates , and Parker 's sexuality is a “ key factor ” in his decision .
Hotze is concerned about the national fundraising and strong efforts of Houston 's Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Caucus on behalf of Parker and other council candidates , Blakemore said .
Parker has tread carefully in her candidacy for mayor , stressing frequently that she is running not as a gay candidate but as a qualified city official who 's won election six times .
In a televised debate last month , she voiced “ no current plans ” to revisit the city charter amendment if elected , although she said the city will need to offer benefits to the same - sex partners of its employees “ at some point . ”
Parker campaign manager Adam Harris said Locke 's overtures to Hotze and others represented a “ desperate and extreme act . ”
“ Houston deserves real leadership , not someone who will cut a deal with anyone and go to any extreme ” to be elected , Harris said .
Locke spokeswoman Kim Devlin said he has met with “ thousands of people ” and promised from the outset of his campaign to be “ mayor for every Houstonian … no matter their political party or their ideology . ”
“ Annise Parker is letting Houstonians in on her true character by leveling these highly incendiary , baseless and ridiculous attacks , ” said Devlin .
Same - sex benefits key
Former Harris County Tax Assessor Collector Paul Bettencourt , another Republican close to Hotze , said that if Locke wishes to unite a strong African - American base with social conservatives , they will need his assurance that he will not seek to overturn the charter amendment .
Responding to the same debate question as Parker last month , Locke said same - sex benefits allow governments and businesses “ a competitive advantage ” and said he “ would favor that , ” although it would not be the first thing on his plate .
“ That 's not going to motivate us to come out and vote for somebody , ” Bettencourt said of social conservatives .
“ You can not get the positive good conservative turnout if you 're trying to undo charter amendments .
It 's a line drawn in the sand .
You just can't have it both ways . ”

Orb -weaving spiders can spin webs of up to 1 m ( 3ft 3 in ) in diameter
A new and rare species of " giant " orb web spider has been discovered in Africa and Madagascar .
In the journal Plos One , researchers describe Nephila komaci as the largest web spinning spider known to science .
Only the females of this groups of species are giants , with a leg span of up to 12 cm ( 4.7in ) ; the male spiders are tiny by comparison .
Scientists say the female spiders are capable of spinning webs that reach up to 1 m ( 3ft 3 in ) in diameter .
Orb -weaving spiders are a widespread group which take their name from the round webs they typically spin .
The few preserved female specimens had bodies almost 4 cm ( 1.5 in ) long
The new spider was identified by Matjaz Kuntner , a biologist from the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts , and his colleague Jonathan Coddington , from the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC .
Dr Kuntner told BBC
News that the discovery was " very unusual " because Nephila spiders were so well - studied and so large .
But this species is so elusive that even Dr Kuntner has not seen one live .
He was able to identify the species from a specimen he first examined in 2000 .
The giant female was in a collection belonging to the Plant Protection Research Institute in Pretoria , South Africa .
" It did not match any described species , " said Dr Kuntner .
In his search through more than 2,500 samples from 37 museums , no further specimens turned up and he assumed the spider must be extinct .
But when a colleague in South Africa found three more of the spiders , it became apparent that they belonged to this same new species .
Male Nephila spiders look tiny in comparison to " giant " females
The discovery will enable scientists to study the evolution of the dramatic size difference between male and female Nephila spiders .
Dr Kuntner explained that the widely accepted theory was that evolutionary pressure was causing female " gigantism " , with the females increasing in size in order to produce larger numbers of offspring .
He and his colleague , Jonathan Coddington , from the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC , fear the rare spider might be endangered .
" Its range is restricted and all known localities lie within two endangered biodiversity hotspots : Maputaland and Madagascar , " said Dr Coddington .
Dr Kuntner named the species in honour of his best friend and fellow scientist Andrej Komac , who recently died in an accident .

CIA DIRECTOR LEON E. PANETTA : ( Extended cheers , applause . )
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very , very , very much — ( laughter ) — that — this is a very loud welcome — ( laughter ) — from a group that ’s supposed to be silent warriors .
( Laughter . )
Mr. President , it is a great honor and pleasure to welcome you to the CIA .
We are all very proud that you have taken the time out of your very busy schedule to come out to Langley and to meet with the men and women who perform the difficult but essential work of intelligence for our nation .
Those who founded this agency some six decades ago — President Harry Truman , inspired by General Bill Donovan , whose statue ’s here in the lobby — understood that they were creating something essential to the security of the nation , an agency that would largely operate in the shadows of secrecy to provide crucial and accurate intelligence to our nation ’s leaders .
The times demanded it then .
The times demand it now .
CIA is on the front line of the defense of this nation .
As we speak , CIA officers are spread out across the globe in some very dangerous places , putting their lives on the line , tackling the threats of our times from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to narcotics trafficking and espionage and every other global challenge and threat .
Their skill and ingenuity and dedication are working to keep the nation safe .
And that work does n’t come without risk or without cost .
The Wall of Stars behind us is the ultimate testament to their sacrifice .
Each star represents an officer who gave his or her life to this country , and some whose names remain secret because they were operating under cover .
But the officers of the CIA do it because they love this country .
We believe in a free and open society , and we deeply believe in upholding the laws and the values of this society .
That ’s why we defend it , so that , in the words of my immigrant father , we can pass those values on to our children .
Mr. President , when you asked me to take this job , you made clear that you wanted honest , direct and straightforward assessments .
I ’ve tried to do that , and will continue to do so .
In that spirit , let me make some important points to the people of America .
First of all , the CIA of today will implement our mission under the guidelines that you have established for detention and interrogation .
I share your beliefs , and make clear that this agency will operate under your executive orders .
We believe that we can fully protect this nation and our values at the same time , and we are doing exactly that .
Second , we are a nation at war .
You ’ve made clear that the core goal of the United States must be , and I quote , " to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies , " unquote .
That is and must be our primary mission .
As a former member of Congress , like you , I understand and appreciate the role of the legislative branch in reviewing what happened to , hopefully , learn the lessons from the past .
And I have made clear that we will fully cooperate with these efforts .
But as you have said , this is a time for reflection , not retribution .
We must be careful not to spend so much time and energy in laying blame for the past that it interferes with our ability to focus on the fundamental mission we have for today and for tomorrow , that of defeating our enemy and keeping our nation safe .
And lastly , as Director , I believe we have an opportunity for the CIA to begin a new and great chapter in our history of service to the nation .
You have made clear your loyalty and support for our mission and for our employees , and for that , I thank you deeply .
In return , I want you to know that you have our full loyalty and support in your efforts to protect America .
Mr. President , again , thank you very much for joining us today .
We are greatly honored to have you .
Ladies and gentlemen of the CIA , I am proud to introduce the President of the United States .
( Cheers , applause . )
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Thank you , everybody .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you , everybody .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , thanks — thank you for the extraordinary welcome .
And thanks for those of you who prepared , from the CIA gift shop , the t- shirts — ( laughter ) — the caps , the water bottles .
( Laughter . )
Michelle and the girls will appreciate that very much .
( Laughter . )
It is a great honor to be here with the men and women of the CIA .
I ’ve been eager to come out here to Langley for some time so I can deliver a simple message to you in person on behalf of the American people :
Thank you .
Thank you for all the work that you do to protect the American people and the freedom that we all cherish .
The CIA is fundamental to America ’s national security .
And I want you to know that that ’s why I nominated such an outstanding public servant and close friend , Leon Panetta , to lead — to lead the agency .
He is one of our nation ’s finest public servants .
He has my complete confidence .
And he is a strong voice in my national security team , as well as a strong advocate for the men and women of the CIA .
I also benefit from the counsel of several agency veterans — chief among them , Steve Kappes , who ’s stayed on to serve as Leon ’s deputy .
He ’s — and he ’s done outstanding work .
( Applause . )
I have to add , just as an aside , by the way , I just met with a smaller group of about 50 , so we could have a dialogue .
And all of you look really young .
( Laughter . )
And so to have a graybeard literally and figuratively like Steve Kappes here , I think , is absolutely critical .
I also want you to know that we have one of your own , John Brennan , who is doing a terrific job as my adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security .
And we are very grateful for the work that he does and the insights that he brings , from his long years of service here at the CIA .
And I would be remiss if I did n’t mention the extraordinary former CIA officer and Director of Central Intelligence , Bob Gates , who is also part of our Cabinet and every once in a while gives me a few tips .
( Applause . )
So let me share with you just a few thoughts about the situation in which we find ourselves .
First , I want to underscore the importance of the CIA .
When the CIA was founded , you were focused on one overarching threat , the Soviet Union .
And for decades , the CIA carried out a critically important mission .
And with the end of the Cold War , some wondered how important the CIA would be to our future .
Now we know .
Here in the 21st century , we ’ve learned that the CIA is more important than ever .
For as Leon mentioned , we face a wide range of unconventional challenges : stateless terrorist networks like al - Qaeda , the spread of catastrophic weapons , cyberthreats , failed states , rogue regimes , persistent conflict .
And now we have to add to our list piracy .
The CIA is unique in the capabilities of collection , analysis and operation that you bring to bear .
So you are an indispensable tool , the tip of the spear in America ’s intelligence mission and our national security .
It is because of you that I can make good decisions .
You prove that the key to good intelligence is not simply technology .
It ’s the quality of the men and women who have signed up to serve .
You ’re on the front lines against unconventional challenges .
You help us understand the world as it is .
You support the work of our troops and our diplomats and law enforcement officers .
You disrupt terrorist plots , and you ’re critical to our efforts to destroy terrorist networks .
You serve capably , courageously , and from here in Virginia to dangerous outposts around the globe , you make enormous sacrifices on our behalf .
So you should be proud of what you do .
Second , you need to know that you ’ve got my full support .
For decades , the American people have counted on you to protect them .
I know that I ’ve come to personally count on your services .
I rely on your reporting and your analysis , which finds its way onto my desk every single day .
And I know you ’ve got a tough job .
I know there ’s no margin for error .
And I know there are endless demands for intelligence .
There is an urgent necessity to collect and analyze information and to work seamlessly with other agencies to act on it .
And — and what makes it tougher is when you succeed , as you so often do , that success usually has to stay secret .
So you do n’t get credit when things go good , but you sure get some blame when things do n’t .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Words indistinct . )
PRESIDENT OBAMA : Now — ( laughter ) — I got an amen corner out there .
( Laughter , scattered applause . )
Now , in that context , I know that the last few days have been difficult .
As I made clear , in releasing the OLC memos as a consequence of a court case that was pending and to which it was very difficult for us to mount an effective legal defense , I acted primarily because of the exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos , particularly the fact that so much of the information was public — had been publicly acknowledged .
The covert nature of the information had been compromised .
I have fought to protect the integrity of classified information in the past , and I will do so in the future .
And there is nothing more important than protecting the identities of CIA officers .
So I need everybody to be clear : we will protect your identities and your security as you vigorously pursue your missions .
I will be as vigorous in protecting you as you are vigorous in protecting the American people .
Now , I have put an end to the interrogation techniques described in those OLC memos .
And I want to — I want to be very clear and very blunt .
I ’ve done so for a simple reason : because I believe that our nation is stronger and more secure when we deploy the full measure of both our power and the power of our values , including the rule of law .
I know I can count on you to do exactly that .
You know , there have been some conversations that I ’ve had with senior folks here at Langley in which I think people have expressed understandable anxiety and concern .
So I — I — I want to make a point that I just made in the smaller group .
I understand that it ’s hard when you are asked to protect the American people against people who have no scruples and would willingly and gladly kill innocents .
Al - Qaeda ’s not constrained by a constitution .
Many of our adversaries are not constrained by a belief in freedom of speech or representation in court or rule of law .
So I ’m sure that sometimes it seems as if that means we ’re operating with one hand tied behind our back or that those who would argue for a higher standard are naive .
I understand that .
You know , I ’ve — I watch the cable shows once in a while .
What makes the United States special , and what makes you special , is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and ideals even when it ’s hard — not just when it ’s easy ; even when we are afraid and under threat — not just when it ’s expedient to do so .
That ’s what makes us different .
So yes , you ’ve got a harder job .
And so do I .
And that ’s okay , because that ’s why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans .
And over the long term , that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies : because we ’re on the better side of history .
So do n’t be discouraged by what ’s happened in the last few weeks .
Do n’t be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we ’ve made some mistakes .
That ’s how we learn .
But the fact that we are willing to acknowledge them and then move forward , that is precisely why I am proud to be President of the United States , and that ’s why you should be proud to be members of the CIA .
( Applause . )
All right ?
Third point — third point — I want you to know how much the American people appreciate your service .
Sometimes it ’s hard to acknowledge sacrifices made by the people whose work , or even identity , must remain secret , and that ’s part of the enormous burden that you carry when you sign up .
But you make the extraordinary sacrifice of giving up parts of your life in service to your country .
Many of you take long deployments overseas .
You miss seeing your families ; you miss weekend barbecues and the birthday parties , watching your children grow up .
You ca n’t even exchange in the simplest pleasures of talking about your job — or complaining about your job openly .
( Laughter . )
There are few signs of patriotism more powerful than offering to serve out of the limelight , and so many of you have signed up to serve after 9/11 — that ’s partly why you ’re all so young — fully aware of the dangers before you .
You serve courageously , but your courage is only known to a few .
You accomplish remarkable things , but the credit you receive is the private knowledge that you ’ve done something to secure this country .
That ’s a sacrifice that ’s carved into those marble walls .
Those 89 stars stand as a testament to both the men and women of the CIA who gave their lives in service to their country , and to all who dedicate themselves to the mission of this agency .
Now we must look forward to the future with confidence .
All that you ’ve achieved , I believe that the CIA ’s best days are still yet to come .
And you will have my support and appreciation as you carry on this critical work .
We live in dangerous times .
I am going to need you more than ever , precisely because we ’re seeing changes in our foreign policy , and we want to send a new message to the world .
That requires better intelligence , not less of it .
That means that we ’re going to have to operate smarter and more effectively than ever .
So I ’m going to be relying on you , and the American people are going to rely on you .
And I hope that you will continue to take extraordinary pride in the challenges that come with the job .
Thank you very much .
God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .
( Applause . )
Editor 's note : Ed Rollins , a senior political contributor for CNN , is Senior Presidential Fellow at the Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University .
He was White House political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Ed Rollins says the GOP should n't go to war over the Sotomayor nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Almost everybody cheers for the underdog -- maybe not those born to upper - class standing with great advantages , but those of us who were n't always want the little guy to be victorious .
We want hard work and extra effort to be rewarded .
Standing at the front of the East Room of the White House Tuesday morning were two Americans who clearly had started life as underdogs .
One is now our president , son of a Kenyan .
The other is the daughter of Puerto Rican parents who is about to sit on the highest court in the land .
Both were born without privilege .
Both were raised in households with little cash , but much love .
Both were raised by strong , devoted mothers who worked hard to support them .
Both were encouraged that through hard work and education they could go beyond the boundaries of their environment and their class .
Somehow the flame of ambition was lit and both became outstanding students who did n't need affirmative action programs to get to the top of their class .
Both are extraordinary role models for the next generation of Americans and both will be historic figures .
And the important thing is that both President Obama and Judge Sonia Sotomayor never forgot where they came from or the people who helped them move forward to such heights .
It was a day to make all Americans proud .
Now we begin a process that might not make Americans proud .
The Senate confirmation hearings for Sotomayor will begin in the coming weeks and already the long knives are out .
The historic role of the Senate to advise and consent to a president 's judicial nominations has become in the last few years a process of " attack and condemn . "
Unfortunately , the battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party that has raged for the last several weeks is now spilling over into the debate over Sotomayor 's ideology and judicial temperament .
The challenge has been laid down by conservative commentators that " if not now , when ! "
The terms " radical liberal " and " reverse racist " are being bantered about , with more to come .
Those who have not been able to lay a glove on President Obama , with his 60 percent - plus approval ratings , now think they can define him by smearing Sotomayor .
For a political party that lost an election just six months ago by 9 ½ million votes , the second largest vote margin of defeat ever for a Republican presidential candidate , you would think we would shut our mouths and figure out how to get more votes in the future .
But instead we have gotten into a raging debate over the purity of the party and who 's a better Republican .
Dick Cheney , Colin Powell , Tom Ridge , Karl Rove , Rush Limbaugh and even Meghan McCain have had their say along with the new party chairman , Michael Steele .
But a political party is not a religion .
We do n't get up every weekend and go to our church or synagogue or mosque or wherever else we might practice our beliefs and pay homage to the great tenets of the Republican Party , or the Democratic Party for that matter .
Of all the things that are important to me , I do n't get up every morning and say first and foremost I 've got to go out and be a good Republican today and spread the gospel and beat up on President Obama and the wretched Democrats .
Like most Americans , I wake up every day and think about my wife , my daughter , my friends , my neighbors , my job and go to work .
I worry about my favorite sports teams and whether they won or lost .
I do think of myself as an American and thank the almighty that I have that privilege .
And as an American , I do worry about the direction of my country and the decisions made by our elected leaders .
That is where political parties matter .
Political parties are vehicles to help elect people to office .
Elected officials are the name of the game .
And what people do when they are elected is what matters to most Americans .
Here is where the conduct of the Republican Senators will have a big impact on the future of this party in this crucial rebuilding period .
Sotomayor will have a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court .
Senators , both Democrats and Republicans , have a right and an obligation to question her and get to know her views .
But they must treat her with the respect she deserves and has earned .
Let me state that I am sure Sotomayor and I do n't agree on very much .
And I am sure some of her liberal rulings will drive me nuts .
But President Obama won , is a liberal and gets to put liberals on the court .
That 's the way it works .
Ideology aside , is she qualified ?
There can be no debate over her qualifications .
Her lifetime achievements in the academic world , in the legal world and the judicial world are unchallengeable .
If that was the only measure , she would be confirmed unanimously .
That is n't going to happen !
We are into full - bore political battle within the Republican Party , with conservatives and pragmatists arguing over what are the best tactics to stop the direction that this young president and his congressional allies are taking us .
But I just offer a word of caution .
The confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor is not the battle to be waged and it wo n't be won .
No one should be brutalized like Judge Robert Bork was in the 1980s .
And no one should be rubber - stamped either .
Sotomayor is not deserving to be on the Supreme Court because she is Puerto Rican or a woman .
She has been appointed by the president because she is extremely well - qualified .
Judge those qualifications fairly and without malice .
To do less will antagonize Hispanic and female voters , two voter groups Republicans must do better with to have any chance of electoral success .
In 1981 when Sandra Day O'Connor was nominated by President Reagan to be the first woman on the court , she was confirmed unanimously .
When Antonin Scalia was nominated , also by President Reagan , he was confirmed 98 - 0 .
He was the first American of Italian descent appointed to the court .
Sotomayor , if confirmed , will be the 111th judge to sit on the court .
One - hundred - six white men , two African - American men and two white women have gone before her .
The appointment of a Hispanic - American is long overdue .
Appointing another woman is critical also .
But she 's there because of her own accomplishments , not her gender or her heritage .
Republicans are in a position where we are the underdogs .
Unfortunately , no one is cheering for us to win .
These nationally televised hearings may be an opportunity for Republican senators to take a step in the right direction .
Do n't treat her like a lady .
Treat her like an extremely qualified American who the president chose to elevate to the nation 's highest court .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins .

From Colditz to D - Day : Amazing aerial images taken by daring Allied pilots on secret missions during World War II
Advertisement
The detail is astonishing .
At first it looks like just another castle surrounded by tiny houses and neat fields .
But zooming in on the courtyard one can see figures milling around .
They are in fact Allied officers being held in the notorious German PoW camp of Colditz and the photograph is one from an archive of aerial photographs taken by airmen - sometimes flying as low as 50ft - during secret reconnaissance missions in World War II .
Until now the pictures have been kept behind closed doors .
But they are revealed to the public for the first time today via the internet amid a painstaking cataloguing process .
Colditz Castle ( circled ) in Saxony , Germany on April 10 , 1945 , just three days before U.S. forces overran the area .
In the close - up on the right , prisoners can be seen milling around in the courtyard of the high security prison
The castle , seen from the ground , which lies close to Leipzig in eastern Germany .
Teams of academics , historians and archaeologists would examine the photos taken
In another image , precise as a hole punch through a sheet of paper , craters surround a Nazi doodlebug factory in an extraordinary photograph showing the devastation wreaked by an Allied bombing raid .
The date is September 2 , 1944 and the place Peenemunde , a village on the Baltic , where the terrifying weapons Adolf Hitler hoped would win the war for Germany were designed and tested .
Others in the collection convey the human suffering experienced amid the fighting , including rare shots of a Nazi slave labour camp and of the landings on D - Day .
Alan Williams , manager of the National Collection of Aerial Photography which houses the photos , said : ' The archive literally shows the world at war . '
Long before the days of Google Earth , the highly skilled airmen who took them flew alone , by day and night , in unarmed Spitfires relying on their wits as they risked their lives to capture the images on their plane - mounted cameras .
Craters surround a site at Peenemunde in Mecklenburg - Vorpommem , Germany on September 2 , 1944 , following an Allied bombing raid on the site where the V weapons were designed and tested
Devastation :

Sometimes their planes were painted pink , as the unusual colour proved very good at hiding the aircraft against a background of low cloud .
For high altitude missions , the planes were painted a dark shade of blue .
But often they still found themselves targeted by anti-aircraft missiles .
Hundreds of them never returned home .
Those that did brought with them photos vital to the war effort .
Expert photographic interpreters studied the pictures using optical instruments such as stereoscopes to view them in 3D to build up detailed information for intelligence reports and models used in military planning for operations such as the D - Day landings .
The ' detective ' teams , who were headquartered in a stately home in Buckinghamshire at RAF Medmenham - MI4's Allied Central Interpretation Unit - included Oxbridge academics , geographers and archaeologists .
Central Caen in Normandy in France on October 2 , 1944 .
While the pilots were all men , a large proportion of interpreters were women , including Winston Churchill 's daughter Sarah Dotted around the fields of Holland , these gliders clustered together formed just a small part of Operation Market Garden in September 1944 - the largest airborne operation ever carried out
While the pilots were all men , a large proportion of interpreters were women , including Winston Churchill 's daughter Sarah .
Other famous names attached to the unit included actor Dirk Bogarde .
Peenemunde was a key strategic site where the doodlebugs - or V1s , as they were called by the Nazis - were built .
The 2,000 lb bombs were pilotless planes powered by a jet motor .
First launched from ski-slope ramps by powered catapults in northern France , they killed more than 6,000 people in south east England .
Winston Churchill ordered Operation Crossbow - a plan to destroy V1 production and launch sites - and some 36,000 tons of bombs were dropped on these targets .
Bridges over the River Mae Klong ( later renamed Kwa Yai in 1960 ) and Tamarkan POW camp , at Tha Ma Kham in Thailand .
The picture was taken by 684 Squadron , Royal Air Force , on January 2 , 1945
The photo of the destruction this caused at Peenemunde comes from the Aerial Reconnaissance Archives ( Tara ) , which contains more than 10 million photographs , including pictures taken by the RAF up to the 1990s and by the Luftwaffe .
The photo of the slave labour camp near Mainz in Germany , taken on June 2 , 1945 , is one of only a handful of images that remain of the factory site because it was dismantled quickly after the war .
Slave labour camps were concentration camps where interned inmates had to do hard physical labour under inhumane conditions and cruel treatment .
This one provided workers for a heavy machinery company .

Laden with vehicles and equipment , ships approach Mulberry B , the harbour created by Allied troops off Arromanches , at Normandy , France .
Floated across the Channel , the harbour was made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour namely piers and roadways
In the photos of Colditz - the high security castle where Allied officers who had repeatedly escaped from other camps were held - prisoners can be seen in the courtyard of the high security prison on April 10 , 1945 , just days before US forces took over the area .
Other images show vehicles disembarking from landing craft on D - Day , and the so - called bridge over the River Kwai , part of the Thai - Burma railway project that cost the lives of thousands of prisoners of war .
Mr Williams said : ' The skill of the photo reconnaissance pilot was incredible - they were among the best pilots in the air force .
' As so many of them lost their lives , the archive has become a memorial to them and the events on the ground they photographed .
' How they could take the photos they did is astonishing .
When you remember they were taken in combat , and often being shot at - it 's astounding . '
All the photos were stored for more than 50 years at Keele University before Tara was moved to Edinburgh last year to join The National Collection of Aerial Photography .
Specialist staff are continuing the lengthy task of researching , cataloguing and digitising the images , which is expected to take many years .
Around 4,000 images from the archive will go online initially with more to be added .
The archive can be viewed at aerial.rcahms.gov.uk

Earlier today we mentioned that Peter LaBarbera was heading up to Maine , but before he left he made time for a check - in with Janet Porter , as did the National Organization for Maine ’s Maggie Gallagher .
LaBarbera explained that he was heading to Maine in order to expose the “ radical agenda ” of groups that are trying to influence the vote on marriage equality andy rally pro-family forces to defeat them to prevent them from brainwashing our children in the public schools .
LaBarbera and Porter urged listeners to donate money to the effort and LaBarbera twice issued a special call for financial assistance for Brian Camenker who is “ in a severe financial pinch right now , ” pleading with listeners to make a donation .
Starting around the 4:00 mark , LaBarbera says he believes they will win in Maine and goes on to compare the fight against marriage equality to the fight against reproductive choice , saying those who oppose the “ homosexual activist agenda ” are on the front lines of the culture war and are standing up against this abomination , comparing homosexuality to child sacrifice and bestiality in the Old Testament and vowing never to back down against those who “ are willing to rob our religious freedom in the name of promoting that perversion in the name of civil rights . ”
LaBarbera was then followed by Maggie Gallagher , who likewise sought to raise money from Porter ’s listeners , though she estimated that NOM would raise nearly $ 10 million this year , and spent most of her time claiming that those a who support marriage equality are “ lying to the people of Maine about what gay marriage means ” :

The charade in NYC and Washington goes on .
There is no question that our government is controlled by the unelected that lurks behind the scenes or are appointed as bureaucrats to run our country .
It was never more evident than when administrations changed last January .
Team A replaced Team B , all of whom just happen to be members of the Council on Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group .
There is no debate .
There is only one plan and that is for one - world government .
These are the Illuminists who will Shepard us into final bondage .
This is what our government is all about today and has been since WWII .
The heart of the elitist control mechanism is the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department .
Control of our country emanates from these two entities .
They control the purse strings of our nation .
They allow us to pay for our own destruction .
This is achieved by taxation and debt .
The system in place has been used for centuries to keep control over people .
The elitists want total power over us and all the inhabitants of the world .
Their plans to bring down the world ’s economic and financial structure is well underway .
The problem is that the public has begun to discover what they are up too via talk radio , the Internet and publications such as the International Forecaster .
That has caused the elitists to accelerate their plans and that has opened the window of opportunity for us .
This is why now it is the appropriate time to pass HR1207 and SB604 , bills to audit and investigate the Federal Reserve .
Once the public discovers what these elitists have been doing to the American people for almost a century , they will disband the Fed and turn its job of monetary policy back to the Treasury where it was placed by our Constitution .
This way we will have control and transparency .
The next step will be to close the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington .
t has been two years since the beginning of the credit crisis and the breakdown of our economic and financial structure .
The plan by the elitists since then has been to keep the system functioning as long as possible so that they can continue their massive frauds and corruption ; or until the time is ripe to allow the system to collapse .
These plans are ably assisted by 95 % of our House and Senate who are bought and paid for .
The corruption is so widespread that investigations do not take place and the guilty are protected and at worst pay a fine .
Due to these machinations the America we have known is gone .
Our country is run by thugs in $ 3,000 suits with Ivy League degrees .
Most Americans do not understand what is going on or do n’t care to know .
Most are ill - educated and do not really and a chance of comprehending what is going on .
That is compounded by drugs and alcohol and a steady stream of media propaganda and brainwashing produced by NYC and Washington .
Our daughter teaches the fourth grade and 20 of 23 students are not passing .
They are split three ways : white , black and Spanish speaking .
Then there is no ‘ Child Left Behind , ’ which will make sure they pass summer school and when they graduate they will be functionally illiterate .
It does n’t get much worse than this .
When we went to school one or maybe two out of 30 would n’t pass and they were kept back for a year .
It is outrageous .
They spend all their time studying for federal government mandated tests , and learn little else .
Our three grandchildren read one to four extra books a week and fortunately really excel in their studies .
It can be done , but it takes lots of work and dedication something that most parents do not have time for .
This in part is what is responsible for America ’s failure and lack of leadership .
Leadership , which is totally in the hands of the wealthy Illuminists .
If it is any consolation the rest of the world is n’t doing much better .
The geniuses , the masters of the universe , have a broken system .
This time the system they have deliberately destroyed cannot be resurrected .
Due to talk radio , the Internet and publications such as the IF they had to accelerate their program for on - world government and they are scrambling , hoping they ’ll be successful , and unscathed .
We will make sure they ’ll be no chance of that .
As a result of these machinations America is at the mercy of its creditors and for all intents and purposes is bankrupt .
The only thing left holding America together is its imperial armies that eventually will collapse for lack of funding .
Foreigners are not going to stand for monetization indefinitely .
Yes , the players know the system has failed , and some have already broken ranks .
If they had not Forex assets in sovereign reserves would not have fallen from 64.5 % to 62.8 % over the past nine months , as proof of that .
We have told you where we have been headed over and over again for more than ten years and we have been almost totally right unfortunately .
If we do not stop these monsters we and our ancestors will live in bondage for ever .
That is why passage of HR1207 and SB604 are so important .
We have to drive a stake through the heart of the Illuminist machine .
That heart is the Fed .
If we are unsuccessful we are doomed to chaos and perhaps revolution .
Americans had best wake up and snap out of denial .
Most analysts try to figure out what others within the financial and economic sphere are doing .
Unfortunately they are burdened by playing within the system .
They can not see what is really going on because for one reason or another they are forced to frame their results within the inner sanctum of the Illuminists .
This is the cover that is used for deliberately destroying nations .
These ideas cannot simply be avoided .
You would think reading history that all these brilliant people would n’t be deceived , but they have been .
Every time , what they are doing has been tried , has been a failure .
Deliberate collapses , destroyed currencies , social chaos and revolution .
During the French Revolution 300,000 people such as these lost their heads .
Perhaps this time it will be 3 million .
Inflation can only be controlled by deflation and deflation is totally uncontrollable .
Misguided is n’t the word for it .
Smug and arrogant they ’ll again be proven wrong and unfortunately we will all pay a terrible price .
The progenitors of this false economic policy , Keynesianism , have brought the distortion of price mechanisms , created unlimited opportunities for speculation and they have thrown all discipline to the wind .
This is the basis for our current Federal Reserve System , which is the engine for such a philosophy .
As a result of this policy we will be entering hyperinflation next year and the dollar will continue to fall in value .
Even though gold and silver are suppressed , gold hit a new high this past week .
The CRB index did as well with oil leading the way .
This is all a manifestation of coming hyperinflation and a falling dollar .
The Keynesians are pumping the money supply and monetizing domestic and foreign debt at a wild pace .
The deflationary undertow continues strong as residential and commercial property prices continue their decent .
The final impact is still two or more years away .
There are few financial reports that do not include bogus accounting .
The FASB changed the rules last year and allowed mark - to - model accounting .
Let ’s see if they reinstate mark - to - market January 1st .
The Basel Accords have been simply ignored and no one discusses them .
Exclusive of present on and off balance sheet losses , banks are going to get hit with more residential foreclosure losses and they will be hit by 35 % more commercial losses over the next two years .
If nothing else the banks cannot refinance perfectly good loans because they do not have the funds to do so .
The big question for the banks is will the government perpetuate this fraud ?
We do not know , but we rather think they may for the good of the country .
If fraud continues it will be for the benefit of Illuminists who run the banks , brokerage houses , insurance companies and transnational conglomerates .
Either way again all they are doing is buying time ; the end result will be the same .
The banking , brokerage and insurance businesses are still broke .
Nothing has been done to fix the underlying problem .
There have been no structural changes , just the same old criminality .
Any changes are patchwork for the public .
Stimulus packages , home loan modification and $ 250 checks for seniors who will not get a COLA increase for the next three years .
It is like the mad hatter has been set loose .
Where are the tariffs on goods and services we so desperately need to bring production and jobs back from the third world ?
Without them everything else is futile .
Offshore tax - free earnings , now some $ 1.3 trillion , are too juicy for the Illuminists to give up .
Then again , what better way to destroy an economy , as we wrote in 1967 in the American Mercury ?
Then there is the outrageous scam of terrorism and mindless , endless war to again fill the coffers of the Illuminists and rid the world of useless eaters .
Monetization only makes matters much worse , as we shall see when hyperinflation revisits us next year .
In this process the dollar is allowed to collapse and it was planned that way .
Borrowers have sold more than $ 1 trillion in US corporate bonds in 2009 , the fastest pace on record .
Citigroup and General Electric were the year ’s biggest issuers .
Sales compare with $ 873.2 billion in all of 2008 , and $ 1.17 trillion for 2007 , the biggest year for bond sales .
The record rally in the price of loans owed by the riskiest corporate borrowers may end a two - year drought in leveraged buyouts .
Banks provided almost $ 7.5 billion of high - yield loans in the U.S. and Europe since July 1 to finance acquisitions , more than double the amount in the three months ended June 30 and more than four times the figure in the first quarter .
Central banks flush with record reserves are increasingly snubbing dollars in favor of euros and yen , further pressuring the greenback after its biggest two - quarter rout in almost two decades .
Policy makers boosted foreign currency holdings by $ 413 billion last quarter , the most since at least 2003 , to $ 7.3 trillion .
Nations reporting currency breakdowns put 63 % of the new cash into euros and yen in April , May and June , the latest Barclays Capital data show .
That ’s the highest percentage in any quarter with more than an $ 80 billion increase .
World leaders are acting on threats to dump the dollar while the Obama administration shows a willingness to tolerate a weaker currency in an effort to boost exports and the economy .
The diversification signals that the currency wo n’t rebound anytime soon after losing 10.3 % on a trade - weighted basis the past six months , the biggest drop since 1991 .
US foreclosure filings climbed to a record in the third quarter according to RealtyTrac Inc .
A total of 937,840 homes received a default or auction notice or were repossessed by banks , a 23 % increase from a year earlier .
The Chicago Transit Authority proposed service cuts and boosting some bus and train fares 33 % to close a $ 300 million budget gap prompted by pension obligations and the weak economy .
The volume of delinquent commercial mortgages jumped sevenfold last month as borrowers who got loans with lax terms fail to make debt payments amid sinking real estate values , according to Credit Suisse Group AG .
In September , installments on $ 22.4 billion of mortgages were at least 60 days late , up from $ 3.2 billion a year earlier .
The delinquency rate rose 33 bps to 3.34 % .
Even as the economy continues to struggle , much of Wall Street is minting money — and looking forward again to hefty bonuses .
Many Americans wonder how this can possibly be .
How can some banks be prospering so soon after a financial collapse , even as legions of people worry about losing their jobs and their homes ?
It may come as a surprise that one of the most powerful forces driving the resurgence on Wall Street is not the banks but Washington .
Many of the steps that policy makers took last year to stabilize the financial system — reducing interest rates to near zero , bolstering big banks with taxpayer money , guaranteeing billions of dollars of financial institutions ’ debts — helped set the stage for this new era of Wall Street wealth .
You ca n’t make up stuff like this !
Facing jeers over outlandish pay , the CEO of Goldman Sachs stresses the social goods of his firm 's business .
Blankfein , speaking at a breakfast conversation hosted by Fortune , emphasized that the investment firm serves " an important social purpose " by channeling pools of money held by pension funds and others to companies and governments around the world …
But Blankfein said principal trading -- trades the firm makes for its own account -- makes up just a small fraction of Goldman 's profits .
[ Perhaps Blankfein needs remedial math . ]
How can Blankfein make such an absurd claim when in the last quarter $ 10B of Goldie ’s $ 12.4B in revenue came from trading ?
Obviously Blankfein believes people are stupid given his statement that Goldies principal trading makes up a small fraction of Goldie ’s profits .
What a crock !
And Al Capone used to run soup kitchens .
Borrow from the Federal Reserve at zero and lend to Treasury for a profit .
That 's some racket .
The banks have no incentive to lend .
Most of them still have a significant amount of bad loans sitting on their books that they do n't want to recognize as nonperforming .
If the banks recognize these bad loans , all the write - offs may force them into bankruptcy .
Instead , they hope that over time renegotiated loan terms will eventually allow the borrowers to make their payments .
This ordeal could last at least a decade if this cycle is similar to other crises , like Japan 's lost decade of the 1990s … banks can earn a huge spread by borrowing virtually unlimited amounts for nothing and lending that same money back to the Treasury .

It seems respectable Republicans who like to think of themselves as " intellectual " conservatives are growing dismayed at the living , breathing monster they themselves have unleashed upon us :
Such insiders point to theories running rampant on the Internet , such as the idea that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and is thus ineligible to be president , or that he is a communist , or that his allies want to set up Nazi - like detention camps for political opponents .
Those theories , the insiders say , have stoked the GOP base and have created a " purist " climate in which a figure such as Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) is lionized for his " You lie ! " outburst last week when Obama addressed Congress .
They are " wild accusations and the paranoid delusions coming from the fever swamps , " said David Frum , a conservative author and speechwriter for President George W. Bush who is among the more vocal critics of the party base and of the conservative talk show hosts helping to fan the unrest .
" Like all conservatives , I am concerned about this administration 's accumulation of economic power , " Frum said .
" Still , you have to be aware that there 's a line where legitimate concerns begin to collapse into paranoid fantasy . "
Frum and other establishment Republicans have spoken out in recent days against the influence of what they view as their party 's fringe elements .
Some are pressuring the Republican National Committee and other mainstream GOP groups to cut ties with WorldNetDaily.com , which reports some of the allegations .
Its articles are cited by websites and pundits on the right .
More than any other group , critics say , WorldNetDaily sets the conservative fringe agenda .
Well , as observed last week , getting unentwined from the liked of WorldNetDaily and its extremist clientele is easier said than done .
No , the right - wing populist beast is loose .
You fellas have the right idea , but you 're a bit late .
We 're already well into the great thrashing about that comes with any set of death throes , such as those now besetting movement conservatism .
You can see how it plays out on the ground now , particularly at the Tea Parties .
And it is n't pretty .
A camera crew from Free Speech Radio showed up in D.C. on Saturday for the big GlennBeckFest .
It was frightening and disturbing and even got ugly .
The reporter , Leigh Ann Caldwell , describes what happened :
We met a group of nearly a dozen " 912ers . "
They adorned t- shirts with the fractured Revolutionary War snake , the symbol of their group created by Glenn Beck .
At the end of the 10 - minute interview , they demanded my contact information and a picture so they could " find " me if they did n't like our work .
I took that as a threat , declined to give them my contact information and walked away .
They followed and continued with their demands .
I continued to decline .
One of the women then yelled into her megaphone that " the woman in the black shirt works for ACORN . "
She commanded the crowd to take my picture .
They found out my last name from a previous interviewee , so she then yelled my full name into the megaphone and nearly 50 people surrounded and swarmed me , putting cameras in my face as they heckled and laughed .
The crowd then followed me down Pennsylvania Avenue for the next ten minutes .
Robin Bell , the cameraman , posted that and other videos at his channel at YouTube .
I hope everyone took note of what color those T - shirts were .
Please tell me that was just an accident .
Because the behavior sure did remind of people in that color of shirt .
Nice earthy brown .
And dontcha love how the self - importance - inflating numbers -- the teabagging shouter ends by saying she was with 2 million great Americans that day -- have already become embedded reality for them .
These are true fanatics .
( The numbers , in reality , were closer to 60,000 . )
Michael Shaw found some images from the 912 event along the same lines , with a touch of death wish thrown in for good measure .
We wish Frum and his sane conservative friends lots of luck rescuing their movement from the flood of wingnuttery washing away their lovely intellectual - right edifice .
But let 's face it , fellas -- it was made out of sand in the first place .
These are the natural consequences of that fact .
It does n't only look beautiful , and it would make Jon Ive and Steve Jobs wet , but this naked Coca - Cola can would help save energy while reducing air and water pollution .
Would it really make a difference ?
Let 's do some math :
I assume the consumption only increases through time , but let 's take the daily 2007 numbers from Global INForM Cases Sales database :
The total number of Coca - Cola cans sold per worldwide is 67,873,309 .
Diet Coke and Coke Zero sold 35,387,241 , while My Coke sold 103,260,550 .
Yes , that 's all per day .
Advertisement
So using only classic Coca - Cola 's daily sales figures , that means 24,773,757,785 are sold every year .
Twenty - four billion cans .
That is indeed a lot of paint and paint removal products .
Because this does n't only affect the production .
It also affects the recycling process , eliminating one step :
The naked can help to reduce air and water pollution occurred in its coloring process .
It also reduces energy and effort to separate toxic color paint from aluminum in recycling process .
Huge amount of energy and paint required to manufacture colored cans will be saved .
Instead of toxic paint , manufacturers process aluminum with a pressing machine that indicates brand identity on surface .
Advertisement
Sounds good to me , and it even looks better if you take into account all kinds of Coke .
That brings up the number to 75,380,201,500 cans .
I do n't know how much paint that represents , but I 'm guessing quite a few thousand tons .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed an environmental exemption bill Thursday that will clear the way for construction of the LA Stadium .
State senators approved the bill , which would nullify a lawsuit over the project 's environmental impact report by citizens in neighboring Walnut .
Schwarzenegger signed the bill in support of the stadium because its impact on the local economy and its ability to generate jobs .
He delivered his signature Thursday in Industry .
There will be more than 6,700 new jobs created because of the stadium , causing an addition $ 21 million in new tax revenue and $ 762 million in new economic activity , said LA Stadium spokesperson .
Schwarzenegger hopes developer Majestic Realty Co. , the driving company behind the project , does n't poach any California teams to play in the proposed venue .
They have indicated their plan to approach seven teams in hopes of luring one to LA .
The list includes the three California teams : San Diego Chargers , Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers .
Many residents hope to see quality professional football played in LA in the next couple of years , which just might narrow down the list of seven potentials and maybe even make the governor happy .
LIVE REVIEW : Land Of Talk at Spaceland , Thursday , October 29 , 2009
Due to heavy pre-Halloween traffic en route to Origami Records and an inexplicably stupid entry policy at the Bootleg Theatre , I managed to miss both L.A. performances by The Antlers last Thursday night .
Lucky me , because that left a slot open on my dance card for Montreal ’s Land Of Talk , who were playing at Spaceland that same evening .
Land Of
Talk appears to have more going for them that any indie band could hope for : their last full - length album was produced in part by shit - hot Justin Vernon of Bon Iver fame , and was released in the States by Conor Oberst ’s shit - hot Saddle Creek label .
If that were n’t enough , singer Elizabeth Powell has done time as the female touring voice of shit - hot Broken Social Scene , joining the likes of shit - hot Amy Milan , Leslie Feist and Emily Haines .
And in case you missed it the first time – Land Of Talk is from shit - hot Montreal .
With all that lather on them , it was surprising to find a less than half - filled room awaiting Land Of Talk ’s performance shortly before midnight .
Whether or not the rest of L.A. ’s indie music fans had committed to one of the aforementioned events by The Antlers or the first of two nights by Built To Spill , or something else altogether , they sure as hell were n’t at Spaceland .
No matter , there was all that much more of Land Of Talk for those in attendance to enjoy .
Helmed by Powell – a former jazz student — Land Of Talk live is essentially a trio suffering through an identity crisis .
The same way a schizophrenic with multiple personality disorder assumes various identities , which – no matter how disparate , are all of that person — a Land Of Talk show will find you being ushered through a slice of winsome pop that recalls The Sundays ’ Harriet
Wheeler one moment and then ensconced in a frenzied inferno a la toenut .
the next .
It ’s that manic - but - cohesive combination of pop sensibility melded with serious musical chops that puts LOT in a category all their own , justifiably immune to any comparisons with their geographically aligned colleagues Arcade Fire , The Dears , Stars or The Stills ( none of whom should be compared to each other anyway ) .
Put plainly , in the Land Of Talk , there are n’t any rules that say good songwriting must be restricted by musical simplicity .
It was momentarily concerning that “ Some Are Lakes ” – the sunny , summer -y pop gem that aired off LOT ’s 2008 LP of the same name – arrived early in the set , as it is as close to anything the group has to an readily identifiable pop culture toehold .
But any wonder whether that song ’s appearance heralded an early peak to the night was quelled the moment Powell and company invited their tour manager / merch seller / van driver on stage to fill in on bass while bandmember Joe Yarmush slid over to man guitar , keys and other miscellany — setting the stage for Land Of Talk + 1 to blister through material from their latest release , the Fun and Laughter EP , including the stellar “ Sixteen Asterisk ” and “ May You Never . ”
While LOT ’s smart songwriting could live many lives on its own , it ’s with drummer Andrew Barr ’s contributions that the group arrives at something completely combustible and unique .
As a vocalist , Powell never comes across as anything less than sincere , but it ’s Barr ’s punctuation , quite literally , that cements her messages as more than anchorless fancy .
For all her toil onstage with her high - strapped guitar and theatrical bluster , the risks she shares with Yarmush would be a bit much to take without the framework Barr provides for them on which to stretch their fabric .
Whether bombastic or mellow , Land Of Talk collectively delivers compositions that simply exceed the service of the instruments creating them .
Just as Powell is never merely singing her way through a song for the sake of it , Barr is always doing more than just keeping the beat .
Again , not your average indie fare , and delightfully so .
But there ’s really no point to trying to dissect what LOT is or how it works and why .
By the end of the night , it was apparent that the appeal of LOT has little to do with complexity and everything to do with connectivity .
Powell has a gift of expressing herself – her yearnings , disappointments , celebrations – in a way that resonates in tandem with the music she and her bandmates play .
Land Of
Talk never leaves the impression that their songs are mere constructs of words on top of music ; instead , each song comes across as a very specific emotional delivery mechanism .
Whatever the case , know that what LOT does , they do well and did it exceptionally on Thursday night , despite that so few were there to receive their performance .
There was a mutual appreciation between artist and audience from the get - go ( Powell kept thanking them for coming out on a “ Tuesday night , ” very clearly suffering from Where The Hell Am I? Road Syndrome ) which made for a blessed marriage .
As she gave , the crowd gave in return , and so on until the conclusion of the show arrived like a pot boiling over with goodwill .
Even after an encore vaguely sated the show ’s handful of attendees , it was clear from the smiles on their impassioned faces that they did n’t care if anyone else in L.A. turned out to the event or not .
In fact , they probably preferred that less people came , if only so Land Of Talk can remain their little secret for just a little while longer .

BBC Ireland correspondent
The weight of public opinion is against continued violence in Northern Ireland but dissident republicans seem more determined than ever to kill .
They 've been labelled gangsters , criminals and psychopaths .
Widows have pleaded with them to stop bombing and shooting .
The Real IRA is one of three main dissident groups However , the dissidents are unmoved .
They live by the gun , and cling to the old republican belief that " Ireland unfree shall never be at peace " .
Throughout Northern Ireland 's 88 - year history , there 's always been a hostile republican grouping , in some guise .
First it was the IRA , then the Provisional IRA .
Now there 's the Continuity IRA , the Real IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann .
They 've all had the same aim - to kill their way to a united Ireland .
The dissident groups are very small .
In total , they are estimated to have about 300 members , only a fraction of what the Provisional IRA used to have .
They have no overall command structure and , crucially , they do n't have a large stockpile of weapons , and a supply chain from Libya .
Distasteful though it is to talk about a killing rate , the dissidents have killed three people this year , whereas the IRA used to kill more than 50 people a year .
That cold statistic shows the difference in their capacity .
But in recent months , a small number of former members of the Provisionals have joined the dissident ranks .
Why ?
They have either become disillusioned with the peace process , or simply missed the kicks they got from a life of violence .
Young , unemployed teenagers have also been recruited in towns like Lurgan and Strabane .
A policeman 's partner was injured in this bomb attack
At the weekend , there were attacks in Belfast and County Fermanagh .
It proved that they have small units in various parts of Northern Ireland .
The dissidents are telling young people that politics does n't work - violence does .
Groups like the Real IRA would like nothing better than to see the power - sharing executive at Stormont fall apart .
They could get their wish in the coming months - the relationship between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists is dangerously close to breaking point .
But the weekend violence has concentrated minds at Stormont .
The parties realise the negative signal which would be sent out by a political breakdown , and , crucially , so do the governments in London and Dublin .
It seems the British and Irish prime ministers may soon become involved in another rescue act .

The price of gold is surging on world markets amid fears that the old economic order based on the supremacy of the US dollar could be breaking down .
A new spike has sent the cost of the precious metal to a level not seen before .
The dollar slid sharply after yesterday 's report in The Independent that Gulf Arab states are secretly planning to stop trading oil in dollars , and a senior UN official said that the US should be stripped of its position as the main source of currency reserves for other countries .
The developments come on top of speculation that the Obama administration is operating a policy of benign neglect of the dollar , engineering a devaluation that could help repair some of the economic damage caused by the recession .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Not since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 has gold been treated as the equivalent of a world currency , but The Independent reported that it could form part of a basket of currencies that would be used for oil trading by the end of the next decade .
Aram Shishmanian , the chief executive of World Gold Council , said : " The financial and economic instability of the past 18 months has brought gold 's historical role into sharp focus and has continued to increase its prominence among policy advisers , central banks , and investors around the world .
Across the world , investors have been reaching for gold as an alternative to the dollar and to other US assets , fearing that the American currency is headed inexorably lower .
The dollar index – which measures the greenback against other currencies – fell 0.7 per cent yesterday and the dollar was lower against all major currencies except the British pound .
The US government 's debt – which stands at $ 11.86 trillion ( £ 7.45trn ) after tax revenues collapsed with the recession and the Treasury spent billions on propping up the banking system – would be easier to repay if the value of the dollar was lower .
Economists noted that the US resisted pressure to include a promise to protect the stability of world currencies in last weekend 's communiqué from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , sparking growing concern that the Obama administration could be content to see the currency fall .
That would make US exports more competitive and could spark a manufacturing jobs revival .
Overseas governments are in a bind because they hold trillions of dollars as reserves to protect them against a financial crisis .
They are seeing the value of those reserves decline , but starting to swap them for gold or other currencies could deluge world markets with unwanted dollars and send the value of the greenback even lower .
The situation is particularly sensitive for oil - producing nations , who are paid in dollars for their exports and therefore hold high dollar reserves .
Gulf Arabs have begun planning – with China , Russia , Japan and France – to move from dollar dealings for oil to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council , which includes Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar .
Secret meetings have already been held by finance ministers and central bank governors in Russia , China , Japan and Brazil to work on the scheme , which will mean oil will no longer be priced in dollars .
The revelation was met with public denials yesterday .
The Saudi central bank governor , Muhammad al - Jasser , said : " The future is in God 's hands .
Today , the conditions are good for the arrangement we have . "
The Japanese Finance Minister , Hirohisa Fujii , said he " does n't know anything about it " .
Dennis Gartman , the US investment guru who writes the daily Gartman Letter , said that no one should be surprised to hear denials .
" We are certain that spokespeople for every single nation will be brought to the fore to deny that any such meetings have occurred , that no such decisions have been made , that it is not in anyone 's interest to have held such meetings or made such decisions , " he told clients as The Independent story broke .
" The market will care not a whit . "
Simon Johnson , the IMF 's former chief economist , said the countries involved would calculate that it was not in their interests to drive the dollar down by eroding its position as the currency of international commodities trading and central bank reserves .
" It would only be great news for the US .
The US would love a little bit of devaluation , even though they can't say it , " he said .
" They have to pay lip service to the strong dollar policy , but if someone else were to engineer a devaluation , that would be lucky break for the US . "

After Kat68's diary made the rec list yesterday many of us complained to Zazzle & Cafe Press about the inflammatory and dangerous Psalm 109:8 merchandise being sold on their sites .
Both Cafe Press and Zazzle decided yesterday to pull the merchandise .
Cafe Press alerted everyone in an email that did not blind copy us in but gave our email addresses out to everyone involved in the email campaign .
They said :

I went to bed pleased with DKos , pleased with Cafe Press and Zazzle and thinking that what we do here really does make a difference .
I was all warm and fuzzy .
And then , today after lunch , I got this from Cafe Press ( in yet ANOTHER mass email in which no one was bcc'd ) :
Dear Michelle , Thank you for contacting CafePress.com !
Cafepress looks at content on a case by case basis , and makes decisions about what content is permissible based on our content usage policy .

Our site has become a cultural barometer of public opinion and as such designs often come into question .
In managing our content we are trying to protect self expression , while making sure we are not advocating violence .
We initially pulled the Psalm 109:8 content from our products today because broader media dialog indicated that these designs potentially suggested violence towards the president .
Based on current public discourse and further review of the actual content , we have determined that it is fair political commentary and we are in the process of reinstating this merchandise .

I think this is a poor decision on their part and wonder at the reversal .
I suggest we all do what I 've just done , which is delete your Cafe Press account if you have one , and tell them why you are cancelling your account .
My apologies again for the sucky diary but I have to get back to work .
MikeConwell has also posted about this .
Sorry , Mike ... I did not see your diary .
UPDATE : First , thanks for the rec list .
I would also like to point you to MikeConwell 's diary ... he actually posted a diary about this before me .
And kat68 got the ball rolling ( with a little nudge from Rachel Maddow , that is . :)
I have no idea what the legal implications for Cafe Press are , in regards to pulling ( or reinstating ) the merchandise .
I do believe that this kind of crap is probably protected as free speech but that Cafe Press ( and other businesses ) have a moral obligation to look at the whole picture and make the right decision .
It 's very clear to anyone that reads the entire Psalm in context that the right - wing extremists are using this as a call for violence .
At the very least , if they are NOT using it as a call for violence , then the fact of the matter is that there are enough nutjobs out there to construe it as such .
It may very well be legal for Cafe Press to keep selling the merchandise , but I think it 's morally reprehensible and irresponsible to do so .
That 's my opinion and my opinion only and it's why I cancelled my account with them .
UPDATE 2 : Morning , folks .
Pacific NW
Mark alerted us in the comments to the Cafe Press blog , where they have a poll up about this as well as a place you can leave comments .
You can also join the ' Boycott CafePress ' Facebook page here .
UPDATE 3 : Cafe Press has now reversed its decision of its original reversed decision . :-)
Good work guys .
As I said before , it may be legal for them to sell the merchandise but that does n't make it right , and I think we made ourselves clear about why we thought the merchandise was over the top and went far beyond the usually harmless political merchandise we 've grown accustomed to seeing on sites like Cafe Press & Zazzle .
Good on Cafe Press for reversing its decision to reverse its decision .
And thanks to everyone who got this ball rolling ( kat68 and Rachel Maddow for starters ) , and all those who emailed , called and blogged about this .
Hi my name is Donna and I just wanted to drop you a quick note here instead of calling you .
I came to your UPDATE 3 : Psalm 109:8 Merchandise : Cafe Press Reverses

JERUSALEM , Oct 21 ( Reuters ) - Israel should launch its own Gaza war inquiry to avoid the possibility , raised in a U.N. report it rejects , of war crimes charges against its leaders , Israel 's deputy prime minister was quoted on Wednesday as saying .
" A country that investigates itself puts up a roadblock to coming under ( legal ) assault , " Dan Meridor was quoted as saying in an interview in the Haaretz newspaper .
" A commission of inquiry or examination , which I hope will be named , must examine the claims of the Goldstone report . "
The U.N. Human Rights Council singled out Israel for censure in a resolution on Friday while endorsing a report by South African jurist Richard Goldstone which condemned both Israeli and Hamas actions in the war last December and January .
Goldstone 's report recommended the war crimes issue be referred to the U.N. Security Council if the sides failed to conduct credible domestic investigations within six months , and possibly then to the International Criminal Court .
Meridor 's proposal could create tensions for Netanyahu in his coalition government .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak of the left - of - centre Labour Party has said he prefers the army conduct its own internal investigation of the findings .
But other cabinet ministers have suggested they would support any effort to refute Goldstone 's findings , even if it meant naming a new investigation .
A Palestinian rights group said 1,417 Palestinians , including 926 civilians , were killed in the three - week offensive in the Gaza Strip , territory controlled by Hamas Islamists .
Israel has said 709 Palestinian combatants were killed along with 295 civilians and 162 people whose status it was unable to clarify .
Ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians were killed during the campaign , which Israel launched with the declared aim of ending cross - border rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip .
" I have confidence in the ( Israeli ) military and I must defend it .
The most effective tool for defence is a serious self - inquiry , " said Meridor , a lawyer and cabinet veteran whose current job includes overseeing Israeli intelligence services .
Netanyahu has promised a lengthy battle to " delegitimise " Goldstone 's findings and instructed government officials at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to draft proposals for changing international laws of war .

In dangerous , clangorous times , the idea of America rings like a bell ( see King , M. L. , Jr. , and Dylan , Bob ) .
It hits a high note and sustains it without wearing on your nerves .
( If only we all could . )
This was the melody line of the Marshall Plan and it ’s resonating again .
Why ?
Because the world sees that America might just hold the keys to solving the three greatest threats we face on this planet : extreme poverty , extreme ideology and extreme climate change .
The world senses that America , with renewed global support , might be better placed to defeat this axis of extremism with a new model of foreign policy .

It is a strangely unsettling feeling to realize that the largest Navy , the fastest Air Force , the fittest strike force , cannot fully protect us from the ghost that is terrorism ....
Asymmetry is the key word from Kabul to Gaza ....
Might is not right .
I think back to a phone call I got a couple of years ago from Gen. James Jones .
At the time , he was retiring from the top job at NATO ; the idea of a President Obama was a wild flight of the imagination .
General Jones was curious about the work many of us were doing in economic development , and how smarter aid  embodied in initiatives like President George W. Bush ’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation  was beginning to save lives and change the game for many countries .
Remember , this was a moment when America could n’t get its cigarette lighted in polite European nations like Norway ; but even then , in the developing world , the United States was still seen as a positive , even transformative , presence .
The general and I also found ourselves talking about what can happen when the three extremes  poverty , ideology and climate  come together .
We found ourselves discussing the stretch of land that runs across the continent of Africa , just along the creeping sands of the Sahara  an area that includes Sudan and northern Nigeria .
He also agreed that many people did n’t see that the Horn of Africa  the troubled region that encompasses Somalia and Ethiopia  is a classic case of the three extremes becoming an unholy trinity ( I ’m paraphrasing ) and threatening peace and stability around the world .
The military man also offered me an equation .
Stability = security + development .
In an asymmetrical war , he said , the emphasis had to be on making American foreign policy conform to that formula .
Enter Barack Obama .
If that last line still seems like a joke to you ... it may not for long .
Mr. Obama has put together a team of people who believe in this equation .
That includes the general himself , now at the National Security Council ; the vice president , a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ; the Republican defense secretary ; and a secretary of state , someone with a long record of championing the cause of women and girls living in poverty , who is now determined to revolutionize health and agriculture for the world ’s poor .
And it looks like the bipartisan coalition in Congress that accomplished so much in global development over the past eight years is still holding amid rancor on pretty much everything else .
From a development perspective , you could n’t dream up a better dream team to pursue peace in this way , to rebrand America .
Canada has always been portrayed as a country which favors Immigration .
One of the reasons for this may be the aging Canadian workforce that has allowed the country to welcome immigrants from all over the world .
Also , public officials are continuously giving high priority to immigration as the answer to Canada ’s labor needs !
But there are some who believe that other options like postponing the retirement age , enhancing the domestic productivity , amongst others can be explored in order to fight the problem of Canada ’s aging workforce .
Different mouths , different opinions !
What ever might be the case , Canada will never run out of the options as well as the opportunity that it has to offer to its prospective immigrants .
With some of the top Canadian employers like EllisDon Corporation , Bennett Jones LLP , Wellington West Holdings , Inc. , Delta Hotels , Scotiabank and OMERS , and a gamut of job opportunities everywhere , Canada can be a perfect place to work for any ambition - a- holic .
But the fact remains that – till such time that alternative strategies are worked out - Immigration will make key contribution to labor shortages and demographic issues .
Having decided your desired country of Immigration , it would be best to ensure that your application process goes as smooth as it can .
What ’s best than hiring the services of an Immigration and Visa expert and make the entire procedure a cakewalk for you .
Ben Shpigel and David Waldstein provided updates and analysis during Game 5 of the Dodgers - Phillies National League Championship Series .
PHILADELPHIA — Unsatisfied by their last championship and determined to repeat recent history , the Philadelphia Phillies took another step in their quest to win the World Series again .
The Phillies have been in existence since 1883 , the longest tenure of any professional sports team in one city , with one name .
But it took them until Wednesday night to earn a rare distinction .
With an emphatic 10 - 4 victory against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series , the Phillies have now won consecutive National League pennants for the first time in their 126 - year history , and their seventh over all .
It is also the second year in a row the Phillies beat the Dodgers in five games .
Their next appointment is with the winner of the American League Championship Series between the Los Angeles Angels and the Yankees , who lead that series three games to one .
The Phillies relied on the long ball to win this game .
Jayson Werth hit two of them , a three - run homer in the first inning and a solo shot in the seventh .
Shane Victorino added a two - run shot in the sixth , and Pedro Feliz hit a solo home run for the Phillies , who needed only eight hits to score their runs against shaky Dodgers pitching .
The Dodgers issued four walks and hit three batters , and four of those free passes were converted into runs .
The Phillies scored their final run on a wild pitch by Ronald Belisario .
Phillies closer Brad Lidge got the final out as Ronnie Belliard flied out to center fielder Shane Victorino , igniting a celebration both on the field and in the stands , where 46,214 deliriously happy fans , most of whom were wearing red , waved white handkerchiefs and cheered their team ’s return to the World Series as the Dodgers filed quietly into the clubhouse .
The Dodgers had the best record in the National League , but the season came to a disappointing end , particularly for Manager Joe Torre , who has led two teams to 14 consecutive playoff appearances , but has n’t won the World Series since 2000 with the Yankees .
— DW
Victorino just barely missed his second home run .
The ball was ruled a double because of fan interference .
Victorino seemed to have slightly injured something — perhaps his hand — on the swing , but he ’s still in the game .
Rollins just scored the 10th run on a wild pitch .
The Phillies have two more runs than hits .
The entire left - field bleachers were chanting “ Take a shower ” at Ramirez , but surprisingly , he seemed completely oblivious .
— DW
Ryan Madson gets out of the eighth .
That ’s clutch pitching , because three different Dodgers came to the plate with a chance to draw the Dodgers to a run behind with one swing off the bat .
But Loney fouled out , Martin struck out swinging , and Blake grounded into a fielder ’s choice to end the threat .
The Phillies need only three more outs and Brad Lidge is warming up hard in the bullpen .
It ’s not a save situation , but Manuel would love to have Lidge on the mound for the final out and the celebration .
It would be another confidence boost in a nice postseason for the closer , who came into the postseason as a rather large question mark .
— DW
How about this ?
The potential tying run is on deck .
Just minutes after we declared this game over , the Dodgers have the bases loaded with nobody out in the eighth .
Oops , one out as Loney fouls out .
It ’s 9 - 4 and Russell Martin is up with Casey Blake on deck .
Some fans in front of the press box were chanting “ Take a shower ” at Manny Ramirez , who came to the plate with two runners on base in the eighth .
Ramirez walked and Matt Kemp hit an R.B.I. single to center .
— DW
Werth goes deep again .
This time he straightened it out and hit it to center off Hong - Chih Kuo .
It is the seventh home run of the game and only the first to center .
This may not be the most provocative thought written in this space tonight , but suffice it to say this game is over .
The Phillie Phanatic seems to be very confident right now .
It ’s 9 - 3 as we enter the eighth .
— DW
Get those showers ready .
Shane Victorino just launched the first pitch he saw from Clayton Kershaw in the sixth inning to reawaken the crowd and give the Phillies an 8 - 3 lead .
With two outs , Kershaw hit Jimmy Rollins with a pitch — the third Phillie to be hit — and Victorino made him pay .
That ’s the sixth home run of the game .
The first four were to right field .
The last two have been to left .
If the Yankees are indeed the team the Phillies play in the World Series — barring a nearly impossible comeback by the Dodgers , of course — it will be scary to see what the Yankees sluggers can do in this ballpark .
Amazingly , the Phillies have eight runs on only five hits .
Chan Ho Park is pitching for the Phillies in the seventh .
— DW
The pace of this game has slowed .
They ’ve been playing for almost two and a half hours and it ’s only the top of the sixth .
As a result , the atmosphere in the park has quieted considerably , even with the Phillies poised to win the pennant .
Fans are sitting in their seats waiting for things to happen .
They showed a little life just now as Chad Durbin set the Dodgers down in order .
Only nine outs to go .
— DW
Ramirez just hit a weak roller off the handle of his bat and was thrown out at first without much effort .
So the rally dies a weak death .
Ramirez , who took a foul ball off his left shin on the second pitch of the at - bat and was in considerable pain , initially seemed to think the ball he hit fair was in fact foul .
When he realized it was fair , he ran three - quarters speed three quarters of the way down the line as Durbin fielded the ball , then jogged the rest of the way to first .
Ramirez may have been in pain , but it does n’t look good in the face of elimination .
Phillies still lead , 6 - 3 . — DW
A huge at - bat coming up .
Manny Ramirez is coming to the plate as the potential tying run , with Furcal on second and Ronnie Belliard on first with two outs .
Manuel took out the left - hander J.A. Happ and is bringing in the right - hander Chad Durbin .
Manny is 2 for 8 with a home run and three walks against Durbin .
— DW
Interesting move by Charlie Manuel here :
Not that he ’s pulled Hamels — who showed poor body language after giving up the homer to Orlando Hudson and the double to Rafael Furcal — but that he chose the left - hander J.A.
Happ to face a right - handed - heavy top of the Dodgers ’ lineup .
Manuel clearly feels more comfortable with Happ , a rookie , than with the other potential long man , the right - hander Chad Durbin .
— BS
Orlando Hudson , pinch - hitting for Sherrill , just answered the previous question .
If his last at - bat is any indication , the Dodgers are going to battle .
Hudson , whose optimism and positive outlook are generally uncontainable , just curled a 2 - 1 pitch around the foul pole in left .
The Dodgers close the gap to 6 - 3 . — DW
George Sherrill hit Victorino with a pitch on a 3 - 2 count to force in a run .
It ’s now 6 - 2 , Phillies , heading into the fifth .
Padilla was charged with all six runs in just 55 pitches over three - plus innings .
That ’s a run every 9.17 pitches .
Not an enviable ratio .
The question now is , do the Dodgers keep battling , or do they start just hacking away with one foot on that plane back to L.A.? — DW
Not only is Hamels pitching decently , he ’s also handling the bat well here in the fourth .
He just laid down a perfect sacrifice on a 3 - 2 pitch to push Ibanez and Ruiz over to second and third for the next batter , Rollins .
On a 3 - 1 pitch , Hamels squared and then pulled back the bat for a called strike on a slightly high pitch .
He told the plate umpire , Tom Hallion , that he pulled it back , and when he was told that it was a called strike , he did n’t argue .
Hamels wants those pitches called strikes for him , too , especially since the Phillies already have their runs .
Troncoso just hit Jimmy Rollins with a pitch , so the bases are loaded .
Torre ’s bringing in the left - hander George Sherrill .
If Shane Victorino gets a hit , Manny is going straight to the showers .
— DW
The Phillies are piling on .
Raul Ibanez just ripped a double to the gap in right - center , scoring Werth , who had singled to left , to make the score 5 - 2 , and that ’s all for Padilla .
The former Phillie just did n’t have it tonight , and the Dodgers are going to the right - hander Ramon Troncoso .
Padilla received a huge sarcastic cheer as he walked off .
Phillies fans can smell another pennant .
— DW
Clayton Kershaw , the presumed Game 6 starter for the Dodgers , was loosening in the bullpen .
Perhaps that was the motivation Padilla needed because he just recorded his first 1 - 2 - 3 inning .
In fact , it was his first inning without a home run .
Kershaw is sitting down again .
Torre said Tuesday it would be “ all hands on deck , ” baseball ’s terminology for any pitcher being available to pitch out of the bullpen .
Ramirez is leading off the top of the fourth inning .
He looks very clean from here .
— DW
Padilla did it again .
Pedro Feliz just hit the fourth home run of the game , also to right field .
This came after the Dodgers had cut the deficit to one on Loney ’s homer .
Not surprisingly , the Dodgers already have action in their bullpen .
4 - 2 , Phillies . — DW
The Dodgers got one back as James Loney led off the second inning with a solo home run to right , where all three homers have landed .
Funny , no discernible wind in that — or any — direction .
So the Dodgers have two home runs to the Phillies ’ one , but Philadelphia leads , 3 - 2 .
There ’s a perfect demonstration of why walks hurt so much .
When Werth homered , Torre sat motionless in the Dodgers dugout with a very sour expression .
I ’ve definitely seen that look on his face recently .
Oh yes , it was during batting practice , when he was talking to the former Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson .
Nelson always had that effect on Torre . — DW
What ’s the worst thing a pitcher can do after his team stakes him to a lead ?
Give it right back .
Vicente Padilla did that and then some , surrendering a three - run homer to Jayson Werth with two outs in the bottom of the first to make the score 3 - 1 .
Padilla got the first two outs without much problem but then completely lost the strike zone .
He walked Chase Utley and Ryan Howard , and then fell behind on Werth , 3 - 0 , bringing the fans to their feet waving their hankies and chanting “ Beat L.A. ” as if it were the 1984 N.B.A. finals in Boston .
Padilla regained some of his control to get it to a full count , but Werth then sent a 3 - 2 pitch into the stands in right field .
The crowd went crazy .
— DW
The Dodgers look as if they came to play .
Andre Ethier just clubbed a solo home run to give them a 1 - 0 lead and silence the crowd .
Ramirez followed with a single to right , but Hamels struck out Matt Kemp to end the inning .
For Hamels , it was the fourth home run he ’s allowed in the postseason .
— DW
First pitch was 8:07 on the dot and the temperature is a balmy 63 degrees .
Wow , it ’s actually baseball weather .
Hamels is off to a good start , striking out Rafael Furcal .
Ronnie Belliard is up , with Andre Ethier on deck .
Manny Ramirez is taking a bath .
— DW
Preview
PHILADELPHIA —
The Dodgers and the Phillies are about to take the field for Game 5 of the National League Championship Series at Citizens Bank Park , where the pennant could be decided in the next few hours .
There are no surprises in the lineup , as the Dodgers send out the former Phillies right - hander Vicente Padilla , who is looking to forestall a Philadelphia celebration and send the series back to Los Angeles for a Game 6 .
Cole Hamels , the Phillies ’ struggling left - hander , goes for the home team .
Video
The national anthem has been sung , the infield is groomed and ready , and Hamels will throw the first pitch in a matter of moments .
Dodgers Manager Joe Torre is relaxed and ready for the game .
Torre , who once played for The Boss , went to see another Boss , Bruce Springsteen , here in Philadelphia on Tuesday night .
Torre was asked if Springsteen played his song “ No Surrender . ”
“ He did sing ‘ No Surrender , ' ” Torre said , adding : “ ‘ Glory Days , ’ too .
Do n’t forget that . ” — David Waldstein

Jarno Trulli insists Adrian Sutil made an " extremely dangerous " manoeuvre during the Brazilian Grand Prix , as the Italian was still furious about the accident .
The paired crashed at high speed on the opening lap of the Interlagos race , and Trulli blamed the Force India driver for the accident .
After the crash , Trulli ran over to Sutil and had a heated discussion .
The stewards , however , deemed it had been a racing incident , and even fined and reprimanded Trulli for his post - crash behaviour .
Despite that , the Italian insisted Sutil 's driving was very dangerous .
" I am not angry because of the result , I am angry because of the manoeuvre which was extremely , extremely dangerous , " said Trulli .
" We know it is an easy flat out corner , and he should have given me enough space not to go on the kerbs .
We were in sixth gear and we were lucky that no one got injured - but this was something really bad .
He added : " I thought if I could pull away , Sutil would stay there and I was coming with much more speed .
He went on the inside so I went on the outside , and we went side - to - side to him .
There is an onboard camera showing my front wheel next to his wheel , so if you looking at the back then I am not there .
" He might say that he drove on the racing line .
Yes , but I am still on the racing line in this case .
So if you decide to stay on the inside , then stay on the inside .
Do n't pull on the outside because I am there - and you can see him there .
The problem was that he put me over the kerbs - and once I was on the kerbs I lost car control completely .
" And the fact that I hit him on the back is that once I was on the kerbs that car got unstable .
I lifted off and then I hit him on the back - even though at the time I was next to him . "
Trulli said the crash had been the worst of that type he had seen .
" Honestly , yes .
That is why I was so bloody nervous afterwards when I jumped out of the car .
To happen once is a racing accident - we might have a touch or we might bang wheels .
But when someone does it deliberately at that speed , this is crazy .
It is unacceptable .
" You can not do that .
It is like a straight - you are flat , and he basically sent me onto the kerbs and grass when I was on the straight .
I cannot accept any apology , I am sorry .
It is clear to anyone in the paddock that you cannot do that . "
And the Toyota driver claimed his early exit cost him a podium finish .
" I totally agree .
Maybe even fighting for the victory because on Friday I was very quick and very competitive .
I had enough fuel .
The strategy was fine .
The start was good , so I was in the frame honestly to fight for the win .
The car all weekend was very good . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The nation 's tally of 2009 bank casualties hit 99 Friday night when state regulators closed San Joaquin Bank , based in Bakersfield , Calif .
This was the tenth bank to fail in that state .
Customers of San Joaquin Bank are protected , however .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which has insured bank deposits since the Great Depression , currently covers customer accounts up to $ 250,000 .
The Citizens Business Bank in Ontario , Calif . will assume all of San Joaquin Bank's $ 631 million deposits , according to the FDIC .
Citizens also entered into a loss - share agreement with the FDIC on $ 683 million of San Joaquin Bank 's $ 775 million in assets .
The five branches of San Joaquin Bank will reopen on Monday as branches of Citizens Business Bank .
Customers of the failed bank can access their money over the weekend by writing checks or using ATMs or debit cards .
Checks will continue to be processed , and borrowers should make mortgage and loan payments as usual .
The FDIC also said customers should continue to use their existing branch until they receive notice from San Joaquin Bank that the takeover has been completed .
There are about 8,000 banks in the nation , and an average of 10 banks have failed per month this year , nearly four times the number that failed in 2008 .
This is the highest tally since 1992 , when 181 banks failed .
Though 2009 's count is still far from 1989 's record high of 534 bank closures which took place during the savings and loan crisis , the FDIC revealed there are now 416 banks at risk of failing -- the highest level in 15 years .
This year 's failures have reduced the FDIC 's insurance fund to $ 10.4 billion from $ 45 billion a year ago .
Faced with dwindling funds , the FDIC discussed how to raise money to restock the fund last month .
The agency proposed that banks prepay their deposit insurance premiums for the next three years .
Friday 's closure will cost the FDIC an estimated $ 103 million .
The Curse of Autumn '09 continues to haunt the UFC .
Dana
White says that Brock Lesnar is not only out indefinitely , but the UFC heavyweight champ appears to be in bad shape .
From MMA Junkie :
White said Lesnar collapsed while spending time on a retreat in Canada and was checked into a hospital .
" [ Lesnar ] is in bad shape , and the reality is they do n't really know all that 's wrong with him , " White said .
" He owns a bunch of property in Canada .
He went up to Canada just to get away from his house , to go up there and just kind of chill out up there .
" He [ expletive ] dropped .
He went down , and he had to go to the hospital .
They ran every test on the planet on him , and they ended up finding out something else was wrong with him . "
As if that was n't bad enough , MMA legend Antonio Rodrigo " Minotauro " Nogueira has been forced to pull out of his UFC 108 bout with Cain Velasquez following another case of staph infection .
Again , from MMA Junkie :
" [ Nogueira ] got staph infection , bad , to the point now it 's in his bloodstream , and he 's probably going to have to be hospitalized and intravenously given the antibiotics , " White said .
UFC 108 , previously titled " Nogueira vs. Velasquez , " is scheduled for Jan. 2 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas .
White said the recent string of bad luck for the company , which has included injuries to several of the UFC 's most prominent fighters , is the worst he 's seen in his time at the helm of the promotion .
" It 's crazy , " White said .
" In nine years of being in this business , we have n't had this many injuries in one ( full ) year . "
Suffice to say , this is a gigantic step back for the UFC 's heavyweight division .
Every time the division starts to pick up ( signing Mirko Cro Cop , Randy Couture beating Tim Sylvia ) , it seems to come crashing down ( Gabriel Gonzaga head kicks Cro Cop into mediocrity , Couture leaves the company ) .
Now , when the company found a cash cow to lead the division , they 're left in shambles .
Couture 's moved down to 205 .
Lesnar may never fight again .
Nogueira will now have to deal with recovering from the effects of a draining infection .
What else can go wrong ?
I keep reading in various blogs and newsletters how any weakness in the market will be answered by Uncle Ben and his Printing Press .
In other words , now that the government has proved it can simply pour Monopoly money into the marketplace by way of Goldman Sachs and prop up the markets , it will just keep doing so in perpetuity .
No more bear markets – ever !
There is one thing about which I am certain in this very uncertain world in which we live : at some point , this little game of creating trillions of dollars for the sole purpose of creating an artificial demand for financial instruments is going to fail .
It might not fail tomorrow
It might not fail next month .
But one day , it will fail .
And when it does fail , the Dot - Gov bubble is going to make the Dot - Com bubble and the Housing bubble look like pathetic jokes in comparison .
The reason capitalism – real capitalism – not fraud and artifice – has always appealed to me is because it most closely resembled the natural order of things ; that is : the truth .
And I 've got a familiarity with the truth that some people find disquieting .
I 'm kind of a big fan of it .
And truthful capitalism is about things like quality products , satisfied customers , an inspired and creative workforce , and earnings growth .
It is also , in turn , about a mindful board of directors , a satisfied ( and yet vigilant ) body of shareholders and an earnest track record of truthful accountancy and reporting .
I 'm not interested in shorting AAPL or GOOG , not only because their charts simply are n't that opportune ( even in the face of a severe leg down ) , but also because , by and large , these companies represent capitalism at its best .
That 's also probably why they charts do n't look like good shorts .
But what 's going on now with the market in general – superb companies like the above notwithstanding – is fakery .
If you 've got a dead tree … … … but you hire someone to spray paint the leaves green and trim off some of the more obvious diseased branches …… … you 're going to convince most people for a given period of time that the tree is OK .
But you 've still got a dead tree .
And one day when a storm blows the whole thing over , people are going to realize you 've been lying to them for however long the charade has been going on .
My point is that government money , funneled through Goldman Sachs , can – and has – created artificial demand for equities that have sent them soaring .
The government 's printing presses are big enough to " buy " the market .
But even the government can't fake widespread corporate prosperity , and for that reason , sooner or later , this game is going to reach its ugly conclusion .

Many U.S. states in the 21st century have passed online shopping sales tax laws designed to compel Amazon.com and other e-commerce retailers to collect state and local sales taxes from its customers .
Amazon.com originally collected sales tax only from five states as of 2011 , but as of April 2017 , Amazon collects sales taxes from customers in all 45 states that have a state sales tax and in Washington , D.C. [ 166 ]
While Amazon has publicly opposed secret government surveillance , as revealed by Freedom of Information
Act requests it has supplied facial recognition support to law enforcement in the form of the " Rekognition " technology and consulting services .
Initial testing included the city of Orlando , Florida , and Washington County , Oregon .
Amazon offered to connect Washington County with other Amazon government customers interested in Rekognition and a body camera manufacturer .
These ventures are opposed by a coalition of civil rights groups with concern that they could lead to expansion of surveillance and be prone to abuse .
Specifically , it could automate the identification and tracking of anyone , particularly in the context of potential police body camera integration . [ 204 ] [ 205 ] [ 206 ]
Due to the backlash , the city of Orlando has publicly stated it will no longer use the technology . [ 207 ]
Even so , the first infomercial of the same type we see on TV today , aired in 1982 and was for a hair growth supplement called “ New Generation ” which was marketed by entrepreneur Robert E. Murphy Jr .
It was such a success that other companies quickly began following suit and purchasing program - length commercial air time .
At this time infomercials used to commonly be shown during late night / early morning hours , although stations discovered success showing them at other times when they learned that the majority of purchases were made in the morning , during the day , and around primetime .
Keeping active after retirement may boost health Giving up work completely on retirement could be bad for your health , US research suggests .
The study of 12,189 people found retirees who take on temporary or part - time work have fewer major diseases , and function better day to day .
The findings were significant even after considering people 's physical and mental health before retirement .
The University of Maryland study appears in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology .
The researchers examined data on 12,189 people , who were aged 51 - 61 at the beginning of the study .
All the evidence suggests that if your mental wellbeing is depleted it will affect you physically

The participants were interviewed every two years over a six - year period beginning in 1992 about their health , finances , employment history and work or retirement life .
The researchers registered only medical conditions which had been clinically diagnosed , and took account of factors such as sex , education level and financial wealth .
Mental health
The participants also completed a basic mental health questionnaire .
The findings showed that people who took on post - retirement jobs that were related to their previous careers reported better mental health than those who fully retired .
However , no similar boost to mental health was found in people who worked in jobs outside their career speciality after retirement .
The researchers believe this may be because retirees who take jobs not related to their career field may need to adapt to a different work environment and , therefore , become more stressed .
Also , the results showed that retirees with financial problems were more likely to work in a different field after they officially retire .
Temporary or part - time work after retirement was defined as bridge work .
Researcher Dr Mo Wang said : " Rather than wanting to work in a different field , they may have to work .
" In such situations , it 's difficult for retirees to enjoy the benefits that come with bridge employment . "
The researchers suggest that , when possible , retirees carefully consider their choice of post - retirement employment .
Dr Kenneth Shultz , who also worked on the study , said : " Choosing a suitable type of bridge employment will help retirees transition better into full retirement and in good physical and mental health . "
Professor Cary Cooper , an occupational health psychologist at the University of Lancaster , said : " All the evidence suggests that if your mental wellbeing is depleted it will affect you physically .
" Conversely , if you are more positive mentally you are going to be much more robust and active .
" And if you continue working after retirement often your status remains similar to that you experienced during your career , and as a result your self - esteem and sense of wellbeing will be enhanced . "
However , Professor Cooper said that sometimes making a clean break from a stressful job could be a good thing .
In that instance , he said , the key was to ensure that you had hobbies to keep you active .

The company responsible for an oil spill off the West Australian coast has acquired access to more Australian oilfields .
PTTEP Australasia has so far been unable to plug the leaking Montara rig in the Timor Sea despite numerous attempts over nine weeks .
The company was due to make its fourth attempt to plug the leak yesterday , but that was deferred .
Despite the company 's failure to stop the leak , it yesterday gained control of two more offshore oil fields and five exploration licences .
The move was supported the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson .
A spokesman for Mr Ferguson defended the decision saying there was nothing to suggest the company had done anything untoward .
PTTEP Australasia says it will use a new specialised tool in its next attempt to plug the leak , which may take place this weekend .
An environmental group said on Friday that the oil spill is worse than it feared .
The World Wide Fund for Nature completed a three - day boat trip of the area and said the spill is having a significant impact on marine life .

Harry Potter Book Sizes
After publishing the first four Harry Potter books , author J. K. Rowling was on a roll .
The book sizes were growing exponentially , and the fifth book was projected to be over 1,800 pages long , as shown on the graph below .
However , when the fifth Harry Potter book was published , it was only 870 pages long .
Clearly , Ms. Rowling had started to run out of steam .
Indeed , the graph below shows that Ms. Rowling 's output had peaked and would now diminish , with the sixth and seventh books being only 563 and 428 pages , respectively .
The sixth Harry Potter book turned out to be 652 pages long instead of the previously - predicted 563 pages -- an error of about 15 % , which is pretty darn good for prognostications of this sort .
Although Ms. Rowling apparently had a bit more steam left in her than expected , the graph below still shows that Ms. Rowling will continue to lose momentum , with the seventh book being only 545 pages .
Foiling the previous prediction , Ms. Rowling churned out 759 pages for the seventh and last Harry Potter book -- 39 % more pages than she was supposed to .
Her burst of energy on the sixth book apparently continued into the seventh , although she did n't quite re-attain the peak she reached on the fifth book .
The graph below is the culmination of this years - long research project .
All is well .
Technical Note :
The first graph is a least squares fit of an exponential function to the four data points .
The second graph is the exact rational function ( ratio of two polynomials ) that passes through the five data points .
The third graph is the exact rational function that passes through the six data points .
The fourth graph is the exact rational function that passes through the seven data points .
The displayed coefficients have been rounded to three significant digits .
Calculating the correct y values requires using the full - precision coefficients .

Fresh off a report from last week suggesting that Apple was planning to revamp its Mighty Mouse in conjunction with an expected iMac refresh , comes news from AppleInsider which sheds a lot more light on what sort of changes we can expect to see when Apple re-invents the mouse .
The Mighty Mouse , in its current form , was first released in 2005 and brought with it a number of improvements .
Mac users were finally given the ability to right click , albeit without a dedicated button , and buttons on the side of the mouse could be used to bring up Expose or any application for that matter .
The Mighty Mouse also introduced a scroll wheel for the first time which allowed users to not only scroll up and down on a page , but also from side to side .
When it actually works , the scroll wheel on Apple ’s Mighty Mouse is a delight .
Everything works smoothly , and the small sized scroll ball is unobtrusive and quiet , as opposed to some scroll wheels I ’ve seen on other mice .
Apple ’s scroll wheel also added even more functionality , as users could press down on the scroll ball to activate the Dashboard or any other application of their choosing .
But the scroll ball on Apple ’s Mighty Mouse was n’t 100 % perfect , with the biggest problem being that after a few months of heavy use , dirt and gunk would tend to accumulate under the scroll ball , all but rendering it completely useless – or at best , you might be able to scroll up but not down , or vice versa .
Now there are ways to clean the scroll ball , but since you ca n’t open up the mouse itself , doing so can be a pain at best , or a lesson in futility at worst .
Even more disheartening is that even if you do a good job of cleaning the scroll ball , once it gets stuck once , it ’s more likely to get stuck again and again .
So that ’s what the majority of Mac users have been living with for the past 4 or so years , and it ’s about time for an upgrade , and that ’s reportedly exactly what Apple has planned .
Last week , Mac4
Ever reported that Apple ’s new mouse will be 100 % touchbased , but it did n’t delve into much detail aside from mentioning that it might also be draped in aluminum instead of white plastic .
But according to patent filings that stretch back to 2006 , Apple ’s new mouse will do away with the scroll ball and replace it with a touch sensitive surface that would operate much like scrolling does on the iPhone .
Presumably , users would flick down on the new mouse to scroll downwards and flick up to scroll upwards .
Given the popularity of multitouch devices these days , such functionality would be familiar with users and would also do away with all scroll ball related problems .
Apple ’s new mouse will reportedly “ deliver an intuitive new feel in scroll navigation ” , and with Apple seemingly at the vanguard of practical multitouch technology , we ca n’t wait .
In case you were either holding out or saving up for Street Fighter IV on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 , now would be an excellent time to scrape up those pennies and head to GameStop .

How cheap is cheap ?
How about $ 40 off the normal retail price ?
That 's right , GameStop has marked down Street Fighter IV new for the PS3 and 360 to only $ 19.99 .
Kotakuite DUGDAWG noticed the sale on Slickdeals this morning , and calling my local store I was told that they had just marked down both versions this morning .
The PC version remains at $ 39.99 for the time being , and GameStop.com still lists the used copies at $ 34.99 apiece , so in this situation I 'd probably go with a new copy , unless you are some sort of moron .
That 's a damn fine discount right there .
I already own the game and I 'm thinking about picking up another copy just to bask in the savings .

The new United States attorney for New Hampshire said Tuesday that he wo n't prosecute people using small amounts of marijuana for pain or to improve their appetite .
CONCORD —
The new United States attorney for New Hampshire said Tuesday that he wo n't prosecute people using small amounts of marijuana for pain or to improve their appetite .
U.S. Attorney John Kacavas told The Associated Press his office will go after drug dealers , but not the sick .
He said he will follow guidance issued Monday by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder telling prosecutors that targeting people who use or provide medical marijuana in strict compliance with state laws was not a good use of their time .
Federal law bans the use and distribution of marijuana .
The absence of a state law allowing medical use makes no difference , Kacavas said .
It will be up to the state to decide to prosecute medical users , not his office , he said .
" This attorney general believes that it 's a limited resource allocation problem .
Federal resources are better reserved for larger scale drug dealers and consumers of drugs , " Kacavas said .
The policy does not endorse marijuana use or mean its use is legal , he said .
" But it is saying in a smarter battle against drugs , people who use it to improve their appetite , people who use it to alleviate their pain probably ought not to be prosecuted federally , " Kacavas said .
Next week , the House votes whether to override Gov. John Lynch 's veto of a bill that would make N.H. the 14th state to legalize marijuana use by severely ill people .
Depending on attendance , the House may have the two - thirds votes needed to override the veto , but supporters need two more votes in the Senate .
Asked if his office would prosecute medical users if the law does n't pass , Kacavas replied it would not .
He said he would enforce federal drug laws against dealers and those buying other illegal drugs .
The exception only applies to marijuana , he said .
In his veto message last spring , Lynch cited concerns over distribution and cultivation .
He also noted that marijuana use for any purpose remains illegal under federal and state law .
Lynch spokesman Colin Manning said the Obama administration 's shift in policy does not alleviate Lynch 's concerns and does not make marijuana use legal .
The bill would create barriers to controlling unauthorized marijuana use , Manning said .
" We should not set a lower bar for medical marijuana than we do for other controlled substances , and we should not implement a law that still has serious flaws , " Manning said .
State Rep. Evalyn Merrick , a Lancaster Democrat and the bill 's main sponsor , said Kacavas ' position is good news .
But , she said , New Hampshire needs a state law .
She said she 's more optimistic that the veto will be overridden .
" I would prefer that we as a state set policy so we can control it , so we can guarantee the quality is good for patients , " she said .
If the veto is overridden , the bill would establish three nonprofit " compassion centers " to dispense 2 ounces of marijuana every 10 days to severely ill patients whose doctors approve the drug 's use .
The state would license the centers and issue identification cards to their staff , approved patients and their caregivers .
Lynch said he was particularly concerned about the potential for unauthorized distribution , given that in addition to patients and designated caregivers , an unlimited number of compassion center volunteers also would have access to the drug .
He also took issue with the amount of drug allowed to be dispensed , saying the potency of marijuana can vary greatly depending on how it is cultivated .
Supporters said allowing only the compassion centers to grow marijuana would ensure the drug 's consistency .
The bill would create a " pharmacy model " by licensing the compassion centers to grow and dispense marijuana to patients approved by doctors to receive the drug .
Rhode Island and New Mexico have enacted similar models .
The bill is silent on the cost to patients , but supporters hope contributions will allow them to dispense the drug with little or no cost to patients .
But Lynch predicts the state 's administrative costs would be so high that only the wealthiest patients would be able to afford to pay the resulting fees .
Supporters said any fees would be far lower than the cost of prescription medications that attempt to give the same relief .

Charlie Sheen has blasted the cowardly corporate media response to his “ 20 Minutes With The President ” letter , slamming the press as “ hopeless lap - dogs ” for failing to address a single one of his 20 bullet points on 9/11 while ignoring completely his challenge to publicly debate 9/11 truth debunkers .
Sheen ’s open letter to the President , which took the form of a fictionalized account of a meeting between the two in which Sheen grills Obama about the unanswered questions surrounding 9/11 , received widespread media coverage and was featured in thousands of newspaper stories , online articles and TV segments .
Awareness of the subject only increased after the subsequent release of a You Tube video in which Sheen personally appeals to the President to answer the questions .
However , not one single mainstream media report adequately covered even one of Sheen ’s 20 bullet points that were listed in the article and backed up by a substantial online bibliography .
Indeed , scores of corporate media hit pieces completely fabricated the content of Sheen ’s letter , attributing phrases to him that he had never made in an attempt to portray Sheen as abrasive and “ insulting ” to 9/11 victims and their families , despite the fact that the majority of family members share Sheen ’s questions .
Fox News was one of many corporate media outlets to claim that Sheen had stated “ that Bush / Cheney planned it all , ” when in reality he had said no such thing .
The media merely manufactured this spin so that they could politicize the issue , make it partisan , and then attack Sheen as just another deluded Hollywood liberal .
Claims that Sheen directly accused President Bush of planning 9/11 were erroneously carried by hundreds of media outlets despite the fact that the actor never made any such statement .
The fact that the press had to invent a strawman stance and put words in Sheen ’s mouth to then attack him on proves how scared the media is of the power of the actual questions that Sheen asked in his letter .
In a statement released to Prison Planet.com , Sheen chastised the media response as nothing more than a “ mendacious side - show ” performed by journalists he describes as “ hopeless lap dogs ” .
Sheen slams the press for following “ a desperate , juvenile and transparent script ” in response to his letter after they collectively “ attacked the man and ignored the facts ” .
“ We can no longer allow these cowards and shills to contaminate the reservoirs of truth .
In addition to their slanderous folly , they have ignored my very public challenge to a debate on Larry King Live .
If these cockroaches had but one shred of courage , they would embrace this opportunity , ” states Sheen .
Sheen also released to Prison Planet.com the e mails that he sent to the White House following the publication of his letter to Obama .
After his request to meet with Obama was rejected by Obama ’s staff , Sheen made another request to meet with Obama , this time accompanied by 9/11 family member Bob Mcllvaine who lost his son on September 11 .
Sheen has yet to hear back from Obama ’s staff regarding his follow - up request .
[ efoods ]
In a telling illustration that Obama has failed to even acknowledge Sheen ’s “ 20 Minutes ” piece not just because he is “ busy , ” the President did manage to find time to comment on the mindless antics of rapper Kanye West on MTV , according to an ABC News reporter .
It seems that Obama is more concerned about a hip - hop star ’s behavior at a music awards show than he is with serious questions about 9/11 that are shared by the majority of 9/11 victims ’ family members .
Charlie Sheen ’s full statement and his e mails to the White House are reprinted below .
Another Bin Laden tape has surfaced this morning .
I will be monitoring the FBI ’s most wanted web site to see if this tape finally provides the Bureau with the evidence required to list “ 9/11 ″ in Bin Laden ’s rap sheet .
Thus far it has not .
I must point out as well , that the mainstream media has once again followed a desperate , juvenile and transparent script in their response to my letter , “ Twenty Minutes with the President ” .
Not a single member of this mendacious side - show has focused their attention , for one second , on the 20 bullet points chronicled in my letter .
Instead , they have attacked the man and ignored the facts .
If this is their definition of , “ responsible journalism ” , I urge all free thinking people to ignore these hopeless lap - dogs and responsibly do their own research .
We can no longer allow these cowards and shills to contaminate the reservoirs of truth .
In addition to their slanderous folly , they have ignored my very public challenge to a debate on Larry King Live .
If these cockroaches had but one shred of courage , they would embrace this opportunity .
As of 1 o’clock PM , PST , on Sep. 14th , I still await a formal response from The White House .
The emails I authored are printed below .
I thank you all for your patriotic support .
Respectfully – Charlie Sheen
— — — — — — — — —— —— —————-
Dear Mr. Gibbs – I understand you are quite busy so I wo n’t take up too much of your time .
I have recently published a letter ( article ) online entitled , “ Twenty Minutes with the President ” .
It is currently garnering worldwide attention .
It is a fictional account of myself and President Obama in an interview setting , discussing the events of Sep.11th .
If you have n’t read it yet , I would urge you to do so .
My request is pretty straightforward : I would like to invite our Commander in Chief to join me in a real discussion / interview focusing specifically on Sep. 11th and it ’s aftermath .
If you would provide the President with a copy of my letter , he will have all of my questions and data ahead of time , therefore no surprises .
I understand he is extremely busy and I can only imagine how many requests you receive each day .
If nothing else , it might be a welcome break from the stress of health care reform and the issues surrounding the economy .
Twenty minutes , 1200 seconds , the location of your choice .
America deserves this Mr. Gibbs .
I await your response .
My very Best – Charlie Sheen
— — — — — — — — —— —— —————-
Dear Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Burton – I ’m deeply saddened to hear that my request to interview President Obama regarding 9/11 and present him with the facts has been declined .
However , I am now making another request .
This request is on behalf of a large section of 9/11 victim ’s family members , more specifically Mr. Bob Mcllvaine , who tragically lost his son Bobby on that awful day .
Mr. Mcllvaine represents and echoes a growing number of outspoken victim ’s family members who still have numerous unanswered questions regarding 9/11 .
Mr. Mcvllaine and I would like to sit down with the President and focus solely on the 20 bullet points outlined in my document .
Again gentlemen , these facts are not my opinions or theories , these glaring inconsistencies are supported and confirmed by 6 of the 10 commission members responsible for shaping and creating the “ Official Report ” .
If this secondary request cannot be enacted , I would ask , at the very least , for an explanation in writing from the President himself , detailing the reason (s ) for his decision .
Thank you for your time .
My very best – Charlie Sheen

The gaming industry has gotten bigger and better with each passing year , but sometimes they just do n’t do things right .
Whether it ’s game play , story , pricing , or business practice , sometimes the industry needs a little friendly fire from the gamers to keep it in line .
Other times , developers look down their sight and fire off a well placed bullet right into our unexpected head .
This is Josh & Cameron , and this is Headshots & Friendly Fire .
A Bit of Friendly Fire
Fear of Competition Delaying Games
Platinum Games and Sega decided that although Bayonetta is completely finished , they wanted to move back the release date from this fall , to next spring .
They did n’t want to put their game up against Uncharted 2 and Modern Warfare 2 , even though Bayonetta would be the only third - person action game released this fall .
So instead , Sega would like to see their game go up against God of War 3 and Dante ’s Inferno .
Sega , you are an idiot .
Alpha Protocol has also been moved from its fall release date , to the spring where it can compete with Mass Effect 2 .
You might remember Alpha Protocol as the RPG with character interactions and dialogue tress similar to …Mass Effect !
What publisher is responsible for this ?
Oh , it ’s Sega of course .
Sega is n’t the only publisher pushing back its games , as London Studios has decided to push back the release of Eyepet to the spring .
Now , I ’m going to split the games releasing this fall into two categories .
The first category contains games where you kill demons , shoot people in the face , and Ozzy curses a lot .
The second category contains a game with a cute , fuzzy monkey .
I can safely say that these two categories are mutually exclusive , and nobody is going to be in Gamestop puzzling what category to invest in .
I would also like to take this time to predict that all three of these games will sell much worse without the holidays .
Enemies That Can Heal
This has been a problem at certain points in Demon ’s Souls .
You run up to an enemy , and exchange a few heavy blows back and forth , and then you roll back to a safe distance and the enemy takes the opportunity to completely heal himself .
This causes what would normally be a short fight into a 5 - minute stalemate .
Allowing enemies to heal themselves just makes battles more tedious .
It ’s an unnecessary timer , so to speak .
After you hit an enemy , you only have so much time to kill him , before he regains his health and you have to start the process all over again .
In such a slow paced game where I ’m encouraged to be cautious in how I fight an enemy , it ’s very uncharacteristic of the game to expect me to be so aggressive and attack so quickly .
This also happens in PvP matches , but then again , It would be really unfair to the other player if I could heal and he could n’t , and most of the time the other player just runs at me like an idiot , so it really does n’t matter anyways .
My What SKU ’s you Have
At times it can be very hard to explain the differences in the SKU ’s to non-gamers or potential purchasers of the product and it never helps when there are 4 , 5 or 6 different SKU ’s on the shelf at once .
Back when the PS3 launched in 2006 you had the 20GB and 60 GB , with different feature sets .
Then came the drop of the 20 and the inclusion of the 80GB .
Then the drop of the 60GB and here comes the 40GB .
Are you still following me ?
After all that came a 160 GB PS3 , the dropping of the current 80 GB and now the Slim at 120GB .
That is 4 years worth of change after change where the most biggest change in most of the hardware was the HDD , which makes very little sense when the PS3 HDD can be upgraded with ease by the user .
All this changing made it very hard to talk friends into buying a PS3 and exactly which PS3 they should buy because at times there were 4 or 5 different SKU ’s on the market .
Now i am sure there were changes under the hood that improved the system as they released it , but it got confusing after awhile even for people who follow Sony on a regular basis .
Developer ’s Get to Name Calling
Competition is a great thing and studios should defintely be in this business to make the best product and one up the competition , but should developers really resort to name calling to do this ?
What ever happened to letting your product do the talking for you ?
This is a competitive business and I am sure developers at times let their emotions get the best of them but you should have some professional respect for your competition .
Just because you two developers make similar games for rival consoles does not mean they cannot show each other respect and at times show praise for each others hard work and dedication .
Often times however it feels like the Fight of the Fanboys spills over to the developers and that should n’t happen .
Fanboys already have enough fuel for the fire without the developers help .

Most Mexicans think their lives would be better in the United States , and one in three said they 'd move to the U.S. if they could , according to the latest findings on Mexican attitudes from the Pew Global Attitudes Project .
Half of those who said they 'd migrate north of the border said they would do so without permission , although recent data on immigration suggests that the flow of Mexicans north is slowing .
President Felipe Calderon 's military - led campaign against the country 's drug lords and organized - crime networks is " overwhelmingly endorsed " by the majority of Mexicans , although large majorities describe crime ( 81 % ) and illegal drugs ( 73 % ) as very big problems , according to the study .
Calderon 's offensive against organized crime is now in its third year amid rising drug - related violence , but the Pew project reports that most Mexicans believe those anti-crime efforts are effective .
A hefty majority , 66 % , say the army is making progress against the traffickers , while only 15 % think it is losing ground .
Calderon also is well regarded .
The popularity of the tough stance against drug gangs seems to be bolstering support for Calderon .
Roughly two - thirds ( 68 % ) have a favorable opinion of the president , while only 29 % express an unfavorable view .
You can read the report in its entirety on the project 's website or download it .
Face - to - face interviews were conducted with 1,000 adults in Mexico between May 26 and June 2 , 2009 , for the Pew report .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Renewable energy firm Ocean Power Technologies has won a A$ 66.5 million ( $ 61 million ) grant from the Australian government for a project set to be one of the first to generate power from waves on a utility scale .
Ocean Power , which is listed in both the U.S. and London , said on Friday work on the 19 megawatt project , enough to power 10,000 homes , was expected to begin by the second quarter of 2010 .
The company uses buoys floating up and down to drive an electrical generator , with the power generated being transmitted onshore via an underwater cable .
The project off the coast of Victoria is being carried out in conjunction with Leighton Contractors , a unit of Australian mining contractor Leighton Holdings .
The Australian government is aiming to generate 20 percent of the country ’s electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and the grant awarded to Ocean Power forms part of funding totaling A$ 235 million for four renewable energy projects .
Ocean Power said , however , further funding would be needed to complete the wave power station .
Ocean Power ’s London shares , which have gained 30 percent over the last month , closed up 6 percent at 432.5 pence .
It was trading up 25 percent on Nasdaq by 1706 GMT .

Surely there are better ways to dispose of orphan income .
The Department of Justice in fact suggested one two weeks ago , when it issued a critique of the proposed settlement saying , among other things , that the court might do as we do with actual orphans : appoint a guardian to look out for them until they come of age .
In this case , I believe , such a guardian would have to be charged with service to both the rights holders and the public good .
He would have to try to find lost owners and pay them their due ; should no owners be found , he would have to devise a way to release these works to the public domain .
( He could simply require that users who ’ve been charged for orphans get their money back , or that the fees Google charges libraries be lowered in proportion to revenue collected in error . )
The idea of a guardian obliged finally to serve public ends suggests a second way to expand Defoe ’s metaphor .
The Brat of the Brain has never been thought of the way that European nobility once thought of their land , as something to be handed down generation after generation .
A copyright may be inherited , yes , but not in perpetuity .
At this nation ’s founding , “ perpetuities ” were understood to be one of the devices by which aristocracy maintained its power , and the founders therefore looked on forms of long - term ownership with a skeptical eye .
Jefferson especially believed that no generation had a right to bind those that followed .
“ The earth belongs . . . to the living , ” he wrote to Madison in 1789 ; “ the dead have neither powers nor right over it . ”
That being the case , “ perpetual monopolies ” in arts “ ought expressly to be forbidden , ” Jefferson ’s own suggestion being that copyright run no more than 19 years .
Such time - limited ownership relocates inheritance to serve democratic rather than aristocratic ends .
Where Europeans had shaped inheritance to serve powerful families , Americans would shape it so that something new under the sun — “ the people ” — might receive the legacy of all their forebears had created .
The founders valued “ civic virtue , ” the honor that private citizens acquire by acting for the public good .
By insisting that copyright exist only for “ limited times ” ( as the Constitution says ) , they suggested a way that law itself might engender virtue , transforming the fruits of human imagination from private into common wealth by the mere passage of time .
The point here , of course , is that the parties to the Google settlement are asking the judge to let them be orphan guardians but without any necessary obligation to the public side of the copyright bargain .
Quite the opposite : if Judge Chin grants them a pass to profit from orphan works , he will also be granting them a private monopoly in digital books .
Why ?
Because the Google case is a class - action lawsuit structured such that it will bind all rights holders unless they opted out by a deadline that passed last month .
The missing owners of orphan works could not do that , of course ; by definition they do n’t even know this litigation concerns them .
Now , included by default in the proposed settlement , their Brats are being readied for trade .
they had no toyz .... .... so they gave u me

Forward Marc Savard , the Bruins ’ leading scorer , has been placed on long - term injured reserve because of a broken left foot .
The Bruins did not say when Savard suffered the injury .
The Bruins recalled forward Trent Whitfield from Providence on an emergency basis .
Savard , who has four goals and three assists , will be out four to six weeks .
He has led the Bruins in scoring each of the last three years , and did not miss a game last season while amassing 25 goals and 63 assists for 88 points .
Whitfield , 32 , was signed as a free agent in July and has appeared in 177 NHL games with the Capitals , Rangers and Blues .
He had three goals and eight assists in six games for Providence this season .
BUENOS AIRES , Argentina —
Want to visit Jerusalem without traveling thousands of miles ?
The world 's first religious theme park promises to let you do just that — right in the heart of Buenos Aires .
" Tierra Santa , " or the Holy Land , attempts to recreate ancient Jerusalem with atmospheric architecture and almost 600 statues evoking Biblical times .
The theme park — originally conceived as an amusement park — draws 30,000 weekly visitors during the high season .
Bank of America ( BAC ) is off 4.5 % on fears it will need to raise new capital . :
WSJ : The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Bank of America 's attempt to repay federal bailout funds and escape the government 's grasp has been snagged by a disagreement over how much additional capital the bank must raise to satisfy regulators , according to people familiar with the situation .
Bloomberg essentially backs this theory up , stating that :
Bloomberg : U.S. stocks fell , erasing an early rally , on concern lawmakers will phase out a tax credit for homebuyers and Bank of America Corp. will have to sell shares to pay back its government bailout .
The dollar rebounded from a 14 - month low against the euro and oil wiped out an early advance .
Bank of America sank 5.7 percent on speculation government officials will force the company to raise more capital .

Two decades ago , when I was writing what would be one of the first books on global warming , I interviewed a professor at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government , one of the few academics already thinking about the emerging problem .
He hemmed and hawed for a little while , and then he said , “ This is the public policy problem from hell .
There are just too many conflicting interests .
It wo n’t be solved . ”
This December may be the last real chance to prove him wrong as the nations of the world meet in Copenhagen for a climate conference billed as make or break , do or die , perhaps quite literally sink or swim .
In fact , you could make a fair argument that this will be the most important diplomatic gathering in the world ’s history .
Versailles , sure .
Yalta , yes — but their failures were measured in decades of pain and millions of lives .
Failure to rein in climate change will reverberate for tens of thousands of years , across generations not even yet imagined .
Which is not to say the 12 days of final negotiations will be august or easy to follow or even coherent .
I remember the last big talks of this sort , in Kyoto in 1997 .
The sessions took place , as they will in Copenhagen , in a conference center miles from town .
It became its own insulated world , with reporters and delegates and oil company lobbyists and NGO representatives endlessly querying each other about what was going on .
( There was even a daily paper , and sometimes a parody version . )
The answer to the queries was always the same :
We ’re waiting for the US and the Europeans to strike a deal .
The official palaver was taking place in a big hall , with delegates making amendments and offering motions , but all the real action was behind closed doors .
The whole conference looked close to failure until Al Gore jetted in and instructed the US negotiators to “ show flexibility . ”
That was just enough to allow the talks to limp to a conclusion — the midnight deadline passed , and by the next morning we were all being shooed out the door to make room for a molecular biology convention .
No one had enough energy to give more than a feeble cheer for the final document , which in the end the US Senate never even considered ratifying .
This time around , America will be represented by a career political operative , Todd Stern , as chief climate negotiator .
And probably Hillary Clinton .
And quite possibly Barack Obama .
They ’ll be trying to satisfy the Europeans , who are again pushing for tougher cuts in emissions than the administration thinks are realistic .
But this time the US / European divide is n’t the main challenge — far from it .
This time the developing world has its own demands — and that will make a Copenhagen treaty far , far more complicated to arrive at than Kyoto was .
For the developing world would like to …develop .
And the most obvious way to do it is to burn coal .
And they have an unimpeachable moral case , which goes like this :
You got rich by burning coal , so why should n’t we ?
You can imagine the game of multilevel chess that ensues :
Everyone is under pressure from everyone else , and it all comes down to the final days , and most likely drags on into 2010 as the negotiators lurch toward some kind of middle ground .
Which could mean , in the end , a treaty that at least moves us in the direction of the target that most people have been talking about for the last five years : holding temperature increases under two degrees Celsius and an atmospheric concentration of 450 parts per million ( ppm ) CO 2 .
It wo n’t be easy by any stretch , and it wo n’t be any prettier than the Waxman - Markey bill now staggering through Congress .
But a failure would be so embarrassing that there ’s real pressure to agree to something .
SO THAT ABOUT COVERS all the factors .
Except for two .
Physics and chemistry , they ’re called — and they ’re throwing a serious monkey wrench into the proceedings .
It started in the summer of 2007 when the Arctic melted with sudden and unexpected haste , 30 years ahead of what even the more pessimistic scientists were forecasting .
And that ’s after increasing the planet ’s temperature about eight - tenths of a degree Celsius or slightly less than half of the two degrees that look like a best - case Copenhagen scenario .
When the post - Kyoto negotiations began five or six years ago , we did n’t think one degree was enough to do real damage , but now we know different .
A few months after all that ice melted in 2007 , our foremost climatologists gave us a new number to aim for : 350 ppm.
NASA ’s James Hansen and his team issued a series of papers showing that any atmospheric carbon content greater than that appears not to be compatible with “ a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted . ”
In other words : Climate change is not a future problem for wise statesmen to patiently work to avert .
It ’s a right now , present tense , capital - E Emergency .
Hansen and his team warn that a world of 450 ppm CO 2 is a world that will eventually be largely ice free .
That will take some time — those Antarctic ice sheets are miles thick .
But there ’s plenty of change coming at us already .
Dengue fever , carried by mosquitoes rapidly expanding their range in our newly warming world , has increased thirtyfold in the past 50 years .
( A recent report indicated it could easily spread to more than half the states in the union . )
Glaciers are melting before our eyes .
( Glacier National Park will need a new name as early as 2020 — the source of the Ganges could be a dusty hillside 15 years later . )
Drought is becoming endemic across the American Southwest and in parts of Australia — some 200 people died this year around Melbourne when wildfires whipped through after a heat wave .
A recent study predicted a 50 percent chance that Lake Mead , behind Hoover Dam , will have dried up by 2021 .
Meanwhile , since all the water that ’s evaporating out of dry areas must eventually come back down , deluges ( like the record rains in India that put a million people out of their homes in 2006 ) are getting worse .
This is the kind of trouble you get at 387 ppm .
You really want to go for 450 ?
If you had to pick a country to serve as a proxy for physics and chemistry at the Copenhagen talks , the Maldives would be a good place to start .
This archipelago of 1,190 islands , most of them only a few feet above sea level , has a population of barely 400,000 , so it wo n’t carry enormous clout in Copenhagen .
It does have a certain moral authority , since under the deal that the EU and Obama are pushing for it probably wo n’t exist much longer .
( See also “ To the Lifeboats . ” )
To make matters worse , the islands depend on the fringing reefs that surround them for protection from waves and storms .
But that coral is dying because the carbon in the atmosphere is turning the ocean more acidic .
The pH of the sea — the whole damned Earth - girdling sea — has dropped from 8.2 to 8.1 and is apparently on its way to 7.8 in the lifetime of babies born today .
In July marine scientists in London released a statement saying that long - term CO 2 concentrations above 360 ppm will mean the death of all coral on the planet .
Which explains why Mohamed Nasheed , the dynamic new president of the Maldives , says failure to reach agreement would amount to a “ suicide pact . ”
And then there ’s Bangladesh .
There are the African countries already dying from drought .
The UN raised a lot of new flags in the last century .
Get ready to watch them start coming down .
It ’s not that a treaty that would get us to 350 is impossible .
Hansen and his team have shown that we could actually burn most of the oil in our wells ( but sorry Canada , not the tar sands ) ; if we were to stop burning coal by 2030 , and sooner in the developed world , forests and oceans would eventually scrub enough CO 2 to get us back to a safe level .
Not without severe damage — we lack a method for refreezing the Arctic — but maybe on this side of catastrophe .
But that ’s heavier lifting than Obama and the Chinese have in mind , heavier lifting than even the EU is going to push for .
It would require focusing the entire planet for a generation on the task of transitioning off fossil fuel .
It would mean sticking whole industries with trillions of dollars in unrecoverable sunk costs ( all those coal - fired power plants whose financing depends on a 40 - year run ) .
It would mean paying a huge political price .
It would mean aiming for a solution , not an agreement .
To make it happen would require a movement , a movement big enough to push our leaders into truly uncomfortable decisions .
Some of us have thrown ourselves into building 350.org , which is set to climax on October 24 with thousands of rallies across the planet .
There will be teams of 350 bicyclists , and church bells pealing 350 times ; in the Maldives , President Nasheed will lead 350 divers in the world ’s largest underwater political demonstration .
It may turn out to be the most widely dispersed political protest of all time , with actions happening almost everywhere .
[ Eds :

But whether it will be enough to shift Copenhagen — that remains to be seen .
The Maldives has promised to become the world ’s first carbon - neutral nation by 2020 .
But it ’s also started setting aside a portion of its budget every year to buy a new homeland .
For the moment , global warming remains the problem from hell , and the planet is on a course to a remarkably similar temperature .

DC Game Day V was held October 24th and 25th , and Geek ’s Dream Girl and I were there .
It was a bit different than the game conventions I usually go to : it was held in a section of an office building in downtown DC , and it was 4 sessions of RPGs ( 2 per day ) .
No open gaming , no pick - up games - it was all scheduled ahead of time .
We were there both days , having made sure to be ready when sign - ups opened to grab the games we really wanted ( and even then , ended up having to scramble to pick other games . )
Here ’s what we played , and a short write - up of each .
Time & Temp : Miss Him , Miss Him , Miss Him
One of the games that immediately grabbed my eye was Time & Temp , a new ( and as far as I can tell , still unreleased ) time travel RPG by the creator of Dread .
Those two things were enough to hook me right there : I love time travel , and I love the rules of Dread .
Then the only available session by the time I got to it was run by Kevin “ Piratecat ” Kulp ( ENWorld Moderator , MC of the last two Ennie Awards , and most importantly , poster of one of the most awesome session recaps of his campaign ) which sealed the deal for sure .
The concept behind Time & Temp is that you work for a corporation that runs trips back in time .
However , important people disturb the flow of time , so they only send back the least important people they can : Temps .
Before the game , we were asked to fill out our “ resume ” as character creation .
I came up with an incompetent software engineer obsessed with the movie Hackers who was recruited out of time right before the dot - com boom .
E came up with a musician that turned out to be too good to be a temp , so she changed her concept to street musician .
The system was neat , though more “ gamey ” than you might expect after character generation is so simple , since you begin to fill out a sudoku - like grid of numbers that you ’ve rolled during the course of the game .
Place your numbers well , and you get temporal harmonies that allow you to pull “ Bill & Ted ” - style time travel feats ( “ I ’ll just go back and leave the keys here ! ” )
Roll or place poorly , paradox happens and the universe begins to unravel .
If this happens enough , everybody loses .
( We were only one unlucky roll away from this happening . )
The scenario , adapted from an older time travel RPG , involved a menial task to retrieve a Commodore 64 cooling fan from Radio Shack … which then proved difficult when the party found out that World War 3 had broken out due to time paradox .
The solution , which involved The Beatles , drugs , and more time travel , leading me to declare it to be Andy Looney ’s ideal game .
I really enjoyed it , though going into it I was predisposed to liking it .
The scenario was fun , the GM was great ( he used all of his various British accents ) , and the other players were fun ( one PC was Dr. Zaius from Planet of the Apes , leading to a lot of hilarity and brachiation . )
I enjoyed the system , though I could see it being streamlined a bit , as some of the paradox mechanics never came up .
Also more examples would help , like it was n’t always clear what the difference between “ setting an effect ” and “ setting the effort ” was .
Generally , though , if you ’re OK with playing Jenga to resolve things during your RPG , you ’re going to be OK with messing with a grid of numbers .
Deadlands ( Savage Worlds ) : Trouble at Table Rock
Post Con Carolinas , I ’ve been having a hankering for some more Savage Worlds , and it ’s been a long while since I ’ve played anything Western .
Thus we registered for a Deadlands scenario run by Matthew Cutter ( brand manager for Deadlands at PEG ) , and chose our pregen characters .
I was Dr. August Chillingsworth , Scientist Extraordinaire , and E was Carrie Bellweather , the Rodeo Queen .
After a short recap of the Savage Worlds rules , we were off , getting the group posse together to investigate a group of cattle being killed by strange beasts .
After being ambushed by some banditos ( and having a conversation with them where I got to use most of my character ’s hindrances ) , we followed the trail into Table Rock , and some botched rolls convinced us that it was “ injuns ” and not strange , terrible lizards , even after seeing evidence to the contrary .
The finale ?
We fought a T - Rex ( and one of our party members turned out to be a vengeance - seeking zombie ) , so what more could you ask for ?
I continue to enjoy Savage Worlds for convention games and am impressed by its versatility in genres and situations .
However , I still have the feeling that I probably would n’t want to play it in a long term campaign .
I also formulated my own theory of one - shots : if it ’s important on the character sheet , it should probably come up during the game .
I was happy I got to show off and play each of my character ’s mental disadvantages , but disappointed that I did not get to perform any acts of Mad Science .
D&D 4e : The Caprian Foreign Legion Goes to Tea
Did I mention that Piratecat writes epic recaps of his 4e campaign ?
Yeah , so getting into one of his 4e games was my top priority .
Thanks to the awesomeness that is driving into DC , we were late both days , and so by the time we arrived everyone had already claimed characters .
Fortunately , the two left fit us quite well ( and were both Rogues . )
I grabbed “ Tusker ” , a half - orc ruthless ruffian rogue ( a build I would probably never play myself ) and E grabbed a Goblin Rogue who was multiclassed into Druid who could shapeshift into a giant rat .
The scenario cast us all as members of a forgotten military unit , the first RPG game I have played that used the “ French Foreign Legion ” trope , which seems obvious to use in retrospect .
As you might expect , we were unlikely heroes cast into a situation that only we could handle in our own special way .
I ’m hoping that if you read this blog you know about the 4e system by now , but what I enjoyed here was a 4e adventure being run as a convention one - shot ( and not part of a delve , living game , campaign , etc . )
Each of the characters had connections and opinions of each other , as well as roleplaying advice .
This is definitely a technique I plan to use when I start running some 4e games at conventions … and would love to see used more often .
Lady Blackbird : Adventures in the Wild Blue Yonder
This we jumped into knowing almost nothing about it .
And I know it ’s based on an existing system , but I could n’t tell you what it was !
What I can tell you is that the adventure is downloadable for free and it ’s a steampunky / science fiction adventure featuring a cast of colorful characters .
I played the captain of the good ship Owl , E played a stowaway on the ship .
After taking on a mysterious passenger , the Owl was captured by a ship that bore some semblance to an Imperial Star Destroyer .
We worked on the classic breakout to get back to the ship and escape , with some game mechanic - induced flashbacks all the while .
The style of the game was definitively “ story game ” , with Tom “ Madwabbit ” serving more as a facilitator then GM , and making sure that everyone was getting their spotlight time .
I had fun , though I thought more control of story could have been given over to the players , despite there being at least one player who was clearly in a more “ D& D - style ” mindset for playing .
I believe the adventure is only the first in an upcoming series , so I look forward to playing the next installment …
I like playing the Captain !

Hey Apple , check this thing out !
Toshiba just blazed into IFA on a 7 - inch multimedia tablet , the JournE touch .
It 's dominated by the touchscreen display , but underneath there 's support for a wide range of codecs ( H.264 , DivX , WMV ) , 802.11b/g WiFi , some online multimedia services like YouTube and Flickr , and some light internet duties thanks to Internet Explorer running on Windows CE 6.0 Pro.
Despite the size and multimedia prowess ( it can output sub - 1080 p video over an HDMI plug in the dock ) , the device measures a mere 14 mm thick and weighs just under a pound .
There 's only 1GB of built - in storage , but that can be expanded via the SD slot , and the device can access external storage over USB .
Word is it 'll retail for 250 Euro in Q4 this year .
The device feels pretty nice in hand , but there 's still a bit of a prototype vibe about it -- maybe because it 's still a prototype .
It 's clearly a resistive screen , and the device will include a stylus for non touch - optimized apps .
Toshiba seemed to be having fun with the multitude of Apple comparisons , namely since there is n't an Apple device to compare it to yet .
They also call the video output the tablet 's killer app , and promise to show more once they can track down a WiFi signal .
Sure , it 's just a MID at the end of the day , but we 'll be happy to humor them -- it 's a pretty hot MID .
We 've got some video hands - on of the JournE right after the break -- gaze upon itsdisplaying prowess !
Added one more video after the break , just in case you did n't get enough the first go 'round .
Target apologizes for selling ‘ illegal alien ’
Halloween costume
Target apologized Friday after receiving several complaints from customers and immigrant rights organizations for selling an “ illegal alien ” Halloween costume on its website .
The outfit , which costs around forty bucks , features a space alien mask , an orange jumpsuit with the words “ illegal alien ” emblazoned on the front and a large “ green card . ”
According to Hector Flores of LULAC , one of the largest Latino civil rights organizations in the U.S. , the costume is racist in nature .
“ The costume , while clearly depicting a supposed visitor from space , can generate images as portrayed a la Lou Dobbs , with his inflammatory pictures of people crawling over the fences on the southern border of the U.S. , or anti-immigrant , ” Flores said .
Target spokesman Joshua Thomas says the company will be removing the costume from the site .
He told Pegasus News by phone that they were made aware of the outfit through calls to its customer relations office .
Thomas adds , “ We went into the process of pulling it from Target.com .
It takes about 24 hours .
The costume will be taken down either late Friday or early Saturday . ”
Judy Thomas in the Kansas City Star has an amazing piece ( picked up by MSNBC ) about the online fund - raiser being planned for Scott Roeder , the right - wing extremist who shot Dr. George Tiller in the head in his church :
Roeder , charged with first - degree murder in the May 31 shooting of Tiller , is scheduled to go to trial in January .
“ The network of extremists promoting and defending the murder of doctors is contributing to escalating threats against clinics and doctors across the country , ” said Kathy Spillar , executive vice president of the Feminist Majority Foundation .
One abortion - rights leader called the auction deplorable and said it could lead to more violence .
“ This is unique , ” said Regina Dinwiddie , a Kansas City anti-abortion activist who will sign the bullhorn .
“ Nobody ’s ever done this before .
The goal is that everybody makes money for Scott Roeder ’s defense . ”
These are among the items that abortion foes plan to auction on eBay and other Web sites in a fundraiser for Scott Roeder , the Kansas City man charged with killing Wichita abortion doctor George Tiller .
Perhaps even more appalling is the line of defense they hope to pursue in the courts with this money :
Leach and others would like to help Roeder hire a lawyer to present what is known as a necessity defense .
That strategy would argue that Tiller was killed to prevent a greater harm — killing babies .
Other anti-abortion activists charged with violent crimes have tried to use such a defense but with little success .
Yeah , let 's legalize killing abortion doctors .
Sounds like a job for Antonin Scalia .
One can only hope this defense has zero success , as it has in the past .
Rachel Maddow also featured a segment on this story last night on her MSNBC show , including an interview with the attorney for Tiller 's family , who says he 'll move to have the court attach any funds they raise on Roeder 's behalf :
Transcript :
Joining us now is Lee Thompson .
He 's an attorney who represented the late Dr. George Tiller for 16 years .
He 's currently the attorney for Dr. Tiller 's widow and the doctor 's estate .
Mr. Thompson , thanks very much for coming on this show .
LEE THOMPSON , ATTORNEY FOR DR .
GEORGE TILLER'S WIDOW : Thank you for having me .
MADDOW : First , I 'll just ask for your reaction or the reaction of Dr .
Tiller 's family to this planned fundraising effort for Mr. Roeder .
THOMPSON : Well , obviously , we believe that this is nothing more than a reprehensible publicity stunt that is fostered by the same people trying to sell the same publications that generated the climate of hatred and fear that led to Dr. Tiller 's murder .
Fortunately , it 's probably also a useless exercise , because the drawings and other materials from criminals would generate funds that ought to be attached by the Kansas victim compensation fund under our Son of Sam Law .
So obviously , if this goes ahead , we 'll be asking the attorney general of Kansas to simply attach whatever funds and use them to help other victims of crimes .
MADDOW : Separate from the question of fundraising or , as you say , it would in this case probably be attempted fundraising , how present are your concerns about more violence coming from the radical anti-abortion movement ?
Certainly , it is troubling to see Mr. Roeder as he sits there charged with first degree murder in Dr. Tiller 's death to see him celebrated in this way .
THOMPSON : Absolutely .
And I think it 's obvious , when you look at these very materials , that it 's the rhetoric that was promoted by these groups that has led to violence .
The handbook of the Army of God , for example , had hints on gluing locks at abortion clinics , which Roeder did in Kansas City ; hints and directions on flooding clinic roofs , which they did to Dr. Tiller 's clinic in Wichita ; bombing instructions and other violent directions that all led to that climate that made people think it was OK to do this .
They also suggested , I think , that it was justified and , thus , gave the impression that there was some justification , a defense which the law has routinely rejected .
MADDOW : Since Dr. Tiller 's murder , clearly , the very far fringe , the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement , has decided to celebrate Mr. Roeder .
The pro-choice movement and I think a lot of centrists who see themselves as allied with this issue at all before Dr. Tiller 's murder , have also organized in the wake of the assassination and I think tried to change minds and tried to change the climate in the country in the wake of that assassination - what 's been your reaction to the overall way in which Dr. Tiller 's murder has affected the country on both sides ?
THOMPSON : Well , obviously , any attempt to use it to promote anti-abortion feelings is awful .
It is sick .
It is the worst possible thing that could be done .
This was a criminal act .
It was a premeditated act .
And anything that says it was OK or good is simply wrong .
Dr. Tiller provided a service that provided constitutionally protected rights for his patients .
And it 's extremely disturbing that the climate of fear is still being generated .
Whether or not it should be used to promote the pro-choice approach is something that I 'll leave up to those who are doing it .
I think the family would just assume people remember Dr. Tiller for the service he gave to women over a long and distinguished career .
MADDOW : Mr. Thompson , what happens next in the case of Scott Roeder ?
I wonder if , legally , you believe that we can conclude from this fundraising effort that he 's going to try to put abortion rights on trial , that he 'll try to put the memory of Dr. Tiller on trial in his own defense ?
THOMPSON : Well , they say the fundraiser is to hire an attorney to advance what 's called the necessity defense , a justification for some violent act .
But that 's been routinely rejected by virtually every court and certainly been rejected by the supreme court of Kansas , which in 1993 , in an abortion case , said , to permit such a defense would invite chaos and perhaps could lead ultimately to anarchy .
So , I can't imagine that any judge sitting in Wichita , Kansas , would go against the Kansas Supreme Court on that issue .
I think that we really do n't see that sort of publicity stunt working in Kansas courts very often .
And I believe - with everything I hold dear - that that will be the case in this case .
MADDOW : Lee Thompson , attorney for Dr. George Tiller 's widow and Dr. Tiller 's estate - I know this has been an upsetting turn of events both for you and Dr. Tiller 's family , thanks for being willing to talk to us about it tonight .
THOMPSON : Appreciate you having us .
Thank you .
BERNE / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Switzerland has agreed to reveal the names of about 4,450 wealthy American clients of UBS AG to U.S. authorities in a tax dispute settlement that pierces Swiss banking secrecy and now threatens to spill over to other banks .
The deal promises to end years of investigation and uncertainty for UBS , which announced later on Wednesday that the Swiss government was exiting the stake it had taken to aid the bank during the financial crisis .
With Switzerland ’s famed banking secrecy under fire , the Swiss have also agreed to process requests by the United States seeking information from banks besides UBS about account holders suspected of evading U.S. taxes .
“ This announcement today should send a signal , no matter what institution you ’re with , the IRS is willing to pursue both the institution and the individual , ” Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Doug Shulman told reporters on Wednesday .
The accounts were at one time worth $ 18 billion , Shulman said , though he could not provide a current figure .
U.S. authorities would not name any other foreign banks being probed , but the IRS is expected to use the Swiss deal as a template to pursue further prosecutions .
“ The IRS is now gaining institutional skill and knowledge in how to pursue these types of cases and they ’re going to use that .
This is , I believe , the beginning and not the end , ” said Peter Hardy , a former federal prosecutor and specialist in white - collar crime at Post & Schell in Philadelphia .
The UBS dispute had strained relations between the United States and Switzerland and challenged the latter ’s jealously guarded bank secrecy laws .
The deal may add steam to a global effort among cash - strapped governments to crack down on tax - evading jurisdictions .
But the settlement could help UBS , the world ’s second - largest wealth manager , restore an image that has been battered by the financial crisis .
UBS said the Swiss government was exiting its 6 billion Swiss franc ( $ 5.6 billion ) stake , with the shares to be placed with institutional investors .
UBS shares fell 2.9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange , ahead of the news of the government exiting its stake , after closing one percent lower in Europe .
Among Swiss rivals , Credit Suisse was down 0.2 percent on the NYSE , while Julius Baer closed down 0.8 percent in Europe .
UBS RELIEF
UBS Chairman Kaspar Villiger said the tax agreement helps resolve one of UBS ’ most pressing issues .
“ I am confident that the agreement will allow the bank to continue moving forward to rebuild its reputation through solid performance and client service . ”
In February , UBS agreed to pay $ 780 million and disclose about 250 client names to settle a criminal probe by U.S. authorities .
One former UBS banker testified that he smuggled a client ’s diamonds into the United States in a tube of toothpaste .
Wednesday ’s deal effectively ends a separate civil lawsuit by U.S. authorities that sought up to 52,000 account names .
There was no further monetary penalty .
“ It ’s good to get this out of the way but the confidence of a lot of clients has been compromised so I ’m not sure we will see inflows return in Q3 .
It will take time to recover reputation from this , ” said Jaap Meijer , an analyst at Evolution Securities in London .

Other Swiss banks are fretting that the U.S. taxman ’s spotlight may now fall on them .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that more European banks have been identified in the U.S. tax probe , including Switzerland ’s Credit Suisse , Julius Baer , Zuercher Kantonalbank and Union Banque Privee ( UBP ) .
TAXPAYERS URGED TO COME FORWARD
Switzerland may claim its banking secrecy remains intact , but some private bankers say it is no longer a selling point for its banks , which will need to offer other skills like wealth management and legacy planning to attract clients .
“ The majority of assets in Swiss private banks are from European Union citizens , ” said David Williams , an analyst at Fox - Pitt Kelton in London .
“ I think it wo n’t be long before we see action from the European Union along similar lines . ”
The revised treaty between the United States and Switzerland would allow action in the case of “ tax fraud and the like ” in the UBS case , the Swiss government said .
Precise details will be published 90 days after the agreement comes into force .
The U.S. government retains the right to go back and use a summons to collect the names , which roughly equal the number of accounts , if the settlement process fails , said IRS chief Shulman .
Shulman said notices from UBS to clients would go out in stages , but warned U.S. citizens to come forward now .
“ Once the Swiss government turns over names , all bets are off , ” Shulman said , noting these clients could face civil and criminal prosecution .
Under a temporary amnesty program in effect until September 23 , U.S. citizens can come forward and declare accounts , pay fines and in general avoid criminal prosecutions .
Taxpayers who turn themselves in voluntarily pay all unpaid taxes plus interest , pay 20 percent of the amount of tax that was underpaid over the past six years , and a penalty of 20 percent of the highest value of that account over six years .
Officials said taxpayers face much harsher punishment if they are discovered by the IRS .
“ You can end owing more than is in the account , when you add up all the liabilities , ” said an IRS official who was not authorized to be named .
The UBS case has boosted the amnesty program .
The agency saw about 400 people come forward during one week in July compared to about 100 during all of 2008 alone .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The contentious debate over health care took a new twist Monday as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced his decision to craft legislation including a public insurance option allowing states to opt out .
Reid 's decision is a major victory for the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party .
Reid , a Nevada Democrat , has been melding legislation from the more conservative Senate Finance Committee and the more liberal Senate Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee .
The Health Committee included a form of the public option in its bill ; the Finance Committee did not .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has insisted that the House of Representatives will pass a health care reform bill including a public option .
President Obama is " pleased that the Senate has decided to include a public option for health coverage , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a written statement .
" He supports the public option because it has the potential to play an essential role in holding insurance companies accountable through choice and competition , " Gibbs said .
Although Obama has indicated his preference for a public option , he has not indicated that he would a veto a bill without one .
Several top Democrats have expressed concern that the traditionally conservative Senate would not pass a bill with a public option .
" While the public option is not a silver bullet , I believe it's an important way to ensure competition and to level the playing field for patients with the insurance industry , " Reid said on Capitol Hill .
Polls show that a wide majority of Americans support a public option , he said .
Individual states would have until 2014 to decide whether they want to opt out , he added .
Reid 's health care bill , which will be given a cost assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , also includes a provision from the Finance Committee bill allowing for the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives that would negotiate collective insurance coverage for members .
Reid hopes his compromise will appeal both to liberal senators insisting on a public option and to conservatives wary of a government - run plan , several Democratic sources said .
The sources said Reid does not have firm commitments for the compromise from 60 senators , the number required to break a Republican - led filibuster .
It is likely he would need that number for even a vote to begin Senate debate .
Reid 's strategy of publicizing his intention is risky , multiple sources also said .
A Reid aide said Sunday , however , that the majority leader is cautiously optimistic , based on a series of conversations with Democratic senators , that he will ultimately find the votes .
" I believe we ... will have the support of my caucus , " Reid said Monday .
An administration official went so far as to call Reid 's move " dangerous " but quickly followed by saying Reid knows his caucus better than anyone and will therefore have the support of the White House .
Reid said he was disappointed that congressional Republicans have almost unanimously opposed Democratic - led reform efforts .
The number of moderate Senate Republicans can now be counted " on two fingers , " he argued .
Reid said he hoped to eventually win over Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe , the lone Republican to back the Finance Committee bill .
Snowe has indicated her preference for a " trigger " provision that would mandate creation of a public health insurance option in the future if specific thresholds for expanded coverage and other changes were not met .
Snowe issued a statement Monday , saying she was " deeply disappointed " with Reid 's decision on the public option .
She argued that a decision in favor of a trigger " could have been the road toward achieving a broader bipartisan consensus in the Senate . "
" It 's unfortunate the Senate majority leader decided to take a different path , because he did say it was a pretty good doggone idea with respect to the trigger in September , so I do n't what has happened to change his mind , " she said later .
" It 's regrettable , because I certainly have worked in good faith all of these months on a bipartisan basis and , as you know , have been standing alone at this point as a Republican to do so because I believe in good public policy , " Snowe added .
Reid said he was " disappointed that the one issue , the public option , has been something that 's frightened " Snowe .
CNN 's Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .

Australia enacted its mandatory bicycle helmet law for all riders in 1991 .
Cycling participation dropped 30 - 40 % after the law was enacted while other nations have enjoyed an increase in cycling during the same period .
Head injuries and concussions by cyclists were declining prior to to the helmet law and continued to decline after the helmet law – with no obvious improvement after the law was enacted .
Here in Canada – the provinces of British Columbia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia have mandatory bicycle helmet laws for all cyclists .
Alberta and Ontario have mandatory helmets for cyclists under 18 .
Although there is no conclusive evidence that helmet laws have reduced head injuries , we do know conclusively that it results in lower participation .
We also know that a reduction in participation increases the risk for cyclists , so helmet laws may have the opposite effect that they had intended when they were introduced .
Over the weekend I became acquainted with internationally acclaimed Australian documentary filmmaker Michael Rubbo .
Rubbo acquired a love for the bicycle late in life and has been creating some wonderful videos and posting to his blog that highlight the state of cycling in Australia as of late .
Rubbo recently attended a conference that discussed the possibility of bringing Montreal ’s BIXI bicycle - sharing system to Melbourne , Australia .
The filmmaker rightfully pointed out that success of a bicycling program in a country with mandatory helmet laws will be extraordinarily difficult .
As I watched Rubin ’s video on bicycle sharing yesterday , I was surprised to see a photo flash on the screen of myself on a BIXI bicycle with Montreal ’s beautiful Jacques Cartier bridge in the background .
This revelation triggered an email that led to a pleasant conversation between Rubbo and I .
Rubbo is a fascinating man and at 70 years old he does n’t look a day over 50 .
It ’s a pleasure to talk about bicycle sharing with the man who is said to have inspired Michael Moore to film his first movie “ Roger and Me ” with his 1974 documentary “ Waiting for Fidel ” .
In Rubbo ’s video on bicycle sharing , he proposes the idea of rescinding the mandatory helmet law in Australia but he is told “ it ’s not touchable politically ” .
Is 18 years too much of an investment for a country to admit that it was blatantly wrong in enacting the mandatory helmet law ?
Changing the helmet legislation would surely have a positive impact on the environment , people ’s health , gridlock , and yes – cycling safety .
The more cyclists we get on the streets , the safer it will be for everyone – and the infrastructure will follow as a result .
This is the type of safety that a helmet can’t provide .
A change to the helmet law would n’t have a significant impact on most existing cyclists – even Rubbo admits that he would continue to wear his helmet even if the law were removed – but he wants to have the right to choose whether to wear it or not .
Bravo to Rubbo for promoting cycling in Australia .
If his country does n’t do the right thing and roll back its existing law , it just might be the last country in the Western world to adopt the new era of cycling culture – and that would indeed be a shame .
In the video below entitled “ Biking Up the Wrong tree ” , Rubbo and his friend Bruce cycled around Sydney for 6 hours on a beautiful day and sadly – they only saw 6 other cyclists .
In a beautiful city like Sydney , this is a tragedy .

Paul L. Bloom , a lawyer in the Carter administration ’s Energy Department who pursued oil companies for overcharging and won billions of dollars in refunds for customers , the government and others , died Oct. 10 in Chevy Chase , Md. He was 70 .
The cause was pancreatic cancer , his family said .
James Schlesinger , as the first secretary of the new Department of Energy , appointed Mr. Bloom in 1977 to investigate oil companies ’ compliance with oil pricing regulations .
President Richard M. Nixon had begun oil price controls as a temporary measure at the time of the Arab oil embargo of 1973 , but enforcement of the regulations was lax .
Mr. Bloom , as special counsel for compliance , ended up accusing 33 of the 35 largest oil producers and refiners of overcharges amounting to $ 11 billion .
By 1987 , the government had collected $ 6 billion in refunds as a result of Mr. Bloom ’s suits .
But other than the pleasures of success , it was often a thankless job .
Oil companies complained , with some justification , that the rules , and Mr. Bloom ’s interpretations , were maddeningly arcane .
Economists said price controls , by definition , weakened market efficiency .
Consumer groups criticized Mr. Bloom as being too willing to settle cases , often on terms favorable to the industry .

CHICAGO -- Music serves as a natural and non-invasive intervention for patients with severe neurological disorders to promote long - term memory , social interaction and communication .
However , there is currently no plausible explanation of its neural basis for why and how music affects physical and psychosocial responses .
Origins of music perception in humans may have their foundation in animal communication calls , as evidenced here in non-human primates .
Many speech sounds and animal vocalizations , for instance , contain components , commonly referred to as complex tones , which consist of a fundamental frequency ( f0 ) and higher harmonics .
Using electrophysiological recording techniques to study the neuronal activities in the auditory cortex of awake monkeys , researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center 's have shown neurons tuned to the fundamental frequencies and harmonic sounds , and such neural mechanisms of harmonic processing lay close to tonotopically organized auditory areas .
They presented their findings at the 39th annual meeting Society of Neuroscience .
" The understanding of neural mechanism of ' innate ' music features in non-human primates will facilitate an improved understanding of music perception in the human nervous system , " explains Yuki Kikuchi , PhD , a research associate in the department of physiology and biophysics .
" This will allow a neurobiological framework from which to understand the basis of the effectiveness of music therapeutic interventions . "

The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health .
Kikuchi reports no related financial interests .

Thin is in , whether you ’re talking TVs , cell phones , or laptops .
In fact , thin electronics are downright hot , literally .
The trend in electronics toward miniaturization squeezes more chips into ever smaller devices , leading to intense heat buildup .
Toasty notebook PCs create more problems than just scorched thighs .
Excessive heat can cause slowdowns and lockups in demanding applications like videos and games .
Over the long term , overheating shortens the life of processors and chip sets in notebooks and other downsized electronics .
So the race is on to create more compact and efficient ways to cool off sensitive components .
Most PCs today use fans and heat sinks to dissipate the warmth .
But as laptops get thinner , fans have downsized too , becoming less efficient in the process .
To tackle this problem , Tessera , a mini­ature technologies provider based in San Jose , California , is working on a solid - state alternative that tests have shown can remove the same amount of heat from a laptop as a conventional fan — but do so more quietly and using half the power .
Tessera ’s Silent Air Cooling Technology ( ACT ) is based on electrohydrodynamics , which uses charged ions rather than a mechanical device to create airflow .
Ionic flow applications have been around for years ; copiers use them , but they are probably best known for use in air purification products .
Tessera , building on early research out of the University of Washington , is taking electro­hydrodynamics for thermal management of electronics to the next level .
Tessera still has to prove it has solved issues of dust contamination and reliability before Silent ACT can go to volume production and become a viable alternative to fan - based systems .
Dust is a major cause of failure in fan coolers , and company engineers are studying its impact in the ionic environment .
Craig Mitchell , senior vice president of interconnect , components , and materials at Tessera , cannot yet put a price tag on the new technology , promising only that “ we will be in the ballpark that we need to be in . ”
Laptops and the emerging netbook market are phase one for Silent ACT , but Tessera is looking at other categories of electronics that call for more efficient and quiet thermal management .
Noisy game players , video projectors , digital video recorders , and media servers are ready and waiting .
HOW IT WORKS
Image Steve Karp | NULL
Tessera ’s Silent Air Cooling
Technology uses charged air molecules to create an airstream that removes heat without any moving parts .
The system employs an electrohydrodynamic blower that draws power from the PC .
In the device , voltage is applied to a positively charged electrode , creating a high - intensity electric field that ionizes surrounding air molecules .
Because opposite charges attract , the positive ions move toward the negative electrode , colliding with neutral air molecules en route .
In the process , charge and momentum transfer to those molecules , which are swept along .
The displaced warm air is dispersed through fins , eliminating the need for a fan .
President Obama singled out the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Friday as a special interest lining up to kill his efforts at protecting American consumers from unscrupulous financial services .
In the East Room of the White House , just hours after learning that he had won the Nobel Peace Prize , Obama aggressively criticized banks and financial services companies for unfair practices , and he urged Congress to act to pass reform creating a Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
ADVERTISEMENT
The agency , Obama said , would have " just one mission : to look out for the financial interests of ordinary Americans . "
" It will be charged with setting clear rules of the road for consumers and banks , and it will be able to enforce those rules across the board , " Obama said .
Banks and other financial services companies have come out forcefully against the idea of creating such an entity , drawing fierce criticism from Obama .
"
In fact , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending millions on an ad campaign to kill it , " Obama said .
" You might have seen some of these ads — the ones that claim local butchers and other small businesses will somehow be harmed by this agency .
This is , of course , completely false — and we ’ve made clear that only businesses that offer financial services would be affected by this agency .
" I do n't know how many of your butchers are offering financial services . "
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a statement in anticipation of the president 's remarks saying the proposed CFPA would " exacerbate the weaknesses of the current system " and " restrict access to credit . "
The president was preceded at Friday 's event by ordinary Americans who had been subjected to dramatic , unfair practices , leading the president to declare that the " patchwork system of regulations we have now has failed to prevent these abuses . "
Obama said that " seven different federal agencies each having a role , there is too little accountability , too many loopholes and no single agency whose sole job it is to stand up for people " like those joining the president in the East Room .
Ask around and you ’ll likely find a fellow G1 user who can say that their handset gets unreasonably warm at times .
Â
Whether plugged in or not , the back side of the phone has been known to heat up quite a bit . Â
A fellow Android blogger from AndroidWorld.nl sent us an email this morning about one of their writers who had a battery heat up to the point of melting the cover .
One of my bloggers experienced exactly the same with his G1 , no explosion , but the back cover melted because of the ( battery ) heat .
Still awaiting the answer from T - mobile … After a normal phonecall , so no cables connected .
Apparently , the phone still works and they ’re waiting to hear back from T - Mobile .
You ’ll notice in the pictures that the case is not melted directly over the battery but closer to the SIM card .
This is the spot where many of us have experienced the warm and not so fuzzy feeling .
Anyone else out there have a phone heat up to the point it literally melts your case ?
Miscellaneous thoughts about anything , either topical or not , that arouses my interest .
Fail - Safe C is a memory - safe implementation of the full ANSI C language .
More precisely , it detects and disallows all unsafe operations , yet conforming to the full ANSI C standard ( including casts and unions ) and even supporting many “ dirty tricks ” common in many existing programs which do not strictly conform to the standard .
This work also proposes several techniques --- both compile - time and runtime --- to reduce the overhead of runtime checks .
By using the Fail - Safe C compiler , programmers can easily make their programs safe without performing heavy rewriting or porting of their code .

My first time was outside my college when I was 16 .
I remember it well .
Everyone remembers their first time .
She was beautiful .
The most gorgeous mountain bike you have ever seen .
Sure it was just a £ 200 bike from JJB Sports but I was young and I was in love .
I looked around at the exact spot where I had left it but it was nowhere to be seen .
I ’m sure a lot of people can recall their first time .
Now we all know how to lock our bikes but maybe some times in takes more than that .
Maybe it takes a little bit of thinking outside the box .
A little bit of “ blue sky thinking ” if you will .
The first way to achieve this enlightened state of mind is to step into the shoes of a criminal .
In my criminal heyday I stole a packet of cigarettes and maybe a few sweets from the local shop .
The packet of cigarettes was a long time ago and the sweets was last Sunday .
I ’m kidding , they were both a long time ago .
So , I ’m not exactly what you may call a criminal mastermind .
Yet , despite not been a criminal mastermind this is where I come across my first obstacle to unconventional prevention ideas .
If I was a thief and I liked stealing things what I would not steal is beat up old bikes .
Yet , both my bikes that have been stolen were not worth more than £ 50 second hand .
This puts a major dampener on my first unconventional idea : making your bike look ugly .
So if making your bike look undesirable is n’t a guaranteed solution what is ?
My second idea is removing parts of your bike when you leave it locked .
For example taking off the front wheel and locking it in a separate location ?
Then Mr
Thief comes along , sees a bike with a missing front wheel and thinks : “ unless I ’m the king of wheelies there ’s no way I ’m stealing that ” .
I do n’t think this is such a bad idea .
Though of course it is a pain having to find a location to leave my bike and then another location to leave my wheel and then having to rejoin the two .
Even with a quick release it still takes time .
Another idea which may work well is to personalise the bike .
When research was done into which wallets were returned and which were not they came to an interesting conclusion .
Putting a picture of a baby in your wallet greatly improved your chances of being reunited .
Perhaps this could also work with bikes .
Perhaps I should print a picture of a baby and put it on my bike .
I would certainly get some funny looks .
Though a funny idea , I would presume a bike that had been heavily personalised would not be as sellable .
So maybe you should litter it with stickers ?
The obvious downside to this is I do n’t particularly want to make my bike look silly .
However , this is good , were definitely getting somewhere with our unconventional thinking .
Let ’s take it to the extreme level .
What if bikes were so cheap there was no point stealing one ?
What if everyone in the world was automatically given a bike for life as soon as they are born ?
What if we banned selling of second hand bikes ?
What if all bikes were fitted with GPS tracking ?
What if your bike would n’t move without finger print identification ?
Okay , let ’s cut back on the extreme thinking a little .
For a start whilst the price of bikes may continue to fall , the most desirable bikes will no doubt remain expensive and thus there will still be a market for them .
Banning second hand bike sales would be unworkable and wasteful and GPS tracking would no doubt be expensive .
A bike for life could potentially work and would be very interesting .
Throwing these ideas around is a good thought exercise but one day I ’m hopeful our bike theft problems may eventually solve themselves .
If the number of cyclists continues to increase then maybe one day a bike will become such a commodity that we do n’t even think about it .
It would be like someone trying to steal your vacuum cleaner .
For now I ’ll continue locking my bike with two different locks , in well lit areas , near to other bikes but I just might add a few personal touches .

The UK team aiming to smash its own land speed record by driving a car beyond 1,000 mph ( 1,610 km /h ) has settled on a final design for the vehicle .
It calls for a major re-configuration of the vehicle 's two power units , with a Eurofighter jet engine now being positioned above a hybrid rocket .
The car , known as Bloodhound , will be built in Bristol 's docklands .
The team expects to start running the vehicle on the Hakskeen Pan , Northern Cape Province , South Africa , in 2011 .
The dried - out lake bed had the perfect surface for the record attempt , said Bloodhound 's driver , Wing Commander Andy Green .
" It 's hard enough to support a six - tonne car on metal wheels but soft enough to allow the wheels just to sink in maybe 10 mm , " he told BBC News .
Thrust SSC broke the sound barrier when it claimed the record " That gives the damping , or compliance , we need ; but it also gives me the lateral grip that allows me to steer the car at slow - to - medium speeds .
At high speeds , it 's not so important because the bits of the wheel that stick out of the bottom of the car act as an effective rudder . "
Andy Green set the current World Land Speed Record in 1997 when he drove the Thrust SSC jet - powered vehicle at 763 mph ( 1,228 km / h ) .
The RAF pilot is now returning for a crack at his own mark in a project led by his old team principal , Richard Noble , himself a former land speed record holder .
Many of the original Thrust design and engineering staff are also involved .
The Bloodhound group hopes the quest to take a car through 1,000 mph will be an inspirational venture , in particular to young children thinking of pursuing careers in science and technology .
' OOMPH ' NEEDED FOR 1,000MPH
Car will feature largest hybrid rocket ever designed in UK EJ200 jet engine is same unit that powers UK 's frontline aircraft Total of 212 kN ( 47,500lb ) of thrust - about the same as 180 F1 cars
The project was launched into the public domain in October 2008 .
Since then , intensive efforts have been under way to finalise the car 's design - one that maximises the vehicle 's performance and stability .
The original plan was to position a small ( 200 kg ) rocket above a heavier ( 1,000kg ) EJ200 Eurofighter Typhoon engine loaned to the team by Britain 's Ministry of Defence .
However , as the design staff worked through the modelling , it became clear that additional thrust was going to be needed to overcome the aerodynamic drag .
This called for a bigger ( 400 kg ) rocket .
This in turn introduced instabilities that could only be solved by flipping the positions of the two power units .
" We have switched the architecture of the rocket and the jet engine and the reason for that was we were seeing some quite high lift loads at the rear end of the car , " explained chief designer John Piper .
" The change , though , has had some beneficial side - effects , he added .
" We can now get a good chassis structure across the top which means we can now have a really good mounting for a single fin , whereas before with the rocket on top it was right in the way of where the fin would go .
That meant we were going to have to have two fins , one on each side ; and they were occupying the space where ideally we'd like to put in parachute cans .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" So , there 've been lots of small gains out of this . "
With the design now fixed , the car can be built .
This will be done at a special facility in Bristol 's docklands area , right next to Brunel 's famous iron ship SS Great Britain .
Bloodhound is a private venture .
Although it has substantial in - kind support through the MoD in the loan of two EJ200s , it has to raise some £ 10 m of funds to complete the record attempt .
Major sponsors include the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin which has helped in designing Bloodhound 's aluminium wheels ; and Intel which has assisted the modelling work by making available one of the largest computer clusters in the country .
Bloodhound now has more than 2,410 primary and secondary schools , 98 further education colleges and 33 universities signed up and using the Bloodhound education resources in their lessons .

WHAT DO YOU DO when you have a major conference planned to introduce a card , but you do n’t have a card ?
You fake it , and Nvidia did just that .
In a really pathetic display , Nvidia actually faked the introduction of its latest video card , because it simply does n’t have boards to show .
Why ?
Because it did n’t get enough parts to properly bring them up , much less make demo boards .
Why do we say they are faked ?
If you look at the pictures , it is painfully obvious that Fermi cards do n’t exist .
Well , painful if you happen to be Dear Leader who waved fakes around and hopes to get away with it , but hilarious if you are anyone not working at Nvidia .
Lets go through this in pictures , shall we ?
Please note , none of the pictures are ours , and since you can find them on many other sites , they are likely Nvidia PR material .
Since the company seems to have forgotten to mail us a copy , we will point to the ones at PC Watch .
Fermi chip heat spreader closeup
The first one is from the always great PC Watch , specifically here , but we cropped it a bit for size .
Some things to note on it .
First is that the second set of digits on the first line says 0935A1 .
A1 is for first silicon , something that , when coupled with a direct quote from Jen - Hsun of , “ You are currently looking at a few day old silicon ” ( from here select the video “ See video of Jen - Hsun Huang announcing Fermi ” ) kind of blows the whole ‘ silicon in Santa Clara last spring ’ story out of the water .
I wonder if anyone will retract that , or just change the article retroactively ?
To make matters worse , the other digits are a date code , 0935 means 2009 , work week 35 .
If Nvidia starts its work week on the first full week of the year like everyone else , that would put WW35 at August 28 to September 5 , 2009 .
Where have I heard that date before ?
Oh yeah , here .
Last but not least , you have the funniest part , the number seven hand written on the GPU .
While this is n’t proof of anything , normally when you have small lots of samples , you write numbers on them to identify which one is which as an aid to debugging .
Where did we hear that number seven again ?
Oh yeah , here again .
Here is a free tip to Nvidia PR , when you go after people who are right to try and undermine their credibility , at least be correct , or close to it .
You were neither this time .
Another tip , coach your messengers better , or at least have them read the article you are attacking .
Poor showing guys .
Did Intel hire away your best attack dogs along with your engineers ?
‘ Fermi ’ end plate closeup
The next one is also from PC Watch , specifically here , again cropped to emphasize detail .
Notice how the end plate vents on the second slot are blocked off ?
That gives a lot of cooling , eh ?
You really want to have early samples well cooled so you get good data off of them , and also so you do n’t damage 14.3 % of your chips at once .
Then there are the screws .
Notice that the three screws that hold the end plate on are , well , generic wood screws .
Large flat head phillips screws .
Home Depot grade screws that do n’t even sit flush .
If a card is real , you hold it on with the bolts on either side of the DVI connector .
Go look at any GPU you have , do you see wood screws that do n’t mount flush or DVI flanking bolts ?
5870 on top of a 4890 , both real
As you can see from the picture above of my Radeon HD5870 sitting on my HD4890 , the end plate is more than capable of being held on without wood screws .
It mounts to the PCB via a bolt or two , sometimes solder , and the soldered down DVI pins that go through the PCB VIAs .
The back of the ‘ Fermi ’ endplate
If you look at the back of the fake Fermi , above cropped from PC Watch here , you can see that the expected DVI connector wires are not there , just solder filled holes .
No stubs , no tool marks from where they would be cut out .
Basically , the DVI port is n’t connected to anything with solder , so they had to use screws on the plate .
Compare and contrast this to the 4890 and 5870 above , which , unlike the Fermi , are real .
Also , note that the second SLI connector is half covered by the shroud .
I wonder how much bandwidth that adds ?
Nvidia ’s comedy team strikes again , as long as your initials are not JHH .
If they are , you look pretty silly in front of thousands of people .
In fact , if you look at the video , you can see the wood screws .
You can also see them in the well watermarked photo on Fudzilla here , but I doubt Nvidia will be so happy when it realizes that the word is out .
If you look at the back of the card below , taken from the same PC Watch pic as the last one , again cropped , the hilarity continues .
The card has two power connectors , one on the end , the other on the top of the card , bottom of the picture .
‘ Fermi ’ power connectors and back of the board
Look closely , the 8 - pin connector on the end does n’t line up with the 8 - pin solder joints , they are 90 degrees off , and there are two extra heavy duty solder through holes right up to the back edge of the PCB .
Those lead to … well , not the power connector .
PCIe specs make the pins on the 8 - pin connector far too deep for it to be them .
In fact , it ca n’t really run to anything , since the 8 - pin connectors would block it .
The 6 - pin connector , on the other hand , lines up with , umm , nothing .
There is a potential 4 - pin floppy / sound / jumper block below it , but you can clearly see there is nothing in the vias , not even solder .
The 6 - pin connector connects to nothing , and nothing is holding it in .
Except glue .
Notice the connector is black and the hole below it shows white .
The only real question now is , Elmers or glue stick ?
To make matters worse , the mounting holes for the 8 - pin connector , which should be between the 6 - pin and 8 - pin fakes if the card was real , are empty .
Piss - poor fake job guys .
Go read your fanboi forums , they do a better job , and work for much cheaper than your ‘ geniuses ’ .
The two solder connections under the 8 - pin connector on the end of the card are likely connected to a 6 - pin connector that normally is next to where the 8 - pin on top was before it was removed .
The problem here is that there are two solder holes , four are missing , almost like they ran off the end of the card and were chopped off .
But that would mean the PCB was crudely cut off with base power tools , not even proper PCB making equipment , in order to fake Fermi .
If you do n’t even look all that closely , you will see two barcode stickers on the bottom side of the card end .
They are literally cut in half , about what you would expect if Dear Leader came down and ordered a crude fake .
That is unfair , he would never order workers to make a crude fake , he would order a high quality fake , and Nvidia engineering would deliver a crude one .
You should also note that the mounting holes for the 6 - pin connector are so close to the edge of the PCB that they would offer no real mechanical support and simply crack if used .
No engineer would do that , they would make a longer board .
And they did .
And Nvidia chopped it off to fake Fermi .
Several other bits look oddly truncated as well .
The chips arrived when I said they did , in the number I said they did .
Nvidia did n’t like this , so it used Fudo , who I honestly have the highest respect for , in a way that trashed his reputation .
It has been trying to do this for a long time , and sadly , it looks to be getting close to success .
The board has wood screws crudely driven through it .
The vents on the end plate are blocked .
The DVI connector is not soldered to anything , The SLI connectors are somewhat covered by a heat shield .
The 8 - pin power connector is connected to nothing .
The 6 - pin connector is connected to the PCB with glue , not pins and solder .
The board is crudely chopped off with power tools .
The 8 - pin connector that should be there is not .
The 6 - pin connector that should be there is cut .
The mounting holes are too close to the edge .
There are also likely many more flaws , but this should be enough to prove a point .
In the end , what you have here is a faked Fermi board .
Jen - Hsun held up a scam card .
If you watch the video here , he says , “ This puppy here , is Fermi ” .
Bullshit .

Note 1 : Nvidia PR was asked to comment on the faked cards earlier this evening .
Their reply was , “ I ’m glad you ’re asking us before you write .
That statement is false .
The product that we displayed was an actual Fermi board .
The demo ran on Fermi silicon . ”
We do not believe all of that statement .
Note 2 : Thanks to readers Michael and Bill for emailing about this while it was being written .
Note 3 : Thanks to the forum denziens , starting here , who are already on top of this story .
Note 4 : Thanks to PC
Watch for putting up such great pictures .
Note 5 : Thanks to Nvidia for providing such great source material for articles .
Update 1 : Those screws may be either wood , sheet metal screws , or machine screws .
Some have suggested self - tapping sheet metal screws .
Either way , they are not something that one finds on graphics cards , and you can likely get them at Home Depot .
As far as we know , Home Depot does not sell the bolts typically used to secure end plates , nor does it sell prototype graphics card kits .
If you stop and think about it , that plastic that the screws go in to is not thick enough to provide any real support .
Screws hold better when put into capacitors , chokes , heat pipes , heatsinks , fan components and the occasional IC .
Update 2 : Nvidia seems to have come out and retroactively told everyone and their brother that the board in question was either a mockup , prototype , engineering sample or several other terms .
It has tried to tell everyone on the planet that it was n’t fake , just ( insert words other than fake here ) .
Nvidia has not to date officially notified SemiAccurate that we were correct .
Their last official comment to us on the subject , prior to publication , was , “ Charlie , It sounds to me like what you ’re about to write is patently false .
I ’ve spoken to at least four people involved in this and they are all telling me the same thing . ”
Nvidia has , to date , not explained why it gave SemiAccurate “ patently false ” information in the first place .
Update 3 : When asked initially , a simple response of , “ Yes it was a mockup , Jen - Hsun used non-technical language to describe the part ” would have made this a non-story .
Instead , it is a great story about corporate lies and public deception .
I ’ve written before that you ca n’t receive the national BBC radio stations on your iPhone , because it does n’t play Flash .
The workaround is to use the fantastic BBCStreams service , which transcodes the radio signal into a format that the free FStream app can play .
I ’ve used this service for a while , and it works pretty well , even over the mobile network .
And they ’ve been busy : BBCStreams has just announced that you can now listen to all 45 BBC local radio stations , plus BBC Radio Russia and BBC Radio Arabic .
They also have plans for an iPhone app that will allow you to listen to the Beeb ’s radio ouput , including when you ’re overseas .
But they need your support .
There have been rumours recently that Apple is planning an app that will enable the FM reception capability of the chip within the iPhone 3GS and 3rd generation iPod Touch , much like the FM radio on the latest iPod Nano .
While this is good news , it does n’t do anything for owners of earlier versions of the iPod Touch and iPhone .
So the news that I will be able to listen to more BBC radio is very welcome .
Here ’s what the BBCStreams app will offer :
A dedicated app for playing all BBC radio stations ( including regional stations ) , internationally
Play other independent UK radio stations , again internationally
Eliminate the need for inputting long stream URLs in FStream
The iPhone application will be free , and will not have any built - in advertising .
The anticipated release date is 1st December 2009 .
What ’s the catch ?
There ’s always a catch , is n’t there ?
The problem is that streaming all this radio and developing the app costs money , and they need £ 370 to keep things going .
So , if you ’d like to see the service continue , and the app be built , then you ’ll have to cough up .
BBCStreams have also said that :
“ Everybody who donates will be mentioned in the credits of the application if they would like , with a link to their company or web address if they would like that too ! ”
If you do n’t have an iPhone , this does n’t leave you out – BBCStreams broadcast in Windows Media ( .asx ) format , so you can receive it on newer Nokia N series phones , or any phone that can install Coreplayer Mobile .
So if you ’re interested , the donate link is here :
http://ivirtua.chipin.com/keeping-bbcstreamscom-online-for-another-year.
They need to hit their target by October 27th , when their hosting bill is due .
This service is especially useful given that the BBC are removing their Real Media streams , which will reduce the ability of people to access their stations .
Yes , of course , the Beeb should be doing streaming all this themselves in more accessible formats , but until they do , this is a service worth supporting .
