LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Tom McCarthy , writer - director of “ The Visitor , ” will direct HBO ’s fantasy pilot “ Game of Thrones , ” which will feature Peter Dinklage -- the star of McCarthy ’s first feature , “ The Station Agent ” -- in a key role .
Based on George R.R. Martin ’s best - selling “ Songs of Fire and Ice ” novels , “ Thrones ” is described as the story of an epic struggle for power set in a vast and violent fantasy kingdom .
Dinklage will play Tyrion , the Queen ’s brother who is treated as an outsider because of his size .
David Benioff and D.B. Weiss wrote the pilot script .
“ Thrones ” is slated to film in the third quarter in Belfast , Northern Ireland , in what First Minister Peter Robinson hails as “ the first TV production of such vast size and scale ” to film in the country .
Dinklage is filming two comedy features : the indie “ Pete Smalls Is Dead , ” and the remake of “ Death at a Funeral . ”
“ Thrones ” marks the first TV directorial gig for McCarthy , an actor who received Independent Spirit Awards for both his features as writer - director .
On the acting side , McCarthy next appears in the disaster thriller “ 2012 . ”

Well , well .
The New York Times has finally put a story together on the key role that two controversial psychologists played in devising the Bush administration ’s torture policies .
Guess we should be thankful for small favors .
Until now , Bush has managed to escape blame for his outrageous inactivity before 9/11 because his subordinates – first and foremost , Tenet – have covered up for him .
Faustian bargain ?
Call it mutual blackmail , if you prefer the vernacular .
Apparently , a NYTimes “ exposé ” requires a 21 - month gestation period ; just by way of pointing out that the substance of the Times “ exposé ” appeared in an article the July 2007 issue of Vanity Fair .
Katherine Eban , a Brooklyn - based journalist who writes about public health , authored that article and titled it “ Rorschach and Awe . ”
It was the result of a careful effort to understand the role of psychologists in the torture of detainees in Guantánamo .
She identified the two psychologists as James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , who she reported were inexperienced in interrogations and “ had no proof of their tactics ’ effectiveness ” but nevertheless sold the Bush administration on a plan to subject captives to “ psychic demolition , ” essentially severing them from their personalities and scaring them “ almost to death . ”
In Wednesday ’s New York Times , reporters Scott Shane and Mark Mazzetti plow much the same ground .
But please do not misunderstand .
They deserve praise for finally pushing their own article past the Times ‘ censors , but let ’s not pretend the startling revelations are new .
The Times ought to allow the likes of Shane and Mazzetti to publish these stories when they are fresh .
Alternatively , the “ newspaper of record ” might at least report the findings of the likes of Eban , rather than ignoring them for nearly two years .
It ’s pretty much all out there now , is n’t it ?
Not only the Times ‘ better - late - than - never “ exposé , ” but also :
– The ( leaked ) text of the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on the torture of “ high - value ” detainees ;
– The too - slick - by - half “ legal opinions ” under Department of Justice letterhead ;
– The findings of the 18 - month investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committee highlighting that it was President George W. Bush ’s dismissal of Geneva ( in his executive order of Feb. 7 , 2002 ) that “ opened the door ” to abuse of detainees .
The North / Gonzales Shredder
One issue of some urgency has been overlooked in the media , but probably not by those complicit in torture by the CIA and other parts of the government .
That issue is the need to protect evidence from being shredded .
I have seen no sign that Director of National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair , or CIA Director Leon Panetta , have proscribed the destruction of documents / tapes / etc. relating to torture , while decisions on if and how to proceed are being worked out .
Many will remember how Oliver North ( when the crimes of Iran - Contra were uncovered ) and Alberto Gonzales ( when White House involvement in the Valerie Plame affair was suggested ) made such good use of the days of hiatus between the announced decision to investigate and the belated decision to safeguard all evidence from destruction .
One would think that Attorney General Eric Holder , or President Barack Obama himself , would have long since issued such an order .
Indeed , the absence of such an order would suggest they would just as soon avoid as many of the painful truths about torture as they can .
The issue would seem particularly urgent in the wake of Obama ’s gratuitous get - out - of - jail free card issued to CIA personnel complicit in torture .
They might well draw the ( erroneous ) conclusion that they have been , in effect , pardoned by the President and thus are within the law in destroying relevant evidence — to the degree that being within the law matters any more .
And what about the President ’s decision not to prosecute those in CIA who engaged in torture ?
What is going on here ?
Obama ’s defensive tone on the recent release of the four torture documents issued by the Mafia - style lawyers of the Justice Department does n’t square with what should be the attitude of a specialist in constitutional law .
Oddly , the President and his people seem to think they must justify the release .
In the face of Rush Limbaugh / Dick Cheney - type charges that the revelations endanger national security , they argue that most of the information was already in the public domain ( in the recently leaked report of the International Committee of the Red Cross , for example ) .
Hey , Mr. constitutional - law professor and now President , how about the fact that the Freedom of Information Act requires your administration to release such information ?
How about acknowledging that you are just obeying the law — or is that quaint , obsolete , or somehow passé these days ?
Misplaced Loyalty or Fear ?
It is highly unusual for the President to feel it necessary to visit CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia .
Vivid in my memory is the visit by President George W. Bush on Sept. 26 , 2001 , just two weeks after the intelligence / defense / policy failures permitted the attacks of September 11 .
For some time it remained something of a puzzle , why the President felt it prudent to appear at CIA with his arm around then - CIA Director George Tenet , endorsing his leadership without reservation and bragging about having the best intelligence service in the world .
In retrospect , it was a Faustian bargain .
[ efoods ]
Former CIA Director and Medal of Freedom winner , George Tenet , can be forgiven for being somewhat apprehensive these days — especially in the wake of the article by Shane and Mazzetti .
But let ’s leave aside for now the obviously heinous – like running George W. Bush ’s global Gestapo complete with secret prisons and torture chambers , a criminal enterprise that Tenet shoe - horned into the operations directorate of the CIA .
Let ’s pick a case of simpler , more familiar white - collar crimes – Scooter Libby - style perjury and obstruction of justice .
Those who remember Watergate and other crimes will be aware that the cover - up constitutes an additional – and often more provable – crime , especially when it involves perjury and obstruction of justice .
Until now , Bush has managed to escape blame for his outrageous inactivity before 9/11 because his subordinates – first and foremost , Tenet – have covered up for him .
Faustian bargain ?
Call it mutual blackmail , if you prefer the vernacular .
Tenet gave the President enough warning to warrant , to compel some sort of action on his part .
But Tenet ’s lackadaisical management of the CIA and intelligence community was at least as important a factor in the success of the 9/11 attacks .
Tenet should have been fired after 9/11 .
But President Bush needed Tenet , or at least Tenet ’s silence , as much as Tenet needed Bush , or at least Bush ’s forgiveness .
What developed might be described as a case of mutual blackmail disguised as bonhomie .
Bush was keenly aware that Tenet had the wherewithal to let the world know how many warnings he had given the President – reducing Bush to a criminally negligent , blundering fool .
Were that to happen , Bush would have to kiss goodbye the role of cheerleader / war president – and so much else .
Thus , Tenet had become critical to Bush ’s political survival .
And Tenet ?
All he needed was not to be blamed – not to be fired .
The bargain : I , George Bush , will keep you on and even praise your performance ; you , George Tenet , will keep your mouth shut about all the warnings you gave me during the spring and summer of 2001 .
Tenet , it seems clear , agreed .
On Sept. 26 , 2001 , the President motored out to CIA headquarters , puts his arm around Tenet and told the cameras , “ We ’ve got the best intelligence we can possibly have thanks to the men and women of the CIA . ”
In his sworn testimony of April 14 , 2004 , before the 9/11 Commission , Tenet outdid himself trying to honor his bargain with Bush .
The commissioners were interested in what the president had been told during the critical month of August 2001 .
Answering a question from Commissioner Timothy Roemer , Tenet referred to the President ’s long vacation ( July 29 - Aug. 30 , 2001 ) in Crawford and insisted that he did not see the President at all in August .
“ You never talked with him ? ” Roemer asked .
“ No , ” Tenet replied , explaining that for much of August he , too , was “ on leave . ”
That same evening , a CIA spokesman called reporters to say that Tenet had misspoken , and that he had briefed Bush on Aug. 17 and 31 , 2001 .
The spokesman played down the Aug. 17 briefing as uneventful and indicated that the second briefing took place after Bush had returned to Washington .
Funny how Tenet could have forgotten his first visit to Crawford , whereas in his memoir , At the Center of the Storm , Tenet waxed eloquent about the “ president graciously driving me around the spread in his pickup and me trying to make small talk about the flora and the fauna . ”
But the visit was not limited to small talk .
In his book , Tenet writes : “ A few weeks after the August 6 PDB was delivered , I followed it to Crawford to make sure the president stayed current on events . ”
The Aug. 6 , 2001 , President ’s Daily Brief contained the article “ Bin Laden Determined to Strike in the US . ”
According to Ron Suskind ’s The One - Percent Doctrine , the President reacted by telling the CIA briefer , “ All right , you ’ve covered your ass now . ”
Clearly , Tenet needed to follow up on that .
Was Tenet again in Crawford just one week later ?
According to a White House press release , President Bush on Aug. 25 told visitors to Crawford , “ George Tenet and I ” drove up the canyon “ yesterday . ”
If , as Tenet says in his memoir , it was the Aug. 6 , 2001 , PDB that prompted his visit on Aug. 17 , what might have brought him back on Aug. 24 ?
That was the day after Tenet had been briefed on Zacarias Moussaoui training to fly a 747 and other suspicion - arousing information .
The evidence is very strong that Tenet told Bush chapter and verse .
The extraordinary lengths to which Tenet has gone to disguise that has the former CIA director skating very close to perjury – if not over the line .
A note on Moussaoui : despite strong encouragement from FBI special agent / lawyer Coleen Rowley at the time , the government never interviewed Moussaoui for information on a possible “ second wave ” of 9/11 - type attacks .
Moussaoui knew Richard Reid , the shoe - bomber who almost downed an airliner on its way from London to the U.S. , and might have provided forewarning , were he to been asked in the three months between 9/11 and Reid ’s attempt in December 2001 .
It gets worse : it does not seem that Reid was effectively interviewed either .
This greatly diminishes the credibility of arguments that torture was felt to be necessary because of overweening fear of follow - up attacks .
The administration claims it was pulling out all the stops – while , in reality , it failed to take rudimentary steps to acquire information from suspected terrorists already in our custody .
Obama ’s Faustian Bargain ?
In a recent article on torture , I asked what might be holding the administration back on moving forward with investigation and holding accountable those proven guilty , in order to end this shameful chapter in American history once and for all .
A reader offered an answer :
What ’s holding them back ?
I ’ll tell you , she said .
His name is John D. Rockefeller , IV .
He and other Democratic ( as well as Republican ) lawmakers knew of the torture and did nothing , she added .
The writer gave her name as Kathleen Rockefeller ; she described herself as a cousin with courage .
The disclosures in the Shane / Mazzetti article today , and plenty of other evidence suggest that Ms. Rockefeller in not far off the mark .
Powerful forces are working on our President .
Maybe , just maybe , he insisted on releasing those torture memos with the thought that the rest of us would be appropriately outraged — so outraged that we would put inexorable pressure on him to hold everyone , repeat everyone , accountable .

Be careful of that raunchy joke that gets all the laughs .
As funny as folks at work may find it , it 's probably hurting morale .
That 's one conclusion of a groundbreaking new paper from the Journal of Applied Psychology co-authored by researchers from the University of Toronto 's Rotman School of Management and the University of British Columbia 's Sauder School of Management .
The study 's authors looked at the effect of sexual behavior in the workplace such as sexual jokes , innuendo , discussions of sexual matters or flirtation .
And in a research first , they investigated if men and women got anything positive out of the behaviour , such as enjoyment and social bonding .
They found that some employees enjoyed sexual behaviour in the workplace - 25 % of those exposed to it found it fun and flattering while half were neutral .
But even employees who enjoyed the behaviour tended to withdraw from work , felt less valued and reported depressive symptoms more often than employees who experienced little to no sexual behavior at the office .
The results were found among both women and men , working in manufacturing , social service and university jobs .
" We approached the study with an open mind , " said Prof. Jennifer Berdahl of the Rotman School , who co-authored the study with Prof. Karl Aquino pf the Sauder School .
" We thought , ' Maybe these behaviours are a positive thing for employees who enjoy them . '
And then we found that they were n't . "
Prof .
Berdahl suggested the study 's findings should be treated as " sage advice " for employees and employers to avoid engaging in sexual behaviour while on the job .
" In our culture , sexuality has these connotations of domination , subordinance and vulnerability , " she said .
" Often a dominating behaviour is a way of making someone squirmy .
Why bring this into the workplace ? "

High Woo - Woo at Work
Reader Mack
Hitch sent us a news item from Denver , where the rarified high - altitude atmosphere seems to be getting to some citizens .
A woo - woo vendor named David Stevens is a " Home clearer " who helps real - estate agents by erasing those dreaded negative vibes from properties that are n't selling ...
Last Monday , Re / Max City Horizon broker Steve Kinney , in his experienced wisdom , summoned guru Stevens to dissipate the negative energy from a new home in the Berkeley neighborhood , vibes that came from the " resentment seeping in from the older property next door . "
Makes perfect sense , don' tcha think ...?
Stevens is the owner of " Yoga of the Mind . "
He mystically waved his hands , clearing the way for the house to sell .
The home had been completed in November , and the developer had n't had a single offer on it , a sure sign of clogged - up evil vibes .
Broker Kinney had purchased these magical gestures several times previously , paying the hand - waver $ 100 to $ 200 to have a home " cleared . "
We 've heard before of the brand - new ancient tradition of burying a cheap statue of St. Joseph in the front yard of a home that 's being offered for sale , and feng shui consultants say they 're being called in as well , to make sure that evil forces are n't being trapped in crevices or corners of resistant homes .
So , in Denver , you should be sure that your real estate agent is thoroughly woo - woo , or you 'll get vibes all over you ...
Even Ann Atkinson , an agent with Fuller Sotheby 's International Realty , started using the woo - woo services about a year ago , and actually believes that this hocus - pocus helps her sell real estate .
Hey , she has evidence : a pair of elderly clients moved into an assisted - living facility last May , the magic waves were performed last November , and the house sold just a few weeks ago .
Direct cause - and - effect , as you can see !
Said Ms. Atkinson ,
It may be coincidence , but it 's happened more than once .
If it 's coincidence , I want to keep having those coincidences .
Hey , you can't fool Kinney or Atkinson , can you ?
They 're both just chock - full of common sense and rationality .
The only thing that concerns me is that these people also get to vote ...
How much blood do you think a ShamWow can clean up ?
New police evidence photos taken shortly after Vince Shlomi ( aka the ShamWow guy ) allegedly fought a Miami hooker show that neither party came away unscathed .
The pics , obtained by The Smoking Gun , show the bloody sheets and even a bloody cordless phone left behind .
According to the arrest affidavit , Shlomi began kissing the hooker when she allegedly " bit his tongue and would not let go . "
He then punched the prostitute several times .
Both were arrested for felony battery , but the case was eventually dropped .
I ’ve just reread Eichengreen and Temin , The Gold Standard and the Great Depression , which does a great job of showing how the “ gold mentality ” — what they call mentalite , with an accent — paralyzed policymakers .
( The longer - form version , with more personal color , is Liaquat Ahamad ’s Lords of Finance . )
What E&T show is that circa 1930 key decision - makers had spent so many years equating adherence to gold not just with prosperity , but with morality , decency , civilization itself , that they could n’t even contemplate breaking with that orthodoxy — even in the face of total catastrophe .
I think we ’re more flexible now .
But my sense is that the mystique of finance is playing a somewhat similar role .
More on this when I ’m not waiting for a delayed plan at O’Hare .
Design patterns inspired by functional programming concepts can advance object - oriented design .
This thesis promotes the idea that concepts from the world of functional programming can be captured with design pattern descriptions .
These can then be used to benefit from functional programming concepts with ordinary object - oriented languages .
The functional patterns are evaluated for their impact on language design and a new approach to a dual - paradigm language is presented .

Content Description
Pattern Description Function Object Black - box behavior parameterisation Lazy Object Evaluation - by - need semantics Value Object Immutable values Void Value Abandoning null references Transfold Combining internal & external iteration Translator Homomorphic mapping with multi-dispatch functions
This book integrates the vital areas of object - orientation , functional programming , design patterns , and language design .
The most important concepts from functional programming are captured with six design patterns .
These patterns can be used with any object - oriented language to advance software design .
The patterns form a system , i.e. , a collaborating set of patterns .
In their " Related Patterns " sections the patterns refer to each other and to many other published design patterns .
Each of the relevant areas ( object - orientation , functional programming , design patterns ) is introduced in the first part of the book .
This part also compares the functional and object - oriented paradigms both in terms of concepts and on a calculus level .
The second part presents the functional pattern system .
This system should be beneficial to software practitioners since it integrates the functional paradigm into object - oriented software design .
Hence , advantages which have been primarily available in functional languages can be used in object - oriented languages as well .
Even when some functional concepts have been partially established in object - oriented software practice already , they can now be understood as specialized uses of more general functional patterns .
This practical aspect is complemented by a theoretical account of multi-paradigm language design .
An evaluation of the pattern system for its implications on language design in the third part is concluded by proposing a new distribution of responsibilities between languages and their environments .
The book uses the Eiffel programming language to illustrate the patterns with running sample code .
It includes a critical review of the Eiffel language in terms of its suitability as a functional pattern implementation language .

Language Design
Design patterns inspired by functional programming concepts can advance object - oriented design .
The object - oriented paradigm has undoubtfully raised our ability to design and maintain large complex software systems .
However , it does not seem to have meet the high expectations concerning reuse and ease of evolution which have been promoted ever since its commercial success .
There are many potential reasons for the above observation such as unqualified staff , immature languages , inadequate methodologies , inappropriate business processes , etc .
The view presented here is that although the object - oriented paradigm is a powerful basis , it is incomplete in its inherent concepts and therefore restricts the design space to inappropriate solutions .
It is assumed that both software development and language design are restrained from achieving their full potential when restricted to a purely object - oriented world view .
Since the complementary paradigm to object - orientation is represented by functional programming , I investigate high - level , well - known to work functional concepts and examine their suitability to enhance object - oriented design .
I explore the software engineering relevance of each concept and present its intent , applicability , implementation , and consequences in the literate form of a design pattern .
My approach clearly motivates functional techniques for object - oriented design from a software engineering point of view .
This is different to the usual procedure of designing a new language with an " ad - hoc " conglomeration of functional and object - oriented features .
The latter case requires excellence in language design and makes it hard to find out and evaluate uses of the new language .
In contrast , design patterns are already widely used to improve design .
As functional concepts constitute a powerful paradigm by themselves , it is more than suggestive to assume that design patterns expressing successful functional concepts will enhance the object - oriented paradigm with new capabilities .
I demonstrate the feasibility of using functional techniques in object - oriented designs which are to be implemented by ordinary object - oriented programming languages .
This is done at the level of a calculus comparison and in concrete design pattern implementation descriptions .
I demonstrate synergetic effects caused by concept integration , which together with the advantages of functional patterns , thus , show the utility of the approach .
Object - oriented practitioners hopefully will use the names of functional design patterns as a vocabulary to discuss solutions in a new design space .
I present a system of patterns which are connected by relations that describe how individual patterns may interact and collaborate with each other .
This system , consisting of state - of - the - art mini-architectures , may allow thinking and designing beyond restrictions imposed by a dogmatic object - oriented approach .
As a result , the quality of software is hoped to improve .
Using functional patterns for object - oriented design can be regarded as dual - paradigm design .
In this light , functional design patterns appear as language idioms that lift an object - oriented language to a dual paradigm implementation language .
It is very instructive to verify how well an object - oriented language supports the implementation of these idioms , since limiting properties are expected to interfere in other attempts to produce flexible and maintainable software as well .
Unless one is restricted to use a certain existing language , it is , however , only natural to consider direct language support in order to avoid the repetitive implementation of these idioms .
A holistic language that encompasses both object - oriented and functional paradigms should provide more ease of use , increased safety , better initial execution efficiency , and higher optimization potential .
I consider each presented design pattern for its contribution to language constructs that support a dual paradigm language .
The software engineering considerations , contained in each design pattern description , help to avoid " featurism " ' in favor of conceptually founded language principles .
Ultimately , impulses initiated by the functional pattern system lead to a reevaluation of the role distribution between a programming language and its associated environment .
The resulting language design based on the notion of hierarchical tiles allows transcending the limitations of each paradigm by providing the optimal paradigm view on demand .

Mr Singh launched his attack in a fit of anger after the minister dismissed his interjections over the recent acquittal of senior Congress politician Jagdish Tytler , who had been accused of leading Hindu mobs in communal attacks on Sikhs following the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards .

MSNBC has been reporting on the huge tent city forming outside Sacramento , including a remarkable photo essay on the encampment .
Similarly , a Daily Mail piece offers more detail :
Mikkel Fishman at The Moderate Voice has more details on the economic and political background .
As Chris Jansing reports , this is n't the only " tent city " gaining in size :
So are similar encampments near Seattle , and Reno , and Nashville .
Down in Dallas , the need for an encampment is rising quickly .
In other words , by mid-summer , we may see these encampments around the country .
And they deserve a name :
Bushvilles .
When Americans had to endure such hardships 80 years ago -- forming shantytowns made of wood shacks and canvas tents -- they named them in honor of the president who had done nothing to prevent the oncoming recession and ultimately Depression into which he had led them .
They called them Hoovervilles :
Police are hunting for vandals who chopped fiber - optic cables and killed landlines , cell phones and Internet service for tens of thousands of people in Santa Clara , Santa Cruz and San Benito counties on Thursday .
The sabotage essentially froze operations in parts of the three counties at hospitals , stores , banks and police and fire departments that rely on 911 calls , computerized medical records , ATMs and credit and debit cards .
The full extent of the havoc might not be known for days , emergency officials said as they finished repairing the damage late Thursday .
Whatever the final toll , one thing is certain :
Whoever did this is in a world of trouble if he , she or they get caught .
" I pity the individuals who have done this , " said San Jose Police Chief Rob Davis .
Ten fiber - optic cables carrying were cut at four locations in the predawn darkness .
Residential and business customers quickly found that telephone service was perhaps more laced into their everyday needs than they thought .
Suddenly they could n't draw out money , send text messages , check e-mail or Web sites , call anyone for help , or even check on friends or relatives down the road .
Several people had to be driven to hospitals because they were unable to summon ambulances .
Many businesses lapsed into idleness for hours , without the ability to contact associates or customers .
More than 50,000 landline customers lost service - some were residential , others were business lines that needed the connections for ATMs , Internet and bank card transactions .
One line alone could affect hundreds of users .
" It was substantial , " said John Britton , spokesman for AT&T .
Authorities throughout the area said Thursday night that nobody had sought help from fire or police officials .
But only the coming hours , and maybe days , will tell if there were emergencies nobody knows about yet .
Officials worried that some people might have become incapacitated before they were able to summon help without a phone .
" We do n't know what this has done to people 's lives , " said Liz Kniss , president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors .
" I 'm incredibly troubled by it .
" We have n't experienced a major catastrophic emergency today .
But we do n't know . "
FBI agents , phone company managers and local police said they were scouring the vandalism sites for evidence and aggressively searching for the perpetrators .
Potential penalties include criminal charges of vandalism , heavy restitution payments and possibly even worse consequences if someone winds up being hurt directly by the outage .
' We will find who did it '
There is no indication so far of terrorism being involved , said FBI spokesman Chris Carroll .
" Someone purposely cut these cables , " said Britton .
" They did n't have concern for anyone .
We will find who did it . "
The first four fiber - optic cables were cut shortly before 1:30 a.m. in an underground vault along Monterey Highway north of Blossom Hill Road in south San Jose , police Sgt. Ronnie Lopez said .
The cables belong to AT&T , and most of the service disruption came from this attack .
Four more underground cables , at least two of which belong to AT&T , were cut about two hours later at two locations near each other along Old County Road near Bing Street in San Carlos , authorities said .
Two additional lines were sliced on Hayes Avenue in south San Jose .
In each case , the vandals had to pry up heavy manhole covers with a special tool , climb down a shaft and chop through heavy cables .
Britton said the four cables cut in San Jose were about the width of a silver dollar and were encased in tough plastic sheath .
One cable contained 360 fibers , and the other three had 48 fibers each .
At least 500 total fiber - optic strands were sliced , and each had to be painstakingly spliced back together , requiring hours of work .
Police in San Jose and San Carlos are sharing information , said Cmdr. Rich Cinfio , a spokesman for San Carlos police .
Investigators said they had no suspects .
AT&T announced a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the perpetrators , and Santa Clara County officials declared a local state of emergency .
Extra police , firefighters on hand
Verizon , which depends on AT&T cables in the South Bay , reported that its 52,214 landline customers who lost service in southern Santa Clara County came back online just before 4:30 p.m.
Britton said AT&T restored service to all but a couple hundred customers in South San Jose by 7 p.m. , and that the remaining lines should be up and running by this morning .
Extra sheriff 's deputies , firefighters and police officers heavily patrolled the streets in the affected areas , authorities said .
Additional ambulances were on hand at St. Louise Hospital in Gilroy .
" We 're having a more visual presence out there in the field , " said Sgt. Don Morrissey , Santa Clara County sheriff 's spokesman .
" We 're out there to be the conduit , if you will .
We 're trying to bridge that communication gap between emergency services and citizens . "
The outage was nearly tragic in at least a couple of instances .
Destiny Evans of Gilroy felt faint Thursday morning at her job as an office manager at Ortho Sports in Gilroy .
Her boss , Joseph Abmont , called 911 on a landline and cell phone but could n't get through .
So he put Evans in his car and drove her to St. Louise Hospital , where she was diagnosed with a kidney infection .
" He was my savior , " Evans said as she left the hospital later in the day with her boyfriend .
St. Louise spokeswoman Jasmine Nguyen said the hospital was rescheduling elective surgeries out of concern that if something went wrong , it would have no way to contact doctors .
Among those affected by the outage were customers of Verizon , Verizon Wireless and Sprint wireless , which rely on AT&T to carry their phone traffic back to their networks .
Cell phone customers at T - Mobile and AboveNet also were affected .
Verizon spokesman Jon Davies said the outage was first reported to the company at 1:25 a.m .
He said customers were affected in the Gilroy and Morgan Hill areas .
Verizon is the sole provider of landlines in southern Santa Clara County .
Verizon Wireless customers also were affected in southern Santa Clara County and from Watsonville to Scotts Valley in Santa Cruz County .
Rerouting restores some service
At least one of the severed San Carlos lines belongs to Sprint , which lost service to several thousand landline business customers .
Crystal Davis , a crisis communications manager for Sprint , said the company was able to restore service to some of its customers by rerouting traffic .
The vandalism comes as AT&T is in talks with the Communications Workers of America for a contract covering more than 80,000 employees , who have been working under their old deal since it expired at 11:59 p.m. Saturday .
Union members voted in late March to authorize a strike but have not scheduled one .
Candice Johnson , spokeswoman for the CWA , said union members were not involved in the incidents .
" I can state that CWA members have nothing to do with this at all , " Johnson said .
" There is an investigation going on , and we 'll fully cooperate .
But our members are working .
They 're on the job . "
Britton said AT&T has a good relationship with the CWA and was continuing to negotiate with the union on their contract .

In exchange for 30 pieces of silver , Judas Iscariot kissed Jesus on the cheek and , by doing so , identified him to Roman soldiers .
Although Judas double - crossed his best friend for a paltry sum , some scholars argue that Judas is the secret hero of Christianity .
The claim is based on a recent translation of The Gospel of Judas , a text written by Jesus ' followers a couple hundred years after his death .
In 1978 , a farmer discovered the mysterious text in Egypt and sold it to an antiques dealer .
Years later , a National Geographic Society team got hold of it .
They restored and analyzed the document , and in 2006 , they announced that the text painted Judas as a man of valor .
According to their interpretation , he was actually Jesus ' most trusted friend , because he agreed to fake a betrayal so that Jesus could die a martyr and then be resurrected .
Soon after the National Geographic Society released its findings , other scholars started picking the interpretation apart .
Chief among them was April D. DeConick , a Rice University biblical studies professor , who claimed the team made some critical errors , including translating several passages to mean the exact opposite of what they were intended to communicate .
DeConick contends that the Gospel says Judas was a " demon " rather than a " spirit , " as interpreted by National Geographic , and that he was set apart " from the holy generation " rather than " for the holy generation . "
With just a few tweaks in translation , Judas has gone right back to playing the bad guy .

2 . The kisses you can share with a Quaker
The Religious Society of Friends , or Quakers , is a small Christian sect best known for rejecting all forms of violence , embracing progressive politics , and dedicating themselves to simple , restrained living .
They 've promoted a more harmonious world by founding causes such as Amnesty International , not to mention lending their name to oatmeal .
So we were surprised to learn that when teenage Quakers get together , their favorite activity is a free - for - all kissing game that often ends in bruising and rug burn .
Alternately known as Ratchet Screwdriver , Bloody Winkum , or Wink , the game dates back to the early 1900s .
To play , participants divide themselves into girl / boy pairs with one boy left over to be the " Winker . "
The pairs sit on the floor , with each boy hugging a girl from behind .
When the Winker winks at a girl , she tries to scramble across the room to kiss him , while her male partner does his best to hold her back .
Hilarity ( and release of pent - up sexual frustration ) ensues .
But not everyone finds this game so hilarious .
In 2002 , the Children & Young People 's Committee of the Quakers in Britain issued a statement discouraging the game at official functions .
And while that may not seem surprising , the reasoning is .
The committee frowns upon the game because younger children and adults do n't get to play , thus making it ageist .
Due to their egalitarian values , Quakers seldom segregate by age at get - togethers , and the committee did n't want the very young or the very old to feel left out .
3 . The kiss that proved no means no
Gentlemen , a word :
When a lady rejects your advances , you 'd do best to listen .
Take , for example , the story of Thomas Saverland , an English gentleman who was at a party in 1837 and , as a joke , kissed Miss Caroline Newton by force .
In response , she bit off a chunk of his nose .
Saverland took her to court , where the judge found his case more hilarious than harrowing .
The judge ruled , " When a man kisses a woman against her will , she is fully entitled to bite off his nose , if she so pleases . "
A smart - mouthed barrister then added , " and eat it up , if she has a fancy that way . "
4 . The kiss that said " welcome to America ! "
At the turn of the 20th century , immigration processing at Ellis Island was quite an ordeal .
Immigrants had to prove they were n't carrying any of a long list of illnesses , mental impairments , or moral defects .
If you were sick ( and it was curable ) , then you'd be detained in the hospital until you got better .
The whole process could take hours , days , or months .
And even then , you could be turned back .
Also , ladies traveling alone and anyone with less than $ 20 in their pockets had to wait for a sponsor or family member to meet them .
If no one was there to greet you , you were sent back .
Of course , all of this was further complicated by the fact that immigrants could n't go down to the pay phone and call Aunt Bertha when they landed .
Instead , when relatives heard that the right ship had docked , they trucked over to Ellis Island and waited desperately by the Kissing Post -- a giant wooden column just outside the room where the final stages of immigration took place .
Ellis Island staffers gave the Kissing Post its name because families and lovers were generally swept up in emotion as they reconnected with their long losts .
Today , the Kissing Post continues to be a symbol of hope and togetherness as the pillar that supports the American Family Immigration History Center .
If you 're one of the 100 million Americans descended from immigrants who passed through Ellis Island , there 's a good chance the History Center there can help you find a picture of the ship that carried your ancestors .

5 . The Eskimo kiss : A tale taller than the abominable snowman
Popular wisdom claims that Eskimos rub noses because kissing on the lips would cause their mouths to freeze together .
Not only is this completely untrue , but Eskimos do n't rub noses at all .
The myth of the Eskimo kiss was created by Hollywood in an early " documentary " called Nanook of the North , which took America by storm in 1922 .
To film it , director Robert J. Flaherty recorded real Inuits in the Arctic .
However , in order to accommodate the huge , awkward cameras of the day , he staged all the scenes and built a three - sided igloo for interior shots .
Nanook , the main character , was n't really named Nanook , and the women playing his wives were n't really his wives .
As for the term " Eskimo kiss , " that too was constructed by Flaherty to explain how one of the wives was nuzzling her baby .
In actuality , the woman was giving her baby a kunik , an expression of affection in Inuit culture .
Typically in kuniks , adults press the sides of their noses against the cheeks of their babies and breathe in their scent .
Who kuniks whom differs from culture to culture , but it 's never a romantic gesture .
Inuits kiss on the lips , just like everyone else .
6 . The first guy - on - guy kiss to hit the big screen
Movie experts often credit Sunday Bloody Sunday , a 1971 film about a love triangle among two guys and a girl , with being the first mainstream feature film to depict two gay men kissing .
That 's true , but it was n't the first time two guys kissed on screen .
Apparently , straight men had been doing it for decades .
In 1927 , two soldiers kissed tenderly in the silent movie " Wings " , which won Best Picture at the first Academy Awards .
When the film was released , no one raised an eyebrow about the scene , partially because kissing in the trenches was remarkably common during World War I .
According to British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow Dr. Santanu Das , letters and accounts of the war are peppered with stories of soldiers kissing , embracing , and giving each other pet names like " my Palestine Wife . "
Das believes the war succeeded in breaking down the traditional limits on emotional and physical intimacy between men , allowing soldiers to form relationships that went beyond what was permissible at home .
While it 's surprising to us today , that Wings scene did n't even cause a stir in 1920s America .

7 . The kiss that gave artists their 15 minutes
If it were n't for kissing , Andy Warhol might never have become The King of Pop Art .
In 1963 , Warhol was still a little - known commercial illustrator .
But that all changed when he bought a silent - film camera and started shooting his friends and acquaintances kissing in unbroken , four - minute - long shots .
The result was a series called Kiss , which took the art world by storm .
In fact , New York 's Gramercy Arts Theater played a new " kiss " each week .
The series helped cement Warhol 's place in the artsy underground , and it also launched the careers of several kissers .
8 . The prepubescent kiss that changed the law
When first - grader Johnathan Prevette pecked his classmate on the cheek in Lexington , North Carolina , he quickly became a poster boy for everything that was wrong with America in 1996 .
After Johnathan 's classmate complained to a teacher , the 6 - year - old was taken out of class for the day , missing an ice cream party .
When the school told Johnathan 's parents that he'd violated the sexual harassment rules , a media circus followed .
Critics pointed to the Prevette case as a sign that political correctness had gone too far , adding that innocent play did n't deserve such harsh punishments .
After all , pundits asked , is a child really capable of sexual harassment ?
But while Johnathan was making headlines , another legal battle was raging .
A 10 - year - old Georgia girl named LaShonda Davis had been repeatedly groped by a bully in her class , to the point where she contemplated suicide .
She told several of the teachers at her school , but no one did anything .
LaShonda 's parents had to call the police -- and sue the school -- before the abuse stopped .
Both Johnathan and LaShonda deserved protection under the law , and both cases played a role in molding the current standards .
In response to the Johnathan Prevette case , the Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights issued new guidelines for identifying sexual harassment by putting the emphasis on common sense and telling schools to take age and maturity into account .
But there was still a big question about whether schools should be accountable for students harassing each other .
When LaShonda 's case went to the Supreme Court in 1999 , their answer was yes , sort of .
The Court decided that schools can be blamed , but only if they learn of the abuse and do nothing to stop it .
9 . The kiss that could send you to jail
In the city of Guanajuato , Mexico , there 's a smooching spot called el Callejón del Beso , or the Alley of the Kiss .
According to local legend , the alley was once the final scene of a tragic love affair .
A young woman and her lover were meeting there to run away together , but when her father discovered them , he stabbed his daughter in the heart .
As she lay dying , her lover kissed her hand for the last time , and the alley got its name .
Today , it 's said that anyone who kisses there will have seven years of happiness .
Thanks to its romantic history , the alley has become a popular tourist attraction , although that 's starting to change .
On January 20 , 2009 , the ultra - conservative mayor of Guanajuato authorized a new municipal ordinance cracking down on public displays of affection .
If he has his way , lip - locking in the open will carry with it a fine of $ 100 and up to 36 hours in jail .
10 .
The most Iconic kiss in history
On August 14 , 1945 , thousands of men and women embraced one another in New York City 's Times Square to celebrate victory over Japan .
But two people -- a sailor and a nurse -- locked lips at just the right moment and became larger than life .
More than a dozen men and at least three women claim to be the kissers in Alfred Eisenstaedt 's photograph .
Of the men , our favorite is George Mendonça , a Rhode Island fisherman and World War II navy recruit , who claims he grabbed the strange nurse and kissed her right in front of his girlfriend .
In fact , Mendonça says his girlfriend , now his wife , is in the background of the photo .
While the mystery will probably never be solved , Alfred Eisenstaedt has left us with a juicy back story .
In his autobiography , the famed photographer writes that he followed around a sailor who moved through the crowd , kissing anything wearing a skirt .
When the sailor hit on a nurse whose white dress contrasted nicely with his dark suit , Eisenstaedt snapped the shot .
But he failed to get their names .
Coincidentally , another photographer , Victor Jorgensen , took the same shot from a slightly different angle and also forgot to get the subjects ' names .
Jorgensen 's version ran in the next day 's New York Times , but as a working military photographer at the time , he did n't own the rights to his work .
So while Eisenstaedt received glory and royalty checks for his image , Jorgensen simply got a nice clipping to hang on his fridge .

Celebrity Science
The current issue of Reader ’s Digest has an article on “ The Trouble with Celebrity Science . ”
“ What happens when stars weigh in on medical topics ?... Celebrities may be perfectly qualified to evaluate sneakers , but that does n’t mean you want to learn biochemistry from them . ”
They mention Tom Cruise ’s sweeping condemnation of modern psychiatry , then focus on …
Are you ready for this ?....
Woo - promoter extraordinaire Oprah Winfrey
Anti-vaccine activist Jenny McCarthy ( the one whose victims are listed on the Jenny McCarthy Body Count , and
Gluten - free advocate Elisabeth Hasselbeck !!!
With regards to Oprah ’s recommendations for bioidentical hormones , they point out that if you believe bioidenticals have all the benefits but none of the risks of pharmaceutical hormones , you believe in the tooth fairy .
With regards to Jenny ’s ravings , they clearly say vaccines save lives and do not cause autism and they stress that the science is not on Jenny ’s side .
Hasselbeck I was n’t familiar with , but apparently she is famous from Survivor and The View and is gluten sensitive .
She has written a book describing how she “ discovered the myriad benefits that anyone can enjoy from a gluten - free diet : from weight loss and increased energy to even the alleviation of the conditions of autism . ”
Yeah , sure .
Reader ’s Digest says do n’t bother with a gluten free diet unless you have been diagnosed with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity .
They even included a sidebar with 4 questions to ask before you buy into the latest health fad :
Anecdote or evidence ?
How strong is the research ?
Who ’s making the claim ?
Does it pass the smell test ?
( look for words like miracle and cure and conspiracy theories )
Reader ’s Digest has published a lot of questionable medical information in the past .
They might have written about “ The Trouble with Celebrity Science and Reader ’s Digest Science . ”
But they have partially redeemed themselves with this article .
Finally , a popular mainstream publication that supports science and is not afraid to contradict Jenny – or Oprah !
Have you ever come across a craft project and just could n’t wait to go home and try it ?
For me it was this simple and really cool project from the queen of craft : Martha Stewart .
Perfect for Easter egg dying or just because .
Using silk ties that are destined for Good Will , a bit of scrap fabric , and boiling water , you can dye eggs .
Yup , dye them with the ties !
It is sort of like magic , or chemical reactions even .
Take your silk ties and cut a swatch of the fabric , enough to cover your egg .
Get out your scrap muslin or plain cotton and cut the same swatch of this fabric .
Cover the egg with the silk fabric , then cover with the scrap muslin .
Martha ’s instructions call for twist ties to tie up the fabric , but I used scrap yarn .
Place your egg bundles in a pot of boiling water ( non-aluminum / non - reactive pot ) and boil for 20 minutes .
Here are a few close ups of my favorites from my attempt at this project .
This one I used an old silk scarf .
But you can pretty much use any silk for this project .
A blouse , ties , boxers , scarfs , if it ’s made from silk , it should work .
I learned that you should cover your silk completely with your muslin fabric or you ’ll contaminate your other egg packets .
My pink tie got a bit of blue on it , but it still turned out ok .
For the complete instructions check out Martha Stewart .
We ’d love to hear how your eggs fared !
Columbus — Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked plans to allow speed cameras in construction zones and to give police the power to stop motorists for not buckling up .
The GOP Senate majority also slowed down what had been a fast - moving , $ 250 million plan for a conventional - speed passenger rail line connecting Cleveland , Columbus , Dayton and Cincinnati .
All of the initiatives were part of the state 's $ 7.6 billion transportation budget , which a Senate committee debated into Tuesday night , with final approval expected as early as today .
The Democratic - controlled House had approved language in the budget that would have allowed Gov. Ted Strickland 's administration to set up a pilot program to use speed cameras in construction zones while work was being done .
But Republicans opposed the program .
Sen .
Tom Patton , a Strongsville Republican who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee , labeled the cameras " Big Brother in the sky . "
He said tickets issued as a result of the cameras would have to be reviewed by a trooper before being sent to motorists .
" I 'd rather see that trooper in a car , " Patton said .
House Democrats also wanted to make seat belt violations a primary traffic offense , meaning police officers could stop motorists for not buckling up .
Under current law , drivers must be pulled over for another offense before they can be ticketed for not wearing a seat belt .
Ditching the seat belt provision will come at a cost .
Ohio was slated to receive a one - time payoff of $ 26 million from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for passing the primary - offense bill .
" If its a good idea , then why do we need to be coerced ? " Patton asked .
He said Ohio ranks ninth in the nation in seat belt usage .
" Law enforcement officials did n't ask for it , " Patton said .
" They did n't think we needed it . "
Republicans did allow the state to move forward in competing with other states for part of $ 8 billion in federal stimulus money for passenger rail projects .
But before those dollars could be spent , state officials would have to seek another green light from lawmakers .
" We let them very aggressively go after the funding at the federal level , but they have to come back and provide more information about what the construction costs , startup costs and operating costs are going to be , " Patton said .
" We thought it was a bit ambitious . "
The tentative go - ahead was a slight retreat for Republican lawmakers who looked to be leaning toward derailing the rail plan altogether in recent weeks .
The committee 's ranking Democrat , Cleveland Sen. Nina Turner , said she was concerned that the Republicans approach would n't fly with the federal government .
" Is the Obama administration really going to allow us to compete ? " she asked .
" The Strickland administration is still working on it , but I think that we run a risk with this . "
Because of the changes made in the Senate , the transportation budget bill will probably end up in a conference committee to iron out the differences with the House version .

Time Warner Cable , stung by online criticism of its paltry traffic caps ( in tests , these have ranged form 5GB / month to 40 GB / month ) and ludicrous pricing schemes , has taken to the ' Net to defend its sullied honor .
But it 's hard to defend a scheme with fees so high they might well meet the legal definition of " obscene . "
First , the response : Time Warner Cable COO
Landel Hobbs wrote earlier this week of the need for people to pay for the bandwidth they consume .
" When you go to lunch with a friend , do you split the bill in half if he gets the steak and you have a salad ? " he asked .
Fair enough .
Bandwidth costs ( a little bit of ) money , and there 's certainly no reason for customers to demand the ability to transfer 4TB of data a month for one flat fee .
But TWC 's steak / salad analogy breaks down when it 's crafted more accurately .
The real question is whether you would even have lunch with a friend at a restaurant that charged $ 45 for a salad and $ 200 for a steak .
Certainly , in a free market , most people would go elsewhere .
But this sort of absurd price structure perfectly characterizes the new TWC plans .
Let 's take a look .
Just how overpriced is that steak ?
As TWC expands its test markets for the data caps , it offers plans with 5GB of monthly data transfer for $ 30 .
Plans with 40 GB of data go for $ 55 .
The thinking here is that most customers currently use only 4GB per month or so , and offering those customers a cheaper rate is actually doing them a favor .
As Hobbs puts it , " Our current pricing plans require all users to pay the same amount , whether they check e-mail once a month or download six movies a day . "
But the only favors being done here are to TWC 's bottom line .
That base rate works out to a truly jaw - dropping $ 6 per GB per month , and it 's so far out of line with competitors ' plans as to shock even the most cynical heart .
Take AT&T's DSL , for comparison .
The most expensive plan on offer ( unless one subscribes to the U - verse IPTV system ) is $ 35 per month for 6 M bps DSL .
AT&T has no explicit data cap , but let 's use 400GB as an illustrative limit .
AT&T DSL comes out to 9� per GB .
Verizon 's fiber - optic FiOS system can be had for as little as $ 44.99 a month if you 're content with 10 M bps downstream .
Assuming a 400 GB cap ( Verizon also has no explicit cap ) , this comes out to $.11 per GB .
Upgrading to the much faster 50 M bps service for $ 144.95 a month still means that the charge per GB is only 36 � .
The situation is similar at other cable operators .
Comcast offers Internet service starting at $ 42.95 per month and has a 250 GB cap in place ; this works out to 17 � per GB .
TWC claims that the caps are needed to " make improvements to infrastructure " that are necessary for higher speed access , but it 's hard to see how .
Comcast is aggressively rolling out DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades across its service area .
In Chicago , it already sells a 50 M bps plan for $ 139.95 — only 56 � per GB .
Besides , the dirty secret of these DOCSIS 3.0 rollouts is that they 're cheap .
Cable companies need to upgrade hardware at the headend and may need to send out a new cable modem , but this is hardly expensive .
A New York Times piece last week quoted industry insiders who said the job could be done for between $ 20 and $ 100 ( the latter figure includes a new cable modem ) .
If TWC wants to be " fair , " as Hobbs says , perhaps it can start by rethinking either its caps or its prices .
Even its most generous plan , 40 GB per month for $ 55 , costs a ridiculous $ 1.38 per GB .
( The company has heard the outraged cries of its users and will eventually offer a 100 GB cap option ; pricing , however , is not yet set . )
As Dave Burstein , editor of trade publication DSL Prime , put it recently , " No one is going to stop Comcast , Verizon , or AT&T from practices that are truly necessary to efficiently run a network .
The issue is blocking competitive video and charging 1,000 percent and higher markups on bandwidth that are unacceptable . "

RealNetworks is upping the ante in litigation seeking to prevent it from distributing DVD - copying software .
The company argues the Hollywood studios are a " price - fixing cartel " that have no right to prevent consumers from duplicating the movie discs .
The Seattle - based electronics concern is making the argument in a bid to convince a federal judge to lift the distribution ban of its RealDVD software ( . pdf ) that allows consumers to make copies of the discs to their computer hard drives .
The Motion Picture Association of America , which represents Hollywood studios , and others , sued RealNetworks last year , claiming the software is illegal because it circumvents technology designed to prevent copying .
But RealNetworks , in counterclaims filed late Wednesday , maintains that the studios , as a collective , have illegally crafted a licensing scheme called the Content Scramble System licensing agreement that prevents the fair - use copying of DVDs .
It is the first time the studios , in conjunction with the DVD Copy Control Association ( which licenses the CSS code ) have been accused of anti-trust practices in a lawsuit .
The CSS code is licensed to DVD - player manufacturers so electronic companies can acquire the keys to unscramble Hollywood 's encrypted DVDs .
The code is designed to prevent unauthorized copying of movie discs .
" The CSS agreement is being used to extend a legally granted monopoly over content into separate markets – to prevent competition from technologies that would allow a copy of content for fair use purposes .
But making the making of a copy of a studio DVD is authorized fair use under the Copyright Act , " RealNetworks wrote U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in a court filing .
That said , RealNetworks has gargantuan legal hurdles to clear before it can prevail on its claim , which includes allegations the companies colluded against RealNetworks to banish its DVD - copying software .
For starters , RealNetworks ' argument that consumers have a " fair use " right to make copies of their DVDs for personal use is a claim the federal courts have never embraced .
The reason is the 10 - year - old Digital Millennium Copyright Act , which clearly bans circumventing encryption technology designed to prevent copying .
Hence , for good or bad , fair use is not a part of the legal equation , at least as far as the DMCA is concerned .
RealNetworks , however , maintains the DMCA does not apply because the company is not circumventing technology .
It claims the CSS license it acquired allows for copying DVDs – an issue at the center of the case and a proposition the studios staunchly reject .
What 's more , it 's possible the so - called cartel of studios is immunized from anti-trust allegations under what is known as the Noerr - Pennington doctrine , where the Supreme Court has said that competitors ( in this instance the studios ) have the First Amendment right to band together to advocate for their interests .
Without such immunity , there likely would n't be trade associations , according to Los Angeles copyright attorney Ben Sheffner , who writes the must - read Copyrights & Campaigns blog ,
" In the RealDVD case , I expect one of the studios ' defenses ( though certainly not their only defense ) will be that , to the extent that they cooperated or made any agreements regarding copyright enforcement , such cooperation or agreements are immunized under N - P as legitimate anti-piracy activities , " Sheffner said in an e-mail .
" I also expect them to argue strenuously that – contrary to what Real alleges – there was no agreement among them not to deal with Real . "
Fred von Lohmann , a copyright attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , agreed that " this will be one of their arguments .
But whether the court will buy it is another . "
The studios said RealNetworks ' counterclaims are a ploy .
" While we have not yet had a chance to examine RealNetworks ' new antitrust allegations fully , they appear to be based on significant factual and legal errors , and an attempt to distract attention away from the issue of RealNetworks ’ misconduct and the injunction issue pending before the court , " Glenn Pomerantz , an MPAA attorney , said in an e-mail .
Patel , the judge in the case , also presided over the Napster trial .
Anti-trust issues raised in that case went by the wayside .
Among them were allegations that the record labels colluded to delay the sale of digital audio files to extract more money from music fans .
The theory was that the music industry did n't quickly adopt digital sales because it wanted to sell CDs , thus forcing consumers to pay for an entire CD instead of individual – and cheaper – digital songs .
But let 's assume RealNetworks prevails on its anti-trust claims , that the CSS licensing agreement should be null and void .
Would consumers be better off ?
They might not unless the DMCA is changed .
If the DMCA is left intact , the individual studios – even if barred from being a collective – would still encrypt their DVDs to prevent copying .
The DMCA would still make it unlawful to circumvent encryption technology designed to prevent copying .
A likely result would be that the studios might each encrypt their DVDs differently .
That might result in consumers having to purchase several DVD - playing machines to unscramble discs from different studios .
So even if RealNetworks is right on the anti-trust issues , it does not necessarily result in the company being able to market its DVD - copying software .
Instead , RealNetworks should lobby to change the DMCA .

Without a super - efficient battery , Plug - in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEV ) are little more than scrap metal .
The more efficient the battery , the longer a car can run–and the more attractive it is to people who need to drive long distances .
That ’s why Hitachi ’s announcement that it has developed the world ’s most efficient lithium - ion battery for hybrid cars – the newest battery of choice– is so important .
In the past , car companies have relied on clunky and inefficient nickel metal hydride batteries .
According to Japanese Web site Nikkei , Hitachi ’s battery has an output per kilogram of 4,500 watts –70 % more than its current li-ion batteries and 50 % more than a new model that will be released next year .
The super - battery has a lifespan of 10 years , so it can stay put in a PHEV for life ( or close to it ) .
No word yet from Hitachi on pricing , but the battery , scheduled to be released in mid-2010 , will almost certainly be more expensive than its less efficient counterparts .
One thing is for sure , though .
Li-ion battery makers like Johnson Controls - Saft and Blue Energy should watch their backs .

Mr Tsvagirai had only recently returned to work after his wife 's death
The four - year - old grandson of Zimbabwe 's Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has drowned in a swimming pool at the family 's home in Harare .
The death of the child , Sean , comes less than a month after Mr Tsvangirai 's wife Susan died in a car crash .
The prime minister had been at a ministerial meeting in Victoria Falls at the time of the drowning , but left to be with his family .
He had only recently returned to work after mourning his wife 's death .
Mr Tsvangirai was injured in the March crash that killed his wife of 31 years .
Sean Tsvangirai was the son of the prime minister 's second son , Garikai , who lives in Canada but had been in Harare since his mother 's death .
Ministers from Zimbabwe 's power - sharing government had been meeting for a three - day bonding session in a luxury hotel in the resort of Victoria Falls .
The exercise was intended to help the former rivals trust each other and work together after years of division .
Mr Tsvangirai was sworn in on 13 February as part of a new power - sharing government with President Robert Mugabe .
The unity government is tasked with reversing years of economic decline in the country .
Security specialists who monitor the behavior of cybercriminals are now reporting a disturbing trend among online scammers : paying " captcha - breakers " to solve random blocks of text , to supersede anti-fraud and anti-spam measures .
Humans Versus Computer Programs
Catpcha stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart .
Captchas are most prevalent online blogs that require a user to enter a series of numbers or letters in order to post a comment online .
While sometimes an inconvenience , websites and online forms that require captchas are critical in the first line of defense against cybercriminals .
Since its inception in 2001 , captchas have been able to reduce the number of computer viruses and malware used to extract pertinent information on actual computer users .
Captcha - Breakers Do the Dirty Work
There is no real way of detecting a captcha - breaker , though these people are believed to be operating anywhere from high - end Internet cafes to low - end sweatshops based out of China , India and Nigeria .
( Source : usatoday.com )
At least one known operation exists in rural Pakistan where bandwidth is accessible and labor runs cheap .
Cybercriminals pay captcha - breakers half of a cent to a penny for each solved captcha ; decent pay in some of the third world countries where it is becoming a problem .
This kind of information comes from actual recruitment ads posted on hacker forums all across the Internet .

Social Networks a Haven for Cybercriminals
There is little doubt that cybercriminals are lured to social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter .
Facebook alone is claiming 200 million members -- a virtual goldmine for Internet deviants wishing to steal a few identities or just create some online mischief .
With the captcha line of defense removed , these social networking havens are left virtually unprotected from the misdirected clicks of honest users .
This has led to the spread of infamous malware such as Koobface , Conficker and other dangerous viruses .
The information paints a disturbing portrait of our online safety standards .
However , considering that captchas have continued to be used as an online security tool since 2001 , the emergence of captcha - breakers was almost inevitable .
Still , it will be interesting to see what new security measures will be put in place to detract future online deviants .
The only question is , how long will it be until these security measures are broken down as well ?

What kind of a man is this that he can't even defend his daughter against personal insults from the likes of Laura Ingraham ?... I think he believes that Megan deserves to be spoken to like that because he probably speaks to her that way himself .
Although she 's quite lovely , she 's not physically a perfect Barbie like her mother or Sarah Palin --- or Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham --- which is what he thinks is important in a woman .
So , he can't bring himself to defend her .
She asked for it .
Today 's honoree : None other than , for whom this feature is indirectly named , for reminding us what a truly heinous , ugly , mean - spirited man John McCain is , that he can't even bring himself to stand up for his own daughter when one of the Harridans of Wingnuttia decides to use her as a punching bag .
Money quote : Which means that John McCain = Peter Griffin : Imagine what having Peter Griffin and the Mother from Hell running the executive branch .
No matter how frustrated we may be with Obama , we literally dodged a bullet by not electing John McCain and Sarah Palin .
Labels : assholes , John McCain , scumbaggery
The GOPers — by that we mean Rep. Eric Cantor 's office — are pouncing on an interview today on " Morning Joe " with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , under this subject line : " Administration Permits Only One Question , No Follow - Ups About Extremism Report . "
Today the secretary went on " Morning Joe " but they were only allowed to ask one question .
" Apparently , when the Democrats promise an open administration , they really only mean open as long as you ask the questions they want asked and no follow - ups on controversial topics that everyone is reporting on , " staffer Joe Pounder wrote in an email .
Anyway check out the transcript :
MSNBC ’s Joe Scarborough : “ I want to have a discussion afterwards about that interview . ”
MSNBC ’s Mika Brzezinski : “ Now , we should be clear , they only wanted one question . ”
Scarborough : “ Yeah .
So this morning , I got a call that she [ Janet Napolitano ] was going to be on the show and they said we could only ask one question … ”
Brzezinski : “ That was the agreement . ”
Scarborough : “ … about this story yesterday .
And I initially said , well , we 're not going to do it then , because we do n't allow people to tell us what they 're going to talk about . ”
Brzezinski : “ Right . ”
Scarborough : “ I said , we 'll ask one question , see how she responds and since this Mexico issue is so huge , we want our viewers to watch .
If she was coming on to , you know , name a new post office that would have been something or a book that would have been – but I want – let 's talk about that afterwards . ”
Brzezinski : “ Okay . ”
Scarborough : “ We 'll ask our audience whether we should have had her on the show or not under those conditions . ”
Brzezinski : “ OK , because I actually – I have so many follow - ups . ”
Scarborough : “ I had a lot of follow - ups . ”

A number of buildings in New York City were evacuated Monday morning after a trio of low - flying planes flew near the Statue of Liberty .
“ An Air Force One lookalike , the backup plane for the one regularly used by the president , flew low over Manhattan on Monday morning , accompanied by two F - 16 fighters , so Air Force photographers could take pictures , ” the New York Times reports .
“ But a lack of awareness about the flyover led to the evacuation of several buildings in Lower Manhattan and Jersey City , N.J. , and perplexed officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and other authorities were inundated with calls from anxious ferry passengers , office workers and residents in the area . ”

Let us now put our hands together and pray .
O God , we gather here today to ask you to free our schoolchildren from being forced to go through this charade every day .
As you know , O Lord , because
You see all , British law requires every schoolchild to participate in " an act of collective worship " every 24 hours .
Irrespective of what the child thinks or believes , they are shepherded into a hall , silenced , and forced to pray – or pretend to .
If they refuse to bow their heads to You , they are punished .
This happened to me , because I protested that there is no evidence whatsoever that You exist , and plenty of proof that shows the texts describing
You are filled with falsehoods .
When I pointed this out , I was told to stop being " blasphemous " and threatened with detention .
" Shut up and pray , " a teacher told me on one occasion .
Are you proud , O Lord ?
Forcing children to take part in religious worship every day is a law worthy of a theocracy , not a liberal democracy where 70 per cent of adults never attend a religious ceremony .
That 's why the Association of Teachers and Lecturers – one of the teachers ' unions – has recently moved to ask the Government to stop forcing its members to take part in this practice .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Why does this anachronism persist in this blessedly irreligious country ?
For all their whining that they are " persecuted " , the religious minority in Britain are in fact accorded remarkable privileges .
They are given a bench - full of unelected positions in the legislature , protection from criticism in the law , and vast amounts of public money to indoctrinate children into their belief systems in every school in the land .
I can understand why the unelected , faltering religious institutions cling to this law so tightly .
When it comes to " faith " , if you do n't get people young , you probably wo n't ever get them .
Very few people are , as adults , persuaded of the idea that ( say ) a Messiah was born to a virgin and managed to bend the laws of physics , or that we should revere a man who at the age of 53 had sex with a nine - year - old girl .
You can usually only persuade people of this when they are very young – a time when their critical and rational faculties have not yet been developed – and hope it becomes a rock in their psychological make - up they dare not pull out .
But why do the rest of us allow this fervent 5 per cent of the population to force the rest of our kids to follow their superstitions ?
Parents can withdraw their children if they choose – but that often means separating the child in an embarrassing way from her friends and exposing them to criticisms from the school , so only 1 per cent do it .
Most do n't even know it is an option .
More importantly still , why is worship forced on 99 per cent of children without their own consent or even asking what they think ?
As the author Richard Dawkins has pointed out many times , there are no " Christian children " or " Muslim children " .
I was classed as " Christian " because my mother is vaguely culturally Christian , although at every opportunity I protested that I did n't believe any of it .
Children are not born with these beliefs , as they are born with a particular pigmentation or height or eye colour .
Indeed , if you watch children being taught about religion , you will see most of them instinctively laugh and ask perfectly sensible sceptical questions that are swatted away – or punished – by religious instructors .
I am genuinely surprised that no moderate religious people have , to my knowledge , joined the campaign to stop this compelled prayer .
What pleasure or pride can you possibly feel in knowing that children are compelled to worship your God ?
Why are you silent ?
The prayer - enforcers offer a few arguments in their defence .
At first , they claim it instils " moral values " in children .
The scientist Gregory S Paul produced a detailed study in 2005 to find out if rates of murder and rape went up as levels of religion went down .
He found the exact opposite .
On detailed international comparisons , the more religious a country is , the more likely you are to be stabbed or raped there .
There is n't necessarily a causal relationship – but it blasts a bloody hole in this claim .
Of course , if you actually followed the morality explicitly commanded by the Bible , Torah and Koran , you would kill adulterers , gay people , apostates , and disobedient children and be sent to prison .
Thankfully , the vast majority of religious believers long since decided to disregard much of " God 's word " , because it is manifestly appalling , and read it metaphorically .
But you have to strip away an awful lot of the texts as metaphor before you get to a few bland lessons about being nice to each other .
Ca n't we get the lessons about niceness from somewhere else , without the bogus metaphysics and endless injunctions to kill our friends ?
Once the morality defence dissolves , the religious switch tack , and claim that children indoctrinated into religion perform better academically .
As " proof " , they point to the fact that faith schools perform somewhat better on league tables .
It 's true – but look a little deeper .
There have been two detailed studies of this , by the conservative think tank Civitas , and the Welsh Assembly .
They found faith schools get better results for one simple reason : they use selection to cream off highly motivated children of the wealthy and weed out difficult , poor or unmotivated students who would require more work .
Once you take into account their " better " intakes , faith schools actually underperform academically by 5 per cent ( and that 's before you factor in all the other problems they cause ) .
I am absolutely not saying that schools should teach children to be atheists .
No .
Schools should take no position on religion .
They should be neutral , and equip children with the thinking skills – asking for evidence , and knowing how to analyse it rationally – that will enable them to make up their own minds , when they wish , beyond the school gates .
How can a religious person object to that , without admitting that open - minded , evidence - seeking adults would see through their claims in a second ?
And so , O Lord , I ask you – and the British Government – to set our children free , at last , from being forced to worship You .
Amen – and hallelujah .

At last we appear to be nearing the truth about the effectiveness of CCTV .
After senior police officers suggested , a few years back , that CCTV had no substantial impact on crime , a research group funded by the Home Office has established that vast spending on systems is almost certainly unjustified .
As Alan Travis reports , the review of 44 research studies on CCTV found that they do have a modest impact on crime overall , but CCTV cameras are at their most effective in cutting vehicle crime in car parks , especially when used alongside improved lighting and the introduction of security guards .
So , there are some benefits , as most acknowledged , but the idea that CCTV has any special power to reduce crime generally is clearly flawed .
Travis notes that the investigation by a group including Cambridge criminologist David Farrington was cited by the Home Office in their response to an important report from the House of Lords constitution committee that suggested the spread of CCTV undermined fundamental rights guaranteed by the Human Rights Act .
It is now becoming clear that the £ 500 m spent by local councils on the CCTV in the decade up to 2006 has been on surveillance of the innocent public rather than crime prevention .
As I pointed out last week , it may not be long before these cameras can be connected and upgraded with facial recognition technology .
What we need now is a new national surveillance commission , where spending of public money on CCTV is weighed against the loss of privacy and the threat to the public from likely technological developments .
It would cost a fraction of the money being wasted on elaborate systems and in the end save a great deal .
" The Crisis of Public Reason "
Public Reason : Holding Power - Holders Responsible
American political culture faces a crisis of public reason .
Public reason concerns the norms of public argument , and the health of a modern society can almost be measured by the extent to which norms of public reason are upheld .
The theory behind public reason , which dates to the Enlightenment , is that power - holders can be constrained by compelling them to give reasons for their actions .
If the reasons do n't make sense then citizens can point that out , and the disjunction between reason and action will eventually cause the powerholders to lose their legitimacy and thus their power .
The idea originates as a generalization of scientists ' understandings of their own norms of debate , and it is often scientists who insist most strongly on the connection between reason and the health of political institutions .
If people believe in UFOs , the argument goes , then politicians can say any old crazy thing they want , and society will lose its last fragile protection against authoritarianism and anarchy ( these opposites often being fused by people who make this argument ) .
Challenges to Public Reason : Simulated Rationality
Public reason faces a long series of challenges , which taken together are formidable .
One major challenge is the professionally cultivated practice of simulated rationality : if you 're a powerholder , or more likely a loose network or segmentary coalition of powerholders , and you want to take certain actions , and if norms of public reason are in effect , then you will naturally search for rational - sounding arguments for your plans .
This procedure -- decision first , then arguments -- is utterly routinized throughout the public and private bureaucracies of the world , and a whole industry of public relations ( and other communications professions that operate on the same conceptual basis as public relations ) exists to support it .
The core concept of public relations is the " perception " : what matters in practical terms is not whether one 's arguments are rational , but whether they are perceived as rational .
One must adopt the surface forms of rational argument -- arranging words in logical - seeming ways , using scientific vocabulary , adducing ( carefully selected ) facts , providing impressive - sounding statistics , citing the opinions of authorities ( that is , people who will be perceived as authorities ) , and so forth .
When norms of public reason have been institutionalized , producing this reason - effect is half the battle , and one can purchase reason - effects by the yard .
Challenges to Public Reason : Technical Rationalization
A second challenge to public reason is technical rationalization , by which I mean the application of math - based analytical frameworks to practical problems .
Examples include the mathematical models of operations research , a tremendous variety of simulation methods , and too many others to enumerate .
These models reached their peak of cultural legitimacy during the Cold War , but they date back centuries and persist robustly today .
Rationalization produces reason - effects in the sense just described , but its use of mathematics and its apparatus of deductive logic also give it a special claim to reason .
Deductive logic is airtight in a precise sense : given the premises , the conclusions follow .
Proponents of technical rationalization often feel very strongly , and it is easy to see where they get their fervor .
The matters that they model are often controversial , and answers that can be publicly defended through airtight deductive logic are greatly to be preferred to the hidden agendas of politicians and entrepreneurs .
To question rationalization , on this view , is to question rationality , with all of the dire consequences that I mentioned before .
The serious problem with rationalization concerns the premises and presuppositions of the model : " given the premises , the conclusions follow " , but the premises are rarely as " given " as all that , and the conclusions only follow if the world corresponds to the assumptions that have been built into the model .
Most of these models depend on quantitative " inputs " that are subject to measurement error , assuming that they can even be measured .
Sensitivity analysis ( computing the partial derivative of the output with respect to a particular input ) often reveals that the answers that formal models provide depend so radically on unmeasurable inputs that they are worthless .
Worthless estimates of ten - year budget surpluses in the United States and the State of Texas are current examples .
The point is not that formal models are incompatible with public reason ; reasonable people can argue about the models themselves .
Where rationalization becomes pathological is where this meta - level debate about the premises and presuppositions of models is suppressed .
This can ( and routinely does ) happen in several ways .
The models themselves can be obscure , whether by design or not , and this can suppress participation in the necessary debate .
The people who apply the models can be trained to apply them in a mechanical and superficial way , and may lack the skill to question and evaluate them .
This happens every single day .
Or the dynamics of public debate , as in the compression of sound - bite journalism , can give an unfair advantage to those who can offer a neat answer over those who can offer a ten - page explanation of what 's wrong with it .
An extensive literature documents these problems ; see for example William H. Dutton and Kenneth L. Kraemer , Modeling as Negotiating : The Political Dynamics of Computer Models in the Policy Process ( Ablex , 1985 ) .
Rationalization and the Problem of Hubris
The most basic problem with rationalization is hubris .
The world is complicated , and the people who have expertise with rational models usually do not have enough knowledge of the specifics of particular cases to apply their models realistically .
Quite the contrary , the model creates a set of cognitive filters that tend to exclude from consideration any factors that do not fit it .
If one 's professional standing depends on the applicability of a certain repertoire of formal models , then it is in one 's interests to perceive the world as fitting those models , and to stop inquiring into the particulars as soon as the model has been fitted to them .
This is bad enough when the model - expert suffers the full consequences of inappropriate modeling , but it is much worse when innocent parties suffer .
This is the story of " urban renewal " programs in the 1970s , in which anyone who actually lived in the neighborhoods in question could have told the modelers what their models were leaving out .
Formal models have often proven to be quite idiotic once somebody , in many cases an anthropologist with an equally strong disciplinary predisposition to seeing the social world as an interconnected whole , takes the trouble to discover the fullness of what 's happening on the ground .
The Fallacy of " The Scientific Method " As Sole Basis For Public Reason
A variant of the problem of rationalization arises when scientists and scientific enthusiasts ( not all of them , but many ) insist that the scientific method become the sole basis for public reason .
The problem with this position is that many questions of public concern are simply not susceptible to scientific analysis , being for example complex moral questions .
Another problem is that science does not function in the way that scientific enthusiasts understand as " the scientific method " .
The literature on social studies of science has documented this at length , and has accordingly been excoriated by those pseudo - scientific dogmatists who believe that the question of how science actually works is not a fit matter for scientific inquiry .
The Struggle Over Divergent Visions
A final threat to public reason is , to put it in plain language , the struggle over different ways of seeing things .
Different professions and cultures have different concepts , methods , and assumptions , and people with different social positions and life experiences go about public reason in different ways .
Many people cannot tolerate these sorts of epistemological diversity .
They insist that their own ways be regarded as objectively true , and they insist that any appreciation of others ' ways be regarded as a relativistic abdication of reason .
Wrong though it is , this fear of incommensurability is understandable .
Because public reason only functions if everyone agrees to uphold it , surely the norms of public reason themselves must be framed in a common vocabulary , which vocabulary ought surely to provide a broader basis for commensuration of substantive arguments .
Put more simply , if everyone has their own idea about what public reason is , where are the unanimously legitimated rules that are going to keep powerholders accountable ?
Why can't somebody from your culture , having ascended to office , simply declare that their own cultural understanding of public reason allows them to cite the authority of their familiar spirits as an adequate justification for their actions ?
But the fact remains that people do have diverse understandings of the world and of public reason itself , and that many of these understandings are consistent with the spirit of public reason , and that the attempt to enforce a single such understanding as the gold standard of all public discourse is precisely the sort of arbitrariness that the norms of public reason exist to rule out .
This problem has serious solutions , but they are not solutions that can be explained briefly or written neatly into a constitution .
These difficulties tend to discredit public reason .
One encounters foolish books such as Bent Flyvbjerg , Rationality and Power : Democracy in Practice ( translated by Steven Sampson , Chicago : University of Chicago Press , 1998 ) that discover the shenanigans that go on behind the scenes of putatively rational public debates ( in his case , over urban planning ) and concludes that rationality itself is nothing but an effect of power .
In environmental controversies one observes a struggle over ground rules , with business and government ( usually operating in concert ) pushing the debate onto the terrain of technical and scientific methods that cannot be employed without large amounts of capital and community organizations pushing the debate onto the terrain of experience , memory , and narrative .
Simulated rationality confronts an insistence that the surfaces forms of rationality have become irretrievably corrupt .
Of course many cases are more complex , and the average timber war does include substantial amounts of math and science on all sides .
Academics and activists have worked to make the means of scientific rationality available to those without concentrated capital , but it 's an uphill fight at best .
Two Ideological Rejections of Public Reason
Yet even those disputes over technical rationalization do not present the greatest danger to public reason .
The greatest danger comes from an even deeper interaction between two rejections of reason , the ones that in the United States have come to be known as conservative and liberal .
The new jargon that is increasingly spoken by conservative pundits and activists in the United States , and is rarely denounced by conservatives of any stripe , constitutes a vast assault on reason .
The Longstanding Conservative Rejection
The conflict between conservatism and reason , in fact , is longstanding and overt .
Conservatives in Burke 's day were explicit about the evils of permitting the common people to engage in rational thought , lest they decide to replicate the French revolution , and the thoroughgoing arbitrariness of the new jargon serves to undermine the possibility of popular exercises of reason in the present day .
( Whether it succeeds in this is another question . )
Even those who identify themselves as libertarians follow an overtly anti-rationalist philosophy , as even a brief acquaintance with the work of Friedrich Hayek should make clear .
The argument against reason in this literature is straightforward : it is impossible for any individual to acquire enough reliable information to make a rational decision , any actions founded on rational thought will therefore be delusional , any attempts at reason should therefore regarded as dangerous , and all action should instead be guided by tradition .
This is what Burke had in mind by commending prejudice , even though contemporary conservatives are careful not to use that word .
Conservatism is constitutionally opposed to public reason , and this explains the abandon with which so many conservative pundits embrace flagrant simulations of reason , constructed through the methods of public relations , and exhibit so little regard for the real thing .
Identity Politics : Public Reason Rejected in Response to Trauma
But conservatives are not alone in rejecting public reason .
The rejection of public reason is central to identity politics , whose starting - point is not the rational overthrow of prejudice in the public sphere but rather the creation of alternative spheres in which silenced " voices " can be revived .
Central to this project is the experience of a particular kind of oppression : the infliction of irrationalist nonsense .
Let us say that a long series of jerks indignantly sneer at you that you should stop being a " victim " , or that the Native Americans were n't really oppressed given that there are more of them now than there were when the white men showed up .
If you are in complete possession of your rational faculties then you will think long and hard until you understand what is twisted about this .
But being assaulted by the indignant sneering of nonsense is a bona fide variety of emotional trauma , and only the strongest individual can retain the capacity for rational thought after enough trauma of that sort .
The first step in overcoming the emotional violence of the jargon is not the hard labor of fashioning brief rational comebacks to the immense repertoire of nonsense lines of the jerks .
No , the first step is to make common cause with others who have been abused similarly , reestablish the capacity for trust , compare notes on one 's experiences , and recover the ability to speak in a semipublic way without an internalized jerk sneering at you to stop being such a victim .
The finer dictates of logic have to wait , for the simple reason that an emotionally brutalized person cannot yet distinguish between rebuttals that arise that arise from reason and rebuttals that arise from nonreason .
The problem arises when the communities created through identity politics fail to move past this condition by recommitting themselves to public reason .
At its worst , this kind of interrupted recovery can lead to the worst sorts of irrationalism , as in the elaboration of pseudo - historical scholarship .
Even at its best , it prevents traumatized people from acquiring the repertoire of rational arguments that they need to build a mainstream political movement .
A vicious circle gets going , with pundits employing the most convenient examples of identity - politics irrationalism as a means of disguising their own irrationalism .
The new jargon is filled with projections of this sort , all of which are easy to sustain if one uses facts selectively and otherwise applies the methods of public relations .
Notwithstanding their excesses , which hardly compare to the positive contributions that they have made , the principal threat to public reason has never derived from the movements of identity politics .
The more basic phenomenon is the vicious cycle set in motion by the irrationalists who , whether consciously or by parroting a jargon whose logic they fail to understand , promote a hierarchical culture of deference .
Public Reason : Precondition for Democracy and Sanity
Public reason is not only a precondition for a functioning democracy ; it is also required for individuals to become and remain sane .
As human beings we develop our voices by internalizing the responses of others , and in the long run we only remain rational if we internalize a rational interlocutor .
Only if reason is both legitimized in theory and actually employed in practice can we be kept honest enough to make rational sense .
Rationality is ultimately not about the procedures of logic , which can easily be reified in an irrational way .
Rationality is ultimately about mental health : the kind of contact with reality that we can only maintain if we have good boundaries and a supportive community of similarly healthy people .
To oppress people one must wound them , so that wounded patterns of thought are reproduced from one generation to the next .
During a recession , as tax receipts fall , European countries simultaneously spend more on welfare .
This process , known as automatic stabilizers , forms part of the debate about whether Europe should stimulate its economy as much as countries with lower outlays , like the United States and China .
“ Governments need to take quick and decisive action to avoid the financial crisis becoming a fully - blown social crisis , ” the secretary general of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development , Ángel Gurría , said this week .
Demographics , too , are a challenge .
On the one hand , workers fear that as they age , they will be at a disadvantage when competing for scarce jobs against younger , less expensive workers .
Experts also fear a shortage of skilled workers , as Europe ’s population ages and becomes more of a burden on budgets .
Despite the advent of the single market , the labor market in Europe is fragmented .
In Spain , the jobless rate runs as high as 25 percent in some regions , according to the country ’s National Statistics Institute .
And unemployment has spread from the construction sector to broader industry and services as domestic demand shrinks and global demand for automobiles drops .
Carlos Martín , an economist with the Workers Commissions , the biggest Spanish trade union , said that government projections that the country would begin to pull out of the crisis next year were unrealistic and that hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost in hotels , restaurants and retailing .
“ Six months from now , we ’ll be looking at five million unemployed , ” he said .
“ This is going to be a deep , broad crisis that is going to last a lot longer than two years . ”
The German imperial chancellor , Otto von Bismarck , had something more generous in mind when he designed the world ’s first social insurance program — initiated in the 1880s — on the assumption that the welfare state should help smooth economic cycles .
“ In Germany , there was this class system , with the richer classes feeling guilty and frightened of the working classes , creating this paternalism , ” said Richard Layard , a professor at the London School of Economics .
“ In the U.S. and the U.K. it was the belief that all have the same opportunities , and if you do n’t succeed it ’s your fault .
Now , it ’s the belief that the more people you mobilize , the shorter the recession will be . ”
Senator Charles E. Schumer has never struggled to find a reason to hold a news conference on a Sunday .
But the inspiration for the one on Mother ’s Day arrived unexpectedly , when the senator ’s cellphone rang during a health care meeting on Capitol Hill last week .
“ You are still eligible to reactivate warranty coverage , ” said the recorded voice on the line .
“ This is the final call before we close the file .
Press 1 to speak to a representative now about your vehicle . ”
Most people react with annoyance as soon as they hear the insistent  and all - too - familiar  voices and simply hang up .
But , then , most people cannot investigate who is behind the call and take the information to the Federal Trade Commission .
Mr. Schumer said he received the call on Wednesday as he discussed national health care issues with two other senators , Blanche L. Lincoln of Arkansas and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan .
GDC 2009 marked the second anniversary of the PlayStation Home announcement , and Ars was invited to speak with Jack Buser , director of PlayStation Home for Sony Computer Entertainment of America , and Peter Edward , director of the Home platform .
I started by asking how far we 've come since that announcement .
" I think everyone gets it , we 're starting to see large numbers of people in there .
The user base is active .
Content is constantly coming in ... when you have the Guitar Hero space you pretty much know you 've made it .
The fact of the matter is , every major publisher for the PS3 now has some kind of plan for Home , " Buser tells Ars .
What is Home ?
A virtual space where gamers can get together to talk about games , play some arcade - like games themselves , explore areas based on PS3 titles , and even purchase new accessories for their avatars .
The service has been treated somewhat harshly by the press and gamers for having little content at launch — and for having quite the collection of griefers , with harassment usually aimed at female avatars .
Dealing with words like " gay " and " Jew " on the service has also been an embarrassment for the company ; someone 's religion may be used as an insult , but the term itself being called inappropriate does n't make for the right kinds of headlines .
I 'm given a short demo of the new Guitar Hero space , complete with a Simon - like guitar mini-game and videos for Guitar Hero : Metallica playing on the walls .
" Spaces create a hub for the community .
Here people can go and meet each other and exchange hints and tips ... we also have video screens where there will be announcements and big marketing updates , around the bend they 'll be featuring behind - the - scenes information , Home - specific information .
You see a lot of that that one - on - one communication between the publishers and the community . "
The scoreboards for the guitar minigames are pointed out as being a major feature .
I may have looked slightly incredulous .
" People inside Home take [ high scores ] very seriously , " they tell me , saying how quickly the scores rise inside the virtual space .
In the Red Bull racing area people were taking pictures of their best times and putting them in the forums ; adding a scoreboard helped the space become even more popular .
At an earlier meeting , Lincoln Davis , who handles media relations for the PlayStation Network , laughed darkly when I said we have been somewhat critical of Home in the past .
He seemed to think it was something of an understatement .
Things are looking good at the new Guitar Hero space , but it seems like the space simply is n't tied into the game enough .
You can't get a band together and launch directly into the game , which would have been a killer feature .
" That 's certainly something that can be added later on , " I 'm told , and it 's stressed that Home is constantly being updated and improved .
" The community should expect that .
It will be more of a story if the space stays static , not if things are added .
There will be events , the space will change , the franchise spaces will grow with the series itself . "
Everyone hopes that , eventually , the line between the game and the Home spaces will be blurred .
This of course leads to marketing opportunities .
For Killzone 2 the company had Sony employees simply walking around the virtual spaces in Helghast and ISA Trooper outfits .
The only way to get those outfits ?
Preordering the game through Amazon.com .
" It was an amazing way to tie what was going on in the virtual world to the physical product ... there is a minigame in the Resident Evil 5 area that you can't play unless you have the Blu-ray disc in the drive ! "
Buser tells me — he 's obviously excited by the idea .
The best online plans never survive the first 50 people
Have there been problems policing the community ?
There is a long pause as they both think about the question .
" The average time people spend in home is 40 minutes .
That 's four - zero .
People find secret ways to get up on top of stuff .
At first we did n't like it very much , but the community loves it . "
Some light parkour is n't exactly what I was referring to , but the other problems are downplayed .
" Any online communities have their scare stories and naysayers .
Home is part of the PlayStation Network , it goes by the same standards and guidelines of the PlayStation Network , we have established moderation practices ... fundamentally , it 's the same thing .
Since Home is a 3D avatar - based service there are different interpretations of griefing , and we adapt our practices accordingly .
We take action against users who abuse the system .
I do n't know what more to say , " Edward says .
" If you go into Home for long enough you 'll see someone ... doing something , and in short order you 'll also see one of our moderators , " Buser adds and then chuckles .
" But it 's not just the moderators who do the moderation ... people police their own community . "
They draw a parallel with real life , where if you 're chatting with some people and you get harassed , you can call the police , tell them to get lost , or move to another area .
" People will convey their displeasure to other users . "
A path out of beta ?
The other major issue is the fact that the service is still in beta , which leads to an easy out when discussing these growing pains .
I ask when we 'll get to a full , all - the - way - there release .
" For me , it 's not an issue .
We 're already at a stage where anyone with a PS3 can get on , we 're at more than five million downloads of the client .
Home is there , it 's not going away , " says Edwards .
But when will they lose the beta status ?
" I 'm certainly not going to give you any information on it , " I 'm finally told .
" I can tell you why we like the term open beta , and why we 've been sticking with it , " Buser says , stepping in .
" We really want to emphasize this idea of an evolving platform .
What you see now is very different from what you 'll see in a few months , and that 's very different from what you 'll see after that . "
I 'm getting slightly frustrated by their inability to give a good answer .
World of Warcraft is another fluid , evolving experience , and that 's certainly not in beta .
" That 's fair enough , but for us it 's really , really important to drive that message home , even in the name of the product : Home , Open Beta .
Come in , check it out , check out what we 're offering , but come back !
It will be different when you come back .
Other products are changing like this , but it 's very very unusual ... we 've really embraced those words —
Open Beta — we 're really comfortable with them .
We have n't made any announcements about when we 'll be moving past them or if we hit a major milestone or anything like that . "
There is a long pause .
" We 're becoming quite fond of the words ! "
Everyone laughs , but the tone is also slightly uncomfortable .
" There 's nothing really to say beyond that .
It 's a nonissue in a way . "
So take it away then !
Say it 's out of beta !
Buser thinks about it for a moment .
" It 's changing so fast at the moment , so when would something significant happen that would shadow all the other changes , and make it significantly above that to justify making a big fanfare about it coming out , it would be ... " he trails off .
I note that it almost seems as if they 're trapped by the designation " open beta " at this stage .
" To be honest , we do n't think about it , internally .
We have our short - term plans , our updates , we 're more focused on getting as much out there as possible . "
We shake hands and I leave , perhaps on a different note than we began the interview .
What 's clear is that Home has come a very long way ... and it has just as long to go .

Explore our interactive timeline of human evolution
DAYBREAK , and a group of apes are dancing around a rectangular monolith so dark it seems to suck light in .
Inspired by this mysterious object , one of them grabs a bone and begins to wield it as a tool – then as a weapon .
The armed ape goes hunting , makes a kill and eats flesh for the first time .
Next day , he drives a rival group of apes from a watering hole and murders their leader .
This , according to Stanley Kubrick ’s sci- fi masterpiece 2001 : A space odyssey , is the dawn of humankind .
If only it were that simple .
Anyone trying to understand our origins soon realises that no one thing pushed our ape ancestors across the threshold of humanity .
It is difficult to pin down what makes us human anyway .
We walk upright on two legs , with disproportionately large brains held high , communicating in spoken languages , navigating the complexity of human social life , producing sophisticated tools and artefacts , and creating culture .
The story of how we became human is woven from many strands .
Attempts to unravel that tale have until recently relied on the hard evidence of fossilised bones .
This has allowed us to make inferences about certain aspects of our ancestors : how big they were , how they moved and their cranial capacity .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The housing crisis will deepen , the country could fall into a depression and laid - off workers may need to start their own business .
New York psychic Roxanne Usleman says the bad economy had been good for her business .
If this sounds like the advice of a financial planner or an economist , think again .
It 's a reading from psychic medium Roxanne Usleman .
As the economy tanks , Usleman 's business is booming .
" It 's more types of people I have never seen before , " says Usleman .
" Men in the business world , high - powered jobs , stock market , Wall Street . "
Since last fall , she says she began to see a new type of client -- a " logical , [ A - type ] of personality . "
Many of them are " just completely lost , " says Usleman .
Relationship advice , typically the bread and butter of the psychic business , has been supplanted by something new .
" Should I merge with this company ?
Should I bring in a partner to my company , " are the kind of questions Usleman gets from her clients .
' Your $ $ $ $ $ ' CNN 's Christine Romans and Ali Velshi cut through the smoke screens and tell you how the news of the day affects you and your wallet .
Sat. 1 p.m. & Sun. 3 p.m. ET see full schedule »
This is not the fortune teller of popular imagination .
Wearing a Diane Von Furstenberg dress , Usleman met with CNN at her sparse but tasteful office in midtown Manhattan .
There was no crystal ball in sight when she gave a personal reading on the economy .
For a typical reading , she grips a client 's photograph or set of keys and consults " the angels . "
Business is good , she says .
Usleman sees five or six clients a day and charges up to $ 135 a pop for sessions that usually last more than an hour .
Watch what a session looks like »
Businessman Bruce Levy was skeptical at first but one of his clients pushed him to get a reading .
" What I expected was something like Ouija boards and someone looking at my palm and seeing my lifeline , " says Levy .
Instead , he found a psychic who he says helped him find the answers .
" She helps me make better decisions , " Levy says .
" She is able to make me see things that I would n't otherwise see .
I just think that she has this intuition that gets through to my subconscious in a way that I can't .
" Tell us how you 're surviving in this tough economy
There are no national statistics on the business of psychics .
But Usleman 's experience is backed up by anecdotal evidence from other psychics around the country .
Liveperson.com matches psychics with customers on its
Web site and says the uncertain economy has been good for business .
Some psychics charge up to $ 20 a minute for advice .
Many people simply feel like they have to do something , according to Professor Gita Johar at Columbia Business School in New York .
" The biggest reason people are going to see psychics is probably that they want to feel in control , " says Johar , who studies consumer behavior .
" And when they see that their financials are n't looking so good and they really can't turn to their financial adviser -- they have n't been getting really good advice and so they have to turn to someone else . "
Are people taking control or just wasting money ?
Financial adviser Ryan Mack says adding the cost of a psychic reading into an already stretched budget is not a good investment .
" Regardless of what the stars say , regardless of what the map says in terms of -- if Pluto is lined up with Mars , " says Mack .
" You have the ability within yourself to save , to plan and to be diligent . "

All About National Economy
In the Depression , smart college students flocked into civil engineering to design the highway , bridge and dam - building projects of those days .
In the Sputnik era , students poured into the sciences as America bet on technology to combat the cold war Communist challenge .
Yes , the jobs beckoned and the pay was good .
But those careers , in their day , had other perks : respect and self - esteem .
Big shifts in the flow of talent can ripple through the nation and the economy for decades with lasting effect .
The engineers of the Depression built everything from inter-city roads to the Hoover Dam , while the Sputnik - inspired scientists would go on , often with research funding from the Pentagon , to create the building - block innovations behind modern computing and the Internet .
Today , the financial crisis and the economic downturn are likely to alter drastically the career paths of future years .
The contours of the shift are still in flux , in part because there is so much uncertainty about the shape of the economic landscape and the job market ahead .
But choosing a career is a guess about the future in which economics is only part of the calculation .
Prestige , peer expectations and the climate of public opinion also matter .
And early indications suggest new career directions that are tethered less to the dream of an immediate six - figure paycheck on Wall Street than to the demands of a new public agenda to solve the nation ’s problems .
( Newser ) – More than a million car stereos were stolen in 1994 , but in the past 15 years , yearly thefts have plummeted by more than half , NPR reports .
Why ?
Automakers now install good stereos from the start , and “ there 's no market for factory radios because they normally do n't fit in any other cars , ” says a technician .
Years ago , drivers often replaced poor stereos with devices that were easily transferred to other cars .
As it is today , if a thief nabbed , say , a Volkswagen Jetta stereo , he could only sell it to a Jetta driver — and it would be the same stereo the driver had already .
In the 1990s , a police officer said , every stolen car had the radio missing .
Now , thieves will seize an umbrella or a pair of sunglasses before they take the radio .
( Read more cars stories . )
As of February 's passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , the US is now committed to spending almost $ 800 billion to stimulate our stalled economy over the next few years .
Apart from job creation , one of the goals of the stimulus package ( as it 's commonly called ) is to boost long - term American competitiveness by rebuilding the now - depleted fund of basic research capital that the Cold War era produced , the dot - com era spent , and the post - 9/11 security state finished off .
If I were the Obama administration , and I were really serious about putting those billions into the hands of a crowd that has a spectacular record of turning public money directly into transformative public goods , I 'd go straight to the area in and around Palo Alto , CA , home of legendary labs like Xerox PARC and ground zero of the still - mushrooming information explosion .
And to narrow the geography even further , I 'd make my way to the campus of Stanford University , and ask the school 's president , computer architecture pioneer John Hennessy , how to spend the stimulus money .
So , when I recently got the chance to interview Hennessy at a conference on technology and public policy , that 's exactly what I did .
And while I had a minute with one of the fathers of the RISC movement and the co-author of the main textbook in the computer architecture field — the Gray 's Anatomy of computing — I also asked him about the multicore revolution , and about the on - going evolution of computer architecture .
Stimulating innovation
JS : If you were in charge of spending $ 800 billion dollars worth of stimulus money to get the country back on track , how would you split that money up ?
JH : There are what I would call several pots [ that you can put the money in ] .
First of all , there 's core research , and what we should be doing is laying down a ramp of research funding that will take us [ from where we are now up ] to a level of where we might be on base - level funding on NIH and NSF , say , two years out .
So what we want to do is say , " we believe the budget can support this funding level , which is higher than were we are today , at NIH and NSF , so let 's construct a ramp between here and there . "
Pump some money into DARPA to try to get it back on the track of long - term research , as opposed to these shorter - term , metric - driven , six - month / one - year check - ins — wrong idea .
Fund big strategic areas , and fund multiple teams at multiple universities .
That 's what you do on the research - funding side .
And obviously , there 's a set of key problems you can think about .
There are computing problems , the energy issue , in the biological sciences there a number of opportunities .
We have n't funded stem cell research at the level we should .
Neuroscience has big new opportunities ; I think this next 50 years is going to be the neuroscience equivalent of the understanding of DNA — the 50 years that went from DNA to the sequencing of the human genome ; the same thing will happen in the neurosciences .
We understand how neurons fire , but we do n't understand how the brain works .
There 's a big gap in - between .
Close that gap , and that will lead to much more robust treatments for Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's and diseases that right now we treat in a sort of hit - or - miss , empirical fashion .
So I think there are lots of good things to do on the research side .
Secondly , you take a pot of money and say that we 've got an ailing , out - of - date infrastructure , both in terms of instrumentation and equipment in the labs , as well as some of our research buildings .
Let 's go invest in that , and that creates lots of jobs .
Increasingly , in the physical sciences and the biological sciences , instrumentation is the make - or - break piece of it .
You 've got smart people , and you 've got instrumentation , and you have to bring those together .
So I think we need to really invest there .
The cost of setting up somebody who 's working in basic materials area , for example , has gone up to $ 1 million per investigator , $ 2 million for a more senior person , and $ 10 million for a shared facility of some sort .
So we need to be thinking about numbers like that when we invest in facilities and infrastructure .
Then , I think you have to deploy a bunch of this money to do a bunch of things that we 're simply behind on .
Fixing the broadband infrastructure in this country .
Fixing our piggish use of energy in lots of places — going back and really inspiring people to do energy efficiency , and supplying the up - front capital so that they get there .
I think there are a number of things like that — roads , and the transportation infrastructure , as well .
You want to be doing things like that because that will help put us in a better economic situation so that the rest of our economy can run better .
Intellectual property reform
JS : One thing I 'm surprised that you did n't touch on is intellectual property reform .
Do you see a role for IP reform ?
JH : Yeah , I do .
My good friend Rick Levin , the president at Yale , participated in this study that was done by the national academies on intellectual property reform — trying to streamline the process and make it cleaner .
I support what 's being done there and I 've argued in favor of it .
It does place some additional burdens on universities to be more prompt about recording , because one of the key issues is switching to first - to - file instead of first - to - discover , but I think the reality is that that 's where we have to go to , and the universities should n't block something that is so obviously good for the rest of the economy and the high - tech sector .
So that 's my feeling about that , and we ought to just get our act together .
I 'm less concerned about protecting intellectual property than I am in ensuring that the country reaps the rewards of that benefit .
If intellectual property protection is important to the universities ...
I do n't think that it 's the most important thing , by the way .
The most important thing that universities do is fuel the rest of the economy by the creation of intellectual property — sometimes it 's patented , sometimes it 's not , but the country benefits in the end .
Even private institutions are quasi-public in terms of their funding , so I 'm less concerned about protecting intellectual property than I am in ensuring that the country reaps the rewards of that benefit .
But I think that the concept of a challenge period for a new patent , where external people can submit claims or requests to investigate before the new patent is nailed down — I think that is absolutely required .
If you visit the patent office and talk the patent officers , you realize that these guys are just overwhelmed .
Typical processing time is down to less than 24 hours , meaning 24 hours of one person 's time , or about three days .
They simply do n't have the time to keep up on all the literature .
Despite recommendations in the past that they create a sabbatical program or a continuing education program , it has n't really been done at the level it needs to be done .
So the result is that the patent officers look primarily at the contents of the patent .
Sure , they can do a patent database search or a literature search , but if they 're not an expert in the field then it 's almost impossible to search the literature in the field and read it and figure out whether or not this invention is a trivial extension of something that has already existed .
So I think we need this [ challenge period ] , and we need it also from a global perspective , because technology is now globally created and distributed , and we need to deal with it that way .
AwesomePro 2.0 had it all – the low price of a mom-and - pop software company , 24/7 support , and a surprisingly robust feature set .
Their presentation to the higher - ups could n't have gone better , with the bigwigs ready to whip out the checkbook before it was even over .
AwesomePro were light years ahead of the competition at literally a fifth of the price .
It would be the perfect fit to replace the aging and temperamental in - house ERP solution in use by one of Stewart T.'s clients .
Implementation
Getting the software in the building was to be Stewart 's top priority – his client was like a child on Christmas begging his dad to set up the Wii .
" Is it done yet ? "
No .
" When can we use it ? "
Um , soon ...?
" But we wanna use it to prioritize our initiatives and do some claims processing nowwwwwwww ! "
Being pinged for the status of the install was a constant distraction , as were a few last - minute bumps in the road encountered in any large - scale software integration .
And strangely , the " crack " team of support staff was often unable to answer most of the questions about their own software .
Stewart brushed it off , as he was able to work around or figure out most of the issues on his own .
Before long , they had their system up and running , including a full import of data from the previous system .
And it was glorious !
The bosses were happy , the ERP company was happy , and Stewart was happy .
There were a few curious issues with the data migration however .
Typically , issues with data migration come in the form of incomplete or null data , a data element missing a parent data element , or columns lined up incorrectly .
I 'm sure we 've all encountered a " Mrs. 123 Oakview Ave " living in the beautiful city of " female , 555-867-5309 " .
These errors , however , were subtler and more alarming .
" John Oxford " became " John Ocford . "
" 44 Front St " became " 444 front st . "
The live system showed no such typos , and when Stewart reviewed a small sample of records , 25 % had at least one typo !
Including , yes , the record for Stewart ( or should I say " Stewert " ) .
Fixing the Typos
Spirits were still high when Stewart brought the ERP company in to discuss some of the data migration issues .
" I need you to walk me through the import process , " he insisted .
Stewart and the technician ( " John " ) sat at a PC .
John immediately opened Excel , and Stewart 's heart sank .
He had the data extracted in dozens of CSV files , which John would manipulate quite a bit , and then finally import it into the new system .
So the process was n't the crime of the century , but it was n't reassuring , either .
Still , it was n't yet evident where the typos had come from .
" So that 's what we do , " John said , still smiling .
" Does that answer your question ? "
" Well , no .
What happens to move the Excel data into the actual database ? "
John froze .
" Well , that part 's a little more involved ... "
Stewart remained silent , and John stared back blankly .
" The thing is , it 's a relational database , " John stammered .
" And ...? "
" You ca n't just insert data from Excel into a relational database ! "
Stewart sighed .
" Well , yeah , it 's not a direct insert , but there are ways to import , you just have to do it in the right order .
As long as you know what the constraints ar - "
In a Shyamalanian everything - comes - together moment , Stewart had a rush of understanding .
The team not knowing the software well , the exact same featureset of the six figure system , oblivity to the constraints – they did n't build the software at all !
It was a knockoff from somewhere else all along !
Also , John was actually a ghost the whole time !
( spoiler warning if you have n't seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding )
Stewart swallowed hard , his career flashing before his eyes .
" So how exactly are you entering those 35,000 records ? "
" It 's a process of ... er... "
John stared at the table .
He mumbled , " it 's a ... the process ... "
Stewart raised his voice slightly , and more assertively repeated his question .
John looked up , cleared his throat , flipped into confidence mode , and tried to put a good spin on it .
" Our process is to turn over the data to a team of highly - skilled data insertion analysts who are responsible for importing the data . "
He smirked , satisfied with his answer .
No way Stewart was sharp enough to decode the marketing spin !
" So , " Stewart pressed , " you 've got people retyping this directly into the database . "
Immediately , John 's bit switched back to " nervous stammering , " and his eyes shot back down to the table .
After a long pause , he quietly muttered , " kind of , yeah ... "
Thanks to Stewart 's expertise , he was able to provide detailed guidance on how the data could be imported from Excel .
" Google for ' sql import from excel , ' " he advised .
Still , he could n't bring himself to ask how much money the highly - skilled data insertion analysts would see from the sale .
As India 's big cats face the growing threat of extinction , Kevin Rushby is both inspired and underwhelmed by its national parks ' approaches to conservation
We had just regained the path on the far side of the stream when Prasad stopped .
So far our tiger hunt has been unsuccessful .
A group of Malabar pied hornbills clattered through a tall fruit - bearing tree above us .
Further away there was another sound , an urgent and repetitive bark .
Prasad used his stick to draw two circles in the dirt around some marks .
Neem translated his whispers .
" Leopard tracks - they are about 15 minutes ahead of us .
A mother and cub .
The barking is the langur monkeys giving warnings . "
We went forward .
The jungle was tinderbox dry .
It was almost impossible to move without snapping a twig under a pile of crackling leaves and there were four of us : myself , two park guides and Neem , naturalist and translator .
Through the trees we caught occasional glimpses of the main ridge that makes up Satpura national park , a 1,400 - square - kilometre patch of jungle in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh .
That morning , Neem had told me , I was the only tourist in all those acres of wild forest .
Where the path cleared a little , Prasad pointed out more tracks : " Indian wild dog - very rare animal . "
And nearby something else : a pile of whitened droppings .
" Tiger . "
I felt the adrenaline kick through me .
In my imagination the thickets around us parted and a massive orange and black killer came hurtling out .
An adult royal Bengal tiger can weigh up to 35 stone .
It sprints at 50 mph .
How fast could I climb a tree ?
My assignment was to investigate whether tourism can benefit tiger conservation , but now I wondered if I was about to increase the tigers ' food supply .
It was nonsense , of course .
Any tiger that sensed our presence would be quietly moving in the opposite direction .
One cannot , however , always be rational about such things .
Neem grinned , as if he guessed my thoughts .
" It 's old , " he said , " A couple of weeks . "
Further down the track , Prasad and his partner , Ashish , held a whispered conversation .
The warning cries had stopped and so had the leopard tracks .
They were trying to second - guess the cats ' direction .
We moved forward again , cutting through the forest past a pile of white bones , " An old kill - a gaur , or Indian bison . "
Then suddenly Prasad crouched down , motioning us to do likewise .
There was a whispered conversation and a single glistening drop of liquid on a dry grass blade was pointed out to me .
" Indian wild dog .
It must be very close . "
Prasad slowly raised his head over the line of the undergrowth and I copied .
Almost immediately I saw them : a pack of chestnut and white coloured hounds , more like a long - legged fox than a dog , loping directly towards us .
In seconds they would be on top of us .
I ducked down and got the camera ready .
The dogs , however , had sensed our presence and altered course .
All I got was a brief glimpse through the trees to our left , a single adult that had paused briefly to watch us .
Then , in a flick of chestnut tails , they were gone .
We stood up and relaxed .
" Unbelievable , " said Neem , " There were 18 of them - I 've never seen so many .
Very rare sighting . "
I was shocked to find that 40 minutes had passed since encountering the leopard tracks .
The concentration had been so intense .
And what had we seen ?
No tigers .
No more than a few seconds of a wild dog , but I was buzzing with the adrenaline .
" Breakfast ? "
Neem suggested .
We moved on to some smooth flat - topped boulders , brushed aside a few porcupine poos and sat down .
Neem took a lunch box out .
" Cucumber sandwich anyone ? "
The tiger , as everyone knows , is in deep trouble .
From an estimated 40,000 animals in India a century ago , the number is now down to around 1,200 .
Four sub -species are now extinct .
In January 2005 the Sariska national park was forced to admit that all of its supposed 35 tigers had been killed after a group of students from the Wildlife Institute of India searched the park and could n't find any , an exposé that also uncovered how park officials had been falsely exaggerating tiger numbers for years .
Some experts argued that numbers might have fallen below the minimum for a viable population , something that would mean certain extinction in the wild .
The psychological impact of this calamity on conservation work is hard to exaggerate .
Project Tiger in India has been one of the world 's most energetic and well - funded campaigns , a flagship programme whose failure would spread alarm and despondency .
Things looked up briefly in June 2005 with the arrest of Sansar Chand , the notorious poacher and wildlife product trader who had killed over 1,000 tigers , including the Sariska population .
Plans for wildlife corridors between parks also raised hopes that losses could be replenished naturally from more successful areas .
However , the panic was reignited this year by the admission that Panna Reserve , also in Madhya Pradesh , had lost all of its estimated 30 animals .
One gleam of hope is that some experts , including Julian Matthews of the charity , Tour Operators for Tigers , feel that the way forward is with eco-tourism in well - managed parks - something along the lines already tried in Africa .
If handled correctly , increased visitor numbers , the logic goes , could encourage good practise and ward off poachers .
Now cut away to a week earlier .
This time I am in Kanha National Tiger Reserve , again in Madhya Pradesh .
Kanha provides visitors with the classic Indian wildlife experience , the one most tour companies offer and the one that usually guarantees a tiger sighting .
At 6 am we are in a queue of about 50 jeeps at the park gates , awaiting entry to the " core " zone of the reserve .
Most of the vehicles are filled with Indian families , kids excited and chattering , ladies in bright saris .
We have passed through the broad " buffer zone " where villagers are allowed to live inside a protected forest .
It 's also the zone where privately run tourist lodges are springing up in profusion to cater for this explosion in domestic tourism .
We pick up our local guide and the gate opens .
Our first objective , like everyone else , is to reach " The Centre " .
This is the Park HQ within the inner reserve , the area that excludes all humans except park rangers .
At the centre you can get the numbered token that entitles you to an elephant ride , should a tiger be located .
Once we have that token we can begin to tour Kanha : a delightful rolling landscape of cool forests interspersed with broad grassy meadows dotted with herds of deer .
There is no tracking , however .
No one is allowed down from the open - topped jeep and no deviation from the dirt road is permitted .
The net result is that the local guide contributes very little , his ground - level knowledge locked away in the front seat of the jeep .
These men are usually from the tribal groups that formerly lived within the park and their jobs are the " local employment " that was part of the deal when the government shifted them out .
Sitting in a car , without English skills , they are often under-used and bored .
In this situation the naturalist provided by the tourist lodge becomes the key to any understanding for the visitor .
These are from a very different background : often college - educated and always English - speaking , they move easily in the luxury hotel environment .
Many will become great naturalists , but their knowledge is bookish and vehicle - bound : some have never walked through a jungle in their lives .
At Kanha I was soon locked into my packaged tiger experience .
The park elephants and mahouts had located a male tiger .
We dashed to the centre and waited for our number to come up .
Within an hour I was climbing up on the elephant with one other tourist and strolling through the bush .
The tiger was slumped in a pool of water , lazily watching the elephants come and go with their cargoes of tourists .
He did not get up or move ; he probably knew better , having got used to this morning ritual : elephants and mahouts kettle him for an hour while the visitors get their pictures .
The longer he is kept , the better , as each tourist pays 600 rupees ( around £ 9 ) for the thrill .
I came away rather unelated .
It felt like a zoo .
I put this to Dr H S Pabla , chief wildlife officer for Madhya Pradesh .
" But you could walk , " he says .
" The lodges do n't tell anyone , but we have changed the rules and it is possible to walk through the parks - with a guide of course . "
He goes on to tell me that Pench national park near Nagpur has a walking trail complete with four observation towers that no one has ever used .
Not a single tourist in a 100 - square - kilometre area specifically set aside for walking safaris .
" I want people to come and start walking there ! " he insists .
The magic formula Pabla and others are seeking is a way to integrate tourism so it energises the conservation , rather than just turn tigers into fairground attractions .
My experience at Satpura was the result of work by Hashem Tyabji , a former wildlife warden , who has set up a new lodge , Forsyth , to encourage walking safaris .
His use of local guides on walking tours puts the power , and some money , back in their hands .
" We plan to start teaching them English , " he says , " Communication between tourists and locals is one of the critical issues . "
It is at Pench that I finally do get my " genuine " tiger sighting , but it is one that raises other questions in my mind about tourists and big cats .
Pench is one of India 's up - and - coming parks : its tigers featured in the BBC documentary series Spy in the Jungle .
Close to the big city of Nagpur , it is nevertheless wilder and less - visited - at least if you avoid public holidays and weekends .
The local guides are keener here , more ready to offer information .
We had barely entered the core zone at 6 am when our guide stopped to look at some tiger tracks .
" There is a tigress with cubs who often hunts over this side . "
We turned off on a side road and drove slowly along until we heard langur monkeys warning calls .
A few seconds later , Dhanya our naturalist hissed an excited warning : a tigress was strolling down towards the road through the forest .
This time I felt all the excitement that I had expected .
The tigress was wearing a radio collar - one of the individuals that had been filmed as a cub in the BBC series .
The tigress sauntered across the track and was about to re-enter the forest when she stopped .
Something had alerted her .
She went down on the ground , her hips working to get into a spring position .
It was then we saw why .
A string of spotted deer , chital , were strolling through the trees , directly towards the tigress .
When they were just 20 feet from the tiger 's jaws , they turned , still oblivious to the danger , and jumped down on the road .
One after the other , they trotted across .
Last to go was the fawn .
The tigress waited .
Her tactic would be to attack from behind , leaping on the fawn and biting its neck .
My camera was ready .
It was going to be the wildlife moment of a lifetime - for me , if not the fawn .
Then the jeep appeared .
It was a big party of tourists , heading towards us .
Our driver waved at them to stop .
Instead they speeded up .
I could hear them thinking . . .
Are we missing something ?
Our driver was waving madly .
They increased speed .
We are definitely missing something !
The deer sprang away in alarm .
The tigress relaxed , stood up and sauntered off .
Success rates in hunts are never very high for tigers and they do n't appear to waste energy on frustration .
Unlike us .
Our driver lambasted theirs .
I caught a last glimpse of the tigress as she disappeared .
From behind the demands of two cubs and the dry season were clear : her body was gaunt and bony .
For her , at least , tourism had not helped on this occasion .
Despite this experience , I came away from Pench , Kanha and Satpura cautiously optimistic for the tiger .
With large areas of jungle still intact in Madhya Pradesh , and plans for wildlife corridors between parks advancing , there is hope that a new eco - tourist approach will have sufficient animals to work with .

• This article was amended on Wednesday 29 April 2009 .
The article above about sighting tigers mentioned hearing lemur warning calls and seeing cherval , a type of spotted deer , in India 's Pench national park .
As India is lemurless , the warnings should have been attributed to langur monkeys , as they were correctly elsewhere the piece .
The deer in question are chital .
This has been corrected .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Hamas security forces killed at least 32 Palestinian political rivals and suspected collaborators with Israel during and after the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip , Human Rights Watch said in a new report .
The report by the New York - based group said “ unlawful arrests , torture and killings in detention ” were making a mockery of Hamas ’s claims to uphold the law in the Gaza Strip , territory ruled by the Islamist movement .
“ Hamas should end its attacks on political opponents and suspected collaborators in Gaza which have killed at least 32 Palestinians and maimed several dozen more during and since the recent Israeli military offensive , ” the report said .
Human Rights
Watch said gunmen believed to be from Hamas tracked down and killed 18 Palestinians , most of them suspected collaborators , who escaped from Gaza ’s main prison after Israeli aircraft bombed the facility on December 28 .
The group said another 14 Palestinians , at least four of them detainees , had been killed by alleged members of Hamas security forces since Israel ended its 22 - day offensive on January 18 .
Taher al - Nono , spokesman of the Hamas government in Gaza , denied Hamas security forces were involved in extra-judicial killings .
He said “ some resistance factions claimed they had killed suspected collaborators during the Israeli war on Gaza and in areas where battles took place , and we have launched an investigation which has not yet been completed ” .
Nono said after the Israeli operation , 11 Gaza policemen were dismissed and could face criminal charges over their alleged involvement in the mistreatment of a detainee who was held on suspicion of drug dealing .
Human Rights
Watch said it based its report on interviews with victims and witnesses in the Gaza Strip and on case reports by Palestinian human rights groups .
It said Palestinian authorities in the occupied West Bank , where Hamas ’s main rival , the Fatah movement , holds sway have increased repressive measures against Hamas members and supporters .
Last month , a Palestinian group , the Independent Commission for Human Rights ( ICHGR ) , said security forces controlled by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and those loyal to Fatah in the West Bank routinely carry out politically motivated arrests .
The ICHR said it had documented torture in Palestinian prisons in the two territories that included beatings , the removal of fingernails and sleep deprivation .
Hamas , which won a Palestinian parliamentary election in 2006 , wrested control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah forces in 2007 .
Each side has accused the other of human rights abuses .
The plan is to somehow improve the whole process through bioengineering to do what nature does not do now .
Is this a sensible way to approach a very real current fuel problem ?
The problem with Fourth Generation Biofuels is that they are way , way , way off in the future , if they can be done at all .
This is a graphic from Biopact description of fourth generation biofuels .
The answer is let efficiency take care of it , at least in the foreseeable future 5 , 10 or 15 years from now .
Chu ’s reasoning is based on his miscalculation that we have between 10 and 40 years before oil & natural gas production , taken together , will peak and decline .
Efficiency is supposed to double the time we have to find replacement fuels , so Chu has recast the problem to give himself the 20 to 80 years he requires to find a way to replace oil .
According to Dave Cohen , Steven
Chu sees no particular urgency to our current problems .
His way of dealing with potential shortfalls is described as follows :
I was trying to think of a suitable topic for April Fools Day , and for some reason Steven Chu's Helios project and Fourth Generation Biofuels came to mind .
According to Dave Cohen , " Chu wants nothing less than to alter the Earth ’s primary productivity , its energy flows , to achieve greater efficiency in the conversion of sunlight to chemical energy than Nature has after 3.5 billion years of evolution . "
How likely is this to happen , especially in the timeframe we need to solve our problems ?
Chu 's confirmation testimony indicates that the research is not very far along .
According to an account of testimony at Chu's Senate confirmation hearing :
Chu explained that the two - year - old program is striving to develop fourth - generation biofuels .
To date , researchers at the lab have “ trained ” bacteria and yeast to take simple sugars and produce “ not ethanol , but gasoline - like substitutes , diesel - fuel substitutes and jet [ fuel ] substitutes . ”
He says a cadre of “ brilliant ” scientists who had previously spent most of their careers in basic research is now “ very focused on making this technology commercially viable . ” . .
Currently , no particular plants are being focused on , but they could include anything from algae and corn stover to grasses and lumber - mill dust and scrap .
So Chu reassured Lincoln that her state grows suitable raw materials .
But the real key to making these next - gen biofuels , Chu says , will be figuring out how to design feedstock plants that would grow using fewer energy inputs and prove more robust in the field .
The program ’s also investigating pretreatments for plant - based cellulosic feedstocks .
Their goal : to facilitate the ability of single - cell organisms to break these materials down by separating out and discarding the molecules that plants make to protect themselves from attack by microbes and fungi .
Such a multi- pronged approach looks to optimize all phases of biofuels production with no preconceived idea of which area is likely to offer the biggest payoff .
And that , Chu said , “ is why I ’m so optimistic some real progress can be made . ”
And rapidly .
This is a link to the Helios research center at Berkley lab , that Chu was formerly the head of .
According the website , the goal of Helios is
The primary goal of this effort is to develop methods to “ store ” solar energy in the form of renewable transportation fuel .
Several approaches under investigation include the generation of biofuels from biomass , the generation of biofuels by algae , and the direct conversion of water and carbon dioxide to fuels by the use of solar energy .
This is a link to a speech by Steven Chu called The Energy Problem : What the Helios Project Can Do About It .
If we had 20 to 80 years to solve our problem , there is at least a remote chance the research into fourth generation biofuels and the Helios project would be helpful .
But in the timeframe we are talking about , it seems to me that we should not be putting many eggs in this basket .

Right - wing Republicans have reportedly been mobilizing to block the appointment of two prominent lawyers to advisory positions in the Obama administration : Indiana University constitutional law Professor Dawn Johnsen and the Dean of the Yale Law School Harold Koh .
Johnsen is the administration ’s nominee to head for the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice and Koh is nominated to be the Legal Counsel at the State Department .
Both have a strong human rights record , Johnsen was Legal Director of the National Abortion & Reproductive Rights Action League and Koh served as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy , Human Rights and Labor in the Clinton administration .
Both have distinguished records of government service .
The legal commentator Scott Horton has cited anonymous sources in the GOP and DoJ who claim Senate Republicans are now threatening to filibuster the appointments unless the Obama administration agrees not to release three classified memos authored by one of John Yoo ’s successors in the Office of Legal Counsel , Steven Bradbury .
The memos , which have been described by Glenn Greenwald on Salon.com as the “ Rosetta stone ” for documenting war crimes committed by the highest - level Bush DoJ officials , have been the subject of a determined legal effort by the ACLU to compel their disclosure .
This effort has so far been opposed by the Obama administration despite its avowed commitment to transparency in government .
So , why not strike a deal ?
Because we still have not got to the bottom of what happened in our name .
New information continues to emerge on an almost weekly basis .
On Monday we saw the release of more material from the leaked International Committee of the Red Cross report on the treatment of High Value Detainees in CIA custody which revealed in detail for the first time the direct complicity of medical personnel in acts of torture in complete violation of the most basic of medical ethics .
This drip - drip of revelations is harmful in itself , undermining attempts to restore legitimacy to America ’s struggle with terrorism .
This will only end when there are no more revelations to emerge and that is why a full accounting for the abuses that have occurred since September 11th is so important .
As is a renewed commitment to using the criminal justice system to fight terrorism rather than the ‘ dark arts ’ in which former Vice President Dick Cheney placed so much faith .
Holding ourselves to higher standard makes us smarter and more effective .
The simple arithmetic regarding the number of releases without charge from Guantanamo makes it clear that with the ‘ gloves off ’
US officials were wrong about a detainee ’s affiliations far many more times than they were right .
We can do better than that .

Although you probably use it every day , here 's some interesting trivia you may not know about deodorant .
Actor Matthew McConaughey reportedly does n't wear deodorant .
1 . Be thankful for your foul body odor .
According to anthropologist Louis Leakey , it might be responsible for early man 's survival .
Leakey 's theory claims that most predators avoided feasting on humans because our body odor was " too repugnant . "
2 . Not only did the ancient Egyptians give us pyramids and flush toilets , they also pioneered the field of deodorants .
Egyptians were the first to popularize the idea of applying scents to armpits , usually using cinnamon and other spices that would n't turn rancid in the heat .
3 . The Roman poet Ovid preferred a more proactive solution .
In Book III of the Art of Love , he cautions women against carrying goats under their arms .
4. Antiperspirants are classified as drugs by the FDA .
Technically , they affect and / or alter your body 's natural functions .
5 . The first modern brand of antiperspirant , EverDry , hit drugstores in 1903 .
The original formula was so acidic that it regularly ate through clothing .
6 . Of course , modern antiperspirants can also ruin your clothing .
Aluminum chloride , the ingredient that blocks glandular openings and prevents sweating , is notorious for turning T - shirts yellow .
So , blame your antiperspirant for your pit stains , not your body .
7 . Offensive body odor is actually illegal in libraries in San Luis Obispo County , California .
Mental Floss :
Weird wedding laws still on the books
8 . One thing modern antiperspirants do n't do is cause degenerative diseases .
Medical science has found no conclusive evidence that absorbing aluminum chloride through the skin can lead to memory loss or slurred speech .
9. Aoki , a Japanese company known for its menswear , has developed a deodorant suit that supposedly absorbs sweat and neutralizes odors all over the body .
10 .
But that 's nothing !
The greatest Japanese innovation in the fight against B.O. is Fuwarinka scented gum .
The so - called " functional candy " contains aromatic compounds that cause your skin to release " Fresh Citrus " or " Fruity Rose " aromas for up to 6 hours after chewing .
11 . When Kurt Cobain wrote the lyrics for Nirvana 's breakout song " Smells Like Teen Spirit , " he did n't know Teen Spirit was a popular deodorant brand .
The Mennen Company , which produced the deodorant , would n't say whether the song caused sales to spike , but six months after the single debuted , Colgate bought the company for $ 670 million .

12 . In May 2008 , actor Matthew McConaughey revealed that he never uses deodorant or antiperspirant .
The next day , he received a year 's supply of deodorant body spray from the Axe Company , along with a note on why he might want to start .

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Tensions eased in the northern Indian state of Punjab on Tuesday , following widespread violence across the region after a Sikh guru was shot to death and another was wounded at an Indian temple in Vienna , Austria .
Sikh demonstrators brandish sticks as they shout slogans during a protest in Amritsar .
The situation was tense , but under control , Punjab 's inspector general of police said Tuesday morning .
The army and federal security forces were called in to restore order , added inspector general Parag Jain .
Thousands took part in demonstrations across the Doaba region , where protesters attacked public transportation , knocking out train service in some areas .
They also blocked a national highway to Jammu , CNN sister network CNN - IBN reported .
A number of businesses were ransacked as well .
Police reported one death .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , himself a Sikh , appealed for calm , in a statement .
" There is no place for violence in a secular society like India 's and certainly no excuse whatsoever for the violation of the sacred premises of a ( Sikh temple ) for narrow sectarian or other purposes , " India 's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement .
Killed in Sunday 's attack in Vienna was 57 - year - old Sant Rama Nand .
Do n't Miss Guru killed in shooting at Sikh temple
A second guru , Sant Niranjan Dass , 68 , was seriously injured .
His health has improved noticeably , according to the Indian Embassy , the Austria News Agency reported .
Fifteen others were also wounded .
" Sant Niranjan Dass is doing well , " the embassy said .
" He could soon be released from the hospital . "
Six people were arrested in connection with the attack , which occurred Sunday afternoon in Vienna 's 15th district , police spokesman Schwaig Hofar told CNN .
One suspect shot the two gurus , and five other attackers wielding knives assaulted people in the congregation during prayer , Hofar said .
Four of the wounded were suspects , two of them in serious condition , he said .
About 150 people were in the room when the violence took place , he said .
Authorities are investigating what triggered the attacks , but Austrian Interior Minister Maria Fekter said Sikhs have lived " exceptionally peacefully " in Austria .
CNN 's Ben Brumfeld and Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report .
Kate Hartnick Elliott , who runs a marketing , communications and executive search firm in New York City , lets people she knows use a spare desk , the Internet access and the printer in her office .
She said it ’s nice for people to have a place , other than Starbucks , to take a break between meetings .
LINKS
Most people would n’t hesitate to make an introduction or two to anyone in need .
But Amy Baker , who works in technology marketing in San Francisco , says that if you ’ve ever been out of work yourself , you have almost a moral obligation to throw the rope back for others .
“ One of the best pieces of advice I got was that you have to be talking to someone who ’s been through it , ” said Ms. Baker , who was unemployed for part of 2008 .
“ As someone who ’s been there , I have to reach out to people who are there now .
I know how hard it is , and I know it will work out . ”
Her list of ways she tries to help contains many good ideas , like signing up for unemployment before doing anything else and devoting part of each day to something you could n’t do while working , like taking a nap or seeing a matinee .
I ’ve posted it in its entirety and linked to it from the version of this article at nytimes.com / yourmoney .
You can also help by taking a friend or former colleague to an industry gathering that they might not know of .
Religious congregations are also ready - made communities that are predisposed toward service and good works .
If you ’re still employed , take the lead and start a networking group for those who are n’t .
Or , you could reach out via the organization ’s mailing list to solicit volunteers , say a local appraiser who can offer free appraisals to members in need who are trying to refinance their mortgages .
PATRONAGE
Given the shortage of full - time positions , many people are setting up consulting practices or starting small businesses while continuing their job search .

If you plan on starting a blog that focuses on all - things - kratom , you must have a lot of questions on your mind .
What kind of writing style works for the readers in this niche ?
What are the most common mistakes bloggers make ?
Are there any disclaimers you need to give ?
What about the tone and the overall style ?
In this post , we plan on answering all these questions so you can get straight into blogging with confidence .
Also , these tips should work for any blogger in general ; no matter their niche .
Here they are …
Write with a specific topic in Mind
If you write around a generalized topic , you might wind up nowhere .
Do n’t be surprised if your writing appears ‘ all over the place ’ .
It ’s easy to get lost in the sea of a pool of information around kratom .
Do your research , select a laser - specific topic , and write around that .
For example , you could write about different types of kratom strains , or what all recipes users can make with kratom .
You can also write about the medical conditions in which kratom could work as a management tool .
The point is – pick a specific topic .
Once again , this tip works for blogging in general .
For any successful blog , your focus should be razor - sharp .
Kratom Crazy is a good example of a kratom - based blog that writes around very specific topics .
It writes reviews of different kratom strains .
Again , Focused !
They are also the best kratom capsules for sale in the town .
Make it helpful
It does n’t help to just make statements or give users facts .
Facts are important , but your blog should eventually help users in all ways possible .
For example , it does n’t help to just ‘ tell ’ users where kratom comes from , or the history or the pharmacology of it .
Tell them exactly how it would help their lifestyle .
Perhaps your users are suffering from chronic pain , fatigue , or stress .
In that case , it pays to point out the fact that consuming right kratom strain in safe doses might help them be rid of chronic stress and improve their quality of life .
Keep the tone and the eventual ‘ goal ’ of the blog – helpful .
Make sure that by the end of it , your readers feel empowered to want to try out whatever ‘ tips ’ you gave out .
Do not assume anything
Never leave anything to the assumption .
Do not assume that your readers know what ‘ kratom ’ is .
Perhaps they have already used this herb or maybe this is the first time they are reading / hearing about it .
In any case , it pays to start with a little intro about kratom .
This rule works in general no matter what kind of blog you ’re writing .
It pays to know who your readers are .
If they are not avid kratom users , chances are they have not heard of it .
Here ’s one way to look at it – say you ’re writing for aspiring small business owners who want to gain financial knowledge .
You cannot assume that they already know the ins and outs of the financial implications involved in running a small business .
So , write accordingly .
Write for the readers ; not for yourself .
Keep a positive tone
A positive tone works any day in keeping the readers hooked .
It also makes them feel empowered and encouraged .
Especially when you ’re writing around a rather controversial topic like kratom , where there ’s already a ton of somewhat ‘ negative ’ information out there .
This is not to say that give out false information .
But , keep the tone honest and helpful .
All and all , use as many positive words , anecdotes , and stories as possible while keeping it realistic , informative , and educational .
To make your blog sound confident and well - researched , provide links to authoritative sites ( ideally clinical studies ) whenever possible .
This will add to your credibility and make it appear you ’ve done your homework before writing .
Give suitable disclaimers wherever necessary
Kratom is not regulated by the FDA .
This is one example of the disclaimer you must give when writing about kratom or any controversial topic just to keep the users informed .
It also sets their expectations right .
Another example is to tell them about the possible side - effects of kratom in case they fail to exercise caution with kratom consumption .
Make sure to add all the relevant links to relevant pages for more authority .
Avoid giving out false information
Once again , this tip works in general .
The internet is filled with ‘ bro science ’ and promises that sound too - good - to - be - true .
Readers are already confused and doubtful about what information to trust .
In the middle of so much confusion and fake information , make sure your blog does n’t add to the conundrum .
Keep your blog helpful but also realistic .
Do not give the users false hope just to get them hooked .
In writing , as in life , honestly is often the best policy .
Follow the ‘ KISS ’ process
Easily the # 1 tip that all bloggers should implement right now is to follow the KISS ( Kiss it Simple Stupid ) approach .
Write as you speak .
Avoid using heavy words as much as you can .
Unless you ’re writing for a niche that demands you to follow heavy words and technical jargon , always use simple but authoritative words that make the blog sound convincing .
Once again , write in a conversational tone as much as you can simply because it ’s easier to read and skim through .
In the case of kratom , this is a particularly important tip because often you have to use a lot of medical terms .
To compensate for all that technicality , keep everything else conversational , simple , and easy - to - read .
In Conclusion
Blogging is an art form .
With time , you ’ll be able to hone and polish your writing style .
But , it ’s always good to listen to what the experts have to say , learn from their experience , and write richer content .
This should save you a lot of mistakes , efforts , and time .
Hopefully , these tips provided your insight as to how to write authoritative , helpful , and engaging content .
While this was , by no way , an exhaustive list , these tips are something you should always be sticking with .

I ’ve given many presentations on crisis mapping over the past two years but these were never filmed .
So I decided to create this video presentation with narration in order to share my findings more widely and hopefully get a lot of feedback in the process .
The presentation is not meant to be exhaustive although the video does run to about 30 minutes .
The topics covered in this presentation include :
Crisis Map Sourcing – information collection ;
– information collection ; Mobile Crisis Mapping – mobile technology ;
– mobile technology ; Crisis Mapping Visualization – data visualization ;
– data visualization ; Crisis Mapping Analysis – spatial analysis .
The presentation references several blog posts of mine in addition to several operational projects to illustrate the main concepts behind crisis mapping .
The individual blog posts featured in the presentation are listed below :
This research is the product of a 2 - year grant provided by Humanity United ( HU ) to the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative ’s ( HHI ) Program on Crisis Mapping and Early Warning , where I am a doctoral fellow .
I look forward to any questions / suggestions you may have on the video primer !

Counting is n't easy .
Suppose your boss wants you to work from 8 am to 11 am , and mop floors 8 to 11 .
Simple - it 's one floor per hour , right ?
Nope !
There are 4 floors to mop ( 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 ) but only 3 hours to work ( 8 - 9 , 9 - 10 , and 10 - 11 ) .
Whoa -- we count floors and hours differently ?
You bet .
And somehow , if the boss said " Mop floors 8 to 11 on April 8th to 11th " everything would be ok .
Today let 's unravel this counting mystery .
Basic Counting
Numbers help us know " how many " .
Take a numbered list of houses :
There 's 52 houses there .
Do n't count each one : the addresses count for us !
The numbers label the houses one by one , just as we'd do .
We can just read the last item : " 1 to 52 " is 52 houses .
Examples :
Employee ID cards from 1 to 3493 .
There are 3493 employees .
Days of the month from 1 to 31 .
There are 31 days in that month .
What Does Subtraction Mean ?
We often see numbers as points on a line :
These points can be houses , floors , or plain integers .
Whatever they are , they 're labeled so we can count them easily .
1 to 10 means ten items .
But what about a range like 8 to 11 ?
How many items are there ?
We 'd probably try subtraction : 11 - 8 = 3 , right ?
But here 's the key :
Subtraction is a span between numbers , not a count
The equation 11 - 8 = 3 means there are 3 " spans " between 8 and 11 , but four numbers in that range !
A span is a distance measure , like time from 8 am and 11 am ( 3 hours ) or the distance between 8 and 11 inches ( 3 inches ) .
But when counting floors , we are n't asking for the distance between floors 8 to 11 ( which is in fact 3 floors or 30 feet , assuming 10 feet per floor ) .
We want a count of how many items the range " 8 to 11 " includes !
Working With Spans and Counts
Realizing there are two types of counting was a big mental shift .
We have two possible choices when " counting " from a to b :
Distance from a to b : b - a [ regular subtraction ]
b - a [ regular subtraction ]
Number of items from a to b : b - a + 1 ( span touches extra element )
Ok , the formulas work .
But why does a count need an extra element ?
Well , the shortest span ( distance 1 ) actually touches two numbers :
A span is a line segment with a start and end ; a span of distance 1 covers 2 points .
As we grow the span , we gobble up more points and are always " one ahead " .
Here 's another way to think about it .
A span of 3 means we start with an item ( #8 ) and count out 3 more ( # 9 , # 10 , # 11 ) .
So , a span of N includes 1 original item and N new items , for a total of N + 1 items .
I like seeing new viewpoints ; use what works for you .
The Fencepost Problem
The confusion between spans and counts is commonly called the fencepost problem .
Are you counting the posts ( points ) or the distance between them ( fence spans ) ?
The question goes like this :
You 're building a fence 100 feet long , with posts every 10 feet .
How many posts do you need ?
Here 's how to think about it with our new mental model :
Hrm , we want a fence 100 feet long .
Ok : that 's a span of ten , 10 - foot segments .
But we want the number of posts : how many posts do those ten segments touch ?
Well , a span always touches an extra point , so ten segments means 11 posts .
11 fenceposts it is .
But the problem is n't natural for me - I have to think about spans vs points .
I 'd double - check with a smaller example - a fence that is 10 feet long needs 2 posts , so yes , we need an " extra post " .
A few more examples :
Working Days : I worked April 8th to April 11th .
How many days did I work ?
Well , that 's a span of 3 ( 11 - 8 ) , but we " touch " 4 days : April 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 .
So I worked 4 days .
I worked April 8th to April 11th .
How many days did I work ?
Well , that 's a span of 3 ( 11 - 8 ) , but we " touch " 4 days : April 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 .
So I worked 4 days .
Hours :
Hours are like spans .
Working from 8 to 11 means you are covering the spans 8 - 9 , 9 - 10 , and 10 - 11 . 8 to 11 means a " time " of 3 hours .
Hours are like spans .
Working from 8 to 11 means you are covering the spans 8 - 9 , 9 - 10 , and 10 - 11 . 8 to 11 means a " time " of 3 hours .
Seconds : I start a race , and the start time at 12:01:08 ( 12 hours , 1 minute , 8 seconds ) .
It ends at 12:01:11 .
How long did it go ?
11 - 8 = 3 seconds .
( Short race )
Interesting , eh ?
Some units of time are measured with spans ( seconds ) and others are items to be counted ( days ) .
The measuring type depends on the context .
We see small units of time as " instants " and want the duration between those instants , not the " number " of instants we touched .
We see days as a large fuzzy blob covering a time period ( 9 am - 5 am ) -- and we want to know how many blobs we covered .
Saying you worked April 8 to April 9th implies you worked a timespan of 9 am - 5 pm on two days .
The counting type depends on the context - but at least you know why we count them differently .
Final Thoughts
Counting is n't simple .
The fencepost problem and other " off by one " boundary errors are notoriously common .
But do n't just remember a special trick ( add 1 ) - remember there are two ways to measure something :
Are we measuring a difference ( distance , time ) ?
Then do regular subtraction to get a span .
Then do regular subtraction to get a span .
Are we counting items ?
Then subtract and add 1 ( b - a + 1 ) - we want the number of items the span touches .
It 's not easy to recognize the difference - we 're used to having one way to measure .
Try a simple example ( a fence 10 feet long ) to test if you 've got a count or span .
I 've run into the fencepost problem many times , but the articles I read just told me how to fix it .
No , no , no - why does it happen ?
It turns out we often use the same approach for two different types of counting .
And while the right method may not be obvious , at least we know to try both approaches .
Happy math .

One thing about having kids is that they outgrow their shoes more often than they wear them out .
So , it is with great interest that I ’ll be following these new INCHworm trainers which promise to grow with kids up to one full shoe size .
Using a technology called “ iFit , ” ( what , is Apple an investor ? ! ) , the INCHworm has an accordion like middle which can be pulled out after pushing a button release .
Then , wearers can pull out by the toe in ½ size increments .
While pulling out to extend the size , there is a counter in the heal which ticks off the size change .
But built into the heal is bound to break it before it can properly keep track .
Regardless , this translates to essentially having three pairs of shoes before having to replace them , giving Junior plenty of time to wear the shoes down a tad more before outgrowing them .
In fact , designers promise that these shoes will take the toughest playground abuse kids have to offer and last three to six months longer than the average tennis shoe .
The INCHworm also has another advantage … if your kid has one foot larger than the other , which is fairly common , the shoe ’s can be adjusted accordingly thereby making for a far more comfortable fit .
The INCHworms are available in Great Britain now through distributor Fat Shoes Day and are available in three styles for kids aged three to ten .
Cost is a tad pricey upfront , though , at $ 106 US .

Introduction
After comparing the performance of the Radeon 4850 to the GeForce GTX260 + in part one of this article , some interesting findings were made .
More specifically , it was found that the 4850 was administering the smackdown on the 260 + in certain situations with 8xMSAA , and / or when running adaptive anti-aliasing against the 260 + ’s transparency anti-aliasing .
Clearly this is puzzling since the 4850 has inferior specs , especially with respect to memory resources , where it has almost half the bandwidth and capacity of the 260 + .
So part two of this article will compare image quality of the two cards in order to try to provide some kind of explanation .
Since still screenshots seldom do the issue justice ( as opposed to actual movement during gaming ) , all of the pictures have been substantially zoomed for your convenience .
For the best comparison , I ’d suggest loading the images into individual browser tabs and quickly switching between them .
Also , make sure that your browser ’s image scaling options are off .

Beatings and humiliation by nuns and priests were common at institutions that held up to 30,000 children , Ryan report states
Rape and sexual molestation were " endemic " in Irish Catholic church - run industrial schools and orphanages , a report revealed today .
The nine - year investigation found that Catholic priests and nuns for decades terrorised thousands of boys and girls in the Irish Republic , while government inspectors failed to stop the chronic beatings , rape and humiliation .
The high court judge Sean Ryan today unveiled the 2,600 - page final report of Ireland 's commission into child abuse , which drew on testimony from thousands of former inmates and officials from more than 250 church - run institutions .
Police were called to the news conference amid angry scenes as victims were prevented from attending .
More than 30,000 children deemed to be petty thieves , truants or from dysfunctional families – a category that often included unmarried mothers – were sent to Ireland 's austere network of industrial schools , reformatories , orphanages and hostels from the 1930s until the last facilities shut in the 1990s .
The findings prompted the new Archbishop of Westminster , the Most Rev Vincent Nichols , to say that it took " courage " for those clergy involved in child sex abuse to confront their actions .
In an interview to be broadcast tonight on ITV News at Ten , he said : " I think of those in religious orders and some of the clergy in Dublin who have to face these facts from their past which instinctively and quite naturally they 'd rather not look at .
That takes courage , and also we should n't forget that this account today will also overshadow all of the good that they also did . "
The Irish Survivors of Child Abuse ( Isoca ) , an organisation set up to help victims , condemned the newly appointed head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales for his remarks .
" Rubbish is too kind of word for what the archbishop has said .
I believe I have heard this kind of twaddle uttered by politicians in Ireland like Bertie Ahern , the former prime minister .
It is the verbiage of un -reason and it leaves me cold .
What the Archbishop really has to do is take a long hard look at the character and nature of the people he is talking about and ask himself if they are capable of being good , " said Patrick Walsh .
The report found that molestation and rape were " endemic " in boys ' facilities , chiefly run by the Christian Brothers order , and supervisors pursued policies that increased the danger .
Girls supervised by orders of nuns , chiefly the Sisters of Mercy , suffered much less sexual abuse but instead endured frequent assaults and humiliation designed to make them feel worthless .
" In some schools a high level of ritualised beating was routine ...
Girls were struck with implements designed to maximise pain and were struck on all parts of the body , " the report said .
" Personal and family denigration was widespread . "
The report concluded that when confronted with evidence of sex abuse , religious authorities responded by transferring offenders to another location , where in many instances they were free to abuse again .
" There was evidence that such men took up teaching positions sometimes within days of receiving dispensations because of serious allegations or admissions of sexual abuse , " the report said .
" The safety of children in general was not a consideration . "
The Catholic church had been steeling itself for the report , which was repeatedly delayed by church lawsuits , missing documentation and alleged government obstruction .
The Christian Brothers delayed the investigation for more than a year with a lawsuit that successfully defended their members ' right to anonymity in all references in the report , even in cases in which individual Christian Brothers had been convicted of sexual and physical attacks on children .
The church had already been under fire over the sexual misbehaviour of several priests in various Irish parishes .
The commission 's experts have sought to produce a comprehensive portrait of sexual , physical and emotional damage inflicted on the child victims .
The thousands of survivors said they had no safe way to tell their stories until the investigation began because much of Irish Catholic society regarded them as liars .
Isoca today said it was now up to the Vatican to investigate its religious orders in the republic .
John Kelly , the Isoca co-ordinator in Dublin , said : " Now that the Ryan [ Laffoy ] commission is finished , we call upon ...
Pope Benedict XVI to convene a special consistory court to fully investigate the activities of the Catholic religious orders in Ireland .
" Amongst other things , such a court could establish the whereabouts of Irish state assets that were misappropriated over many years by the religious orders and make restitution to the Irish state exchequer . "
During the commission 's investigations , oral evidence was collected from more than 1,000 people , mainly aged from their 50s to 70s .
Several hundred travelled back to Ireland from the US and Australia to describe their childhood of terror and intimidation .
One victim , John Walsh , of Isoca , called the report a hatchet job that left open wounds gaping .
" The little comfort we have is the knowledge that it vindicated the victims who were raped and sexually abused , " he said .
" I 'm very angry , very bitter , and feel cheated and deceived .
I would have never opened my wounds if I 'd known this was going to be the end result .
It has devastated me and will devastate most victims because there is no criminal proceedings and no accountability whatsoever . "
The commission 's original judge , Mary Laffoy , resigned from her post in 2003 over claims that the Irish department of education – which was in charge of inspecting the orphanages and industrial schools – was refusing to hand over documents to her .

Commuters struggled with the icy conditions throughout London today .
At Waterloo station commuters had to take extra care with slippery steps .
They described how their routine journey to work had been affected by the extreme weather .
From the video captured by two Millville Police car dashboard cameras , emerge two very different versions of what happened in the pre-dawn hours of February 3 , 2008 .
The just - released video ( see left ) is at the center of a lawsuit in which Sheila Stevenson , 42 , claims she became the victim of excessive force , after then - Millville Police Officer Carlo Drogo pulled her over for illegally riding her bicycle on a sidewalk .
In the course of trying to handcuff Stevenson , the video shows Drogo as he sprays himself in the face with pepper spray and she appears to push him .
Drogo then appears to knock Stevenson to the ground to subdue her .
Drogo is seen , seemingly doubled over in pain , as other officers arrive .
“ I am not doing nothing , ” Stevenson screamed on the video .
“ Put your hands behind your back , ” one of the other officers ordered .
“ Can you not do this ?
I ’m not doing nothing !
I ’m not doing nothing , ” she wailed .
Seconds later , Drogo approaches Stevenson again and appears to punch her four times .
“ Why are you hitting me ?
You ’re hitting me !
Why are you hitting me ? ” Stevenson cried out .
“ Why did you hit me and I ’m handcuffed ? ”
Stevenson was eventually led away by officers and put into a police cruiser .
She was later convicted of resisting arrest .
Stevenson ’s civil suit , filed in Cumberland County Superior Court in December , names Drogo , other Millville Police officers and the city of Millville as defendants .
Stevenson ’s lawyer would not comment on the case , nor would Millville ’s Police chief , citing pending litigation .
Drogo resigned from the police department in October for undisclosed reasons .
He would not talk with NBC 10 News on - camera , but issued a statement in which he stood by his actions and called Stevenson ’s allegations a distortion of the facts .
Drogo also insisted the arrest was lawful and described Stevenson ’s lawsuit as frivolous .
Meanwhile , there ’s now a warrant out for Stevenson ’s arrest on drug possession charges , stemming from her encounter with police that was caught on camera .
Human Rights
Watch today accused the Islamist movement Hamas of a campaign of killing and attacks against Palestinians in Gaza that has left at least 32 dead and dozens more seriously injured .
The attacks came over the past three months , beginning during Israel 's three - week war in Gaza .
" Hamas authorities there took extraordinary steps to control , intimidate , punish and at times eliminate their internal political rivals as well as persons suspected of collaboration with Israel , " Human Rights Watch said in a report released today .
During the Gaza war 18 Palestinians , many suspected of collaborating with Israel , were killed .
Most had escaped from Gaza 's main prison after it was bombed by Israeli aircraft at the start of the war .
A further 14 , at least four of whom were in jail at the time , have been killed since the end of the war .
" The unlawful arrests , torture and killings in detention continued even after the fighting stopped , mocking Hamas 's claims to uphold the law , " said Joe Stork , deputy director of Human Rights Watch 's Middle East division .
It was the worst internal Palestinian violence inside Gaza since Hamas , which won Palestinian elections three years ago , seized full control of the strip in mid-2007 .
The accounts corroborate witness testimony reported by the Guardian at the time and appear to show Hamas took advantage of the chaos of the war to exert control over its political and security rivals in Gaza .
Other Palestinians have also spoken of a campaign of intimidation against secular and moderate groups in Gaza .
Human Rights
Watch said the extent and frequency of the attacks " strongly suggests " they resulted from a policy decision by Hamas leaders .
Palestinian human rights groups in Gaza also found 49 Palestinians were shot in the legs in punishment attacks and around 73 were severely beaten , suffering broken arms and legs , from the start of the war in late December until the end of January .
Some of the attackers were not identified , but many appeared to be from Hamas .
Hamas told Human Rights
Watch charges had been brought against police over two deaths and that another two were being investigated .
" Four investigations into 32 deaths are not enough , " Stork said .
Taher al - Nunu , a Hamas spokesman in Gaza , denied Hamas forces were involved in extrajudicial killings .
He said : " Some resistance factions claimed they had killed suspected collaborators during the Israeli war on Gaza and in areas where battles took place , and we have launched an investigation which has not yet been completed . "
Human Rights Watch said Fatah , the rival , western - supported Palestinian faction that controls the West Bank , had also used " repressive measures " against its Hamas opponents .
It said Palestinian human rights groups recorded 31 complaints of torture by the Fatah - led security forces , as well as one death in custody and the arbitrary arrest of two Palestinian television journalists .
" Western governments that support and finance the Fatah authorities in the West Bank have remained publicly silent about the arbitrary arrests and torture against Hamas members and others , " said Stork .
In the most recent incident , on Sunday , a Hamas MP and preacher , Hamed Bitawi , was injured after he was shot in the leg by an officer from the Fatah - led security forces in the West Bank city of Nablus .
Human Rights
Watch has also accused Israel of violating international law during the Gaza war , including by what it said was indiscriminate use of weapons such as white phosphorus in densely populated civilian areas .
“ I was away from the sport for two years , and I did n’t think it was right that I made the decision , ” said Basso , the winner of the 2006 Giro and a favorite at this year ’s race .
“ But I think we need to apologize to the fans .
I ’m coming off a very tough time , and I ’m trying to do something good for cycling . ”
Basso is in his first season after a two - year doping ban , and he is treading carefully in his first Grand Tour race in three years .
He was implicated in a doping ring in Spain , using the name of his dog , Birillo , as his code name at a blood - doping clinic .
He admitted not to doping , but to thinking about doping .
But his redemption among his fans , competitors and countrymen started long before this race .
Basso , 31 , once thought to be the next coming of Lance Armstrong , spent two years thinking about it , creating it and acting on it .
“ It is important that I try to get the fans to believe in me again , ” he said .
“ But I know I have three types of fans .
Those who were with me all the time .
Those who had big delusions about me but decided to follow me again .
But some fans want to kill me for what I ’ve done .
“ There will always be a group who are unhappy , and I ’ve learned to understand that . ”
Di Luca added 1 minute 7 seconds seconds to his overall lead , and is 1:20 ahead of the second - place rider , Denis Menchov .
Michael Rogers is in third , 1:33 back .
Levi Leipheimer is in fourth , 1:40 behind Di Luca .
Armstrong , the seven - time Tour de France winner , rose to 18th in the overall standings but is 5:28 out of first .

Originally called Apollo , Adobe Air was released in beta back in 2007 and has gone from strength to strength ever since .
You can build an Adobe Air app using HTML , JavaScript , Flash or ActionScript relatively simply .
Basically anyone with even a little knowledge of programming and a little patience can create rich Internet applications .
Below , we present the Adobe AIR Developer ’s Toolbox : Resources and Tutorials , a round - up of tutorials , links , references , cheat sheets and showcases that will help you create the next popular app .
What is AIR and How To Get Started ?
First things first : Adobe Integrated Runtime ( AIR ) is a cross- platform runtime environment for building rich Internet applications using Adobe Flash , Adobe Flex , HTML , or Ajax , that can be deployed as a desktop application .
The runtime bridges the “ classic ” user experience within Web- applications and rich , highly sophisticated user experience in modern desktop - applications .
To do so , the runtime complements the browser adding desktop integration , local data access , embedded database , convenient desktop APIs and a cross-operating system compatibility .
In other words , Adobe Air makes it possible for web - developers to run rich Internet applcations outside the web browser ( similar to Mozilla ’s Prism ) – on the desktop – and also guarantess cross-compatibility across operating systems .
Hence , applications are created using a mixture of JavaScript , HTML , and Flash .
The resulting application is delivered to end users in a single package and rendered using the WebKit HTML engine .
The only requirement is that the users of AIR - applications have the AIR runtime engine installed ( very much like Adobe Flash users need to have the Flash - plugin installed on their system ) .
In fact , Adobe AIR is becoming more and more popular with over 100 million installations of the engine across the globe and over 470 AIR - applications featured on Adobe AIR Market Place .
Adobe AIR SDK
To get you started , you will need the runtime environment for running AIR applications on your OS ( download the latest version of Adobe AIR – you will be asked for the OS you are using ) .
You will also need the Adobe AIR Software Development Kit ( SDK ) to develop , build and deploy Adobe AIR applications .
This development kit ( will provide you with the framework for AIR APIs , a template for the Adobe AIR application install badge , the command - line Adobe AIR Debug Launcher and the command - line Adobe AIR Developer tool .
The kits are available for Mac OS X ( 22.1 Mb ) , Windows ( 15.8 Mb ) and Linux ( 18.5 Mb ) .
Official Adobe AIR Resources
For quick reference here is a brief overview of the essential official Adobe AIR resources that may come in handy for developers of AIR - applications .

AIR 101
To be launched in AIR , an HTML or SWF application requires an application XML file ( a.k.a. an application descriptor file ) .
You can almost consider this application XML file the actual AIR application file : it is initially opened and read by AIR , it specifies application properties such as application window name and size , and it identifies which file ( HTML or SWF ) is to be loaded into the AIR container .

Here are two puzzles , and a meta- puzzle .
I ’m going away for two weeks and I ’m not posting the answers until I return , so unless you think you can solve them or you can stand the suspense , stop reading now !
First Puzzle : three prisoners with skullcaps
A warden says to three prisoners : tomorrow morning the guards will seat the three of you around a triangular table .
Standing behind you , they will place a skullcap on each of your heads , such that each of you has no chance of seeing his own skullcap .
Each skullcap is either black or white ; overall there can be any combination .
Each of you will place your hand on a switch below the table , such that the others have no way to see .
You can move the switch to the left to indicate black , right to indicate white , or leave it in the middle to indicate no choice .
After a suitable time to move the switches , you ’ll put your hands on the table and we ’ll see how you did .
Here are the three possible outcomes :
Someone correctly identifies the color of his own skullcap , and no one else makes a mistake .
In this case , you all go free .
At least one person guesses wrong .
In this case you all die .
No one guesses .
In this case you all die .
So not everyone has to guess , but everyone who does must guess correctly for you to win .
You can plan now , but tomorrow you will be forbidden to talk or otherwise communicate in any way .
What is the prisoners ’ best strategy to maximize their chances of survival ?
Second Puzzle : 100 prisoners with boxes
A warden says to one hundred prisoners : tomorrow morning the guards will lock each of you in separate cells , with no means of communication .
One by one you will be escorted into a room with one hundred closed numbered boxes .
Each box contains the name of one of you hundred prisoners , and each prisoner ’s name is in exactly one box .
You will be allowed to open ninety boxes — all but ten — in order to try to find your own name .
Once you are finished , the boxes will be closed ( no rearranging ) and you returned to your solitary cell , so the next prisoner may come and try .
There are two possible outcomes :
All one hundred of you are successful in finding your own name .
In this case , you all go free .
One or more of you fails to find his own name .
In this case , you all die .
You can plan now , but tomorrow you will be forbidden to talk or otherwise communicate in any way .
What is the prisoners ’ best strategy to maximize their chances of survival ?
Meta-puzzle
The solutions to these puzzles have something interesting in common .
What is it ?
PS — there are no tricks to either of these .
The prisoners do not cheat .
Apple is set to offer a host of interesting features on the new iPhone 3.0 OS .
Among the most anticipated features is the addition of stereo Bluetooth - audio streaming ( A2DP ) , which will allow current second - generation iPhone and iPod Touch owners to experience the cutting edge of mobile technology .
Of course , Apple is expected to roll out additional features that will only be available to those who purchase the latest iPhone and iPod Touch devices .
Among these exclusive " hardware features " are high - speed 802.11n
WiFi ( wireless network ) capabilities and FM radio transmission .
Transmitter Manufacturers May Profit or Plummet
While many anticipate the launch of the new iPhone 3.0 OS ( slated for sometime this summer ) , there are a few who are dreading the release date -- namely : the accessory manufacturers who have been making iPod - compatible FM transmitters for years .
For third - party companies like Belkin and Griffin , integrated FM transmission could signal the end of well - known products like the iTrip .
( Source : sf - wifi.com )
Still , if Apple is feeling a bit generous , they could always require their users to purchase FM transmitter apps to enable its functionality , just as they did with voice recording .
In this case , smaller companies can still get a piece of the action .
Faster WiFi capabilities
As mentioned above , the iPhone 3.0 OS promises improved WiFi speeds .
The current iPhone and iPod Touch models support 802.11a networks ( 5GHz ) , or 802.11b/ g networks ( 2.4GHz ) , which are now common on most portable devices .
Since the faster 802.11n support already appears in Macbooks and AirPort Base Stations , its inclusion of smaller Apple devices is not surprising .
( Source : cnet.com )
Smoother Online Multi-player Gaming
The increased WiFi speed also allows Apple to reinforce their initial intentions of someday making the iPod Touch a significant mobile - gaming platform .
Now , online multiplayer games are a more viable option , as player interaction will be smoother than ever before .
Whether or not people are ready to trade in their established game consoles for an Apple iPhone , however , remains to be seen .

In the wake of the MIAC report and the Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment , another document issued by the Department of Homeland Security “ for official use only ” covering so - called “ rightwing extremism ” has surfaced .
The document warns federal and local officials to expect “ terrorism ” in response to planned firearm restrictions and other points covered below .
The DHS document cover page .
Alex Jones called the numbers listed on the document and validated its authenticity .
He contacted the “ watch captain ” at the Department of Homeland Security ’s National Infrastructure Coordinating Center who confirmed the product number on the document as legitimate but would not comment further .
A call to the FBI went unanswered .
The following points covered in the document are of particular concern :
Gun Sales
According to the DHS and FBI , local law enforcement ’s primary concern should be the high volume of gun and ammunitions purchases over the last few months .
The document equates Americans who stockpile ammunition to “ rightwing terrorists . ”
Moreover , stockpiling ( merely purchasing ) ammunition is an indication of involvement in “ paramilitary training exercises ” and potential terrorist activity .
According to the Irish Times , the “ stockpiling ” of ammunition and increased firearm sales are due to the fear Obama will impose new gun laws and other restrictions .
“ Gun -shop owners and the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) say the surge is driven by worries that President Obama is planning to ban many types of firearms and that the deepening economic crisis will fuel a crime wave . ”
If we are to believe the DHS and the FBI , these Americans , numbering in the millions , are violence prone terrorists and a threat to local law enforcement .
In addition , as noted below , concerns about crime due to a worsening economy are paranoid fantasies exploited by terrorists
Job Losses and the Economy
The document states that job losses , home foreclosures , and the collapsing economy are “ perceived ” by rightwing terrorists and exploited by them to “ draw in new recruits ” and further radicalize “ those already subscribing to extremist beliefs . ”
According to the document , the economic crisis is a perception without a foundation in reality , merely an exaggerated device used by terrorists .
In other words , if you complain about the faltering economy reported upon numerous times a day by the corporate media you are a rightwing extremist and a terrorist who may resort to violence and threaten local law enforcement , especially if you support the Second Amendment , own firearms , and “ stockpile ” ( purchase ) ammunition .
Illegal Immigration
Like the economic crisis , illegal immigration is at best a perception , not reality , and the rightwing terrorists have exploited this political issue as a racist “ call to action ” and recruitment tool .
The DHS document claims the extremists have exploited the First Amendment on this issue in order to foment violence against illegal immigrants and those who support amnesty and other schemes to legalize illegal immigration .
The DHS document cites several examples supposedly linked to anti-immigrant violence committed by “ militia members ” and mentions a “ machinegun attack on Hispanics . ”
Stated Purpose of the Document
Dated April 7 , 2009 , the “ scope ” of the document is as follows :
This product is one of a series of intelligence assessments published by the Extremism and Radicalization Branch to facilitate a greater understanding of the phenomenon of violent radicalization in the United States .
The information is provided to federal , state , local , and tribal counterterrorism and law enforcement officials so they may effectively deter , prevent , preempt , or respond to terrorist attacks against the United States .
Federal efforts to influence domestic public opinion must be conducted in an overt and transparent manner , clearly identifying United States Government sponsorship .
The DHS document — with the unwieldy title “ Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment ” — contains the following warning :
LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION NOTICE :
This product contains Law Enforcement Sensitive ( LES ) information .
No portion of the LES information should be released to the media , the general public , or over non-secure Internet servers .
Release of this information could adversely affect or jeopardize investigative activities .
Warning : This document is UNCLASSIFIED // FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ( U// FOUO ) .
It contains information that may be exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 U.S.C. 552 ) .
It is to be controlled , stored , handled , transmitted , distributed , and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to FOUO information and is not to be released to the public , the media , or other personnel who do not have a valid need - to - know without prior approval of an authorized DHS official .
State and local homeland security officials may share this document with authorized security personnel without further approval from DHS .
The DHS wanted the document to remain secret but it was leaked , probably by “ authorized security personnel ” in local law enforcement ( as was the case with the MIAC document produced by the Missouri State Police ) .
Information in the document was “ provided to federal , state , local , and tribal counterterrorism and law enforcement officials so they may effectively deter , prevent , preempt , or respond to terrorist attacks against the United States . ”
The DHS document — produced in coordination with the FBI — begins by stating it is “ one of a series of intelligence assessments published by the Extremism and Radicalization Branch to facilitate a greater understanding of the phenomenon of violent radicalization in the United States ” ( it is interesting to note the phrase “ violent radicalization ” is the same one used in H.R. 1955 , entitled the “ Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ″ ) .
Key Findings
In “ Key Findings , ” the DHS document states that the Office of Intelligence and Analysis ( I&A ) has no “ no specific information that domestic rightwing terrorists are currently planning acts of violence , but rightwing extremists may be gaining new recruits by playing on their fears about several emergent issues [ specifically gun control ] .
The economic downturn and the election of the first African American president present unique drivers for rightwing radicalization and recruitment . ”
The above text points to a footnote on the page dividing “ rightwing terrorists ” into two categories — “ adherents that are primarily hate - oriented ( based on hatred of particular religious , racial or ethnic groups ) , and those that are mainly antigovernment , rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority , or rejecting government authority entirely . ”
It is significant the DHS ( and FBI ) categorize opposition to the government as terrorism .
The FBI in particular has labeled various “ rightwing ” movements as extremist for more than a decade , so this is nothing new or revelatory .
The authors of the document drag out all of the old “ rightwing ” bugaboos , most notably the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing .
In addition , they mention the “ [ p ] roposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans ” resulting in recruiting new members and culminating in the “ planning and training for violence against the government . ”
In order to underscore this assertion , the authors note the “ high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by rightwing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement . ”
In fact , as noted above , the “ high volume of purchases , ” as the media has reported , is a reaction on the part of Americans in general regardless of ideological persuasion .
It is a common sense reaction to the documented fact president Obama is opposed to firearms ownership , even though he claims to support the Second Amendment .
The DHS I&A attributes the purported “ resurgence in rightwing extremist recruitment and radicalization activity ” to economic factors and the election of Barack Obama .
“ Despite similarities to the climate of the 1990s [ a reference to the militia movement exaggerated by government and corporate media ] , the threat posed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years .
In addition , the historical election of an African American president and the prospect of policy changes [ i.e. , gun registration leading to eventual confiscation ] are proving to be a driving force for rightwing extremist recruitment and radicalization . ”
The tone of the document indicates that the government plans to impose restrictions on the ownership of firearms .
In addition , the document warns local law enforcement that “ rightwing terrorists ” will violently resist any attempt to register or confiscate guns .
Link to Pittsburgh Cop Killer
In order to stress the point , the authors cite as an example the murder of three police officers in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania :
The alleged gunman ’s reaction reportedly was influenced by his racist ideology and belief in antigovernment conspiracy theories related to gun confiscations , citizen detention camps , and a Jewish - controlled “ one world government . ”
Following this event , the liberal noise machine , funded in large part by the Soros and Ford foundations , expended an extraordinary amount of energy attempting to link the murders to Fox News and Alex Jones .
Jones was singled out by the Anti-Defamation League ( Shooter In Pittsburgh Cop Killings Held Strongly Anti-Semitic And Racist Beliefs , April 6 , 2009 ) as having influenced the alleged killer , Richard Poplawski , who frequented the white supremacist website hosted by Stormfront .
“ According to ADL , Poplawski also frequented ‘ Infowars , ’ the Web site of the right - wing conspiracy radio talk - show host Alex Jones , where he shared links to its stories with others and sometimes posted his own messages to the site , ” the ADL wrote in the above linked press release .
Similarity to SPLC and ADL Talking Points
According to the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC , the MIAC documents were heavily influenced by “ faulty and politicized research issued by the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) and Anti Defamation League ( ADL ) . ”
The Southern Poverty Law Center was cited as a research source for the ‘ Missouri Documents ’ .
Furthermore , the attempt of these documents to cast suspicion of violent and life threatening behavior on millions of Americans who are concerned about these issues [ unemployment , taxes , illegal immigration , gangs , border security , abortion , high costs of living , gun restrictions , FEMA , the IRS , The Federal Reserve , and the North American Union / SPP / North American Community ] is consistent with the regularly released political materials of both the SPLC and ADL .
The DHS ’ “ Extremism and Radicalization Branch ” participated in the “ Global Summit on Internet Hate Speech ” organized by the International Network Against Cyber - Hate and the Anti-Defamation League and held November 17 - 18 , 2008 , in Washington , DC .
Abraham H. Foxman , ADL National Director , was a key speaker at the event .
The DHS document claims today ’s “ rightwing terrorists ” present more of a threat than those of the earlier period :
Unlike the earlier period , the advent of the Internet and other informationage technologies since the 1990s has given domestic extremists greater access to information related to bomb - making , weapons training , and tactics , as well as targeting of individuals , organizations , and facilities , potentially making extremist individuals and groups more dangerous and the consequences of their violence more severe .
New technologies also permit domestic extremists to send and receive encrypted communications and to network with other extremists throughout the country and abroad , making it much more difficult for law enforcement to deter , prevent , or preempt a violent extremist attack .
The document makes it clear the DHS and FBI consider websites such as Infowars and Prison Planet to be vehicles for “ potentially making extremist individuals and groups more dangerous and the consequences of their violence more severe . ”
( Note : Alex Jones has repeatedly warned his listeners against violence . )
Recall a House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on “ Terrorism and the Internet ” held in November , 2007 , and broadcast on C - Span , that featured a panel of “ experts , ” including representatives formerly of the RAND Corporation and the Simon Wiesenthal Center who presented 9/11 truth websites sites alongside sites that celebrate the attacks and offer training in terrorist tactics .
“ The hearing was chaired by Democratic Rep. Jane Harman , and ranking Republican , Rep. Dave Reichert .
It was supposed to focus on the use of the internet by ‘ home grown terrorist recruiters ’ yet in a shocking move it blatantly related the 9/11 truth movement with so called radical ‘ jihadists , ’ ” Paul Joseph and Steve Watson wrote at the time .
Alleged “ falsehoods ” and “ conspiracy theories , ” according to RAND corporation director Bruce Hoffman , “ have now become so ubiquitous and so pervasive that they are believed , so you have almost a parallel truth , and it has become a very effective tool for recruiting people . ”
Rep. Jane Harman sponsored the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 .
As Alex Jones has noted numerous times on his radio show , the FBI and military intelligence have taken a keen interest in the comment sections on Infowars and Prison Planet .
In the last week and a half the liberal noise machine and to a lesser degree the corporate media have kicked into overdrive in an attempt to link Jones and his websites to a deluded and violent individual .
It should not be considered a coincidence the DHS document considers the murders in Pittsburgh an indication of emerging “ rightwing terrorist ” violence , specifically in response to “ proposed ” gun laws now in the works , as the document indicates .
Conclusion
The document is designed primarily to radicalize local law enforcement and convince individual police officers that citizens opposed to violations of the Second Amendment , draconian gun legislation ( including registration and ammunition tracking schemes ) and illegal immigration are terrorists capable of committing acts of violence against them .
It is a cynical effort to increase the tension between police and the community at large , especially members of the community that exercise the Second Amendment and oppose open border policies .
In addition , the document equates opposition to the policies of Barack Obama to racism .
Opposition to " a range of issues , including immigration and citizenship , the expansion of social programs to minorities , and restrictions on firearms ownership and use " is characterized as exploiting " racial and political prejudices . "
Obviously , the document is part of a larger campaign by the government to circumvent legitimate political activism and characterize such activity as the behavior of a violent minority of terrorists .
It is noteworthy that several issues of concern to our rulers — namely firearm possession and the effort to flood the country with lower paid workers and thus undermine the middle class — are highlighted in this until now secret and restricted document .

( Ben Heine � Cartoons )
My maternal grandmother was a simple Shtetel Jew .
She came from a place not much different than the small town portrayed in Fiddler on The Roof .
Traditionally the womenfolk from those areas were uneducated in matters of anything other than home making and child raising , while the menfolk studied their Holy Books for hours on end .
Life was simple for them , and they themselves were basically a very simple folk .
I remember my grandmother going through the frenzie of cleaning the house this time of year� .
the traditional Passover cleaning .
All traces of leaven had to be removed from the home before the start of the Holiday .
To her , that process included the removal of any trace of dust or smears on the window panes .
The house sparkled when she was finished .
Most of our non Jewish neighbours were going through the same process , but simply called it �spring cleaning� , ridding the house of all unwanted matter , including broken furniture and junk .
I remember asking my grandmother why she was going through such a frenzie� .
her answer was simple and to the point� .
" If a Jew eats bread during Passover he will die ! "
That was what she was taught , that�s what she taught us� .
In Israel today , things are not much different than life in the Shtetel when it comes to Passover preparations .
But today there is a growing number of non observant Jews as well as a growing number of non Jews .
This is a threat to the lifestyle of the self imposed Shtetel Jew living here today .
The courts are allowing the sale of Chametz ( leaven ) this year .
This has the ultra orthodox community up in arms A Torah violation right under their noses !
BUT WAIT !!!!!!
That very same Torah teaches the Jew not to hate �. where is the uproar when that is violated ?
When an extreme rightwing member of the Knesset utters anti Arab remarks �.
one representing a so - called religious party , what is done ?
He is provided with extra protection !
( I was distressed to learn that this bastard lives very close to my home ) .
Where is the uproar against his madness ?
WHERE ???
Where is the uproar against the Neanderthal rabbis that have recently called for the expulsion or the genocide of the Palestinians ?
WHERE ???
As in previous years , the Palestinians living on the ' other side� of the great wall of apartheid will be sealed in for the duration of the Holiday ( 8 days ) , literally making the State of Israel Arabrein for that period of time .
Where is the uproar against this ?
WHERE ???
Israel does need a cleansing � a good one ; not only of bread during the Holiday season but also of hatred .
Both are violations of the Holy Teachings .
The above is a repost from a year ago �.. the situation is even worse today

This past Sunday , a 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa set the auction world record for most expensive car ever sold , fetching € 9,020,000 ( $ 12 million ) .
The legendary racer was auctioned off at the third annual Ferrari Leggenda e Passione event at a factory in Maranello , Italy , hosted by RM Auctions and Sotheby ’s .
The previous auction record was set by a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT , which went for $ 9.6 million .
Lately , Ferraris have been on a tear with prices continuing to climb precipitously .
The Ferrari 250 TR was produced between 1957 and 1958 with only 22 units built .
The car quickly entered the racing scene , running the 1958 Buenos Aires 1000 km , where it finished fourth .
From then until 1961 , the 250 TR ran 19 international races , coming away with 10 victories .
In the years after it quickly gained iconic stature as it become more and more coveted as a collector ’s item .
The car has become well known for its instantly recognizable Scaglietti - designed ‘ pontoon - fender . ’
Also of note , the last Ferrari F430 to roll out of the factory was auctioned off as well .
A certificate from Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo indicating this fact will ensure that this becomes a collector ’s item as well .
Who knows , maybe in 40 years , it will be worth $ 10 million ( probably not ) .
For now , the money from this auction will be donated by Ferrari to help rebuild Abruzzo in central Italy , much of which was destroyed by an earthquake last month .
Other cars auctioned off included two 1959 Ferrari 250 GT SWB ( Berlinetta Speciale Bertones ) , a 1962 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder ( 1 of 37 built ) , a 1967 Ferrari 330 P4 ( 1 of 3 built ) , a 1990 Ferrari 641/2 F1 car , a 1956 Maserati 250F Grand Prix and a 2008 Maserati MC12 with factory mileage .
Each car was certified by Ferrari Classiche .

CAIRO ( Reuters ) - Egyptian authorities have released a 22 - year - old Egyptian blogger and activist after nearly seven weeks in detention , an Egyptian human rights group said on Saturday .
Police detained Diaa Eddin Gad on February 6 outside his home in the Nile Delta province of Gharbiya .
London - based rights group Amnesty International said in February that his incommunicado detention in an unknown location put him at danger of torture .
“ Dia was released ( Friday ) at dawn ...
He was ill - treated in the period where we did not know where he was being held , ” said Gamal Eid , director of the Cairo - based Arabic Network for Human Rights Information .
Eid said police beat Gad in the car immediately after detaining him and during his detention in State Security offices .
Police beat and kicked him , threatened to electrocute him , and electrocuted others in front of him , according to Eid .
The government says it prosecutes torturers .
Gad 's blog Sawt Ghadib or " An Angry Voice " ( soutgadeb.blogspot.com ) contained pro-Gaza slogans and news and commentary on Gaza during the three - week Israeli offensive on the coastal strip , as well as strident denunciations of Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak and security services .
Eid said police interrogation of Gad focused on such criticism , and on his references to Mubarak as “ Ehud Mubarak ” -- an apparent reference to Israeli Defense Minister and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak .
The government has faced rising public anger over its enforcement of a blockade on the Hamas - run Gaza Strip , especially since an Israeli offensive in Gaza on January .
Egypt has been less tolerant of criticism of its Gaza policy since an Israeli offensive that ended on January 18 .
This increased Egyptian public opposition to Cairo ’s participation in an Israeli - led blockade of the Hamas - run territory .
Egyptian authorities have escalated tactics against bloggers and web activists in recent weeks even as the government freed opposition politician Ayman Nour , one of its most prominent critics .
Nour ’s release had long been demanded by Washington .
Madison - Wisconsin will collect sales taxes on Internet downloads of music , games , books , ring tones and other video entertainment - a decision that angers some who will find the 5 % tax added to their credit - card bills after Oct.
1 .
On Thursday , Gov. Jim Doyle signed into law a package of tax - law changes that included extending the sales tax to so - called digital downloads .
The District of Columbia and 15 states have similar laws , although none of those states borders Wisconsin .
The change will require vendors to add the tax when the product is sold and remit it to the state treasury .
One of the most popular sellers of songs , CDs and other digital products , iTunes , already collects sales taxes on those sales for states that charge it , said Susan Lundgren , a spokeswoman for Apple .
It is expected to cost Wisconsin consumers about $ 6.7 million a year - a number that suggests it 's a $ 134 million annual industry here .
Also , national experts estimate that downloads are growing by as much as 20 % a year , which means the amount of sales tax in that area will grow substantially .
Doyle has been fighting for the change for years .
He and other state officials say it is a matter of fairness : Internet vendors should n't have a tax - exempt advantage over Wisconsin 's brick - and - mortar retail stores .
" This is applying the sales tax in the same way to the same products , " said Doyle spokesman Lee Sensenbrenner .
" This change protects Main Street businesses . "
Some digital downloaders do n't see it that way , however .
" I do n't feel very good about it , " said Cyntha Hammerel , 40 , of South Milwaukee , who downloads songs and CDs several times a week .
" I 'm not buying the product in Wisconsin . "
" I am being taxed to death , " said David Vogt , 46 , of Milwaukee .
" Where in the world does it stop ? "
Once a week , Vogt downloads a movie from a large chain , which gives him the right to watch it on his computer or his big - screen TV .
Each movie download costs him about $ 4 .
A smoker , Vogt is also upset about Doyle 's proposal to raise the state tax on a pack of cigarettes from $ 1.77 to $ 2.52 .
" Now , I 'm thinking about quitting , " Vogt said .
' Complex , but necessary '
Milwaukee lawyer Andrew Franklin , who studies Internet taxation issues , backed Doyle .
Charging the sales tax on downloads " is tricky and complex , but necessary , " Franklin said .
" The statistics are staggering .
Billions of dollars in revenue are being lost , a number that is growing exponentially every year , " he said .
" It 's a revenue gap that will certainly grow in such harsh economic times where only the best retailers with the lowest overhead will survive , and the rest will be left struggling .
" This is not a shift in taxation .
It does not rob consumers of a benefit otherwise available to them .
Rather , it merely collects a tax that in every way mirrors the tax that would be collected if one were to leave a house , go to a store and make a purchase in person . "
More than entertainment
But Republican Rep. Jeff Fitzgerald of Horicon said the tax on digital products will be charged on many non-entertainment products .
" This new tax affects far more than kids downloading songs ; it raises costs on all types of digital media from photos to clip art to computer games , " said Fitzgerald , who voted against the tax - increase package .
" Graphic artists , photographers , printers and Web designers just saw their costs go up for producing content . "
Jamie Armata , 32 , of Wauwatosa , who downloads music about twice a month , wondered how he 'll end up paying the sales tax on his downloads .
If the company selling the product adds the sales tax every time he makes a purchase , Armata said , " I have absolutely no problem with that . "
But Armata and others said they do n't want to self - report what they owe in sales taxes on downloads or get a notice from state tax collectors saying they owe a specific amount in unpaid sales taxes .
State Department of Revenue officials say they can't talk about specific tactics they might use to collect the sales tax on digital downloads .
But they will launch an extensive educational campaign before Oct. 1 to make sure vendors are aware of the change and their requirement to add sales taxes when a digital product is downloaded .
" As with any change to the sales tax law , the Department of Revenue will work with sellers to ensure they are correctly collecting and remitting sales tax on digital goods , " said department spokeswoman Jessica Iverson .
Iverson said the sales tax compliance rate is high , and state officials expect Wisconsin residents to pay it on digital products .
" Effective October 1 , consumers will pay sales tax on digital goods as part of the total purchase price , just as they would with any taxable goods and services , " she said .
10 Heels Taken to Hospital ; 21 Spartans Arrested
The aftermath of a NCAA Championship nearly always produces the same results : the fires burn , the streets are painted , people body surf , your bud gets a traffic cone melted to his arm , and there are some arrests .
However , during the chaos that followed the 2009 UNC vs Michigan State championship game , there was a peculiar outcome .
It seems that over 10 times the amount of people were arrested in East Lansing at 21 people , compared to 2 being arrested in Chapel Hill .
Police in East Lansing reported 12 fires and a crowd of 1,700 people outside an apartment complex .
In comparison , only 10 people were taken to the hospital and a total of 26 were treated for injuries in the victor ’s home streets .
Rioting after a loss is nothing new , but I have only heard of this if there was a shot at the losing team winning .
In this case , the game was over by the first television time out .
At that point , it was time to either lay off the booze or begin drinking until you believed the Spartans won .
And just to make a point : there were 30,000 plus people packed into Franklin Street , many of which made the trip from the notoriously violent city of Durham .
Yet , we all celebrated in harmony and only TWO managed to be cuffed .

So I 've noticed there seems to be a fair amount of confusion in the Ruby world about exception hierarchies .
A number of libraries I use happen to use them in ways that cause problems — usually in ways that surface at the worst possible times near the end of long batch operations .
So here 's a little primer to refresh your memory and hopefully save some of my sanity if I ever use one of your gems .
Exception is the root class for the whole exception hierarchy .
I see a lot of code that subclasses Exception for regular non-fatal exceptions .
It 's not obvious , but this is really not how it 's meant to be used .
Imagine you are building a restful interface .
The following code will bring down the application :
class GetSomeRest < Exception ; end begin if ( 7 .. 11 ) .include ?
Time .now.hour perform_restful_operation else raise GetSomeRest end rescue puts ' You really should not stay up so late . '
end
This is because rescue will only capture errors that descend from StandardError by default .
We should be subclassing StandardError here , as well as for anything else that 's non-fatal .
Save Exception subclasses for very serious things .
Running out of memory should raise an Exception .
When a user presses control - c , it raises Interrupt , which is descended directly from Exception rather than StandardError .
Sending a Unix kill signal to a process does the same thing .
If you rescue Exception or Interrupt , then you have to resort to kill - 9 to stop your application externally , leaving it with no chance to clean up after yourself .
Unfortunately , we live in an imperfect world , and we have to deal with libraries that misuse the exception hierarchy .
The first thing you should do when you encounter one of these misuses is submit a patch to the offending library .
( You could even include a link to this post . )
But it 's not always possible to get it fixed , so here 's the workaround I 've been using :
begin perform_possibly_problematic_process rescue Exception => e raise e unless e.is_a ?
StandardError or e.is_a ? GetSomeRest @log .warn e.message end
If you 're not sure of all the problematic Exception s a piece of code could raise , you could just rescue Exception and re-raise e if it's an Interrupt , but this might swallow some other legitimate serious problems , so it 's best to be specific .
Tell your friends to use Ruby 's exception hierarchy as it was intended !
Update :
Do n't feel bad if you did n't know this , apparently even the Lucky Stiff himself has fallen into this trap .

And AMD will be right on there ass with something just as fast if not faster .
And it will still barely beat a Core 2 Quad in performance .
( Could n't help myself ! )
i 7 barely beats Core 2 Quad its self lol and is still beat by C2Q Extreme
I can't remember where I read it , but after looking at some detailed specs i noticed that the data transfer speeds ( of FSB and QuickPath ) for the C2Q Extreme were about the same as the i7 , so there still might be some bottle neck .
Also the C2Q had higher L2 caches ( which is better for gaming ) .
The i7 processors arent much faster but i think there is a lot of head - way in the architecture that could be exploited .
Since January , the Conficker .
B worm has been spreading like wildfire across the internet , infecting the French navy , hospitals in Sheffield , the court system in Houston , Texas , and millions of computers worldwide .
One of the ways it spreads is by cracking administrator passwords on networks .
Which leads to the important question : why are IT administrators still using easy - to - guess passwords ?
Computer authentication systems have two basic requirements .
They need to keep the bad guys from accessing your account , and they need to allow you to access your account .
Both are important , and every system is a balancing act between the two .
Too little security , and the bad guys will get in too easily .
But if the authentication system is too complicated , restrictive , or hard to use , you wo n't be able , or wo n't bother , to use it .
Passwords are the most common authentication system .
They 're easy to implement and use , which is why they 're so popular .
But , as computers have become faster , password - guessing has become easier .
Most people do n't choose complicated enough passwords to remain secure against modern password - guessing attacks .
Conficker .
B is even less clever - it just tries a list of about 200 common passwords .
To combat password - guessing , many systems force users to choose harder - to - guess passwords - requiring minimum lengths , non-alpha - numeric characters , etc - and change their passwords more frequently .
The first makes guessing harder , and the second makes a guessed password less valuable .
This , of course , makes the system more annoying , so users respond by writing their passwords down and taping them to their monitors , or simply forgetting them more often .
Smarter users use a secure password database such as Password Safe .
Users forgetting their passwords can be expensive - customer service reps have to field phone calls and reset passwords - so some systems include a backup authentication system : a secret question .
If you forget your password , you can authenticate yourself with some personal information that only you know , such as your mother 's maiden name , your favourite schoolteacher , the street you grew up on , the name of your first pet and so on .
This may make the system more usable , but it also makes it much less secure : answers can be easily guessed , and are often known by people close to you .
A common enhancement is a one - time password generator , such as a SecurID token .
This is a small device with a screen that displays a password that changes every time the button is pressed .
This is called two - factor authentication , and is much more secure , because this token - " something you have " - is combined with a password - " something you know " .
But it 's less usable , because the tokens have to be purchased and distributed to all users , and far too often it's " something you lost or forgot " .
And it costs money .
Tokens are more frequently used in corporate environments , but banks and some online gaming worlds have taken to using them , although sometimes only as an option , because people do n't like them .
In most cases , how an authentication system works when a legitimate user tries to log on is much more important than how it works when an impostor tries to log on .
No security system is perfect , and there is some level of fraud associated with any of these authentication methods .
But the instances of fraud are rare compared to the number of times someone tries to log on legitimately .
If a given authentication system lets the bad guys in one in a 100 times , a bank could decide to live with the problem , or try to solve it in some other way .
But if the same authentication system prevented legitimate customers from logging on even one in 1,000 times , the number of complaints would be enormous and the system would n't survive one week .
Balancing security and usability is hard , and many organisations get it wrong .
But it 's also evolving ; organisations need to tighten their security and continue to push more involved authentication methods ; and more savvy internet users will then be willing to accept them .
And IT administrators need to be leading that evolutionary change .

( CNN ) --
New research suggests that crabs not only suffer pain but that they retain a memory of it .
No thanks for the memories :
The scientific study applied mild electric shocks to hermit crabs to determine if they could ' feel ' pain .
The study , which was carried out by Professor Bob Elwood and Mirjam Appel from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen 's University , Belfast , looked at the reactions of hermit crabs to small electric shocks .
It was published in the journal " Animal Behaviour . "
Professor Elwood , whose previous work showed that prawns endure pain , said his research highlighted the need to investigate the treatment of crustaceans used in food industries .
Hermit crabs have no shell of their own so inhabit other structures , usually empty mollusc shells .
In the research , wires were attached to shells to deliver the small shocks to the abdomen of some of the crabs within the shells .
The only crabs to get out of their shells were those which had received shocks , indicating that the experience is unpleasant for them .
The research suggests that this response is not just a reflex , but that central neuronal processing takes place .
Hermit crabs are known to prefer some species of shells to others and it was found that that they were more likely to come out of the shells they least preferred .
The main aim of the experiment was to deliver a shock just under the threshold that causes crabs to move out of the shell , to see what happened when a new shell was then offered .
Crabs that had been shocked but had remained in their shell appeared to remember the experience of the shock because they quickly moved towards the new shell , investigated it briefly and were more likely to change to the new shell compared to those that had not been shocked .
" There has been a long debate about whether crustaceans including crabs , prawns and lobsters feel pain , " said Professor Elwood in a press statement .
" We know from previous research that they can detect harmful stimuli and withdraw from the source of the stimuli but that could be a simple reflex without the inner ' feeling ' of unpleasantness that we associate with pain .
" This research demonstrates that it is not a simple reflex but that crabs trade - off their need for a quality shell with the need to avoid the harmful stimulus .
" Such trade - offs are seen in vertebrates in which the response to pain is controlled with respect to other requirements .
Humans , for example , may hold onto a hot plate that contains food whereas they may drop an empty plate , showing that we take into account differing motivational requirements when responding to pain .
" Trade - offs of this type have not been previously demonstrated in crustaceans .
The results are consistent with the idea of pain being experienced by these animals . "
Previous work at Queen 's University found that prawns show prolonged rubbing when an antenna was treated with weak acetic acid but this rubbing was reduced by local anesthetic .
According to Queen 's University the findings from both studies are consistent with observations of pain in mammals .
But Professor
Elwood says that in contrast to mammals , little protection is given to the millions of crustaceans that are used in the fishing and food industries each day .
" More research is needed in this area where a potentially very large problem is being ignored , " said Elwood .
" Legislation to protect crustaceans has been proposed but it is likely to cover only scientific research .
Millions of crustacean are caught or reared in aquaculture for the food industry .
" There is no protection for these animals ( with the possible exception of certain states in Australia ) as the presumption is that they cannot experience pain .
" With vertebrates we are asked to err on the side of caution and I believe this is the approach to take with these crustaceans . "
No group has done more for the party than Club for Growth , the Washington - based anti-tax group dedicated to weeding out RINOs ( Republicans in Name Only ) .
I mean , of course , the Democratic Party , which has been the chief beneficiary of this strategy blessed by the GOP to become even more conservative .
Mission accomplished .
Recently , CFG President Pat Toomey stepped down from his job to rid Pennsylvania of the scourge known as Sen. Arlen Specter .
In doing so , Toomey 's bludgeoned the Republican Party far more than a few conscience votes by the moderate Republican .
Because Specter just switched parties and will almost certainly coast to re-election in 2010 .
But not before casting critical votes on budgets , health care and cap and trade .
Now the Dems have 60 seats in the Senate , just as soon as the courts finally rule for Al Franken in Minnesota .
He 's had a consistent lead and it only looks to be a matter of the GOP running out the clock .
I would n't be the least bit surprised if there 's a resolution introduced by a Democrat in the Senate for " Pat Toomey Day .
" The GOP may be " pure " but it has also become far smaller -- with only 21 percent identifying as Republicans in the latest Washington Post poll .
And thanks to Club for Growth , the party has hemorrhaged in the last two cycles Senate seats in Rhode Island and New Mexico and congressional seats in Idaho , Maryland and Michigan .
As I just wrote about in my last column , the CFG - anointed candidate , Tim Walberg , knocked out moderate U.S. Rep .
Joe Schwarz in the 2006 GOP primary , leading to liberal Mark Schauer winning the conservative 7th District seat last year .
And so far , he 's running unopposed .
Beats me why the party is n't eager to change .
I always thought politics was about winning .
But given the shrill reaction of Michigan GOP strategists like Dave Doyle ( he of the eugenics anti-Proposal 2 ads ) to the mere suggestion that the party needs to change its message , I guess they 'll leave that whole change thing to Barack Obama .
Not that he 's had any success with that .
Top 8 Free Music Websites
The world of free online music has changed quite a bit from the early days of bulletin boards and Napster .
Now , there are so many unique and useful free music services and web sites streaming music that it can spin your head .
Most of them are legal or at least not illegal at this point .
I did my best to sort through the tidal wave of music services to provide a unique blend of the best free music services .
Pandora – My personal favorite .
You create a station by requesting a particular artist and Pandora attempts to play music on that ‘ station ’ that is similar using a huge database of properties .
You can thumbs up and thumbs down songs to tailor the station to play exactly the type of music you want .
The one drawback is that to keep it legal you ca n’t rewind or replay a song ; you have to wait until the station plays it again .
Pandora has now put a 40 hour a month limitation on free listening .
Slacker Radio is a site that is almost identical to Pandora in how it works , although the song selection and recommendations are little different .
I have been listening to Slacker more of late as it gives me a different selections of songs for the same genre .
It is a nice alternative to Pandora .
Grooveshark – Peer to peer music service .
Grooveshark connects you with music hosted by other people who have already purchased the rights to the music .
Just search for the song you want and hit play .
It is really as easy and perfect as it sounds .
This is my go to site when want to listen to a specific song .
You do n’t even need an account to play songs .
Blip.fm –
This one has been referred to as the ‘ Twitter for Music ’ .
You create an account and become a social DJ .
You search for the song you want and you can play it and / or Blip it .
Blip it means adding a short twitter like message and recommending it to your ‘ listeners ’ .
Others can subscribe to your ‘ feed ’ and play the songs that you recommend .
Check out Trent Reznor ’s Blip page for a good example .
Sky.fm – Free streaming radio stations .
They have a large range of music categories and huge collection of electronic dance stations .
Sky.fm was my reintroduction to free online music , but I have since moved on to Pandora .
MySpace Music – Search and play site similar to Grooveshark , and they do also have videos available to watch .
They have a larger selection of music too .
TheSixtyOne – Unique Digg like service that allows the user to vote up the best music .
After a quick listen I realized that most of the music on this site is non mainstream and unique .
Great for someone who wants to find great music that is off the beaten path .
Last.fm – Offers a service that is similar to Pandora , Grooveshark , and Blip all in one place .
The only problem for me is that I never really got the site interface .
I am happy with the offerings at other sites so I never really got into Last. fm .
Jamendo – Free listening and downloads .
Jamendo allows budding new artists to share their music with new listeners .
I figured I better throw in a service that lets you download free music to round off the list .
Most of the sites that offer ‘ free ’ downloads get closed down pretty quickly .
Bearshare is still ‘ legal ’ , but that requires you to download software to get access to the music so it does n’t quite fit on the list .
Hope you enjoy trying out some of these great services .
My favorites are Pandora and Grooveshark .
Feel free to share any other sites or experiences that you think are worthy of a mention in the comments section .

Hilarious Dildo Commercial On Canadian TV
Note : to turn off these warnings you need to set the ' safe mode ' to OFF ( on the top right )
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Rupert Murdoch , whose media company News Corp owns one of the few U.S. newspapers that makes people pay to read its news on the Web , said more papers will have to start doing the same to survive .
The headquarters of the New York Times is pictured on 8th Avenue in New York April 30 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Gary Hershorn
Murdoch , who bought The Wall Street Journal and its parent company Dow Jones & Co in 2007 , said online advertising , which most U.S. publishers hope will offset ad revenue declines at their print divisions , will not cover their costs .
“ People reading news for free on the Web , that ’s got to change , ” said Murdoch speaking at The Cable Show , an annual cable television industry event , in Washington , D.C .
Murdoch pointed to the Journal ’s main rival in the United States , The New York Times , as an example .
The Times has one of the most popular U.S. newspaper websites , but still cannot cover its costs with online ads , he said .
Murdoch ’s newspaper empire includes the New York Post , the Times of London and other papers in Britain and Australia , which are available online for free .
The Journal had been charging for access for years before News Corp bought it .
His comments come as the Times holds a semi-public debate about whether it should revisit charging readers to get some or all of its news and commentary online .
It canceled an earlier experiment , “ TimesSelect ” , to charge for columnists and similar content because it made more money from ads .
The Journal charges readers for access to its website , which Murdoch said was “ not a gold mine , but it ’s not bad ” .
When he first took over the paper , News Corp and Dow Jones executives considered making the site free , but determined it would be better to keep charging for most , but not all , content .
As online ad revenue growth stumbles and in some cases falls , publishers are being forced to rethink whether charging for access is possible , or whether readers would simply stop going to their websites .
Time is running out .
Some U.S. publishers like Tribune Co have filed for bankruptcy .
Others , including Hearst Corp and EW Scripps
Co , have been shutting down big city dailies .
Still others are furloughing employees , cutting pay and buying out or laying off thousands of workers .
Even as they cut costs , publishers are looking for ways to get more people to read -- and pay for -- journalism .
Murdoch also told Cable Show attendees that News Corp is investing with partners in a new portable device to let people read electronic versions of their daily papers .
News Corp is investing in a reading device similar to Amazon.com ’s Kindle and Sony Corp ’s Reader but with a larger screen for reading newspapers , Murdoch said .
Newspapers like Pearson PLC ’s Financial Times and Gannett ’s USA Today are working with a Mountain View , California company called Plastic Logic on newspaper - specific reading device expected to launch early next year .
Murdoch did not clarify if it was the same technology and the company did not return calls seeking comment .
Murdoch also addressed concerns among newspaper publishers that search engines like Google Inc and Yahoo Inc help users to find stories by aggregating links to newspapers websites and blogs -- but then wrest ad dollars from them that they think should be theirs .
“ The question is , should we be allowing Google to steal all our copyright ... not steal , but take , ” said Murdoch .
“ Not just them but Yahoo . ”
Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt is expected to discuss this topic when he speaks at the Newspaper Association of America ’s annual conference in San Diego next week .
Separately , Murdoch said he is still “ slightly pessimistic ” about the economy and said he does not see things returning to previous levels for another two to three years .
The recession , along with hurting newspapers , has contributed to ad revenue declines at News Corp ’s U.S. local television business too .
Murdoch also talked about the financial industry ’s help in sparking the world economic crisis .
While there have been some well publicized excesses by some executives , he said , the U.S. government should go easy on regulation .
“ We need to get an SEC that ’s awake and maybe a few more regulations but not too many , ” he said .

I just adopted a dog .
It ’s a pound puppy ( well , kinda ) and by the time this post is published , he ’ll be the newest addition to the family .
So when I read about Honda releasing a version of their popular Element utility vehicle specifically for dog owners , I was all ears .
The Element was already popular with active folks cause it ’s basically a giant sheet of plastic inside .
You can wash the thing out with a hose .
And its various tent options allow for simple tailgating to taking a family of four on a three week safari through darkest Africa .
Ok maybe only a week safari through the jungles of the exurbs , but still .
The canine - friendly version can be equiped with dog restraints , a ramp to help older dogs get in / out , a raised platform so your pooch can still see the family , rear fan for ventilation , and a built - in water bowl .
I am seriously eyeing this baby as my next car .

Commercial real - estate loans could generate losses of $ 100 billion by the end of next year at more than 900 small and midsize U.S. banks if the economy 's woes deepen , according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal .
Such loans , which fund the construction of shopping malls , office buildings , apartment complexes and hotels , could account for nearly half the losses at the banks analyzed by the Journal , consuming capital that is an essential cushion against bad loans .

About 20 police officers wearing helmets and carrying batons , plastic shields and pepper spray entered a New School building at 65 Fifth Avenue around 11 a.m. on Friday , arresting 19 protesters who had occupied it as part of a determined protest aimed at the university ’s president , Bob Kerrey .
( Please note that this is a blog account updated over the course of the day Friday .
You may also read the news article prepared for Saturday editions of The Times , watch related videos or read blog comments . )
The 19 people arrested inside — 16 men and 3 women — were charged with third - degree burglary ; one was charged with assault and grand larceny for stealing a radio from a building employee .
Three other protesters , who authorities said were part of a group of about 8 people who tried to escape the building as the police surrounded it , were charged with second - degree assault , disorderly conduct , resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration .
The protest followed a similar occupation of a cafeteria in the same building nearly four months earlier .
That protest ended peacefully .
This time , the university ’s response was more confrontational , and the outcome violent .
“ The Police Department was asked to arrest individuals trespassing on the property , ” said Paul J. Browne , the department ’s chief spokesman , who said the operation “ was done in a very organized , orderly fashion . ”
But students at the scene described a tumultuous situation in which protesters were pepper - sprayed before being placed in handcuffs and loaded by police officers into the back of a white van , around 11:30 a.m .
Mr. Browne said it was “ untrue that pepper spray or mace was used in effectuating the arrests ” — though he later clarified that he meant the arrests inside the building .
Witnesses said that the protesters had sought to leave the building by a side door , but were pushed back and pepper - sprayed .
The witnesses said that several students pushed open a door that exited onto 14th Street , and that police officers stationed outside that door used pepper spray on the students in the corridor and slammed the door shut .
“ The students tried to open the door , ” said Kristina Monllos , a sophomore at Eugene Lang College , part of the New School , and a reporter covering the scene for the New School Free Press .
“ When the students pushed the door open , the police sprayed pepper spray inside and pushed the door closed . ”
Mr. Browne , however , said that if some students believed they were unable to leave , it might have been because they had used a chain to lock themselves inside , which officers then had to cut through .
Mr. Browne said in a statement :
At some point , as police were entering the building on Fifth Avenue , a group of 30 to 40 individuals advanced on a side entrance of the same building on East 14th Street .
While an individual or individuals pushed against the side door from inside , others from the advancing group began to throw metal barriers at the officers .
Additional officers were summoned .
They pursued fleeing members of the group , and affected three arrests for charges that included : assault , disorderly conduct , resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration .
Footage recorded by a videographer , identified by the New School Free Press as Chris McCallion , and shown on the Free Press Web site , shows a turbulent scene in which demonstrators briefly scuffle with police and heave a metal barricade .
At one point , a protester appeared to try to wrest a woman away from an officer who was trying to arrest her .
A video , above , shot by a freelance journalist , Brandon Jourdan of Brooklyn , showed about a half - dozen police officers standing near the door on 14th Street when it was pushed open from inside .
Then it shows officers shaking cans of pepper spray as they hold the door back , spraying inside the corridor , and forcing the door shut .
It shows an officer , a few moments later , lunging toward Mr. Jourdan ’s camera , before swerving toward a young man standing on the street shouting .
In the video , the officer pushes the man ’s face and knockes him to the ground before arresting him .
( Be advised , the video includes some profanity . )
As senior police officials , firefighters and emergency medical technicians looked on , the police officers surged into the building around 11 a.m. , carrying bunches of white plastic handcuffs attached to their belts .
Moments later , several were seen leaning over the parapet ; the banners that the three dozen or so students occupying the building had hung were removed .
Officers from the Emergency Service Unit cut the chains and then officers from the Manhattan South Task Force entered the building around 11 a.m. , and “ began to make arrests in an orderly fashion , ” Mr. Browne said .
Neither Mr. Browne nor the university could immediately say whether or how many of the 19 people arrested were New School students .
The university said that the three people arrested on assault charges after leaving the building were students : one from the New School , one from Brooklyn College and one from New York University .
Police Reaction to Video
After Mr. Jourdan ’s video was posted on the City Room blog , Mr. Browne viewed it and spoke simultaneously with a reporter by phone .
He took issue with an earlier account on City Room that described officers as having “ stormed ” the building .
“ There was no storming , ” he said .
He said the officers wore helmets and had standard - issue batons and pepper spray , but no riot gear , as some descriptions from witnesses had it .
As he watched the video , Mr. Browne explained why the officers held the door shut .
“ What happens is , we are making arrests inside , and we are trying to prevent people from escaping , ” he said .
“ It ’s not like , ‘ Hey , we ’re giving up . ' ”
He said that some people were trying to get out of the building and that others were trying to get in , so keeping the doorway closed served two purposes .
“ There was a group we thought might be trying to get in , ” he said .
It was the activity on the street outside that led to arrests there , Mr. Browne said , and those arrests are on the videotape .
Regarding the use of pepper spray , Mr. Browne said the video made it clear that the spray was , indeed , used .
( The department does not use Mace or tear gas , he noted . )
“ We apparently used pepper spray for people who were either trying to let more people in or were trying avoid arrests , ” Mr. Browne said .
“ Now , once I see it , I know what is going on . ”
He continued to insist that the spray was not used in “ effectuating the arrests ” inside the building , and that he had not been aware earlier of the incidents at the side door .
He also noted that it is standard procedure for all officers to carry batons and pepper spray in most situations .
Mr. Browne reviewed several times the segment of the video showing a protester getting knocked to the ground .
When asked about the tactics used , he said , “ He pushed him and he fell down . ”
He added : “ My comment — the officer pushed into him and he fell down .
There were individuals interfering with an arrest being made , and he was one of them , and they pushed into him and he fell down . ”
Mr. Browne also questioned the source of the video , which came from a man who was shooting for the liberal news organization Democracy Now and said it was more notable for what was not included in the footage .
“ If they want to question the validity of it , the proof is in the pudding , ” Mr. Jourdan , 29 , said in response .
“ The video speaks for itself and not only that , there were plenty of witnesses there who believed the police overreacted and lost their cool . ”
He said he planned on filing a complaint against the officer who , he said , also “ shoved me to the ground . ”
Donna Lieberman , the executive director for the New York Civil Liberties Union , viewed the videotape — twice , she said — and pointed out that while it is unknown what occurred prior to the yelling , the portions of video that are seen raise “ serious concerns . ”
“ What appears on the video is someone yelling at the cops and getting punched in the face for it and thrown to the ground and arrested , ” said Ms. Lieberman .
“ The Police Department has no authority to use physical force on somebody in this situation and they have no authority to arrest people for yelling at them ; that is a violation of civil rights plain and simple . ”
The Police Video
Late on Friday afternoon , the Police Department released its own video of the confrontation , a video that showed the police in a more favorable light .
According to that video , the mood at the epicenter of the standoff , inside the New School , was defined by order and efficiency — even if the scene outside was significantly more chaotic .
Uniformed police officers and the 19 protesters who had locked themselves inside spoke to one another in a calm , almost subdued tone of voice , with each side being polite and courteous to the other , the police video showed .
The police videotape showed a detective speaking to one protester , identified as John Clay , as he spoke on a cellphone to an organizer outside named Chelsea .
The detective , Jeff Salter , is seen on the video negotiating for the students to unlock a set of glass doors and let the officers in .
At that point , the officers had already cut the locks barring them from an earlier set of doors , said Mr. Browne , the police spokesman .
“ We want to end this peacefully , ” said Detective Salter .
“ We do n’t want anyone to get hurt . ”
The doors were glass .
Behind them were some barricades that appear to be movable room barriers or shelves , as well as other furniture , and about 30 feet beyond the doors , the group of students – including four women and the rest men – were sitting calmly on the floor , many with backpacks .
At one point , two students , a woman and a man in a sweatshirt with Mickey Mouse emblazoned on it , got up and walked toward the officers and unlocked some locks on the doors , and then went back and sat down .
“ Thank you , ” one officer can be heard saying on the video .
Once the doors were opened , the officers entered slowly , led by Chief of Department Joseph Esposito .
“ Do me a favor , take your back packs off , ” one officer said to the group .
The students complied .
Another officer asked : “ How many females do we have ? ”
The female students were handcuffed first .
The first one stood and put her hands behind her back and allowed the officer to handcuff her .
It continues in that fashion for several minutes .
“ Next female , please stand up , ” an officer said .
“ Put your hands behind your back . ”
The male students sat on the floor , awaiting their turn .
The Start of the Protest
The students had occupied the building around 5:30 a.m. , planning a takeover similar to one carried out at the university in December .
A graduate student who spoke to a reporter at 5:55 a.m. outside the building said , “ The students just entered the building , and the police are already here . ”
Mr. Browne , the police spokesman , said the people who occupied the building ejected a maintenance worker , stole his radio and chained the doors locked .
Whoever stole the radio might face robbery charges in addition to trespassing charges , he said .
In a statement ( see below ) , the university called the protest an “ illegal occupation ” and said the protesters had injured a security supervisor who tried to stop them .
Around 7 a.m. several dozen students , standing on the sidewalk on Fifth Avenue , cheered when several masked people appeared on the roof of 65 Fifth Avenue , waving red and black flags and lifting clenched fists in the air .
The students on the roof draped banners over the side of the building that read , “ Kerrey and Murtha resign now ! ”
Police officers were already on hand , and as the morning went on , the numbers increased until dozens of officers stood on all sides of the building , and the streets surrounding the building held mazes of metal barricades and yellow police tape .
Students on the sidewalks outside the building said they were members of various groups — all of which are disgruntled with the administration .
A woman who identified herself as Alex Johnson , a fourth - year politics major , said she was a spokeswoman for the students inside , and spoke to a reporter by phone from what she said was an undisclosed location .
Asked how long the students intended to remain inside the building , she said , “ As long as they can . ”
Asked what it would take to make the students to leave voluntarily , she replied , “ It would take Kerrey and Murtha resigning . ”
Among the students watching from across the street was Andy Folk , 21 , a junior at Eugene Lang College , studying fiction and philosophy .
“ I ’m here to show solidarity and support , ” he said .
“ We and much of the faculty continue to have no confidence in Bob Kerrey . ”
Mr Folk added that he thought Mr. Kerrey wanted to soften the radical legacy of the school .
As senior police officers and fire officials arrived , the masked people on the roof used a megaphone to address the crowd below .
One of the masked figures read a lengthy critique of capitalism and contemporary life , which a student below identified as an essay , “ On the Poverty of Student Life , ” that originated at the University of Strasbourg .
By 10:30 , the part of Fifth Avenue below 14th Street , as well as adjoining side streets , were filled with city vehicles .
There were police vans , an emergency services unit truck and a mobile Fire Department command center and Fire Department ambulance .
Paramedics stood at the ready , and police officers , holding what appeared to be building plans , huddled together .
A group of police officers , one holding a sledge hammer , then walked toward the building .
Elsewhere , tensions rose shortly before 11 , when a crowd of people rallying in support of the students dashed east on 14th Street , pursued by police .
Police officers and about 40 protesters faced off on the south side of 14th Street .
A line of officers advanced toward the protesters , who retreated toward Union Square , some shouting at the officers .
At the same time , on Fifth Avenue , several dozen police officers wearing visor helmets and carrying long plastic shields lined up in front of the main entrance to 65 Fifth Avenue .
An officer made an announcement through a megaphone that officials said was to let students know that officers were about to enter the school .
Other officers on horseback patrolled surrounding blocks where , by 11 a.m. , more than 100 police vehicles were parked .
The Earlier Building Occupation
The December takeover lasted about 30 hours .
Then , students barricaded themselves inside a ground - floor cafeteria at the building , protesting a host of issues , many connected to the administration of the university ’s president , Bob Kerrey .
The students adopted a list of eight demands including a greater student voice in university affairs and the resignations of Mr. Kerrey , a former senator from Nebraska ; James Murtha , the executive vice president ; and Robert Millard , treasurer of the board of trustees , who students said was connected to a private security company working in Iraq .
That action ended after negotiations , but a student group calling itself the New School in Exile promised further disruptions if Mr. Kerrey did not accede to their demand to resign by April 1 .
“ With their demand still unmet as of this date , students have once again reclaimed this neglected , symbolic building which housed the New School for Social Research , ” student organizers said in a news release on Friday .
“ On the 75th anniversary of the University in Exile , New School students are reclaiming the tradition of protest and political action that birthed the university and gave it meaning for generations to come . ”
Statements From the New School
The university responded to the protests with the following statement on Friday morning :
On December 15 , 2008 , an unofficial student organization calling themselves the New School in Exile occupied the cafeteria at 65 Fifth Avenue , barricaded themselves into the room , and issued a set of demands .
Early on the morning of December 16 , a group of students and non-students broke through a fire exit on 14th street and entered the building .
Although the occupants had violated a number of important security rules , the university made the judgment they were neither an operational or a security risk .
Accordingly , we did not file a complaint with the New York Police Department to have the occupants removed .
Instead we entered into a process of negotiations with our students and reached agreement on a list of demands including amnesty for all involved early on the morning of December 17 .
The students left peacefully at that time .
In January , this same unofficial student organization issued a public threat to forcefully shut down the university on April 1 unless the President and Chief Operating Officer were removed .
Following this they were caught stealing an entire edition of the student newspaper on account of a story they regarded as unfavorable to them ; and subsequently they vandalized the university ’s presidential residence .
During this time the university has allowed and accommodated every peaceful protest , teach - in , and demonstration .
We have enforced our rules governing such events in such a way as to permit protests , so long as they do n’t endanger the safety of other members of the community or destruction of property .
This morning ’s illegal occupation of 65 Fifth Avenue was joined by a number of New School in Exile students as well as individuals without any affiliation to The New School .
Their claim that this was a simple political protest is false .
Their entry into this building was forced , they removed a man who was cleaning the building , took his phone , injured a security officer , and did physical damage to the building .
Accordingly , in this case the university asked the New York Police Department to remove and arrest those who were trespassing on our property .
We suspended , pending administrative review , all New School students who were a part of this action .
The New School prides itself on civic engagement .
We have been and will continue to be a refuge for open and critical political debate .
Students and faculty who choose to peacefully and passionately oppose the policies of the university will have their rights to do so protected as strongly as we protect our right to safely and securely operate our university .
Later on Friday , the university issued an updated statement :
Early this morning , a New School building at the corner of 14th Street and 5th Avenue was illegally broken into by approximately 30 people , some of whom were New School students .
The police were involved and 23 protesters were arrested .
Any participant that is enrolled at The New School will be suspended pending completion of disciplinary proceedings .
Below is a timeline of activity .
At 5:25 a.m. , a maintenance employee for The New School was in the cafeteria in 65 Fifth Avenue .
He heard a loud bang when over two dozen protesters with crowbars broke the locks on the side door on 13th Street .
As he exited the cafeteria , he was overwhelmed by another group of protesters , some wearing face masks .
He reported being physically grabbed by four men and forced out the door .
During this time , they stole his security two - way radio .
A security supervisor responded to a call from the maintenance employee and went to the building ’s entrance on 13th Street , where he interrupted the protesters in their effort to block the doorway .
Although students have publicly denied that anyone was hurt , participants slammed the supervisor ’s leg in the door as he tried to enter through the door .
He sustained injuries to his leg and went to the emergency room at St. Vincent ’s Hospital .
The protesters carried crowbars , bolt - cutters , mace , paint , hundreds of feet of security cable , masking and duct tape , kryptonite locks , and hundreds of feet of nylon rope into the building .
They were also carrying sleeping bags and food , indicating they planned to be in the building for some time .
Security called 911 to report a burglary at The New School and gave the location at 65 5th Avenue .
The initial N.Y.P.D. responding units arrived at the scene in three minutes and began assembling a comprehensive team to deal with the break - in .
N.Y.P.D. have been on alert since December 2008 as there have been numerous attempts to break into this building before .
N.Y.P.D. protocols dictated the nature of the response by the police .
The protesters , some but not all of whom were New School students , blocked all building entrances .
They used conduit pipe , or hollow metal bars , heavy , plastic - coated security cable , and gravity locks to block the doors , which were then reinforced with desks and chairs .
They used Crazy Glue on all the locks .
They put duct tape over all security cameras and transmission devices , effectively cutting off the building ’s network service .
They also cut through the cage inside the building to the cafeteria and smashed the cash register .
Between 8:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. , up to nine hooded individuals appeared on the roof of the building , where they made a statement and hung signs at the 13th Street and 5th Avenue corner of the building .
At approximately 11:30 a.m. a group of students tried to escape through an exit on 14th Street .
It is estimated that eight participants escaped down 14th Street .
Three were caught by the N.Y.P.D. and resisted arrest .
The individuals included three students , one from The New School , one from Brooklyn College and one from N.Y.U. , who was confirmed by N.Y.U. security as a member of their previous occupation .
These protesters hurt two police officers and face charges of assault in the 2nd degree .
One protester , a New School student , was hurt in the altercation .
At 11:45 , the N.Y.P.D. prepared to enter the building .
Using a megaphone , Tim Sikorski , head of New School security , warned the protesters they would be arrested and the N.Y.P.D. ’s hostage negotiation leader also made a similar announcement .
Protesters responded to the N.Y.P.D. ’s request and unlocked the doors and let the N.Y.P.D. in .
There were 16 males and 3 females present in the building .
All were arrested , in addition to the 3 arrested earlier on 14th Street .
It is unknown at this time how many participants were New School students .
There were participants from other universities as well as other unaffiliated individuals .
Protesters inside the building did not resist arrest .
The N.Y.P.D. used plastic handcuffs and led each participant out of the building .
They were taken to N.Y.P.D. ’s central booking .
All participants face charges for burglary in the third degree , a charge stemming from breaking into an unoccupied building .

The Sandroid Recirculating Blasting System .
If a race of alien robots were to take over the world ’s sand blasting industry and started cloning themselves , it still would n’t be as cool as the Sandroid Recirculating Blasting System from Engrave - A - Crete .
The Sandroid is an innovative tool for blasting decorative designs into existing concrete .
It creates a fine impression in the concrete slab by blasting away the top surface of sealer , stain and concrete .
With the Sandroid you can create very delicate images as well as distinguished designs .
P.W. Singer ’s latest book , Wired For War : The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century , is exciting , fascinating and frightening .
Singer covers the history of robotics for warfare ( and robot history in general ) before delving into the dizzying plethora of robotic systems being developed and / or used at a tremendously accelerated rate .
With loving detail , Singer describes all the new awesome bot warriors and the players involved in creating them .
At the same time , he explores the horrors and dangers — both potential and current — and raises the alarming and increasingly unavoidable ethical issues that are bubbling to the surface as war increasingly becomes robot war .
Beyond that , Singer is a total science fiction geek , so the book in some sense hinges around the degree to which fictional fantasy is turning into reality .
With the upcoming release of Terminator Salvation on both of our minds , he was clearly excited to lay out the many correlations between one of our leading cinematic mythologies and the actual evolution of robots for war .
Singer is a Senior Fellow at Brookings Institute , where he is Director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative .
He was also coordinator of the Defense Policy Task Force for Barack Obama ’s 2008 presidential campaign .
Other books have included Children at War and Corporate Warriors : The Rise of the Privatized Military .
h+ :
What were some of the more impressive or frightening things that you discovered about robotics in warfare that you discovered in researching the book ?
PWS : It ’s impressive when you break it into three different directions that robotics and war are headed in .
For one thing , there ’s the raw numbers , in terms of the use of these robotic systems .
We ’ve gone from a handful of drones during the Iraq invasion to more than 7,000 now in the U.S. military inventory .
On the ground , we had zero unmanned vehicles before the invasion of Iraq .
We now have over 12,000 .
And this is just the start .
This spread is also continuing in terms of the domains that they fight in .
In the air , the U.S. purchased more unmanned planes than manned planes last year , and that will continue to increase .
And use of these systems are increasing on the ground and at sea .
And then we ’re starting to develop these systems for space and even cyberspace .
And it ’s not just an American expansion .
It ’s global .
There are 43 countries working on military robotics right now .
So you have this just huge … immense growth .
The best way to imagine where we ’re going is to look at what Bill Gates says about robotics .
He says , “ Robotics are about where computers were in 1980 . ”
A… scientist talked about how the military came to him and said , “ Oh , we ’d like you to design the hunter - killer drone from the Terminator movies . ”
The second impressive aspect of this is the new size and shapes — the forms that these robots come in .
There are these huge robots such as planes with wings the length of a football field that are designed to stay up in the air not just hours , not just days ….
but literally for weeks , months , even years .
So there you have incredible possibilities in terms of the roles they might play , where it ’s almost like a spy satellite in the sky .
You can even contemplate it as a flying cell phone tower , a flying gas station … you name it .
And then at the other end of the size and shape spectrum , they ’ve got the teeny tiny robots .
I saw one system that would fit on the tip of your finger .
You can think of it as bugs with bugs — insect - like and insect size , but carrying James Bond surveillance bugs .
The third impressive aspect is their ever - greater intelligence and autonomy .
We ’ve gone from having systems where we remote controlled every single thing that they could do to systems where the human role is more managerial or supervisory .
We ’re slowly pushing ourselves outside of the loop .
For example , the Global Hawk is a drone that ’s the size of a plane .
It ’s a replacement for the U - 2 spy plane .
It can take off on its own ; fly 3,000 miles on its own ; carry out its mission on its own ; turn around and fly itself back 3,000 miles on its own , and land itself .
So it ’s not so much being piloted as it ’s being supervised or managed .
And then you get to the interactivity of these robots .
There ’s incredible work on social robots that can recognize facial expressions and then , in turn , give their own facial expressions .
And this is going to continue , because you have Moore ’s Law going on here , where our systems — our microchips are doubling in their computing power just about under every two years or so .
And that means that the kind of systems that we have today really are the Model T Ford .
They ’re the Wright Brothers flyers as compared to what ’s coming .
If Moore ’s law holds true , the way it has held true for the last several decades , within 25 years our systems may be as much as a billion times more powerful than today .
And so this all sounds like science fiction , and yet it is real right now .
It ’s a technologic reality and a political reality .
h+ : …. which raises the inevitable Terminator question .
Did you see anything that made you think of that film , particularly ?
PWS : Oh , god .
You know , what did n’t ?
I mean , I can think of just wonderful layers of anecdotes upon anecdotes about that .
I ’ll give you four things that sort of jumped out at me and that I write about in the book .
For one thing — it ’s interesting where the scientists get their ideas about what to build .
There ’s a section in the book about the role that science fiction is playing in directly influencing battlefield reality .
And I went around interviewing not just the scientists who design and build these systems , but the science fiction creators who inspire them .
And I recall one of the scientists talking with incredible admiration about the robots in the opening scene of Terminator 2 , where the robots are walking across the battlefield .
This is basically what Terminator Salvation is about — that ’s the world that movie is going to play in , right ?
And he was like : “ This is incredibly impressive stuff . ”
You know , yeah , it ’s stepping on a human skull , but it ’s still really impressive .
Another scientist talked about how the military came to him and said , “ Oh , we ’d like you to design the hunter - killer drone from the Terminator movies . ”
Which , you know , is kind of incredibly scary , but it makes perfect sense from another perspective in that if it ’s effective for SkyNet , their thinking is : “ Well , it could be really neat in our real - world battlefields . ”
The second example is all about perception issues .
I did n’t just ask people what do we think of our robots .
I asked , what do other people think about our robots ?
What do the insurgents think about our robots ?
What do news reporters in places like Pakistan or Lebannon think about this ?
And so I remember doing one of the interviews with an Air Force officer and asking him , “ What do you think the experience of a Predator drone attack is like ? ”
And he said , “ You know , it ’s probably like the opening scene of the Terminator movies , where the human are hiding out in the caves and the bunkers , and this sort of relentless robotic foe is coming at them .
That ’s what I bet it ’s like for the Al - Qaida and Taliban . ”
And there ’s sort of an irony there , in that we — the watchers of the movie — are supposed to be cheering for the humans on the ground .
And the humans on the ground eventually get over their fears of this relentless foe and fight back .
So it ’s a sort of weird irony when you think about it that way .
The third example came up recently .
These machines have incredible capabilities and offer immense possibilities .
But then , you know , every revolution has two sides to it .
And one of the challenges of some of these systems is that they gather scads and scads of data .
It ’s too much data , actually .
One of the Air Force officers I met with , who was in charge of targeting for CENTCOM , described how every morning he would get a three - inch high stack of intelligence reports and he ’d have about 20 minute to go through it and make his decisions .
So , as he put it , there ’s a lot of data falling on the floor .
General Norman Schwartz , the chief of staff of the Air Force , told us in a talk at Brookings Institute : “ There ’s no way we can hire enough intelligence analysts to go through all that data .
So we ’re going to have to turn it over increasingly to computers and AI to sift through all the data that we get and tell us what ’s important . ”
And so I said , “ You know , that ’s interesting .
I actually have the perfect name for that AI that will go through all the information that we have .
We could call it SkyNet . ”
The fourth example is the role of what I call the refuseniks .
The refuseniks are scientists working in robotics who are starting to worry that they are becoming too much like the Dyson character in the Terminator chronology .
Dyson was the scientist who invents SkyNet and then learns to his horror what it did .
And he has this wonderful quote : “ You ’re judging me on things I have n’t even done yet .
Jesus .
How were we supposed to know ? ”
And that ’s in the world of fiction .
The refuseniks are also thinking about the world of history , most particularly what happened in the 1940s to the nuclear physicists who became so enamored of building this incredible technology — what became the atomic bomb — that they never took a step back and went , “ Oh my gosh .
What does this all mean ? ”
And even more to the point — they tricked themselves into believing they were going to be the ones in charge of how it would be used .
And , of course , after the Manhattan project , they were n’t the ones in charge .
And a lot of them asked themselves , “ My god , what did I do ? ”
And a lot of the people who invented the atomic bomb then became the founders of the arms control movement to ban the atomic bomb .
So the refuseniks are real - world roboticists … a sort of small movement in the robotics field .
As I joke , they ’re the roboticists who just say no .
They ’re the ones who are saying , “ You know what ?
I do n’t want to accept military funding for what I ’m doing .
I ’m not going to work on war bots . ”
And that ’s another Terminator - like parallel .
But just like in the Terminator chronologies , just because you ’ve got some people who decide to change their minds , it does n’t mean that the entire field is n’t moving in that direction .
h+ :
When I saw the refuseniks chapter in your book , my first thought was , “ My god .
That ’s a very small chapter . ” ( laughter )
PWS : And it ’s a very small movement .
h+ : Right .
It ’s always interested me that during and right after the Vietnam war , you had a lot of people who refused to work with the military .
And that changed .
But you might think that after the Iraq invasion , more people would start having second thoughts again .
But you do n’t really see that .
It seems like they ’re on the gravy train and it does n’t seem like anybody really wants to think about stepping off of it .
PWS : It ’s a good question .
I spoke at Carnegie Mellon recently and got a great reception by some people .
And then this professor angrily emailed me afterward , basically saying ( paraphrasing ) : “ I ’m so upset that you troubled our graduate students by forcing them to think about whether to take military funding or not . ” ( Facetiously )
Oh my gosh .
Horrors .
Just to be really clear —
I ’m not saying do n’t take military funding .
And you ’ll notice , in the book , that I show a strong sense of admiration for the refuseniks but I also show a strong sense of admiration for the people who say , “ I do this because I think it saves American soldiers ’ lives . ”
But I do n’t have respect for the people who try to have it both ways — the one ’s who say , “ Oh , I take military funding , but I have nothing to do with the military .
I ’m not linked to war in any way … .
You know , that head - in - the - sand phenomenon .
Unfortunately , that describes a large portion of the people in the field .
They are the one ’s who take money from DARPA and do n’t want to think about what the D stands for .
h+ : Let ’s return to the question of autonomous bots .
What is the level of autonomy right now ?
I mean , are bots making decisions to pull a trigger or drop a bomb yet ?
Or if not , how close are we to that sort of thing ?
PWS : Autonomy is n’t a yes or a no or an on or off switch .
It ’s more like a measure along a spectrum .
And we ’re giving more and more autonomy to our systems .
A sort of good human parallel to autonomy is maturity .
How much of a leash does that parent let that kid operate under ?
And what we ’re seeing with our robotics is that we ’ve gone from humans involved in the complete operation of everything that they do to really loosening that leash .
The Global Hawk that I talked about earlier is one illustration .
Warfare is going open source .
Another one is the C - RAM — the Counter - Rocket Artillery Mortar System .
The system looks a little bit like R2 - D2 if R2 - D2 had a 20 millimeter machine gun cannon mounted on him .
It ’s used to shoot down incoming artillery and rockets in places like the green zone in Iraq .
The system — the human turns it on and off .
But during its operations , the human role is non-essential .
When you have an incoming rocket , humans can basically get to mid-curse word —
“ Oh , cra … ”
That ’s about it .
That ’s about the amount of time we have to respond .
So because of the very speed and nature of war , the computer has to respond without our authorization or interference .
So we are a part of the loop in one sense , but we really are n’t in another sense .
What I get from it is — we ’ve re-defined our sense of control , our sense of what it means for something to be autonomous or not .
You know , there ’s the great descriptor in the book from a bomber pilot of the dropping of a bomb .
He ’s a pilot .
He ’s in charge of that plane .
But the way he described dropping the bomb was , “ The computer opened the bomb bay doors , and sent the weapon out into the dark . ”
He was n’t pressing the pickle button , like we see in the World War II movies .
He was along for the ride … for the computer to decide when to drop it or when to not .
Now , he could ’ve stopped it .
He ’s still in charge .
But you get where I ’m talking about here .
And we ’re giving more and more autonomy to the robots in terms of things like target - recognition software .
These are the counter - sniper devices that basically — when a sniper shoots at a soldier , it targets that sniper ’s location in an instant .
So we are not yet at the point in the Terminator movies where you ’ve got robots out there completely operating on their own , making all their own decisions .
But we ’re certainly already in a space where few imagined we would be .
And then , secondly , we are working on those more Terminator - like systems .
h+ :
There ’s some discussion that a strong AI system could actually make better decisions , even better ethical decisions , than governments and generals and soldiers ..
Did you run into any of that kind of discussion while you were working on your book ?
PWS : There is some , but it ’s very stove - piped .
You have people working in the field who talk about that , but military ethicists are n’t dealing with it .
So you have this stove pipe .
And that ’s one of the points of the book — to try and break these stove pipes down and say , “ These things are n’t mere science fiction any more .
They ’re real .
They need to be engaged on .
And they ca n’t just be engaged in by just the roboticists or just the military . ”
Secondly , there is a somewhat inherent flaw in these discussions among the roboticists , when you sort of peel them back a little bit .
They argue , yes … they can be more moral ; they can be more ethical .
But when you actually explore what does it mean to be ethical , what does it mean to be moral , you ca n’t have a machine that ’s moral .
Our very meaning of morality is something that ’s very much linked to humans .
The same thing with ethics .
You can try to program a robot to follow a set of guidelines that we have defined as moral or ethical , but it does n’t make the machine moral or ethical .
The more important part of that problem is that when you look at their sort of descriptions of how that would be accomplished , it ’s a black box .
They say , “ Well you could have the robot with the ethics black box . ”
So you ask , “ Okay , well what does that mean ? ”
And they might say , “ Well , it ’s just a little black box in the diagrams . ”
It ’s sort of like saying , you know , “ Oh , well it ’ll have the emotion box . ”
Well , how do you build it ?
What …
h+ : … but if you get to the level of artificial intelligence where it ’s approaching the sort of intelligence that Kurzweil talks about , could n’t you have a bot being asked by generals to participate in a war .
And the bot thinks about it and says ( imitating scene from 2001 A Space Odyssey ) , “ I ca n’t do that , Dave . ”
PWS : Yeah , in theory .
But when you look at their outlines for it , it ’s still a black box .
It ’s sort of like , “ I ’m going to have the car that produces no bad emissions because it ’s powered by the cold fusion device . ”
And you say , “ Oh , well … what ’s your design for the cold fusion device ? ”
“ Well , it ’ll be the cold fusion device . ”
Do you get what I ’m saying ?
h : Sure .
The speculation has nothing to do with the path we ’re actually currently on with war bots .
PWS : So it ’s a challenge .
And you hear some people say , “ Oh , you could program the machine to follow this set of rules , and it ’s more likely to follow the rules than a soldier because it ’s not driven by emotion . ”
Soldiers are also supposed to be programmed to follow the Geneva conventions , but their emotions take them over .
A buddy gets killed and they get angry .
They commit a crime of rage or revenge .
And a robot is emotionless , so it ’ll always follow those set of rules .
Well , yes , a robot is emotionless .
But it also has no sense of empathy … no sense of guilt .
It will see an 80 - year - old grandmother in her wheelchair in the very same way it sees a T - 80 tank .
They ’re both just 0s and 1s in the programming language .
Finally , we ’re living in an era where the application of the laws of war are n’t clear - cut .
They ’re difficult .
You know , it ’s not simple , like “ Never shoot at noncombatants . ”
It ’s “ What do I do in a situation where I have a terrorist leader shooting at me from a house that also has women and children in it ?
What if I have an insurgent group that ’s using an ambulance and I ’m not supposed to shoot at it because it ’s got a red cross on the side of it , but they ’re using that ambulance to move explosives around . ”
These are really tough questions that we could spend lengthy periods debating , and we would never come to a resolution .
The computer is n’t going to be able to resolve those kinds of questions any time soon .
h+ : I wanted to ask you about these robot systems escaping the military and getting into private hands .
You had an interesting part of the book there with sort of a militia - type border patrol group that has drones .
PWS : Yes .
h+ : So I ’m picturing drug gangs and terrorist groups … angry high school students or whatever … you know , everybody having their own war bots .
Are we moving towards that kind of situation ?
PWS : The way I think about it is this — just like software , warfare is going open source .
That is , we ’re starting to use more and more systems that are commercial , off - the - shelf — some of it is even DIY .
You can build your own version of the Raven drone , which is a widely used military drone , for about $ 1,000 dollars .
So we have a flattening of the landscape of war and technology that is just like what happened in software .
A wide variety of actors can utilize these systems .
You know , it ’s not just the major states that are using military robotics .
There are 43 countries working on them — rich states , poor states , big states , small states , you name it .
Everyone from the U.S. to Pakistan and Iran to Belarus and on and on .
And it ’s the same thing with the non-state actors .
And the non-state actors range from Hezbollah to this militia group in Arizona to a bunch of college kids at Swarthmore .
It widens the landscape of who can play in war .
That ’s a pretty disturbing factor .
One person ’s hobby — such as the hobbyist who flew a homemade drone from North America to Great Britain — can be another person ’s terrorist strike option .
The United Arab Emirates is considering legislation that would criminalize publication of anything that would " harm the economy . "
Already , the local press is pulling back from their coverage of the steep decline in Dubai property values and the rise in deportations , voluntary departure , and abandonment of unsaleable assets , such as cars .
Instead of moving toward greater transparency , the emirates seem to be moving in the other direction .
A new draft media law would make it a crime to damage the country 's reputation or economy , punishable by fines of up to 1 million dirhams ( about $ 272,000 ) .
Some say it is already having a chilling effect on reporting about the crisis .
Last month , local newspapers reported that Dubai was canceling 1,500 work visas every day , citing unnamed government officials .
Asked about the number , Humaid bin Dimas , a spokesman for Dubai's Labor Ministry , said he would not confirm or deny it and refused to comment further .
Some say the true figure is much higher .
" At the moment there is a readiness to believe the worst , " said Simon Williams , HSBC bank 's chief economist in Dubai .
" And the limits on data make it difficult to counter the rumors . "
IFPI works to make sure that the rights of its members , who create , produce and invest in music , are properly protected and enforced .
As the netbooks market gets more competitive , design has emerged as a big factor for companies seeking to distinguish their products .
Lenovo's latest netbook photos show it may just blow its rivals out of the water when it comes to looks .
The company teased Monday with pictures of a new netbook called Pocket Yoga .
The photos also show a netbook with a nice almost full - sized keyboard that supports a touchscreen for a stylus .
It also has a form factor that allows it to be flipped into a small tablet PC .
The Pocket Yoga design ultimately is reminiscent of the Sony Vaio P netbook released earlier this year .
Sony has targeted that netbook at fashion conscious consumers .
The Vaio P Lifestyle Series netbook comes with a 1.33GHz processor and a 8 - inch screen .
There are no specifications yet available on the Pocket Yoga netbook or details on if the product will make it to market .
It 's all in the concept stage now .
But based on the initial pictures it seems the device will be small enough to fit into the back pocket of your Levis jeans .
Till more details of the Pocket Yoga trickle out , feast on pictures of the netbook .
It 's drool worthy .

Star Trek : Original Motion Picture Collection Blu-ray Review
The original six beam onto Blu-ray .
Reviewed by Martin Liebman , May 25 , 2009
" Star Trek " lived up to its promise , boldly going where no television series had gone before , the forward - thinking and enormously popular program from the 1960s spawning eleven feature films , an animated spinoff show , four additional live action television programs spanning 25 seasons , countless novels and fan fiction works , attics full of toys , dozens of conventions , and legions of fans .
Series creator Gene Roddenberry likely did n't even imagine the enormity of his creation when the show was conceived , and its lore grows only larger as time moves on .
What Roddenberry did see , however , was the bold new direction the series explored when then - little - known writer and director Nicholas Meyer became the creative force behind the most lauded and acclaimed ( before , arguably , J.J. Abram 's fantastic 2009 reboot )
Trek movie , The Wrath of Khan .
Re-thinking not necessarily the mission of Starfleet in general and the Enterprise in particular but certainly lending to them a more militaristic , uniform , and orderly structure , Meyer 's influence on Star Trek and all its many interpretations since remains even today , approaching thirty years since Khan was unleashed on theaters .
The six films featuring the original Enterprise crew -- Captain Kirk ( William Shatner ) , Mr. Spock ( Leonard Nimoy ) , Dr. " Bones " McCoy ( DeForest Kelley ) , Mr. Scott ( James Doohan ) , Uhura ( Nichelle Nichols ) , Sulu ( George Takei ) , and Chekov ( Walter Koenig ) -- offer good stories and bad , pajama uniforms and military - appropriate garb , action and adventure , past and future , good and evil , politics and drama , Earth and the farthest reaches of space , old enemies and new friends , timeless literature and classic acting and , most importantly , love and family , all showing what makes Star Trek so special , so memorable , so enchanting , so important , so smart , so exciting , and so meaningful to an incredibly diverse spectrum of humanity that sees in Gene Roddenberry 's fictional world a very real future worth striving for .
To boldly go .
Star Trek : The Motion Picture
Rating : 4/5
The human adventure is just beginning .
A large , mysterious cloud on a direct course towards Earth destroys three Klingon Battle Cruisers and a Federation outpost .
A refitted Enterprise is the only ship within intercept range before the cloud reaches Earth , but the ship is in no condition to either pursue or engage the deadly force .
His experience his greatest ally , Admiral James T. Kirk , former Captain of the Enterprise , successfully lobbies for his return to the Captain 's chair , supplanting Captain Decker ( Stephen Collins ) and reassigning him to the position of Executive Officer .
Despite new and untested engines , a mostly inexperienced crew , and no science officer , the Enterprise sets out to intercept the cloud , the famed vessel perhaps Earth 's last , best chance for survival .
Before 1979 , " Star Trek " fans had enjoyed their heroes on small , fuzzy television screens , the grandeur of both the Enterprise and the many " strange , new worlds " she traveled to and the " new life forms and new civilizations " she encountered perhaps lost in translation from set to screen .
With Director Robert Wise 's ( The Sound of Music ) Star Trek : The Motion Picture , fans were treated to a larger - than - life presentation of the " Star Trek " experience , and indeed , every moment of The Motion Picture plays out like a long , drawn - out love affair with not necessarily the story , but the characters and , most importantly , the Enterprise herself .
In perhaps the film 's best sequence , and indeed one of the finest in the entirety of Trek lore , Mr. Scott flies Kirk to the Enterprise in a small shuttle pod , offering an extended visual tour of the ship from the outside , the camera slowly moving across the hull , saucer section , and nacelles .
The sequence marks the Enterprise 's debut on the silver screen , the vessel 's size and mass captured with both beauty and perspective , the scene featuring men in space suits moving about the exterior of the ship , offering viewers an idea of the enormity of the NCC - 1701 Enterprise .
While Star Trek :
The Motion Picture may be more about its characters and visuals , the story that ties the experience together represents classic " Trek " and also hearkens back to some of the deeper , more involved classic Science Fiction films of previous decades .
Delivering on many of the same ideas as some of the better episodes of the Star Trek may very well exist some two centuries into the future .
Star Trek :
The Motion Picture also features the introduction of the now - iconic Star Trek theme , one perhaps even more recognizable than that of the original series , the music later serving as the opening theme to the " Star Trek : The Next Generation " television series .
Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan
Rating : 5/5
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life .
On a mission to locate a lifeless world on which to test the " Genesis " device , an object capable of instantly transforming a barren world into a habitable paradise , the U.S.S. Reliant 's Captain Terrell ( Paul Winfield ) and Commander Chekov beam down to Ceti Alpha V ( though they believe the planet to be Ceti Alpha VI ) to investigate a singular object which may represent life .
There , they discover the remnants of the Botany Bay , the vessel housing a marooned Khan Noonien Singh ( Ricardo Montalban ) , a 20th Century genetically - engineered superman with an unquenchable thirst for the blood of his old nemesis , Admiral James T. Kirk .
Capable of controlling Terrell and Chekov and commandeering Reliant , Khan sets out to both capture the Genesis device and exact revenge on an unawares Kirk and Enterprise crew .
So named for the character that first appeared in the " Star Trek " episode " Space Seed , " perhaps the most unique feature of The Wrath of Khan is that the film is n't about Khan at all .
His presence lends to the film the dramatic aspect of the picture and serves as the vessel through which the primary plot revolves , but his is of only secondary importance to the thematic core of the film , a study of life and death .
The Wrath of Khan -- from the barren wastelands of Ceti Alpha V to the rebirth of Regula , from the reemergence of a forgotten foe to the loss of an old friend -- deals with life 's most basic yet also most mysterious principle and does so with a level of dramatic and emotional gusto the likes of which few films , and indeed even fewer Science Fiction films , capture at a level at once wholly fundamental , psychological , and spiritual .
Indeed , the core elements of the picture are never obscured behind phaser blasts , torpedo launches , or nebulae ; the continuous reminders of the frailty of life and the permanence of death , of the thin line between functional and useless , the small reminders that hint at what once was , what is , and is to come -- play central to story .
Never does the theme grow tiresome , but quite the opposite .
Repeat viewings serve not to reinforce but rather , with time , redefine the message , its significance only becoming more clear and its implementation more impressive .
Neither decades nor repeat viewings can lessen the emotional impact of the film 's conclusion .
Few pictures stir the emotions quite like The Wrath of Khan , the almost overwhelming issues of death , the creation of life , and the reunification of family cannot help but emotionally drain but also satisfy the viewer .
The best - made of the original ten Star Trek films from a purely technical perspective , The Wrath of Khan 's structural superiority impresses , even when the emotional overtones devour the screen .
Though the quality direction , score , and acting simply cannot overshadow the fundamental theme of the picture , it can no doubt match it on several occasions .
William Shatner 's performance -- particularly in the film 's most emotionally - charged scenes at the end of the film , the first with David and moments later alongside McCoy and Dr. Marcus -- captures a range of emotion rarely seen in film , and for all the critiques of his acting , Shatner delivers , in the latter in particular , a final moment that captures the very essence of the entirety of the film in but a single shot .
Also of note , obviously , is the all - time great performance of Ricardo Montalban , his effort some 15 years after " Space Seed " recapturing not only the overreaching essence of the character but the small mannerisms the defined him in his debut .
Director Nicholas Meyer 's contributions to the film , aside from his sure - handed direction , are well - documented and noted above , but his effort carried the film not just in those moments of thematic import but also through the very well - staged and engaging action pieces , too , that make the film a complete effort .
Finally , James Horner 's remarkable score adds not a finishing touch to the picture but rather a necessary element that both adds to the more militaristic feel of the picture and perfectly reinforces its core themes .
Star Trek III : The Search For Spock
Rating : 3/
5
If I had n't tried , the cost would have been my soul .
Most of its trainees reassigned and the badly - damaged Enterprise returning home from its confrontation with Khan , the skeleton crew laments the loss of their friend , Spock , the ship feeling cold and lifeless in his absence .
Upon their arrival at a star base , Kirk and crew learn that the Genesis planet is at the center of a galactic controversy , and a refitted and repaired Enterprise wo n't be returning to the new world where their colleague has been laid to rest .
In fact , the Enterprise is to be decommissioned , the fate of her crew in question .
When Kirk learns that Spock 's katra or " living spirit " was transferred to Dr. McCoy moments before his death , he , Scotty , Uhura , Chekov , Sulu , and McCoy hijack the Enterprise from space dock in order to return to Genesis to retrieve Spock 's body in hopes of reviving him and transferring his katra back to its rightful body .
Complicating matters is a none - too - happy Starfleet and a Klingon captain named Kruge ( Christopher Lloyd ) bent on securing the secrets of the Genesis device for his own use as an ultimate doomsday weapon .
A sequel not only in number but also in thematic content , The Search For Spock begins soon after the events depicted in The Wrath of Khan .
Unfortunately , this Leonard Nimoy - directed picture does n't exude the same level of excellence as Nicholas Meyer 's masterpiece .
Although sharing with its predecessor a similar theme of life and death , the film tackles the issues more because of a necessary extension to tie the film together with the last rather than as a means of exploring important emotional and psychological undertones , and it does so with a rather heavy - handed approach that removes much of the dramatic and emotional effect from the story .
The film never takes on a sense of urgency in either its action or its drama , and despite some good moments scattered throughout , it never quite gels and generally fizzles just as often as it succeeds .
For every " stealing the Enterprise " sequence there are equally poor moments , many of which are dragged down by less - than - inspired acting from secondary characters , including Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon Kruge ; James Sikking as the Excelsior 's Captain , Styles ; Phillip R. Allen as the Grissom 's Captain , Esteban ; and Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik .
Nevertheless , the movie 's sole purpose -- the resurrection of Spock -- is handled well enough and with just enough believability in the context of both the story and the accepted power of the Genesis device and the events on the Genesis planet .
With fine performances from and banter between the primaries , Star Trek III : The Search for Spock reinforces not only the friendship but the brotherhood of the bridge crew as they put their lives and careers on the line for the sake of one of their own , returning the favor and sacrifice shown by their fallen comrade in The Wrath of Khan .
Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home
Rating : 5/5
Admiral , there be whales here !
With Mr. Spock recovered from his rebirth and once again a fully - capable Starfleet officer , the Enterprise bridge crew votes unanimously to return to Earth to face the charges levied against them .
On their way home in a commandeered Klingon Bird - of - Prey , they learn that a mysterious probe has arrived at Earth , sending out a signal that baffles Starfleet Command and simultaneously causing a string of environmental disasters that threaten Earth 's power reserves .
Spock surmises that the probe 's signal may not be meant for humans , and verifies his theory when he discovers that it is indeed a replication of the songs sung by humpback whales , an extinct species in the 23rd century .
The only solution is to slingshot around the sun in an effort to travel back in time , retrieve a pair of whales , and return them to the 23rd century so they may communicate with the probe before it destroys the planet .
Following the disappointment of The Search for Spock , The Voyage Home delivers a unique and highly entertaining experience quite unlike anything Trek fans had seen before .
Though the time travel angle had been used to great effect in episodes past , including the magnificent " The City on the Edge of Forever , " The Voyage Home frames its story through a comedic angle that sees each cast member deliver a nonstop barrage of humorous and classic lines .
Generally , the film offers little in the way of action , and even the most intense sequences -- a chase through a nuclear vessel or the smuggling of a patient out of a hospital -- plays with a comedic edge and a smart sense of humor that adds levity to the sequences but does n't sacrifice the drama or excitement of the moment .
Enjoying a far better script and acting than its predecessor , The Voyage Home works even when the film takes on more serious tones and issues , including its ecologically - friendly message .
Though the " save the whales " message is delivered bluntly , it never overpowers the film .
Indeed , the comedy often overshadows the plot , and many viewers may even forget the danger 23rd century Earth is facing , even as the crew goes about solving the problem in the 20th century .
Still , the film 's humor steals the show , and The Voyage Home is easily not only the funniest movie in Trek history but also one of the better comedies of the past several decades .
The infectious humor sees McCoy delivering his usual barrage of classic lines ( " off the deep end , Mr. Scott " ) , but as might be expected , Spock 's presence in a world even more illogical than 23rd century Earth and dealing with a populace fond of " colorful " means of expression , steals the show .
His attempts to fit into the 20th century and understand the mannerisms , dialect , and popular culture of the day makes for one humorous scene after another .
Of course , what makes The Voyage Home so memorable for fans is its inclusion of every cast member into the plot , with each enjoying scenes and dialogue that represent the best the film has to offer .
Chekov and Scotty , in particular , dazzle , Chekov's " nuclear wessels " routine and Scotty 's interaction with a classic Macintosh computer marking , perhaps , the film 's most memorable individual scenes .
Star Trek V : The Final Frontier
Rating : 2.5/5
Your pain runs deep .
Shore leave is cut short when the newly - designed Enterprise -- registration NCC - 1701 - A -- is called upon to resolve a hostage crisis on the planet Nimbus III , a world settled jointly in the name of " galactic peace " by the Federation , the Klingons , and the Romulans .
Each of these powers ' emissaries to the world is taken captive by a renegade Vulcan named Sybok ( Laurence Luckinbill ) who devises a scheme to overpower the Federation forces and hijack their starship for the purpose of traveling to the edge of the galaxy in search of God .
Though with only a skeleton crew and plenty of technical problems plaguing the ship , the Enterprise heads to Nimbus III , only to fall prey to Sybok 's plan .
With the Enterprise crew enchanted by Sybok 's mystical ability to ease the burden of deeply - rooted individual pain and suffering , the ship heads towards a world that may be home to God -- with a Klingon Bird - of - Prey in pursuit .
Though The Final Frontier bears the burden as , by consensus , the worst film amongst the six original crew pictures , one must at least give it credit for trying to be both meaningful and exciting .
The film 's foray into exploring deeper philosophical issues both hits the mark and falls well short of it at the same time .
The primary theme of the picture -- that a man is the sum of his experiences rather than the superficialities he shares with those around him -- hits the mark in a rather good sequence that transitions the film between middle and final act .
Kirk reflects that his pains -- those experiences that may hurt on the inside but that have also molded his soul -- make him whole , and sacrificing them sacrifices his entire being .
Unfortunately , The Final Frontier falls flat in its exploration of both the attraction to and the purpose of a higher being .
Although the underlying theme appears to state that a search for God lies not at the edge of the universe but rather inside a man 's heart , it seems lost in the shuffle in the name of a less - than - stellar action sequence with a being that only purports to be God .
Kirk delivers this sound philosophical explanation , stating that God exists perhaps not at the farthest reaches of space but rather in a man 's heart and , by extension anywhere he may be , from the fields of Iowa to the edge of the Great Barrier .
As for the action , it 's partially routine and partially laughable , with a typical Klingon enemy in one corner and a band of poverty - stricken nobodies in the other , the latter led by a renegade Vulcan who both dodges the law and shuns his heritage .
Such a character offers an intriguing juxtaposition to Spock , and indeed , Laurence Luckinbill delivers a steady if not slightly goofy performance , though in context and compared to some of his peers , he 's one of the film 's brighter spots .
For the first time in the series , the primary players -- the Enterprise bridge crew -- each see a noticeable drop in effort , likely due to a script that even Patrick Stewart probably could n't have done anything with .
Fortunately , several scenes do work rather well .
The interaction between Kirk , Spock , and McCoy around the campfire sees the characters at their very best , both poking fun at one another but also showing their kinship and understanding of their differences , differences that serve to strengthen their bond rather than weaken it .
Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country
Rating : 4.5/5
Cry ' havoc ! ' and let slip the dogs of war .
When the Klingon moon Praxis -- a primary energy production facility -- suddenly explodes , the Klingon species finds itself unable to recover and on the verge of extinction .
In an effort to both save the Klingons and bring peace to a long - troubled relationship , the Federation agrees to help the Klingons , assistance that includes dismantling part of the fleet across the neutral zone .
Spock volunteers Kirk , the Enterprise , and her crew to escort the Klingon Chancellor , Gorkon ( David Warner ) , through federation space to a peace conference .
Kirk rejects both the mission and its purpose , proclaiming his distrust of the Klingons .
Nevertheless , the Enterprise carries out her orders , but relationships become further strained when the ship seems to fire on the Klingon Cruiser and a pair of assassins beam aboard the vessel and murder the chancellor .
Kirk and McCoy beam over to the Cruiser to ascertain the situation , are arrested , and ultimately found guilty of the assassination .
Sentenced to life imprisonment on the harsh penal colony of Rura Penthe , the pair must not only struggle to escape but to save their very lives on a daily basis .
Meanwhile , the Enterprise crew vigorously searches for answers in hopes of identifying the true assassins before they have a chance destroy any hopes of achieving peace .
Of all the Trek films , The Undiscovered Country may be the smartest and most fundamentally sound , playing not only with more intellectually - oriented ideas such as political intrigue , but also implementing into the film references to classic literature that play directly into the film 's thematic elements .
The primary theme of the film , reduced to a single line , is uttered several times throughout .
" To be or not to be " reflects a question that defines the story both in its immediate sense and in the context of the consequences of the story that , whatever the outcome , will determine one species ' future in absolute terms , reflecting either its survival or total demise .
The smart script is reflected in the acting , too , with the primary cast returning to form after a disappointing outing in The Final Frontier .
Adding tremendous weight to the film is Christopher Plummer ( The Sound of Music ) , whose performance as the Klingon General Chang is every bit as good as Ricardo Montalban 's effort as Khan .
Plummer immerses himself in the role , playing off the classical themes of the picture and rising to the occasion in every scene , be it the dining sequence or his delivery of the classic " cry ' havoc ! ' " from Shakespeare 's Julius Ceaser , the line still sending chills up the spine with each viewing .
Moreover , The Undiscovered Country enjoys the best pure action of any Trek film since The Wrath of Khan .
Nicholas Meyer , returning once again to direct the crew for their final voyage together , shows why he remains the benchmark
Trek director , both his films encompassing the entire spectrum of moviemaking magic , delivering smartly - written characters ; a sound plot with under - and overtones reflecting upon timely social , political , and human characteristics ; well - staged action ; fantastic acting ; and wonderful pacing .
His films reflect both Trek and Science Fiction in general at its very best , and with a hand in the writing of The Voyage Home , his stamp may be found on the three best original crew pictures .
Finally , the film provides a fitting send - off for the crew , with a reference to Peter Pan , bringing Meyer 's themes of life and death that surround the two films he 's directed full - circle , followed by each cast member " signing off " for the last time , together , across a star field .
" Star Trek " lived up to its promise , boldly going where no television series had gone before , the forward - thinking and enormously popular program from the 1960s spawning eleven feature films , an animated spinoff show , four additional live action television programs spanning 25 seasons , countless novels and fan fiction works , attics full of toys , dozens of conventions , and legions of fans .

So named for the character that first appeared in the " Star Trek " episode " Space Seed , " perhaps the most unique feature ofis that the film is n't about Khan at all .
His presence lends to the film the dramatic aspect of the picture and serves as the vessel through which the primary plot revolves , but his is of only secondary importance to the thematic core of the film , a study of life and death .-- from the barren wastelands of Ceti Alpha V to the rebirth of Regula , from the reemergence of a forgotten foe to the loss of an old friend -- deals with life 's most basic yet also most mysterious principle and does so with a level of dramatic and emotional gusto the likes of which few films , and indeed even fewer Science Fiction films , capture at a level at once wholly fundamental , psychological , and spiritual .
Indeed , the core elements of the picture are never obscured behind phaser blasts , torpedo launches , or nebulae ; the continuous reminders of the frailty of life and the permanence of death , of the thin line between functional and useless , the small reminders that hint at what once was , what is , and is to come -- play central to story .
Never does the theme grow tiresome , but quite the opposite .
Repeat viewings serve not to reinforce but rather , with time , redefine the message , its significance only becoming more clear and its implementation more impressive .
Neither decades nor repeat viewings can lessen the emotional impact of the film 's conclusion .
Few pictures stir the emotions quite like , the almost overwhelming issues of death , the creation of life , and the reunification of family cannot help but emotionally drain but also satisfy the viewer .
The best - made of the original tenfilms from a purely technical perspective , 's structural superiority impresses , even when the emotional overtones devour the screen .
Though the quality direction , score , and acting simply cannot overshadow the fundamental theme of the picture , it can no doubt match it on several occasions .
William Shatner 's performance -- particularly in the film 's most emotionally - charged scenes at the end of the film , the first with David and moments later alongside McCoy and Dr. Marcus -- captures a range of emotion rarely seen in film , and for all the critiques of his acting , Shatner delivers , in the latter in particular , a final moment that captures the very essence of the entirety of the film in but a single shot .
Also of note , obviously , is the all - time great performance of Ricardo Montalban , his effort some 15 years after " Space Seed " recapturing not only the overreaching essence of the character but the small mannerisms the defined him in his debut .
Director Nicholas Meyer 's contributions to the film , aside from his sure - handed direction , are well - documented and noted above , but his effort carried the film not just in those moments of thematic import but also through the very well - staged and engaging action pieces , too , that make the film a complete effort .
Finally , James Horner 's remarkable score adds not a finishing touch to the picture but rather a necessary element that both adds to the more militaristic feel of the picture and perfectly reinforces its core themes .
Most of its trainees reassigned and the badly - damagedreturning home from its confrontation with Khan , the skeleton crew laments the loss of their friend , Spock , the ship feeling cold and lifeless in his absence .
Upon their arrival at a star base , Kirk and crew learn that the Genesis planet is at the center of a galactic controversy , and a refitted and repairedwo n't be returning to the new world where their colleague has been laid to rest .
In fact , theis to be decommissioned , the fate of her crew in question .
When Kirk learns that Spock ' sor " living spirit " was transferred to Dr. McCoy moments before his death , he , Scotty , Uhura , Chekov , Sulu , and McCoy hijack thefrom space dock in order to return to Genesis to retrieve Spock 's body in hopes of reviving him and transferring hisback to its rightful body .
Complicating matters is a none - too - happy Starfleet and a Klingon captain named Kruge ( Christopher Lloyd ) bent on securing the secrets of the Genesis device for his own use as an ultimate doomsday weapon .
A sequel not only in number but also in thematic content , begins soon after the events depicted in .
Unfortunately , this Leonard Nimoy - directed picture does n't exude the same level of excellence as Nicholas Meyer 's masterpiece .
Although sharing with its predecessor a similar theme of life and death , the film tackles the issues more because of a necessary extension to tie the film together with the last rather than as a means of exploring important emotional and psychological undertones , and it does so with a rather heavy - handed approach that removes much of the dramatic and emotional effect from the story .
The film never takes on a sense of urgency in either its action or its drama , and despite some good moments scattered throughout , it never quite gels and generally fizzles just as often as it succeeds .
For every " stealing the " sequence there are equally poor moments , many of which are dragged down by less - than - inspired acting from secondary characters , including Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon Kruge ; James Sikking as the 's Captain , Styles ; Phillip R. Allen as the 's Captain , Esteban ; and Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik .
Nevertheless , the movie 's sole purpose -- the resurrection of Spock -- is handled well enough and with just enough believability in the context of both the story and the accepted power of the Genesis device and the events on the Genesis planet .
With fine performances from and banter between the primaries , reinforces not only the friendship but the brotherhood of the bridge crew as they put their lives and careers on the line for the sake of one of their own , returning the favor and sacrifice shown by their fallen comrade inWith Mr. Spock recovered from his rebirth and once again a fully - capable Starfleet officer , thebridge crew votes unanimously to return to Earth to face the charges levied against them .
On their way home in a commandeered Klingon Bird - of - Prey , they learn that a mysterious probe has arrived at Earth , sending out a signal that baffles Starfleet Command and simultaneously causing a string of environmental disasters that threaten Earth 's power reserves .
Spock surmises that the probe 's signal may not be meant for humans , and verifies his theory when he discovers that it is indeed a replication of the songs sung by humpback whales , an extinct species in the 23rd century .
The only solution is to slingshot around the sun in an effort to travel back in time , retrieve a pair of whales , and return them to the 23rd century so they may communicate with the probe before it destroys the planet .
Following the disappointment ofdelivers a unique and highly entertaining experience quite unlike anythingfans had seen before .
Though the time travel angle had been used to great effect in episodes past , including the magnificent " The City on the Edge of Forever , " frames its story through a comedic angle that sees each cast member deliver a nonstop barrage of humorous and classic lines .
Generally , the film offers little in the way of action , and even the most intense sequences -- a chase through a nuclear vessel or the smuggling of a patient out of a hospital -- plays with a comedic edge and a smart sense of humor that adds levity to the sequences but does n't sacrifice the drama or excitement of the moment .
Enjoying a far better script and acting than its predecessor , works even when the film takes on more serious tones and issues , including its ecologically - friendly message .
Though the " save the whales " message is delivered bluntly , it never overpowers the film .
Indeed , the comedy often overshadows the plot , and many viewers may even forget the danger 23rd century Earth is facing , even as the crew goes about solving the problem in the 20th century .
Still , the film 's humor steals the show , andis easily not only the funniest movie inhistory but also one of the better comedies of the past several decades .
The infectious humor sees McCoy delivering his usual barrage of classic lines ( " off the deep end , Mr. Scott " ) , but as might be expected , Spock 's presence in a world even more illogical than 23rd century Earth and dealing with a populace fond of " colorful " means of expression , steals the show .
His attempts to fit into the 20th century and understand the mannerisms , dialect , and popular culture of the day makes for one humorous scene after another .
Of course , what makesso memorable for fans is its inclusion of every cast member into the plot , with each enjoying scenes and dialogue that represent the best the film has to offer .
Chekov and Scotty , in particular , dazzle , Chekov's " nuclear wessels " routine and Scotty 's interaction with a classic Macintosh computer marking , perhaps , the film 's most memorable individual scenes .
Shore leave is cut short when the newly - designed -- registration NCC - 1701 - A -- is called upon to resolve a hostage crisis on the planet Nimbus III , a world settled jointly in the name of " galactic peace " by the Federation , the Klingons , and the Romulans .
Each of these powers ' emissaries to the world is taken captive by a renegade Vulcan named Sybok ( Laurence Luckinbill ) who devises a scheme to overpower the Federation forces and hijack their starship for the purpose of traveling to the edge of the galaxy in search of God .
Though with only a skeleton crew and plenty of technical problems plaguing the ship , theheads to Nimbus III , only to fall prey to Sybok 's plan .
With thecrew enchanted by Sybok 's mystical ability to ease the burden of deeply - rooted individual pain and suffering , the ship heads towards a world that may be home to God -- with a Klingon Bird - of - Prey in pursuit .
Thoughbears the burden as , by consensus , the worst film amongst the six original crew pictures , one must at least give it credit for trying to be both meaningful and exciting .
The film 's foray into exploring deeper philosophical issues both hits the mark and falls well short of it at the same time .
The primary theme of the picture -- that a man is the sum of his experiences rather than the superficialities he shares with those around him -- hits the mark in a rather good sequence that transitions the film between middle and final act .
Kirk reflects that his pains -- those experiences that may hurt on the inside but that have also molded his soul -- make him whole , and sacrificing them sacrifices his entire being .
Unfortunately , falls flat in its exploration of both the attraction to and the purpose of a higher being .
Although the underlying theme appears to state that a search for God lies not at the edge of the universe but rather inside a man 's heart , it seems lost in the shuffle in the name of a less - than - stellar action sequence with a being that only purports to be God .
Kirk delivers this sound philosophical explanation , stating that God exists perhaps not at the farthest reaches of space but rather in a man 's heart and , by extension anywhere he may be , from the fields of Iowa to the edge of the Great Barrier .
As for the action , it 's partially routine and partially laughable , with a typical Klingon enemy in one corner and a band of poverty - stricken nobodies in the other , the latter led by a renegade Vulcan who both dodges the law and shuns his heritage .
Such a character offers an intriguing juxtaposition to Spock , and indeed , Laurence Luckinbill delivers a steady if not slightly goofy performance , though in context and compared to some of his peers , he 's one of the film 's brighter spots .
For the first time in the series , the primary players -- thebridge crew -- each see a noticeable drop in effort , likely due to a script that even Patrick Stewart probably could n't have done anything with .
Fortunately , several scenes do work rather well .
The interaction between Kirk , Spock , and McCoy around the campfire sees the characters at their very best , both poking fun at one another but also showing their kinship and understanding of their differences , differences that serve to strengthen their bond rather than weaken it .
When the Klingon moon Praxis -- a primary energy production facility -- suddenly explodes , the Klingon species finds itself unable to recover and on the verge of extinction .
In an effort to both save the Klingons and bring peace to a long - troubled relationship , the Federation agrees to help the Klingons , assistance that includes dismantling part of the fleet across the neutral zone .
Spock volunteers Kirk , the , and her crew to escort the Klingon Chancellor , Gorkon ( David Warner ) , through federation space to a peace conference .
Kirk rejects both the mission and its purpose , proclaiming his distrust of the Klingons .
Nevertheless , thecarries out her orders , but relationships become further strained when the ship seems to fire on the Klingon Cruiser and a pair of assassins beam aboard the vessel and murder the chancellor .
Kirk and McCoy beam over to the Cruiser to ascertain the situation , are arrested , and ultimately found guilty of the assassination .
Sentenced to life imprisonment on the harsh penal colony of Rura Penthe , the pair must not only struggle to escape but to save their very lives on a daily basis .
Meanwhile , thecrew vigorously searches for answers in hopes of identifying the true assassins before they have a chance destroy any hopes of achieving peace .
Of all thefilms , may be the smartest and most fundamentally sound , playing not only with more intellectually - oriented ideas such as political intrigue , but also implementing into the film references to classic literature that play directly into the film 's thematic elements .
The primary theme of the film , reduced to a single line , is uttered several times throughout .
" To be or not to be " reflects a question that defines the story both in its immediate sense and in the context of the consequences of the story that , whatever the outcome , will determine one species ' future in absolute terms , reflecting either its survival or total demise .
The smart script is reflected in the acting , too , with the primary cast returning to form after a disappointing outing in .
Adding tremendous weight to the film is Christopher Plummer ( ) , whose performance as the Klingon General Chang is every bit as good as Ricardo Montalban 's effort as Khan .
Plummer immerses himself in the role , playing off the classical themes of the picture and rising to the occasion in every scene , be it the dining sequence or his delivery of the classic " cry ' havoc ! ' " from Shakespeare's , the line still sending chills up the spine with each viewing .
Moreover , enjoys the best pure action of anyfilm since .
Nicholas Meyer , returning once again to direct the crew for their final voyage together , shows why he remains the benchmarkdirector , both his films encompassing the entire spectrum of moviemaking magic , delivering smartly - written characters ; a sound plot with under - and overtones reflecting upon timely social , political , and human characteristics ; well - staged action ; fantastic acting ; and wonderful pacing .
His films reflect bothand Science Fiction in general at its very best , and with a hand in the writing of , his stamp may be found on the three best original crew pictures .
Finally , the film provides a fitting send - off for the crew , with a reference to Peter Pan , bringing Meyer 's themes of life and death that surround the two films he 's directed full - circle , followed by each cast member " signing off " for the last time , together , across a star field .
Star Trek : Original Motion Picture Collection Blu-ray , Video Quality
Star Trek : The Motion Picture
Rating : 4/5
Star Trek : The Motion Picture warps onto Blu-ray with a generally stunning 1080 p , 2.35:1 - framed transfer .
One of the first things noticed is the intricate detail on the Klingon cruisers seen at the beginning of the film .
In short , they look fantastic , all of the various protrusions and textures seen on the models now visible in splendid detail thanks to the 1080 p resolution .
The interiors of these same vessels take on a hazy , soft appearance , a stark contrast to the highly - detailed and nicely - lit exterior shots .
Once the film moves its focus to the Enterprise , the film 's fundamental set of visuals -- the ship , the crew members , the uniforms , and the small intricacies on board the Enterprise -- generally showcase high levels of visible detail that provide plenty of " wow " moments throughout the transfer .
The inside of the Enterprise in particular , with its clean , sleek , silver and white appearance , not to mention the gray , white , blue , and mustard - colored crew uniforms , look better than ever .
Star Trek :
The Motion Picture does feature a few drawbacks , though none seem particularly bothersome taken in the context of the original elements .
Various shots appear soft and blurry while others look sharp as a tack , though some of this is due to Director Wise 's various techniques or some of the more special - effects - heavy shots .
Indeed , many effects shots appear littered with dirt and debris , though such is to be expected of such shots from a film of the era .
Also visible is a bit of blocking in some of the blacks , though the problem is never all that noticeable .
The film also looks smooth throughout , without much at all in the way of noise save , again , for some of the more complex effects - heavy shots .
When all is said and done , though , Star Trek : The Motion Picture looks fantastic , certainly the best home presentation the film has ever seen .
Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan
Rating : 4.5/5
Presented in a 1080 p , 2.35:1 - framed transfer , The Wrath of Khan has never looked better for home viewing .
The transfer enjoys a slight layer of grain , spiking at times but remaining steady and unobtrusive throughout much of the film .
The transfer enjoys startling clarity compared to any and all previous home video transfers , with both foreground and background objects revealing details never seen to such an extent .
Particularly impressive are the many printed signs throughout the film and the instrument panels and readouts on the bridges of both Enterprise and Reliant , all far sharper and readable thanks to the improved resolution offered by the Blu-ray transfer .
A few scenes take on a soft look , even a few intercut with sharp scenes that define the majority of the image .
A few effects shots see some scattered debris , and the 1080 p resolution reveals a few leftover remnants from the assembly of the shots , but never to an intrusive extent .
Flesh tones appear normal and blacks tend towards a generally dark and inky hue .
Paramount delivers a suitably high quality transfer for the flagship film in this collection .
Star Trek III : The Search For Spock
Rating : 3/
5
Coming off of two rather impressive visual releases in The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan , The Search for Spock , much like the movie itself , disappoints .
Presented in 1080 p high definition and framed inside a 2.35:1 window , the image appears lifeless and incredibly smooth , though very clear .
Colors range from natural to incredibly bright and vibrant ; the Klingon Bird - of - Prey appears an overpowering shade of neon green , and the red Starfleet uniforms sometimes appear to be cranked a shade or two above optimal .
The 1080 p imagery does reveal the remnants of some effects shots , placing bright boxes around objects against the darkness of space , though the effect is minimal in most instances .
Also , while the majority of the image is sharp , some softness creeps in from time to time .
The major drawback , though , comes in the form of noise reduction , where backgrounds that should be swirling with grain often appear static , lending to the film a phony , flat appearance .
Though faces sometimes look like plastic , flesh tones never waver too far from optimal , and blacks levels are decent .
While this Blu-ray release of The Search For Spock looks better than any previous home video release , it pales next to its predecessors .
Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home
Rating : 3.5/5
Faring slightly better than The Search For Spock but not as good as The Wrath of Khan or The Motion Picture , The Voyage Home features a decent but slightly underwhelming image .
Once again , noise reduction appears to be the primary culprit .
Backgrounds where one might expect a swirling grain field appear static , such backgrounds almost looking frozen in time and devoid of life .
A very small amount of blocking and banding also appear in several shots .
Nevertheless , the image enjoys a bit more depth than its predecessor .
The hazy interiors of the Klingon Bird - of - Prey look fine , with background details adequate under both the haze and the utilitarian color scheme .
The ship 's exterior takes on a slightly more natural shade of green here , too .
The image tends to look just fine in the bright , daytime exterior San Francisco shots , where it sports a fair bit of depth and vibrancy .
Overall , colors offer a more natural tone while skin shades and blacks deliver suitable visuals .
The Voyage Home looks fine , but seems like it could be a notch or two better should a future release be given a bit more of a thorough effort .
Star Trek V : The Final Frontier
Rating : 3.5/5
Neither the best nor the worst transfer of he bunch , The Final Frontier delivers a mostly satisfying 1080 p , 2.35:1 - framed transfer .
Detail ranges from adequate to exceptional ; Sybok 's woven garb as seen at the beginning of the film on the dusty planes of Nimbus III showcases a nice , palpable texture .
Likewise , the rockface of El Capitan , which Kirk is seen climbing at the beginning of the film , shows adequate detail in close - up shots , and exterior and up - close shots of the Klingon Bird - of - Prey reveal extraordinary details in the ship 's outer hull and wing - mounted weapons .
The transfer appears rather soft in several sequences , though the majority appears mostly sharp and clear .
Backgrounds do n't appear quite as static in this film as in its pair of predecessors , though there is virtually no grain to be seen here , either .
The print exhibits small speckles here and there , too .
Flesh tones tend to remain strong but blacks often tend towards a too - bright , slightly grayish appearance .
For the film likely to get the least playtime of the six , this one delivers a transfer somewhat better than expected of it .
Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country
Rating : 3.5/5
The Undiscovered Country premieres on Blu-ray with a 1080 p , 2.35:1 - framed transfer .
Like the previous few films , this one delivers a suitably good transfer , but one that may have benefited from a bit more tender loving care .
The transfer reveals generally strong details and fine colors , though it lacks personality , appearing smooth and somewhat artificial , with film grain only seen minimally and in places .
A few shots exhibit some unsightly shimmering and jagged edges on objects .
Flesh tones appear fine , and blacks , while stable , sometimes appear a bit on the gray end of the spectrum .
Effects shots hold up well .
Though easily the best the film has looked for home viewing , it still exhibits some pesky issues that prevent it from being a definitive release .

Star Trek : Original Motion Picture Collection Blu-ray , Audio Quality
Star Trek : The Motion Picture
Rating : 4/5
Star Trek :
The Motion Picture has never sounded better for home consumption than it does with this full - fledged Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack .
Jerry Goldsmith 's score , particularly the overture , features a nice , inviting feel , the orchestral music playing smoothly and pleasantly while flowing cleanly from the front channels , the experience recalling the sensation of a live performance .
Likewise , the classic " Trek " theme sparkles , each instrument in the arsenal heard distinctly , an all - encompassing effort that emanates from both the front and the rear channels .
Sound effects -- communication chatter , background voices and ambience inside Starfleet Headquarters , or the humming of the Enterprise 's engine as heard from the ship 's engineering section -- may be heard , and in some cases felt , all about the soundstage to wonderful effect .
Sound swoops around the listening area , too .
The cloud 's attacks on the Klingon vessels allows sound effects to rush from one speaker to the next , offering an almost liquid ambiance .
The electrical impulses emanating from the V'ger cloud spread out throughout the soundstage , and the many beeps and thumps from V'Ger seemingly emanate from every speaker in the 7.1 configuration with quite the presence and plenty of LFE support .
Along with fine dialogue reproduction , Star Trek :
The Motion Picture makes for a fantastic listen , both the score and the many distinct and memorable sound effects playing most impressively via this quality soundtrack .
Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan
Rating : 3.5/5
Presented with a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack , The Wrath of Khan delivers a solid if not slightly feeble audio experience .
James Horner 's score , from the more reflective of pieces to the louder action - oriented segments , plays with grace across the front , though perhaps not featuring the utmost in either clarity or volume .
Once the film begins with the action sequences -- the opening Kobayashi Maru sequence , for instance -- the track never produces much in the way of low - end heft , explosions sounding slightly more uninspired than anticipated .
However , the first time the Reliant is seen cruising through space , the soundtrack does well to send a bit of a rumble across the soundstage as the vessel seemingly flies through the room .
Surround activity picks up a bit during the exterior Ceti Alpha V sequences as wind and debris fly audibly across the soundstage .
The lossless track does reveal some minor nuances scattered here and there that seem to have been lost in the shuffle of previous releases .
Dialogue reproduction suffices , though a few scenes exhibit a slightly harsh edge , though hardly of any level of troubling import .
In summation , the track delivers almost as expected of a film with a sound design that impresses in context but fizzles next to the latest and greatest offerings .
Star Trek III : The Search For Spock
Rating : 4/5
Once again presented in a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless format , The Search For Spock enjoys a solid listening experience .
The music accompanying the opening credits features fine clarity and strong rear - channel support , the whole experience recalling a live orchestral performance .
Interior Enterprise shots enjoy the humming of the engines in the background , the effect increased when the action shifts to the engineering section .
Sound often plays with a heft and room - filling presence ; a de-cloaking Bird - of - Prey features thunderous lows and a spacious presence that makes fine use of every speaker .
Likewise , the chaotic shifting climate of the Genesis planet feature booming lows and a wide soundstage .
Dialogue generally impresses , though a few lines sound garbled .
This is a solid all - around effort .
Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home
Rating : 4/5
Presented with a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack , The Voyage Home delivers a pleasant and robust sonic experience .
Like the other films in the set , this one features a clear and precise delivery of the theme that plays over the opening credits , offering crisp highs , a solid midrange , and deep lows .
The music also enjoys strong rear - channel support , and its breezy , easygoing flair sets the stage nicely for the lighthearted romp to follow .
With little in the way of action , this track relies more on atmospherics , music , and dialogue , and no one element falters .
Most importantly , dialogue reproduction impresses , and minor sound effects -- the transporter beam , for example -- features a good sense of space and depth , the effect spilling across the entirety of the front soundstage .
The Voyage Home may be the least aggressive of the six films in this collection , but its soundtrack is no worse for it .
Star Trek V : The Final Frontier
Rating : 4.5/5
The Final Frontier features a powerful Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack .
Surprisingly active , boomy , and spacious , the mix never disappoints during the action sequences .
Sound effects throughout the film play with both heft and volume , all flowing effortlessly about the soundstage .
The track enjoys excellent clarity across the front , be it in explosions or music , but the track also features plenty of rear channel activity , too .
The battle outside of Paradise City , where both phasers and cruder weapons are fired from every corner of the soundstage , engulfs the listener with a steady , loud , and aggressive presentation .
As with the previous outings , music excels , too , that accompanying the film 's title sequence once again recalling the feel of a live orchestral performance .
Rounded out by strong dialogue reproduction , this soundtrack delivers even when the movie does not .
Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country
Rating : 4.5/5
Yet again , Paramount offers a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack for The Undiscovered Country .
The Praxis explosion packs a nice wallop , the waves flowing through the soundstage from front - to - back with a noticeable presence and feel .
Likewise , the sounds heard inside the various starships play all over the soundstage with subtle atmospherics , engulfing the listener and spilling out of every speaker and at just the right volume so as not to overwhelm the sense or create a phony - sounding environment .
The raucous trial of Kirk and McCoy features chanting Klingons pounding and shouting from every speaker , and in these scenes the track delivers a fabulous echoing effect in the cavernous trial chamber as Chang prosecutes the pair of Federation officers .
Also featuring strong dialogue reproduction , The Undiscovered Country offers up arguably the best soundtrack in this collection .
has never sounded better for home consumption than it does with this full - fledged Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack .
Jerry Goldsmith 's score , particularly the overture , features a nice , inviting feel , the orchestral music playing smoothly and pleasantly while flowing cleanly from the front channels , the experience recalling the sensation of a live performance .
Likewise , the classic " Trek " theme sparkles , each instrument in the arsenal heard distinctly , an all - encompassing effort that emanates from both the front and the rear channels .
Sound effects -- communication chatter , background voices and ambience inside Starfleet Headquarters , or the humming of the 's engine as heard from the ship 's engineering section -- may be heard , and in some cases felt , all about the soundstage to wonderful effect .
Sound swoops around the listening area , too .
The cloud 's attacks on the Klingon vessels allows sound effects to rush from one speaker to the next , offering an almost liquid ambiance .
The electrical impulses emanating from the V'ger cloud spread out throughout the soundstage , and the many beeps and thumps from V'Ger seemingly emanate from every speaker in the 7.1 configuration with quite the presence and plenty of LFE support .
Along with fine dialogue reproduction , makes for a fantastic listen , both the score and the many distinct and memorable sound effects playing most impressively via this quality soundtrack .
Presented with a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack , delivers a solid if not slightly feeble audio experience .
James Horner 's score , from the more reflective of pieces to the louder action - oriented segments , plays with grace across the front , though perhaps not featuring the utmost in either clarity or volume .
Once the film begins with the action sequences -- the opening Kobayashi Maru sequence , for instance -- the track never produces much in the way of low - end heft , explosions sounding slightly more uninspired than anticipated .
However , the first time theis seen cruising through space , the soundtrack does well to send a bit of a rumble across the soundstage as the vessel seemingly flies through the room .
Surround activity picks up a bit during the exterior Ceti Alpha V sequences as wind and debris fly audibly across the soundstage .
The lossless track does reveal some minor nuances scattered here and there that seem to have been lost in the shuffle of previous releases .
Dialogue reproduction suffices , though a few scenes exhibit a slightly harsh edge , though hardly of any level of troubling import .
In summation , the track delivers almost as expected of a film with a sound design that impresses in context but fizzles next to the latest and greatest offerings .
Once again presented in a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless format , enjoys a solid listening experience .
The music accompanying the opening credits features fine clarity and strong rear - channel support , the whole experience recalling a live orchestral performance .
Interiorshots enjoy the humming of the engines in the background , the effect increased when the action shifts to the engineering section .
Sound often plays with a heft and room - filling presence ; a de-cloaking Bird - of - Prey features thunderous lows and a spacious presence that makes fine use of every speaker .
Likewise , the chaotic shifting climate of the Genesis planet feature booming lows and a wide soundstage .
Dialogue generally impresses , though a few lines sound garbled .
This is a solid all - around effort .
Presented with a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack , delivers a pleasant and robust sonic experience .
Like the other films in the set , this one features a clear and precise delivery of the theme that plays over the opening credits , offering crisp highs , a solid midrange , and deep lows .
The music also enjoys strong rear - channel support , and its breezy , easygoing flair sets the stage nicely for the lighthearted romp to follow .
With little in the way of action , this track relies more on atmospherics , music , and dialogue , and no one element falters .
Most importantly , dialogue reproduction impresses , and minor sound effects -- the transporter beam , for example -- features a good sense of space and depth , the effect spilling across the entirety of the front soundstage .
may be the least aggressive of the six films in this collection , but its soundtrack is no worse for it .
features a powerful Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack .
Surprisingly active , boomy , and spacious , the mix never disappoints during the action sequences .
Sound effects throughout the film play with both heft and volume , all flowing effortlessly about the soundstage .
The track enjoys excellent clarity across the front , be it in explosions or music , but the track also features plenty of rear channel activity , too .
The battle outside of Paradise City , where both phasers and cruder weapons are fired from every corner of the soundstage , engulfs the listener with a steady , loud , and aggressive presentation .
As with the previous outings , music excels , too , that accompanying the film 's title sequence once again recalling the feel of a live orchestral performance .
Rounded out by strong dialogue reproduction , this soundtrack delivers even when the movie does not .
Yet again , Paramount offers a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack for .
The Praxis explosion packs a nice wallop , the waves flowing through the soundstage from front - to - back with a noticeable presence and feel .
Likewise , the sounds heard inside the various starships play all over the soundstage with subtle atmospherics , engulfing the listener and spilling out of every speaker and at just the right volume so as not to overwhelm the sense or create a phony - sounding environment .
The raucous trial of Kirk and McCoy features chanting Klingons pounding and shouting from every speaker , and in these scenes the track delivers a fabulous echoing effect in the cavernous trial chamber as Chang prosecutes the pair of Federation officers .
Also featuring strong dialogue reproduction , offers up arguably the best soundtrack in this collection .

More than 1,300 girls in the United Kingdom have experienced negative reactions to the government - mandated Cervarix vaccine for the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , according to adverse events reports collected from doctors by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) .
" When they introduced this new vaccine , we had major concerns about its safety , " said Jackie Fletcher of Jabs , a support group for those negatively affected by vaccines .
" The current statistics detailing adverse reactions -- including cases of epilepsy and convulsions -- bears out that we were right to be concerned .
" Cervarix , manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline , inoculates patients against strains 16 and 18 of HPV , which are believed to be responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancer cases .
The British government began a program to vaccinate all secondary school girls in September 2008 , and 700,000 have received the injections so far .
The government 's plan is to have all girls under the age of 18 vaccinated by 2011 .
Critics have objected , however , that the government based its decision on studies of women under the age of 26 , rather than studies conducted on school - age girls .
In addition , while the vaccine has been shown to prevent against HPV infection in the short term , there is no evidence of its long - term efficacy or that it actually lowers cancer rates .
The MHRA reports show a total of 2,891 adverse events reported in 1,340 girls .
The majority were minor and short - lived problems , such as swelling , rashes , pain or mild allergies to the vaccine .
A number of cases were more severe , however , including 20 cases of blurred vision , four cases of convulsions , one case of seizures and one epileptic fit .
Five cases of partial paralysis were reported , including Bell 's palsy ( face ) , Guillain - Barre syndrome ( legs ) , hyopaesthesia ( loss of sense of touch ) and hemiparesis ( severe weakening or paralysis of half the body ) .
" The government needs to look at the future of this program given the number of side - effects coming through , " Fletcher said .

Imagine if someone came into your neighborhood , blew up a few buildings , took what they wanted and dumped the toxic debris into your drinking water .
What would you do ?
Maria Gunnoe and many of the communities in Appalachian West Virginia are dealing with exactly that question .
While coal mining has long been important to the regionâ€™s economy , Mountaintop Removal mining over the past decade has caused large - scale environmental devastation and dramatically damaged local water .
Everyone downstream from where that mountaintop removal site is gets flooded and their wells are contaminated .
My well is contaminated .
Canâ€™t drink my water .
â€ “ Maria ’s Story
photo by barrenera
Mountaintop removal coal mining blasts up to 1000 feet off the top of a mountain to expose the coal veins .
Rock and dirt are dumped into the adjacent valleys , valley fills , often burying natural water systems .
Long after the coal is gone , surrounding communities are left with poisoned water supplies and remain threatened by rock slides and major floods .
Everything around these strip sites is constantly erodinâ€™ , and thereâ€™s always water runninâ€™ in all different directions .
The DEP calls that â€œstreams meandering .â€ 
They were never streams before â€ “ now theyâ€™re streams !
Â — Maria ’s Story
Without natural plants and soil layers the area cannot hold water and flooding becomes frequent and destructive .
Coal companies often categorize these floods as â€œacts of God.â€ 
It is estimated that almost 500 mountaintops have been removed , polluting 2,000 miles of waterways .
Much of the community water is now toxic and undrinkable .
A former mountaintop removal mine now has 2.8 billion gallons of â€œcoal slurry , â€ full of chemicals like arsenic , lead , mercury and chromium , that residents fear could flood onto the elementary school just 400 yards beneath a dam in the event of heavy rains .
Children routinely come home sick .
Gunnoeâ€™s own house stands beneath a valley fill with 2 toxic ponds polluted with mine waste from mine run-off .
People around here are swigginâ€™ down contaminated water all day long , every day .
The health affects are sometimes long - term .
Itâ€™s usually pancreatic cancer or some kind of liver disease , or kidney stones , gall stones â€ “ digestive tract problemsâ€ ¦
Why do they expect us to just take this ?
â€ “ Maria ’s Story
Easy , cheap valley fills have not always been ok .
Bush - era administrative regulation basically said it was fine to dump the debris in and around streams if alternatives were too expensive , and that it was alright to use the cheapest option to fill in what was left of the top of the mountain .
All of this was a dramatic blow to the Regan - era â€ œ1983 ruleâ€ that did not allow mountain debris to be deposited within 100 feet of any valley waterway .
Â President Obama is working for new legislation to reinstate this rule and strengthen the existing Clean Water Act and put Federal money behind clean up and protection effort , in part because of Gunnoeâ€™s activism .
Her activism has not been welcomed by local officials and coal mining employees .
She reports that her family is frequently harassed and tells this story about government response :
One time I was flooded with no rainâ€ ¦ blue skies and just barely any clouds at all in the skyâ€¦ and the stream coming through my property just came up .
It came up about three feet .
By the time I called the DEP [ WV Department of Environmental Protection ] and made the proper complaints and reports , the water had subsided .
The DEP said there was no evidence of what had happened and therefore it was OK.â€ â€“ Maria ’s Story
Gunnoe has been a tireless advocate for her community –
Her work has included organizing monthly county meetings , trainings on how to read mining permits , media awareness action and nonviolent protests in addition to creating groups to monitor coal companies and report illegal acts and toxic spills .
She is currently advocating for the Clean Water Protection Act and a reinstatement of the â€œ1983â€  buffer zone , restricting valley fills from 100 feet around streams and rivers .
She was recently awarded the 2009 Goldman Environmental Prize — the largest global award for grassroots environmental activism .
Founded in 1990 by Richard and Rhoda Goldman , The Goldman Environmental prize has grown to honor local environmental heroes around the world for creating positive change through community action .
In their own words :
The award comes with a â€œno strings attachedâ€ $ 150,000 prize .
What will she do with the money ?
According to a recent interview , she hopes to have enough left over after paying the taxes to finance a pipeline for city water access .
That will cost $ 31,000 .
For now she spends around $ 250 a month buying clean water from stores .
Maria Gunnoeâ€™s passionate activism has been documented in the Mountain Top Removal documentary by Haw River Films , and water issues like hers from around the world are investigated in the film Blue Gold by Sam Bozzo .
Since 2004 she has been working with the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition , fighting for clean water and environmental sustainability for her community and future generations in Appalachia .
The streams that go by me here right now are the headwaters of the streams all over the Eastern United States .
Whether people realize it or not , everyoneâ€™s downstream from this .

Mininova , one of the largest BitTorrent sites on the Internet , will launch a new feature today that will help artists , labels and other content producers to generate revenue .
The Dutch record label ' Beep ! Beep ! ' is one of the first to try the new feature , which allows content producers to add ' shopping links ' to their free torrents .
Mininova ’s content distribution platform has been around since 2007 .
All files published on the content distribution platform are both tracked and seeded by Mininova .
This ensures high download speeds while the publishers do n’t have to worry about seeding the files themselves .
The service is mostly used by independent artists , but record labels are also interested .
Today , the Dutch record label Beep !
Beep !
announced a partnership with Mininova , which will see the site distribute the label ’s complete discography for free under a Creative Commons license .
BitTorrent has proven to be an ideal marketing tool for musicians , writers and other creative minds who want to promote their work and engage fans .
Up until now , though , there was no easy solution to monetize their releases .
A new feature from Mininova changes that , as it allows content publishers to offer their newly born fans the option to buy related products .
In just a few clicks , users of Mininova ’s content distribution platform can now add links to CDs , concert tickets , merchandising or other products they want to sell alongside their torrent release .
The new feature integrates a link to products in the artist ’s myshopify.com store , as the record label Beep !
Beep ! has done with one of their latest releases .
The label even gives Mininova users a 20 % discount for helping out with seeding .
According to the label , the reason why they have decided to give all their albums away for free is simple .
“ Because it ’s only fair not to pay for something you have n’t heard yet , ” they say .
“ In our opinion torrents are an excellent way to present you with our music .
That ’s why Beep !
Beep ! and Mininova have teamed up .
We like the fact that you ’re taking the effort to get to know new music .
In fact , we ’d like to thank you for downloading and seeding our music by giving you a discount on our hardcopies , ” the label announced .
Mininova co-founder Niek told TorrentFreak that the shop links will go live for users of the content distribution system some time later today .
It ’s good to see that Mininova not only helps to distribute content , but also help artists to pitch their gear to interested fans .
Mr Molyneux argues the judicial system needs to embrace new technology A magistrate has resigned from the bench following a complaint about his use of the Twitter network .
IT consultant Steve Molyneux , from Telford , Shropshire , posted messages on the social networking site about cases at the town 's magistrates ' court .
He said everything he reported on Twitter had already been said in open court and he had done nothing illegal .
Mr Molyneux said he had been making use of the latest technology to bring " transparency " to the judicial system .
The people who read the Twitter read the same thing in the newspaper that evening
Steve Molyneux
Former magistrate Mr Molyneux , a magistrate for 16 years , said he chose to resign after an individual within the court system lodged a complaint .
" I think things have escalated out of control , " he said .
" I was using the technology after hearing a remand case just to inform local people and others that follow me in my role of magistrate and did n't think I 'd done anything wrong .
" I did n't prejudice a case , I did n't do anything like that . "
' Seeing justice '
He later told BBC Radio Five Live that he accepted he had to be " careful of the language " he used , but did not accept he should not use the technology .
In fact , he argued , his feed was providing people with a service .
" I use it to communicate with the public .
The people who read the Twitter read the same thing in the newspaper that evening .
" The fact [ is ] I used a piece of technology that allowed others [ to know about the case outcome ] that may not have read the local newspaper but were just as interested .
I saw no harm in it . "
He said he believed the judicial system needed to embrace technology to ensure transparency so that the public could see " justice has been done " .

In Germany , the file - hosting service Rapidshare has handed over the personal details of alleged copyright infringers to several major record labels .
The information is used to pursue legal action against the Rapidshare users and at least one alleged uploader saw his house raided .
Like many new releases , Metallica ’s latest album “ Death Magnetic ” was uploaded to the popular file hosting service Rapidshare one day prior to its official release date last year .
Since users do n’t broadcast their IP - address or distribute files to the public directly though Rapidshare , it came as a surprise when the police raided the house of an uploader a few weeks ago .
At first it was unclear how the identity of the uploader was revealed , but today German news outlet Gulli said it had found out that this was likely to be accomplished by creative use of paragraph 101 of German copyright law .
It turns out that several record labels are using this to take legal action against those who share music on Rapidshare .
Previously the paragraph was only used by rights holders to get the personal details of those who share copyrighted works on file - sharing networks .
It basically enables the copyright holders to get “ permission ” from a civil judge to ask ISPs to disclose the personal details of a user behind a certain IP .
Now , however , this also seems to be the case for file - hosting services such as Rapidshare , which is based in Germany .
This of course opens up the possibility for rights holders to go after a wide range of file - hosting services and potentially even BitTorrent sites .
Indeed , everyone who now uploads a torrent file to a site hosted in Germany is at risk of having his personal details revealed .
Although it will be impossible to prove that the uploader actually seeded the file it might be seen as assisting in copyright infringement .
Pretty much all torrent sites keep track of the IP - addresses of their ( .torrent ) uploaders , and if the rights holders can get the IP - address of people who upload to file - hosting services such as Rapidshare , they can easily extend this to BitTorrent sites hosted in Germany .
A dream come true for copyright holders , but a nightmare for the privacy of Internet users .
Too bad for Metallica ’s Lars Ulrich who only just started sharing files himself .
Former editorial cartoonist , still cartooning , writing , and generally making fun of the idiots who run the world .

U.S. border czar confronts disturbing Mexico discovery
It 's something for border czar to worry about
Strongest gun yet seized from cartel by Mexican authorities
On the very day President Barack Obama appointed former U.S. attorney Alan Bersin as a border czar to combat drug cartels , Mexican police announced they confiscated a U.S. - made machine gun that could penetrate steel from a mile away , likely the most destructive weapon of its type ever seized in Mexico .
Together , the two moves signal the ever increasing strength of cartel warfare — and the task ahead for the U.S. and Mexican governments .
The discovery of the .50 - caliber Browning machine gun , which Mexican authorities said was mounted in the bed of a pickup and has a rate of fire of 800 rounds a minute , also came just days before Obama ’s first trip to Mexico .
The White House is promising cooperation with Mexico , and both Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon , are under pressure to slow the drug running , gun smuggling and violence that threatens Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California .
Bersin , of San Diego , will coordinate American policy on immigration , guns , drugs and bulk cash shipments into Mexico , a Department of Homeland Security official told the Houston Chronicle .
The discovery of the weapon in the northern Mexico state of Sonora serves notice that cartels are ready for all - out war .
Mexican authorities have not yet said how it got into the country .
The gun , which fires rounds nearly 6 inches long , was discovered by federal police on routine patrol when they spotted the truck parked outside a house .
A woman was arrested at the scene , and police said the Browning , part of a grenade launcher and other weaponry have been linked to the Beltran Leyva drug cartel .
The Beltran Leyva group is one of Mexico ’s older syndicates , and operates with a lower profile than the Gulf or Sinaloa cartels , which often grab headlines .
Gun ’s source unknown
Mike Vigil , the Drug Enforcement Administration ’s former chief of international operations , said the weapon is capable of “ a massacre … they were probably waiting for a major offensive . ”
Vigil suspected the weapon belonged to the Mexican military , but was obtained by corrupting military officers .
The issue of U.S. - made weapons ending up in the hands of cartels has gained attention in recent months and is expected to be part of the discussion between Obama and Calderon .
Mexican government officials have said repeatedly that if the U.S. government wants them to curb the northward flow of drugs , America will have to curb the southward flow of weapons .
Federal blitz planned
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , as well as Texas firearms dealers , say the big gun could have taken many paths to the drug traffickers , including having been bought on the military black market .
“ Saying it is rare would be correct , ” ATF spokeswoman Franceska Perot said .
“ This is a high - powered weapon . ”
The gun could be used to shoot down an aircraft if mounted correctly , but it is made for use against personnel or vehicles , Perot said .
Federal gun agents are planning to blitz Houston and the southern half of Texas starting later this month with a temporary army of 100 additional inspectors and investigators aimed at rooting out weapons traffickers .
That force is scheduled to be permanently beefed up later this year by other agents , some of whom are currently in the ATF academy .
Perot said the coming move will bolster current investigations as well as tear into a backlog of some 700 U.S. - purchased weapons confiscated in Mexico after being used by drug cartel gunmen .
Staff writers Dudley Althaus from Mexico City and Stewart Powell from Washington contributed to this report .

Keynes maintains that sometimes people want to hoard money instead of saving it .
When this money is withheld from investment , the result is unemployment which , in turn , causes overproduction .
Unemployed people are not able to buy the previous output of products and depression results .
According to Keynes , there will be an absence of savings during a depression as people withdraw money to survive .
He goes on to say that ( 1 ) without savings there will be no investment ; ( 2 ) without investment there will be no employment ; ( 3 ) without employment there will be no spending ; and ( 4 ) without spending there will be unsold goods .
Keynes explains that savings can overshoot the demand for investment in capital equipment , resulting in excess savings and the withdrawal of funds from circulation and from the necessary sufficient demand for goods .
Drawing money away from the purchase of finished commodities makes them less profitable at the very same time that firms are seeking to set up additional capital resources to produce finished commodities .
Keynes maintains that a deficiency of purchasing power is inevitable , resulting in an increased supply of , and a diminished demand for , products .
As a result , profitable production cannot be continued and crises and depression begin .
Keynes 's solution for preventing or alleviating depressions is to either reduce the amount of savings or to stimulate consumption through government spending and / or the issuance of new money .
Keynes says that in a free market interest rates fail to perform the function of a market clearing price and that wage rates do not adjust .
The result is underconsumption and unemployment in an unregulated economy .
As a cure to bolster consumption , he proposed state management of the money market to supplement fiscal policies with respect to taxation and government spending .
Economic Recovery Requires Savings and Capital Accumulation
In a recent two - part article posted in his blog , economist George Reisman explains that the economy is not functioning correctly because it has lost capital which is accumulated on the underpinning of savings .
He observes that recessions stem from the effort to build capital on a foundation of credit expansion rather than on savings .
Such credit expansion causes overconsumption and the loss of capital due to bad investments .
The housing bubble is a prime example of overconsumption and bad investments caused by credit expansion as many loans were made to " homebuyers " who were not worthy of the amount of credit involved .
Although the houses represented capital to the homebuilders and to the financing banks , they did not represent wealth to the unworthy " purchasers " who had not contributed comparable wealth and capital to the economic system and who had no realistic possibilities of doing so .
To add to the problem , many of these people borrowed using the increased market value of their homes as collateral and then spent what they had borrowed .
Their consumption came at the expense of capital that had been invested by others in the economy .
When the housing bubble burst and house prices fell drastically , the effect accentuated the losses experienced by lenders as people abandoned their houses , thus requiring the creditors to lose by the amount of the decreases in the prices of their houses .
This loss of capital is what caused a large decrease in the amount of available credit , resulting in bankruptcies , unemployment , and decreased consumption expenditures .
Lenders currently do not know which prospective borrowers to trust due to the problems of the capital markets that accompanied the bursting of the housing bubble .
Reisman explains that economic recovery requires that the economy rebuild its stock of capital , and that doing so necessitates greater savings relative to consumption .
Greater savings and the accumulation of new capital are needed to make up for the losses brought about by credit expansion and the overconsumption and bad investments that stemmed from it .
Government Spending Does Not Bring Prosperity
He emphasizes that the use of stimulus packages will result in the additional loss of capital .
A stimulus package begins with the consumption of already produced wealth that is a component of the capital of the business that owns it .
The money received by the company does not come from the production of any corresponding comparable wealth on the part of the government or by those to whom the government has given the money .
When the good consumed by a non-producer is replaced , the result is the consumption of some of the firm 's assets .
In turn , the replacement production is followed by additional consumption .
Each succeeding act of production is accompanied by new consumption that is equal to it .
It is clear that real economic recovery requires increases in production that exceed increases in consumption .
Stimulus packages only aggravate the problem of the loss of capital that is the fundamental cause of economic recession .
Government demand - management policies aimed at stimulating economic activity do not and cannot create any new wealth — economic stimulants will not succeed .
Government stimulus proposals are illogical .
The government cannot inject money into the economy without first removing it from the economy .
The government can distribute funds only by collecting more taxes , borrowing from the private sector , or printing additional money .
There can be no stimulus if the government increases the ability of some people to spend by decreasing other people 's ability to spend .
When a government taxes or borrows it simply transfers spending power from private owners to political spenders .
By taxing people who create real wealth , the government impairs the process of wealth - generation and diminishes the likelihood of economic recovery .
In addition , people who lend money to the government preempt the private - sector uses toward which that money could have gone .
Furthermore , when the government prints money the result is inflation which , in turn , leads to hesitant businessmen and entrepreneurs and continuing capital decumulation .
The additional " profits " due to inflation are taxed as though they are true profits thereby impairing the ability of companies to replace their assets .
All of this results in a less than zero - sum game because government handouts are likely to be less productive ( or even counterproductive ) and because money distributed by the government is always less than the money collected , since government employees such as tax collectors and dispensers have to be paid .
On top of all of this , a stimulus plan will devalue United States currency .
Stimulus : Euphemism for Deficit Spending
A stimulus package requires the federal government to go further into debt , creating a burden on future generations .
New debt has to be repaid with interest through taxation in the future .
Government budget deficits cause a continuing depletion of production and output because of the stimulated detour into consumption .
Every dollar spent from government securities issued to fund a deficit is a dollar that will not be invested in a private company .
Increased government spending will transfer more of the American economy to the public sector thereby raising the burden of government on America 's citizens .
On the other hand , if the government reduces both taxes and spending , more money will remain in the hands of private individuals who constitute the productive sector of the economy .
A recession is a time period during which businessmen need to recognize and correct their past errors .
A recession comes about due to the effects of the great amount of unproductive debt that financed a multitude of unwise ventures such as loans to homebuyers who were not creditworthy .
Through the Community Investment Act , the government required banks to make many such loans to accommodate local community groups .
This resulting debt burden should be reduced through bankruptcy proceedings , write - offs , rescheduling , and so on .
True Wealth Creation Economic recovery requires that the stock of capital be rebuilt in the economic system .
Markets will need the freedom to adjust to slow conditions through price and wage rate reductions .
In addition , unsound investments should be sold off .
There should be no bailouts and the assets of the mortgage giants should be liquidated .
Allowing some businesses to fail and others to begin would provide an incentive to redirect capital into more productive and profitable uses .
True entrepreneurs do not request nor obtain government assistance .
When a failed or faltering business is rescued by a government handout , it is no longer a business .
Likewise , when a businessman obtains his results by receiving special privileges such as subsidies granted by the government , he forfeits his status as a businessman .
Government intervention prevents the efficient functioning of the market .
Increasing government involvement makes the investment climate riskier and reduces the motivation of entrepreneurs to innovate .
Because of the integration of all individual markets into one functioning system , the reality is that government does not have to be concerned with artificially stimulating demand .
Markets clear if not interfered with .
Government efforts to stimulate the economy via direct spending and efforts to stimulate consumer spending are counterproductive .
When the government spends , it must expropriate money from businesses to do so , thus ensuring a misallocation of resources .
Government should get out of the way by reducing taxation , spending , regulations , and government control of money and the interest rate .
1. Clive Cussler , Sahara ( 2005 )
Though Clive Cussler has written 20 novels starring adventurer Dirk Pitt , neither Cussler nor Pitt has had much luck with movies .
Raise The Titanic !
became a notorious flop in 1980 , which might explain the long break leading up to 2005 ’s Sahara , which starred Matthew McConaughey and looked like it might reverse Cussler ’s fortunes .
Cussler thought otherwise .
Feeling shut out of a screenwriting process that eventually involved 10 different writers , Cussler badmouthed the movie and filed suit for breach of contract before filming even finished .
It did n’t help when the film went on to lose humongous amounts of money .
A countersuit followed , with producers claiming Cussler damaged the box office by disparaging the film , and that he misrepresented how popular his books actually were .
It all devolved into a public , and still ongoing , game of “ You suck ! ” / ” No , you suck more ! ” , with both sides trading settlement money back and forth as embarrassing details — like a budget whose items include hundreds of thousands in bribes and “ entourage travel ” — came to light .
2. Brian Garfield , Death Wish ( 1974 )
Brian Garfield ’s novel Death Wish is a study of urban paranoia , grief , and impotent rage , so it ’s no big surprise that Garfield was n’t happy with the movie version .
Paul , a middle - aged architect , is living the good life until a group of street punks assaults his wife and daughter .
The wife is killed , and the daughter is raped , beaten , and left comatose .
Distraught , the architect buys a gun and starts tracking down muggers , killing them to assuage his guilt .
But in the novel , Paul does n’t start killing ’ til near the end , and his motives are far from pure ; Garfield creates a portrait of a deeply conflicted man who commits murder to prove he ’s still in control of his life .
Contrast that with the movie , where Bronson seems destined to kick ass from the moment he steps onscreen .
It ’s a textbook example of getting the notes right but the tone wrong , and Garfield was deeply displeased with the finished project .
The four sequels that followed ( including a deliriously stupid third film that ’s essential viewing for crappy - cinema fans ) just served to salt the wound .
In 2007 , Garfield ’s own sequel , Death Sentence , was eventually adapted into a Kevin Bacon vehicle that was even more ridiculous .
Garfield probably is n’t returning Hollywood ’s calls anymore .
3. Stanislaw Lem , Solaris ( 1972 , 2002 )
Bad enough to have one adaptation miss the point ; there ’s a special kind of frustration that comes from seeing filmmakers screw things up twice .
In defense of Andrei Tarkovsky and Steven Soderbergh , Stanislaw Lem ’s science - fiction classic Solaris poses significant challenges for any filmmaker .
It tells the story of an alien intelligence so vast that it ’s classified as a planet .
Scientists attempting to communicate or even study the intelligence meet with failure until the alien sends up avatars — people from the scientists ’ past , including the protagonist ’s wife , who committed suicide when he left her .
Tarkovsky used this setup to explore the contrast between nature and the cold sterility of space exploration , while Soderbergh ’s more intimate take focused on the fractured relationship between the two leads , treating the planet ’s intervention as a kind of second chance to rectify past mistakes .
Both movies are worth watching , but neither capture the mystery at the heart of Lem ’s novel — the impossibility of trying to understand something that can’t even be exactly qualified as “ life . ”
Lem ’s objections ( based , in the case of Soderbergh ’s adaptation , entirely on reviews of the film — he never saw it for himself ) boil down to the fact that both filmmakers , in trying to graft more obvious human concerns onto the story , miss the point entirely .
4. Bret Easton Ellis , Less Than Zero ( 1987 )
From the beginning , filmmakers have attempted to adapt Bret Easton Ellis ’ nearly unadaptable dissections of the lives of the young , rich , and spiritually vacant .
And from the beginning , Ellis has n’t been shy about registering his opinions about how they turned out .
Just recently , he spoke up with read - between - the - lines ( or sometimes , just read - the - lines ) ambivalence about The Informers , a critically reviled bomb that cut to 95 minutes a script he and Nicholas Jarecki had intended as a sprawling L.A. tapestry with the scope of Short Cuts or Magnolia .
But Less Than Zero , his debut novel , was the work that put Ellis on the map , and the end result bore such a superficial relationship to the book that Ellis refused to see it for a while , claiming that only the title and the character names bore any resemblance to what he wrote .
As the years passed , he ’s softened on the film just a little :
Though he still believes it ’s “ obviously bad ” and woefully miscast , save for Robert Downey Jr. and James Spader , he claims to love it visually , saying it captured L.A. youth culture in the mid-to - late ’ 80s in a “ stunningly beautiful way . ”
5. Anne Rice , Interview With The Vampire ( 1994 )
Putting Anne Rice on this list is a bit of a cheat , since after actually seeing the film based on her book , she praised it immoderately .
At the same time , her vilification of the producers and directors before she saw the movie was so public and memorable that the list would n’t seem complete without her .
Where authors are usually fairly circumspect about adaptations - in - progress — perhaps because contracts require them to be —
Rice was at the time a celebrity in her own right , used to having her own way , and she threw a public temper tantrum , telling the L.A .
Times , “ I was particularly stunned by the casting of Cruise , who is no more my Vampire Lestat than Edward G. Robinson is Rhett Butler . ”
For months , Rice campaigned against Cruise in the media , urging her followers to get him booted from the film , and bitching “ The Tom Cruise casting is just so bizarre , it ’s almost impossible to imagine how it ’s going to work .
I do think Tom Cruise is a fine actor , [ but ] you have to know what you can do and what you ca n’t do . ”
Once she saw the film , however , she embraced it ( and Cruise ) so thoroughly that conspiracy - minded fans lit up the Internet , accusing her of having been paid off in some way , or at least realizing she had everything to gain financially from helping make the movie a hit .
She seemed sincere enough , though ; in a public statement published by Variety , she gushed over the movie , criticizing it on just one ground : “ There is one problem created by the compelling charm of Tom ’s performance , obviously .
Since he is n’t all that nasty , why does Louis hate Lestat ?
How can he ? ”
6. Ernest Hemingway , A Farewell To Arms ( 1932 )
While he was alive , Ernest Hemingway was said to have disliked every one of the dozen or so adaptations of his books , and had he lived to see Chris O’Donnell play him in the schmaltzy 1996 biopic In Love And War , it probably would have killed him .
But Hemingway had a special hatred for Frank Borzage ’s 1932 version of A Farewell To Arms , starring Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes .
He thought it betrayed his original ending , and that it heavily favored the romantic elements of the story over his depiction of wartime brutality .
( The film ’s defenders tend to concede all these points and appreciate Borzage ’s accomplishments anyway . )
As a special show of contempt , Hemingway actively worked to keep the film from premièring in Piggott , Arkansas , the tiny town where he wrote much of the book .
He was unsuccessful .
7. James Ellroy , Cop ( 1988 )
James Ellroy has had a funny relationship with the movies .
The hard - boiled author is happy to take the money for movie rights , knowing full well that 99 times out of a hundred , a movie version will never be made .
He was critical of Cop , an adaptation of his Blood On The Moon , but he quickly learned that he ’d do best by saying nothing at all if he had nothing good to say .
To a publication called Groucho Reviews , he summed up his filmography this way : “ Brown ’s Requiem , no comment .
Cop , no comment .
L.A. Confidential , wonderful film .
The Black Dahlia , wonderful film . ”
That last one may surprise people who a ) watched Brian De Palma ’s horrible film version , and b ) read a later interview in which Ellroy refused to praise the film , but would n’t shoot it down , either .
( “ Look , ” he told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , “ you ’re not going to get me to say anything negative about the movie , so you might as well give up . ” )
Ever the pragmatist , in language and in life , Ellroy summed up his relationship with the movies to Interview : ” I ’m happy for the money .
I ’m happy for the exposure .
Every once in a while there ’s lightning in a bottle like with L.A. Confidential …
Even bad movies create substantial readership for your books . ”

8. Stephen King , The Shining ( 1980 )
Perhaps the most famous example of an author being displeased with the film adaptation of his work is Stephen King ’s reaction to Stanley Kubrick ’s The Shining .
And that ’s interesting , because while most film adaptations are considered letdowns , King wound up hating a film that almost everyone else , from critics to audiences , thought was a masterpiece .
He was particularly upset with the lead casting of Jack Nicholson , whom he felt would telegraph his madness to the audience , and he felt Kubrick was too subtle in communicating Jack ’s alcoholism and family issues .
He also did n’t care for the ambiguous way Kubrick handled the book ’s supernatural elements with kid gloves .
( It further did n’t help that Kubrick pestered King at ungodly hours , calling him up with unanswerable philosophical queries . )
King was so distraught over what he felt was a poor screen treatment of one of his best books that he oversaw a hokey 1997 TV - miniseries version of it , starring the terrifying Steven Weber .
( He reportedly liked that one better . )
9. Gore Vidal , Myra Breckenridge ( 1970 )
Gore Vidal is no stranger to movies ; he worked as a screenwriter , and was the ( uncredited ) driving force behind the multiple - Oscar - winner Ben-Hur .
He was reportedly excited when plans were made to film an adaptation of his audacious satire of American sexual mores , Myra Breckenridge , but when he read the finished screenplay , he declared it was “ an awful joke ” and disowned the project .
He did n’t see the movie — a massive box - office flop instantly reviled as one of the worst films of all time — until decades later .
( Though he recalled that its failure killed off sales of the book , as well . )
After seeing , it he declared it “ the second - worst movie I ’ve ever seen ” and cited the fact that it ruined the director ’s career as proof of the existence of a just God .
It would n’t be Vidal ’s last such experience ; Bob Guccione so hijacked his screenplay for the notorious Caligula that he sued to have his name removed from the credits .
10 . Winston Groom , Forrest Gump ( 1994 )
It seems like any writer should be happy with an adaptation like Forrest Gump received .
It set massive box - office records , caused sales of the book to skyrocket , worked its way into global culture , won tons of awards , and made piles of money .
Sure , it took a few liberties with the book , but Groom ’s dismay over the movie version of his 1986 novel was n’t because of the depoliticizing of his message , or the ( fairly slight ) alterations of the book ’s narrative and tone .
It was over money .
Paramount and the film ’s producers failed to pay him a single penny , even going so far as to make the absurd claim that the film lost money , so there was nothing to pay him — a claim belied by the fact that Tom Hanks contracted for points instead of a salary , and netted more than $ 20 million .
To add insult to injury , no one even mentioned Groom ’s name in any of the film ’s six Oscar - winner speeches .
Groom had to sue to get anything at all , and it took years and a small fortune in legal costs ; small wonder that the first line of the book ’s sequel , Gump And Co. , begins “ Do n’t never let nobody make a movie of your life ’s story . ”
11 . Robert Crumb , Fritz The Cat ( 1972 )
Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb explained in Terry Zwigoff ’s documentary Crumb that in spite of his work ’s obvious leftist bent and coverage of the turbulence of the ’60s , he never exactly felt like part of the hippie culture .
In other words , even at his boldest and brashest , Crumb is no one ’s mascot , and he ’s touchy about how his work gets interpreted .
So he naturally availed himself of the privilege of killing off one of his own creations in the wake of Ralph Bakshi ’s 1972 animated adventure Fritz The Cat .
While the film makes an effort to ape Crumb ’s tone and the feel of his art , it separates the title character from Crumb ’s own cutting , loopy words .
Crumb ’s work walks a fine line between satire , sympathy , and exploitation , but Bakshi ’s film quickly grows tawdry and tiresome .
12 . Elizabeth Wurtzel , Prozac Nation ( 2001 )
Erik Skjoldbjærg ’s mind - boggling adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel ’s memoir / mopefest Prozac Nation offers a scathing portrait of its subject as a deranged , self - absorbed monster who throws a hissy fit because she ’s worried boyfriend Jason Biggs is paying more attention to a mentally challenged sibling than to her .
The film version of Wurtzel is pathologically egotistical , so it ’s no huge surprise that Wurtzel called the film “ horrible . ”
The rest of the world agreed .
Though filming was completed in 2000 , it debuted on Starz ! in 2005 , then went on to a DVD release and a quick , merited trip to obscurity .
13 . Alan Moore , everything ( 2001 - present )
There have been several adaptations of Alan Moore ’s comics , and there are likely to be a lot more .
They vary in quality from the abysmal ( League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen ) to the acceptable ( the “ For The Man Who Has Everything ” episode of the Justice League television show ) , but they have one thing in common : Moore has had nothing whatsoever to do with them .
The man many consider to be the greatest living comics writer has always maintained that he wrote his stories specifically for the comics medium , and that any adaptation would be so different that he did n’t want to be a part of it ; now , after four movie adaptations and a handful of lawsuits , he ’s asked for his name to be taken off any property he does n’t directly own , with the result that Watchmen — this year ’s big - screen take on what may be the best superhero story in comics history — bore the name of only its artist , Dave Gibbons , in the credits .
Given his extremely public , extremely negative , comments about the movie versions of V For Vendetta and League , it ’s unlikely he ’ll ever change his mind about Hollywood .
Making homemade bread has taken on a whole new meaning .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Brock McLeod and Heather Walker will teach you how to start your own wheat field .
Even if you live in the heart of the city .
" We want to see a reintroduction of people growing grains for themselves in their backyards , " says McLeod who , together with Walker , has created Island Grains , a new participatory farming project on Vancouver Island .
" If we can start growing wheat locally , if there is enough demand for it , well , that could really help revise the food system . "
Electric fan separates chaff
The idea is simple : Hand over $ 65 , and McLeod and Walker will lease you a 200 - square - foot slice of Makaria Farm , their 10 - acre organic spread near the town of Duncan , in the fertile Cowichan Valley .
They 'll also give you a grain seed of your choice , seminars with guest experts , and basic infrastructure support , including irrigation and tools .
( " Yes , we have a scythe ! " notes the website . )
You 'll attend a few guest - expert seminars , plant your crop , then show up for at least three subsequent days -- two or more to tend ( weed ) your plot , and one to harvest and thresh , using a low - tech plywood threshing box and a standard household fan to separate the wheat from the chaff .
You 'll leave the program , and your plot , with your own grains -- which you can mill into flour as needed at home in your blender or food processor .
You 'll also have enough know - how to start your own micro - farm the following season anywhere you have soil and sun .
That includes your own back yard , which McLeod says offers more potential than you might imagine .
Quoting tables provided in Gene Logsdon 's book , Small Scale Grain Raising , McLeod explains that 1,100 square feet -- a 10 foot by 109 foot plantation -- could produce about 60 pounds of wheat .
" You can probably get about two loaves of bread per pound , " he says , " so that would be up to 120 loaves of bread per harvest . "
That 's two loaves per week for a year .
Out of what might presently be a lawn .
' Brilliant '
" It is a brilliant idea , " says Dan Jason , a longtime food activist and owner of Salt Spring Seeds , who will be supplying the project with red fife wheat , barley and other grain varieties .
" It is neat way to introduce people to the whole concept of grain - raising without a lot of land . "
The area 's regional agrologist agrees that small - scale grains make a lot of sense .
" It sounds like a really good idea , especially for people to get together and learn from each other , " says Wayne Haddow , who works for the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture and Lands .
" We have a lot of under - utilized land in smaller lots on Vancouver Island , and grains do store very well , " Haddow adds .
" The opportunity is there . "
McLeod and Walker certainly hope so , too .
After growing a successful trial crop of red fife and barley last summer -- they threshed it by stuffing a pillowcase and hitting it with a shoe -- they 're opening their gates to 50 would - be micro- farmers and advisors in the coming season .
( " We 're not the experts , " McLeod stresses , " but we 're bringing in the experts . " )
Get in line
After launching their website on Boxing Day , the couple sold out all 50 of this season 's memberships before the end of January .
They are maintaining a wait list .
The couple have come a long way in just a few years .
Two years ago , McLeod , 29 , and Walker , 28 , were living in a rented Victoria condo and working nice , stable -- albeit boring -- civil service jobs .
Life was good :
They ate out a fair bit , enjoyed the city .
" But we were n't really happy , " recalls McLeod .
So one day McLeod said the words that many of us say when we dream of a better , simpler life .
" Let 's get a farm . "
The couple took out a mortgage , and in June 2007 bought Makaria .
As they figured out what worked and what did n't , McLeod came across Logsdon 's book .
It proved an epiphany .
" I 'd always imagined that growing grains requires acres and acres of prairie just to make it worth your while , " says McLeod .
" But Logsdon shows that just 1/40th of an acre -- the amount of space taken up by a single - car garage , is enough space to grow the wheat you need to enjoy a loaf of bread every week for a year . "
Podcast inspired start
They cooked up the idea for Island Grains after listening to the Deconstructing Dinner podcast hosted in part by The Tyee .
That program documented the Creston Grain CSA Pilot Project , a community supported agriculture program in British Columbia 's southern interior region that last year attracted international attention .
" We figured , if it is doable , and there 's this much interest , " says McLeod , who grew up on an organic farm , " then we would like to do it here and invite other people to join us . "
Their timing proved perfect .
Don Jason reports that his customers have been asking for grain seeds in increasing numbers .
" Since about October I have been getting so many orders for barley and wheat and spelt ; it is phenomenal , every second order is asking for grain . "
" If you do something inspiring , " says Matt Lowe , cofounder of the Creston Grain CSA project , " it creates a chain reaction .
I 'm glad to hear that what is happening on the island is inspired by what we are doing . "

" Hail to the Ch - Ch - Ch - Chief ! "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York Gov. David Paterson on Thursday introduced a bill to allow gay marriage in the state , likening the effort to civil rights struggles and brushing aside objections from religious leaders .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
If the bill becomes law , New York will follow Connecticut , Massachusetts , Vermont and Iowa in legalizing gay marriage , but the effort is expected to face resistance in the state Senate .
“ Anyone that has ever experienced degradation or intolerance would understand the solemn duty and how important it actually is , ” Paterson , the state ’s first black governor , told a news conference in Manhattan .
“ This is a civil rights issue .
Civil rights do n’t wait for the right time , ” he said .
Paterson was accompanied by city and state leaders , including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
Gay marriage has broad support in the Democratic - controlled New York lower house , the Assembly , where it passed in a 85 to 61 vote in 2007 .
It was not put to a vote in the state Senate .
The bill is again expected to be passed in the Assembly .
In the Senate Democrats hold a majority for the first time in more than 40 years , but it is slim -- 32 to 30 -- and at least one Democrat has said he opposes the measure .
Lawmakers in New Hampshire and Maine , which offer same - sex couples some form of legal recognition , also are weighing bills to allow gay marriage .
California briefly recognized gay marriage until voters banned it in a referendum last year .
Forty - three U.S. states have laws explicitly prohibiting gay marriage , including 29 with constitutional amendments restricting marriage to one man and one woman .
The New York governor ’s announcement comes the day after the installation of the new Catholic Archbishop of New York , Timothy Dolan , who is a strong opponent of gay marriage .
Paterson , who said he was christened a Catholic , said gay marriage is the “ right way ” from a spiritual standpoint .
I ’m working on a recommendation system designed to suggest features to users who have n’t tried them yet , based on what other people use .
The method I ’m looking at now is using the Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) technique to build suggestions ;
It has been used in the Netflix prize , among other places .
SVD for profit : the Netflix prize
The movie rental service Netflix offers recommendations to their clients , and have launched a contest in 2006 to improve their recommendation engine .
Participants get a dataset of 100 million ratings for 480,189 users and 17,770 movies .
The matrix of all ratings is 480,189 ×17,770 ( over 8.5×109 items ) , of which almost 99 % is empty .
It is such a hard problem ( computation - wise ) that Netflix is currently offering $ 1 M for a 10 % improvement over their existing system .
My dataset is far from being as large as theirs , but is large enough to require some special attention — we can’t use naïve techniques , and ca n’t fit the entire matrix in memory .
Quick explanation of matrix approximations using the SVD
The SVD can be used to approximate a matrix , which is useful in this kind of system .
The SVD of a m - by - n matrix M is the collection of 3 matrices ( U , Σ , V ) where U is an m - by - m matrix , Σ an m - by - n diagonal matrix , and V * the conjugate transpose of an n - by - n matrix , such as M = UΣ ( V * ) .
Using an example from the Wikipedia page :
The SVD can be used to approximate a matrix :
By keeping k columns of U as ( U k ) , k values of Σ as ( Σ k ) , and k lines of V * as ( V* k ) , we still get M≈U k Σ k ( V* k ) .
If k is small enough , we can use a total number of cells lower than the original n×m .
Note : Running an SVD on a matrix as large as the Netflix one requires a special technique , which reduces these billions of cells to a few millions only while retaining a lot of information .
See Timely Development for an example using the Netflix dataset .
Example of matrix approximation
Consider the following ratings table :
Books rated by users User 1 User 2 User 3 User 4 Book 1 1 4 1 Book 2 2 5 Book 3 4 1 4 Book 4 1 Book 5 3 5 5 1 Book 6 3 2
Original matrix :
Rebuilt with k=4 , the matrix is the same .
Approximation in rounded integers with k=3 :
Three ratings are wrong : ( User1 , Book1 ) and ( User4 , Book1 ) were both 1 and are now 0 , ( User1 , Book3 ) was 0 and is now 1 .
RMSE ≈0.657
With k=2 :
Quite a few mistakes here ... one rating is - 1 and one is 6 !
When the matrix is rebuilt , the values must always be recalibrated into the right range .
RMSE ≈ 2.903
With k=1 :
RMSE ≈9.456
This one is way off !
We ca n’t use such an approximation .
One must then find a compromise between data size and precision by tweaking the value of k .
For reference , the first team to reach a RMSE under 0.8572 in their predictions on the Netflix dataset will win the prize .
SVD for fun : image compression
Let ’s try on real data .
If we load an image as a matrix of colours , how well can we compress it using the SVD ?
Pretty well , even if it ’s not JPEG .
Take a look at “ Lenna ” , using different values for k :
k = 1 , image generated from ( 1×384 + 1 + 384×1 ) = 769 bytes .
k = 10 ; 7,690 bytes .
k = 20 ; 15,380 bytes .
k = 50 ; 38,450 bytes .
k = 100 ; 76,900 bytes .
k = 200 ; 153,800 bytes .
Here is lenna.png , the file used as an input to the program ;
Please excuse the very primitive PPM writer , this is not really the point of this article .
The code for image compression is in Haskell , using the hmatrix and pngload libraries :
module Main where
import Numeric.LinearAlgebra
import Codec.Image .PNG
( loadPNGFile , dimensions , imageData )
import Data .
Array .
MArray ( getElems )
import Data .
Word ( Word8 )
import Data .
Char ( chr )
main = do
png <- loadPNGFile " lenna.png "
case png of
Left fail -> error fail
Right img -> do
m <- fmap ( compress 10 ) $ mkMatrix img
savePPM " out.ppm " m
mkMatrix img = do -- creates a matrix from a PNGImage
let ( w , h ) = dimensions img
table <- getElems $ imageData img :: IO [ Word8 ] -- read colours
return $ ( fromEnum h>< fromEnum ( 3*w ) ) $ map fromIntegral table
compress k m = u_k <> sigma_k <> v_k where
( u , sigma , v ) = full svd m -- get SVD
sigma_k = ( takeColumns k . takeRows k) sigma -- keep k values of Σ
u_k = takeColumns k u -- keep k columns of U
v_k = takeRows k $ trans v -- keep k rows of v
savePPM filename m = writeFile filename $ header ++ contents where
header = concat [ " P6
" , show $ cols m `div` 3 ,
" " , show $ rows m , "
255
" ]
contents = ( concatMap . map ) toChar $ toLists m -- format
toChar = chr .

Other techniques
There are many ways to recommend items ; a lot of them are described ( with Python code ! ) in the fantastic book Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran .

Is a humanoid robot inherently more human than your average task - specific bot ?
iRobot apparently does n't think so , and it 's taken square aim at one of the most popular humanoid bots around to make its point .
That argument arose in a recent interview with CNET News , where iRobot CEO Colin Angle responded to a question about humanoid robots by flatly asking , " why would you want to make a humanoid robot ? , " adding that they might be good for movies or those looking for a robot companion , " but other than that , most tasks are best tackled by designs that are not constrained by trying to look like a person . "
He then goes on to note that Honda 's ASIMO " requires a team of 10 or 15 people to maintain it , it can walk about , maybe , half a meter per second and in some situations climb stairs over the course of a few minutes , and if it ever falls down , it 's a paperweight . "
On the other hand , iRobot 's Warrior bot , he says , " can take a 10 - foot drop onto concrete , drive 20 miles an hour , drive up stairs without stopping at full speed , carry 200 pounds of payload and has , maybe , five motors , " which means it can " go nearly everywhere a human can . "
So , Angle says , " you look at these things and say , which one of these is a robot human ?
The answer is , Warrior . "
Is it ?
Or , deep down , is there a little bit of ASIMO in all of us ?

5 p.m. Great Vespers
Closing
With all the hopes many in the FOSS community have pinned to the increasingly popular netbook , it ’s no great surprise that the topic is a contentious one .
So , when the first Android netbook was spotted recently , excitement on the blogs went through the proverbial roof .
Computerworld ’s Seth Weintraub seems to have been the first to shine a spotlight on the Skytone Alpha 680 , which was apparently announced a few weeks ago in Hong Kong .
Further investigation revealed that the ARM - based machine will cost around US $ 250 and should be available within three months .
The diminutive device ’s specs are “ anemic , ” in Weintraub ’s opinion ; nevertheless , they were more than enough to fire up some red-blooded conversation .
‘ The Price Tag Is Disappointing ’
“ It ’s nice to see companies experimenting with putting Android on netbooks , even though this first one seems like something of a dud ( not enough RAM , battery life problems ) , ” wrote Theli on Digg , where the topic was discussed not just once but twice in separate threads .
“ That is to be expected , though .
It ’s clearly an early adopter ’s device .
I ’d probably wait until some of the bigger players ( Asus , Acer , MSI and HP ) get involved .
Prices should come down , and the design should settle on something that works . ”
Similarly : “ Given the prices of current netbooks , the $ 250 price tag is disappointing , ” agreed Binarydemon .
“ Unless performance or battery life is significantly better , I would just spend a few more bucks for x86 compatibility .
They need to start hitting that projected $ 100 price point . ”
‘ Very Nice ’
With more than 1,400 combined Diggs and 130 comments — in addition to those on the Computerworld blog — the topic was clearly an inspiring one .
So , we here at LinuxInsider took to the streets for some more perspective .
“ Very nice , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
“ I wonder how hard it would be to reformat that machine .
It would be a good replacement for the full - sized notebook I use for network analysis and configuring equipment , since it would probably be a lot easier to carry . ”
Along similar lines : “ So far Android looks to be a Good Thing , ” Slashdot blogger drinkypoo agreed .
“ You can run a real Linux alongside Android or you can ( theoretically ) put Android on arbitrary hardware . ”
Not the First ?
Whether the Alpha 680 is the first ARM - powered netbook — as the Computerworld article claims — is far from clear , however , drinkypoo told LinuxInsider .
In fact , there is currently a trademark suit in progress over the rights to the netbook name , he noted — something that “ was invented by Psion , which had an ARM - powered ‘ netbook ’ before anyone knew what a netbook was . ”
The claim that Skytone was first “ seems to have been made only by the article ’s author , Eric Lai , who should probably acquaint himself with Wikipedia before he is permitted to write any more articles for Computerworld , ” drinkypoo added .
‘ A Really Great Thing ’
“ I ’m excited to see Android escape the T - Mobile G1 , and after a sad , disappointing love affair with the Kogan Agora Pro that never gotreleased , I ’m ready for Android to make itself available to me on anew consumer device , ” Monochrome Mentality blogger Kevin Dean told LinuxInsider via email .
“ My skepticism is not with Android , but with netbooks in general , ” Dean added .
“ My view is that Linux stands a GREAT chance of ‘ domination ’ in the embedded market because mainstream users do n’t yet have a set idea of a ‘ phone interface , ’ whereas on desktop PCs , people reject Linux because the expected user experience is quite strong . ”
Netbooks , of course , fall somewhere in between .
Android could be “ an excellent operating system ” for netbook users seeking mobile Internet devices , Dean explained .
“ In this realm , I see a ton ofpotential , useful and quirky applications deployed across a mostlystable and consistent development platform .
This could be ‘ A ReallyGreat Thing . ' ”
Unfortunately , “ most people see netbooks today as laptop replacements , ” he added , “ and because of the expectation of Windows , Android netbooks will fail , because they ’re not marketed clearly as ‘ not a laptop replacement . ' ”
The Trouble With Flash
Prices will also have to come down , many bloggers felt .
“ The price is too high , ” Slashdot blogger hairyfeet told LinuxInsider .
“ I can get a netbook with XP Home for $ 300 — less if there is a special at someplace like Woot , which just last week had [ an ] EEE at $ 159 , ” he noted .
“ At those prices , why would I adopt an OS which , frankly , is virtually devoid of apps ? ”
However , at the sub - $ 200 — or , even better , the sub - $ 150 — price point , “ you have the makings of a hit , ” hairyfeet added .
“ The battery life of 12 hours plus could help sell it there . ”
Flash video could be a sticking point .
“ Last I checked , Adobe had Flash ARM support on its ‘ to do ’ list but had n’t released anything that works , and we frankly do n’t know which — if any — ARM chips they will support until the release of code , ” said hairyfeet .
“ With so much of the Web embracing Flash , this will be a hard hurdle to overcome . ”
‘$ 150 Sweet Spot ’
Still , assuming that problem is solved and the price point drops , “ Linux might have a real shot at this market , as the only Windows that supports ARM — WinCE — simply is n’t up to the job , ” hairyfeet observed .
Of course , “ if this ‘ ultra low end ’ market turns out to be a big seller , Intel has the Atom and Celeron able to compete in that space , and most folks will be willing to forgive battery life in return for Windows , ” he predicted .
“ I would say $ 150 will probably be the sweet spot for these units ; at $ 250 - plus , they are simply too close to the price of an Atom - based netbook — and why would a consumer spend that much when they can get one that runs all their programs ? ” he wondered .
‘ The Year of GNU / Linux ! ’
“ Forget $ 250 — China will produce $ 100 machines this year and ARM will be a part of that , ” blogger Robert Pogson asserted by email .
“ There is no place for that other OS at these prices . ”
The world “ will go to small and portable because it costs less , and the least cost will be with GNU / Linux or other free software , ” Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ Expect an intense period of readjustment at M$ as they try to push [ Windows ] 7 onto the world . ”
Netbooks , in fact , “ are what makes 2009 The Year of GNU / Linux , ” Pogson added .
“ They perform better than other hardware at portability , price , power consumption and ease of use .
They make a clear statement to the world that we do not need to continue with the Wintel treadmill . ”
AMD and Intel “ need to use their 32nm processes to produce chips for these things , or someone else will , ” he opined .
“ ARM will eat them up as it is , and ARM will spread upwards in the PC world to notebooks / desktops / servers .
ARM is already multicore ; is it not feasible to produce server chips with 1024 cores with this technology ? ”
In short , “ expect rapid changes , ” Pogson concluded .
“ Wintel is fighting back with feature bloat , but they cannot continue to sell bloat without severe cuts in price . ”
A persons ’ memory can be read simply by looking at electrical activity of their brain , according to a study published in Current Biology .
Scientists can now determine where someone imagines him / herself to be ( in realtion to an entire maze or map for example ) without asking him / her .
They say their study proved that memories relating to location or imagining a location can be “ read ” by a brain scanner .
One of scientists who conducted the study says this is a step closer towards the idea mind reading .
Dr. Hannabis says in at least ten years technology will be closer to making it might be possible to use a brain scanner to solve and fight crime .
Hot damn , girl !
You 're incredible .
Everything about you gives me koala feet .
You do n't know koala feet ?
That 's when a koala gets so dumbstruck by something beautiful in nature like a rock or a boulder that he forgets how to tie his shoes .
You 'd make a koala rely on a zookeeper to tie his shoes for him , or maybe invest in some velcro sandals .
I 'm not exaggerating .
In fact , I 'm just getting started .
You 're blushing ...
You do n't even know how fine you are , do you girl ?
That just makes you even hotter .
It 's like you 're a retard that wandered into NASA mission control and some balding dude with a headset and a cigarette hanging out of his haggard genius mouth sat you down in front of a supercomputer and said " Go on , save the rocket " .
You do n't know what the fuck is going on , and you are n't even wearing regular underwear .
I like that .
Yeah , you know I do .
If we were stranded together on some tropical paradise and we found a four - post bed with silk sheets and a can of whipped cream , I would give you half of the whipped cream .
You 'd probably have to sleep on the floor because I flail my arms about when the nightmares get bad , but you would n't be able complain about the poor sleeping conditions .
After all , I split the food with you , right ?
You would n't even know how comfortable sleeping on the bed would be , and that would just make you even hotter .
Your skin is a gently rolling landscape , its surface a milky velvet delight .
I want to spend a lazy afternoon traversing every millimeter of its surface with my fingertips , held in such a way as to make it look like my hand is skateboarding .
What gorgeous hair you 've got .
It 's like a hundred ropes .
When I smell it I become intoxicated , like I just used too much ammonia to clean up a poorly ventilated hospital bathroom .
I could lose myself in your hair if it was big enough to make a maze .
I 'm horrible at those things , which is pretty much the only reason why I could n't become a professional hedge maze solver .
Your eyes are like sparkling diamonds in a sparkling stream and someone went nuts with a Bedazzler on all the tadpoles .
When I look into those eyes , I am blinded to everything in the world but you , and that poster on your wall with the two girls kissing in black and white .
Girl , your brain weighs roughly three pounds .
Your legs are long like the line I waited in to see Star Wars : Episode One .
I sat there for twelve hours without going to the bathroom , and the local news asked me a few questions live on the air .
If he were to ask me about your legs , I 'd have a lot of flattering things to say but I 'd probably steer the conversation toward Star Wars .
Your breasts are like a slightly mismatched pair of oversized oranges .
If I grasped them with my strong but tender hands and gave them a honk , the sweetest orange juice would drip out from every pore .
I 'm not being poetic , I genuinely believe that 's what would happen .
Your lips are a pair of pillowy security doors hiding a dangerous secret :
Your teeth .
Your teeth can bite and chew , but your lips can kiss and sometimes form words .
Your whole mouth is a dichotomy .
Think about it !
My absolute favorite thing about your body , though , is the nape of your neck .
It 's like an NES cartridge .
I could spend hours leaning in close , exhaling hot whispers of the games I want to play into its smooth hollow , and it would n't have any effect whatsoever on you .

Take - Two Sues 3D Realms for Failing to Deliver Duke Nukem Forever
Original : Take - Two Interactive , publisher of Duke Nukem Forever , has filed suit against the remains of Apogee Ltd./3D
Realms for failing to deliver the long - awaited title .
Take - Two claims that an agreement to finish the shooter was breached when 3D Realms shut down development last week .
At the time of the studio's closing , Duke Nukem Forever had been in development for over 12 years .
" Apogee continually delayed the completion date for the Duke Nukem Forever , " says Take - Two in the complaint , according to Bloomberg .
" Apogee repeatedly assured Take - Two and the video - gaming community that it was diligently working toward competing development of the PC Version of the Duke Nukem Forever . "
Take - Two paid $ 12 million to former DNF publisher Infogrames for the exclusive publishing rights to the game in 2000 .
According to the publisher , a second unspecified agreement was struck between Take - Two and 3D Realms in 2007 .
Following the closure last week , Take - Two spokesman Alan Lewis confirmed that the publisher was not providing 3D Realms with " ongoing funds for development of the title . "
The two companies were on less than cheery terms during development of the game .
After Take - Two publicly expressed hope that 3D Realms would finish the game in 2003 , 3D Realms president George Broussard famously reminded Shacknews users that the game was self - funded , saying : " Take Two needs to STFU imo . "
The details of the 2007 agreement have not yet been revealed , and may be key to determining how the lawsuit will proceed .
Apogee Software , Ltd is the official title of 3D Realms .
The company abandoned the Apogee name in 1996 in favor of the 3D - oriented title .
Apogee Software , LLC , an external publisher established in 2008 , remains in operation .
Houston police : Driver fires back at other car , hits 3 inside
No charges in north Houston freeway gunshot exchange
No charges have been filed so far in a fatal shooting earlier this week on Interstate 45 .
Houston police said a man killed one man and wounded two others after they fired at him while driving in the 9400 block of North Freeway about 12:20 a.m. Wednesday .
Officers were called to a gas station in the 7400 block of North Shepherd because three males had been shot .
Investigators determined that the men had been shot at the freeway and drove to the Shell station .
According to police , they were driving a white Pontiac Grand Prix when they fired gunshots at the driver of a truck .
Then they exited the freeway at West Gulf Bank .
The truck driver stopped on the West Gulf Bank overpass and got a rifle from his back seat for protection , police said .
As he looked over the side of the freeway to see the license plate of the Pontiac , he saw the car 's driver 's side window open and feared the suspects would shoot at him again .
He fired several shots at the Pontiac , hitting the passenger who was sitting in the front seat and another man who was in the back seat .
The front - seat passenger , 17 , was taken to Memorial Hermann Northwest Hospital , where he later was pronounced dead .
The Ponitac 's driver , who was cut in the face by flying glass and shrapnel , and rear seat passenger were treated at the hospital .
Their conditions are not immediately known .
A 19 - year - old man who was passenger in the car ran away , but was later found and questioned .

AUTHORITIES have arrested the manager of an Afghan television station for refusing to censor women 's bare limbs .
The Government has previously censured television stations and taken others to court , but the arrest of Emrose TV's Fahim Khodamani on Monday was the first by authorities for airing overly salacious content , the Deputy Attorney - General , Fazel Ahmad Faqiyar , said .
Since the Taliban fell in 2001 , TV stations have flourished in Afghanistan , pitting press freedom against conservative norms .
Many Afghan TV stations cut or blur scenes with women showing more than their face or neck , taking a stance to avoid violating a government law that prohibits media content not " within the framework of Islam " .
Mr Khodamani was arrested for refusing repeated requests to pixelate or otherwise obscure images of women dancing in short skirts or outfits with low necklines , Mr Faqiyar said .
Afghanistan 's media oversight commission sent letters to the station in recent months reproaching the channel for the amount of bare skin on its programs and for airing pop music videos during the Islamic holiday of Ashoura in January , according to Mr Faqiyar and the station 's owner , Najibullah Kabuli .
Mr Kabuli confirmed that Mr Khodamani refused to censor the programming , saying it was station policy to air unaltered programs .
He said the arrest was " against freedom of speech and democracy " .
Mr Faqiyar said Mr Khodamani will be held for up to 15 days while an inquiry is conducted .

Bass trombonists well versed in the orchestral literature know that Bela Bartok , in his famous " Concerto for Orchestra " ( composed for the Boston Symphony Orchestra ) requires an " impossible " glissando from low B---> F .
On a standard B flat / F single valve bass trombone , this gliss IS impossible , and in the 1960s , several bass trombonists including Edward Kleinhammer , Kauko Kahila and Alan Ostrander , worked with American instrument companies to develop the modern double valve bass trombone so the low B could finally be played comfortably by bass trombonists .
But even the modern double valve bass trombone is a compromise for Bartok 's glissando .
It 's important to keep in mind that Bartok , like many other composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries , was writing for the old bass trombone in F - and for such an instrument , Bartok 's glissando was quite playable from 7th to 1st position .
No break , no valves , no problem .
The F bass became obsolete in the 20th century but there are still many pieces by Bartok and others that simply work better on the instrument for which they were conceived .
I was therefore very fortunate when Yamaha made an F bass trombone for me .
In the photo above , the slide is extended to seventh position as I play Bartok 's glissando for the first time as the composer intended .
The Yamaha F bass trombone is one of a kind , made in the Yamaha Toyooka Factory in Hamamatsu , Japan .
Yamaha made this instrument for me as a gift and it was a complete surprise to me .
Many years ago I had mentioned - in an off hand way - how fantastic it would be if Yamaha could ever make an F bass trombone .
I subsequently forgot about this in the rush of life and you can imagine my surprise when , in the summer of 2004 when I was in Japan teaching at the 10th Hamamatsu International Wind Instrument Academy and Festival , that Yamaha presented me with this extraordinary instrument .
The photo above shows the F bass on a long table that has the full range of trombones made by Yamaha .
From the foreground you can see the F bass , my YBL - 622 bass trombone , a Yamaha tenor trombone , alto trombone and , hidden behind the alto , a prototype Yamaha soprano trombone .
The F bass trombone is so long that it needs a substantial handle on the slide in order for the player to reach sixth and seventh position .
The photo above gives a close up view of the handle of the F bass ( my YBL - 622 bass trombone is to the left ) .
While larger than the traditional 19th century F bass trombone , this new instrument blends very well with modern tenor trombones .
I have used this instrument many times in the Boston Symphony including performances of Bartok 's " Concerto for Orchestra " and works by Olivier Messaien .
The relative size of the Yamaha F bass trombone is easily seen in this photo ( left ) .
Before making this instrument , Yamaha had never made a trombone this large .
They needed to develop special machinery in order to draw such a long slide .
A joint collaboration with Yamaha 's trombone and tuba designers , the instrument went through multiple design phases before finally being manufactured .
While I was at the Yamaha Toyooka Factory in 2004 I made a video that explains the process of making a Yamaha trombone .
The video concludes with footage of the moment that I noticed the F bass trombone on the long table of instruments - again , remember this was a complete surprise .
To see the video ( it is available online for free ) and hear some audio excerpts of my playing this extraordinary instrument , visit the Making Trombones video page .
Welcome to hyperscale , the future of the datacentre
Computing in the 21st century will be done at an unprecedented scale , connecting people across the continents to a vast network of business , social and entertainment services .
Providing compute capacity at that magnitude is today ’s top infrastructure challenge .
That challenge is being taken on by a new wave of ultra- dense hardware , combined with software designed to natively scale out .
Tomorrow ’s servers will be built upon multiple architectures , including Intel x86 and ARM , and will be connected into datacentre - wide clusters via flexible , high - speed fabrics .
At the heart of these clusters lies Ubuntu Server , the OS leading the cloud computing revolution .
Being the arrogant know - it - alls that we all are , it ’s rather too easy to make knee - jerk suppositions about the state of the MMO market , but recent research by Screen Digest ( via the BBC , via RPS - chum Dan Gril ) suggests it ’s in ruder health than is sometimes supposed .
Currently , the industry is growing , despite last year looking , from afar , a wee bit disastrous for anything that was n’t Warcraft .
In the US and Europe , there was a jump of some 22 % .
At a guess , that ’s got something to do with growing broadband adoption and the increasing take - up of MMOs by formerly non-habitual gamers .
Also that not enough people are bored of elves yet .
Coming out of this is also a top 10 of MMOs , and it ’s a slightly surprising one .
What ’s interesting is that it is n’t ordered by subscriber / user numbers , but by player spending .
It is , in hindsight , a sensible and obvious way to look at the market , but it changes what we thought we knew quite a bit .
Games that we often consider to be dwindinling ( e.g. Conan , City of Heroes , Everquest II … ) are , when squinted at like this , actually doing pretty well by dint of their fairly highly monthly subscription fees .
£ 9 / $ 9 times a couple of hundred thousand is , after all , pretty good money , so long as the server and staffing costs do n’t eat it it all .
Here ’s the run-down , pop-pickers :
1 ) World of Warcraft
2 ) Club Penguin
3 ) RuneScape
4 ) Eve Online
5 ) Final Fantasy XI
6 ) The Lord of the Rings Online
7 ) Dofus
8 ) Age of Conan
9 ) City of Heroes
10 ) EverQuest II
The bottom three are the surprises , but number 2 , Club Penguin , is a bit of a puzzler too .
Or , at least , it is in terms of most of the RPS Hivemind having never previously heard of it .
Granted , as Kieron noted earlier we receive chummy - aggressive emails like “ why no love for [ random reader ’s cause celebre ] ? ” about something or other we ’ve missed on a daily basis , but it ’s especially odd that something so big can pass under our sporadic mutual radar .
Or maybe it ’s just that the promise that we can “ waddle around and meet new friends ” sounds a little too much games industry press events for comfort .
It ’s a kid- orientated Disney effort , and like many rugrat - pleasers offers the choice of a limited free account or a bells ’n’ whistles - endowed monthly subscription .
RuneScape , which you probably have heard of , is a similar deal , but for a slightly older audience .
Warhammer Online is n’t , apparently , in there because its Winter 2008 launch means it was too late into this survey to make the chart , but Screendigest predict it making the number 3 spot next year .
This is presuming its already - reduced userbase does n’t dwindle too much by then , anyway .
And will Conan make it to another year ?
Before today , the smart money would have said no , but going on this it still seems profitable enough to keep going a while longer .
Med -resistant flu strain plagues patients in US Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday March 2 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
A virulent strain of influenza sowing misery across the United States is proving resistant to what had been until recently the most effective anti-viral drugs , according to a study released Monday .
A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) found that the H1N1 subtype of influenza A viruses commonly proved resistant to the popular drug oseltamivir .
Oseltamivir , sold commercially in the United States as the drug Tamiflu , is produced by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche , and is the main antiviral remedy on the market .
But during the 2007 - 2008 flu season last year , the Tamiflu - resistant strain of the virus accounted for fully one in five cases of flu in the United States .
Preliminary data during the current 2008 - 2009 influenza season shows that the virus 's resistance to the Tamiflu continues to be high and that the drug - resistant strain of the flu continue to have a high incidence .
Equally worrying is the virulence of this particular strain of flu .
Data last year for 99 individuals infected with oseltamivir - resistant influenza found that five of the patients had to be hospitalized , four of whom died .
The authors wrote that the worrisome development " has highlighted the need for the development of new antiviral drugs and rapid diagnostic tests that determine viral subtype or resistance . "
In an editorial accompanying the study , David Weinstock of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , and Gianna Zuccotti of Boston 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital said that the findings also show that researcher can never become complacent when treating the scourge .
" New surprises await in the perpetual struggle with influenza , " they wrote .
" One thing is certain -- the organism will continue to evolve . "

What ever happened to eye contact ?
This morning on my way into the office , I made some mental notes about how many people would studiously avoid making even fleeting eye contact with me .
Perhaps it was my clothing , body language or choice of hat ?
While seated on the train the odds were almost down to zero .
I know from the experience of riding the subway in New York this is tantamount to putting your life on the line and an urban superstition of some power , but even in laid back Los Angeles it ’s becoming just as bad .
At a time when we should be joining together , smiling into each others eyes and reaching out , it ’s becoming a progressively bleak picture .
Why ?
The superstition that someone staring at you and thereby giving you “ The Evil Eye ” goes back thousands of years and I suppose even further if you want to include the kind of thing that happens between primates if they stare at each other .
Try going to the zoo and having eye contact a male baboon in their cage – they go berserk .
I have seen signs on zoo cages warning not to provoke them this way and when I worked as a wild animal trainer , I was warned never to stare or have eye contact with chimpanzees for over a milli-second .
Tradition says that it all has to do with jealousy and coveting something from someone else .
In the case of the baboon cage , its tied into a mating ritual that spills over into that man / ape relationship we share .
Professor Alan Dundes who teaches at The University of California at Berkeley covers the subject quite well :
“ Almost everywhere that the evil eye belief exists , its effects are said to occur as an inadvertent side - effect of envy or praise .
A typical account of such a mishap might be : “ I dressed the baby in new clothes and took him to town and a woman who has no children saw him and said , ‘ Oh , what a pretty child ! ’ and as soon as we got home he began to vomit ! ”
The “ evil ” in these accounts of the evil eye indicate that it is thought to be situational in nature and that it is caused by a failure to restrain envy within proper social bounds . ”
There are hundreds of books on the subject .
Far too much information for me to attempt to go into here .
These beliefs are as entrenched as throwing salt over your shoulder .
Well , … maybe not your shoulder , but you get my drift .
Today we have a version of this juju where we hear about psychics claiming to be able to get someone to turn their head around by simply staring at the back of their neck .
Pssssshaw .
I try it everyday on the train and I know it NEVER works .
Let ’s see someone step up to Randi ’s million dollar challenge on that one .
That should be easy enough for even the lowest totem on the psychic totem pole to be able to replicate .
It ’s not happening .
It never has happened and I ’m challenging anyone out there who says they can do it to prove it or admit it ’s likely it never will happen .
These superstitions are with us day to day and haunt our thinking .
There I sat , knowing better and yet staring intently at the back of some random woman ’s head when I could have been putting that same intensity of thought on world hunger or alternative energy .
Silly me .
A small thought , but like someone said about other things , one thought here , another there and pretty soon you have a whole lot of thoughts .
In the case of The Evil Eye : centuries of wasted thought .
We can look and see The Evil Eye every where if we choose to .
Pattern recognition and pareidolia examples aside , go on line and witness hundreds of businesses peddling pendants , tattoos , bracelets , charms and amulets in every shape and form .
If it makes you feel safe wearing one of these , it ’s no different than a rabbit ’s foot .
Belief is everything , but logic and skepticism should tell us it was n’t very lucky for the rabbit was it ?
There ’s a whole reality show in there somewhere too .
Black magic , sorcery , figure casting , witchcraft and toying with The Evil Eye all have at their source the one main ingredient that makes all these charms , curses and fetishes work : FEAR .
It ’s all down to that in our supposedly sophisticated and intellectually advanced society is n’t it ?
The “ All - Knowing All Seeing Eye ” that brings to mind Orwell and Big Brother still works it ’s primal magic on us .
Do n’t think so ?
Think you are immune ?
No way .
Take a look at the world ’s most infamous network logo :
So can that all seeing eye turn itself in on itself and take a close look at the ancient cults , invocations and countless subliminal links it has made to all of our subconscious minds since it was first introduced into our living rooms back in 1951 ?
I might be asking too much here and posing a rhetorical question like trying to operate on your own eye or fixng your own teeth , but there ’s a method to my madness .
Is the CBS logo supposed to be watching out for us or at us ?
CBS logo designer William Golden has stated that the logo had shaker roots , but I ’m putting my money on a much more ancient and far more decidedly sinister lineage .
But then again , … that ’s just me .
Nonetheless , if you fancy yourself The Modern Television Executive
In the Know , it might be best to cover all your bases and eschew the rabbit ’s foot by spending six bucks for one of these :
As the executive who may indeed be in need of the proper etiquette and occult use of such bewitchery , please allow me to help you in the ways of the paranormal .

So what do these figures mean ?
A good handling stat allows to turn more easily .
A good off - road stat means that your vehicle is fast even when it's off the road , this can be pretty useful if you like using shortcuts .
The speed stat corresponds to the top speed which can sometimes hard to reach if your acceleration is poor .
It 's an important stat for time trials .
With a heavy vehicle ( weight stat ) you can smash through lighter vehicles , sometimes throwing them off the road but your jumps will be shorter .
The mini-turbos are those you can trigger when using manual drifting .
A high drift stat allows you to turn more sharply during drifts .
The higher the acceleration , the quicker you can reach high speeds after having been slowed down or stopped , it 's an important stat in the Grand Prix mode where you usually get hit pretty often .
Beginners will usually prefer good acceleration and handling stats whereas expert players will usually prefer faster vehicles at the cost of a poorer acceleration .
It brings me no end of wonderment that anyone would listen to anything Jenny McCarthy says .
Our evolved instinct to obey authority — if you sit still when the tribe leader yells " run ! " you ’re likely to become saber - tooth tiger nosh , and are unlikely to contribute to the gene pool — is clearly to blame here .
Still , we also have large and I ’m guessing generally unused portions of our brains which are built to override such foolish impulses .
Sure , Ms. McCarthy is something of a celebrity .
She ’s very pretty , attracting attention , and is actually very funny ( yes , I have a sophomoric sense of humor sometimes ) , so it ’s no surprise people might be tempted to listen to her .
But what she says is so mind - numbingly mind numbing .
Vaccines cause autism .
She cured her son of autism .
Her son is an Indigo child .
And so on .
Her latest ?
“ I love Botox , I absolutely love it , ” she said .
“ I get it minimally , so I can still move my face .
But I really do think it ’s a savior . ”
I see .
So injecting kids with scientifically - proven medicine that can save their lives and the lives of countless others is bad because of a fantasy - driven belief that it causes autism , but injecting a lethal pathogen — in fact , the most lethal protein known — into your face to help ease the globally threatening scourge of crow ’s feet is just fine and dandy .
Got it .
Oh , say : can you excuse me a second ?
I need to go over here for a sec …
Aaaaiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee !
If you want a little vaccination against her nonsense , read this spot - on op - ed in a student newspaper .
It ’s good to see some folks get it .
Tip o’ the syringe to BABloggees Philip W and Sparky .
The four are now split between two households , and between those who expect to stay and those who would return to Ecuador  a tally that keeps shifting .
The daughter , despite tireless efforts to get ahead , feels she is losing ground and worries that her brother takes his citizenship for granted .
The son , despite his freedom , carries the weight of his family ’s highest hopes .
Their status is also mixed in less obvious ways .
The mother , 47 , who gave up her fledgling career in Ecuador as a computer systems analyst and now baby - sits for a living , has not had anywhere near the same opportunities in this country as the father , also 47 , who found rewarding work as a draftsman .
Increasingly dissatisfied , she has tried in vain to leverage her son ’s citizenship to get a green card granting her permanent residency .
Still , they are a loving family , and better off than many illegal immigrants , making a comfortable life in a city that welcomes foreigners , with or without papers .
The parents are among a rising proportion of illegal immigrants with higher educations  at least one in every four are believed to have had some college  abandoning careers back home to try to vault their children into the American middle class in a single generation .
Yet as each year brings new setbacks , they hear the clock ticking and push their children harder .
For all the daughter ’s high ambitions , the mother never misses a chance to point out a simple solution to her career impasse : find an American husband .
One Saturday night last month , the family gathered to celebrate the daughter ’s 22nd birthday in a Chinese restaurant where most of the tables were filled for a raucous wedding reception .
As they waited under the swirling disco lights for dishes of pork and seafood , the parents asked the children about their plans  for school , for work , for life .
The son was characteristically vague , saying only that he wanted to attend college .
The daughter , as usual , had her future worked out in fine detail : graduate school , community work , a life of service and independence .
But they could barely be heard above the dance music pounding through the restaurant .
As a toast was raised to the bride and groom , the din grew louder .
Dozens of guests clinked their spoons on glasses .
Testing AJAX Views in Django¶
A lot of the Django code we use at work has a special case for AJAX .
It has been a kind of a pain to test , because the test client by default does n’t use AJAX .
Luckily the is_ajax call in the Django HttpRequest object is a simple check of an HTTP Environmental variable .
An undocumented feature of the Django Test Client is that you can pass in custom HTTP ENV variables on requests .
The definition of get for example is :
def get ( self , path , data = {} , follow = False , ** extra ) :
Later on in the file , the request environment is then updated with the extra keyword args : r.update ( extra ) .
This lets us throw in arbitrary variables in our get and post requests in the test client .
Like so :
r = self .
client .
post ( ' / ratings / vote / ' , { ' value ' : ' 1 ' ,} , HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH
= ' XMLHttpRequest ' )
Note that the custom env is outside of the dictionary of get parameters .
This will now return the /ratings / vote / view with the output that is normally called on an AJAX request .
She was a disciplined , fearless young woman of great promise , a Wesleyan University junior with a passion for women ’s health issues .
He was apparently disturbed , a man with shaky relationships and a malevolence toward Jews , threatening them and others on the campus in Middletown , Conn. , in a journal he kept .
The lives of Johanna Justin - Jinich , 21 , and Stephen P. Morgan , 29 , had intersected briefly  and ominously  two years ago , when both attended a summer course at New York University .
He called repeatedly and sent 38 harassing e-mail messages .
The university and the police were notified , but he had left town and she declined to press charges .
There was no way to foresee the sudden , nightmarish sequel .
Mr. Morgan walked into a campus bookstore about 1 p.m. Wednesday , then toward the Red and Black Cafe , where Ms. Justin - Jinich worked .
He was a bearded , menacing figure on the overhead surveillance camera , a dark gun in his right hand swinging at his side , and something else hidden behind him in his left hand .
It was a long - stranded wig and he put it on , the baldish man undergoing a bizarre transformation as he confronted her , raised the gun and opened fire , a point - blank , seven - shot execution , officials said .
Ms. Justin - Jinich fell , mortally wounded .

Debbie Zukerman meets people from both sides of the tracks on Melbourne 's public transport system .
MELBOURNE'S public transport system is fraught with drama , and like all good drama , it has heroes and villains — a cast of characters from singing tram drivers to stony - faced ticket inspectors who can provoke powerful emotions .
Recently , I was on a tram at 6.30 am with an Early Bird ticket ( which allows free transport before 7 am ) , when a ticket inspector approached .
She took one look at my Metcard and proceeded to inform me that unlike every other ticket in the public transport system , these tickets were only valid on trains .
I was stunned .
I offered to validate a brand - new , 10 x 2 , hourly ticket , but she refused and instead confiscated it !
The proceeds from this article will go towards paying the fine .
If this were a movie , the villain would be the litigious Department of Transport .
Lynne Kosky stars as its inept leader , babbling her way through disaster after disaster .
" In for a penny , in for a pound ! " is her battle cry as she throws more than $ 1 billion at the troubled myki ticket system in lieu of buying trains and laying tracks .
Meanwhile , her army of green - clad ticket inspectors are doing their best to get it all back .
Remember when you could reason your way out of a misdemeanour ?
Well , those days ended a few years ago when operators ( Connex , Yarra Trams , etc ) began getting a commission from fines .
And the zealous ticket inspectors ?
Maybe they get a gold star for everyone they catch , and at the end of the month , whoever has the most stars gets a $ 20 voucher .
Can you explain your company in 30 seconds or less ?
No , I do n’t mean what you do .
I mean , why you do it ?

These days colorful lines are one of the most malleable effects you can easily create in Photoshop .
They simply fit everywhere and can look really awesome .
In this tutorial , you 'll learn how to create these fantastic colorful effects using only Photoshop .
I 'll show you how to compose illustration with these effects .
Let 's get to it !
Video Tutorial
Our video editor Gavin Steele has created this video tutorial to compliment this text + image tutorial .
Preparation
First let 's grab the photos we 'll be using in this tutorial : girl and teddy , which are taken from one of my favorite stock sites 123rf.com .
And one balloon photo from sxc.hu .
Step 1
Start by opening the girl image , then grab the Pen Tool ( P ) and start extracting .
When you 're done making the path , right - click and select Make Selection .
Then use Command +
C to copy the selected area .
While extracting , take a look at the arrows , they indicate shadows .
Make sure you do n't include them with the girl .
We 're gonna cast shadows on our own depending on the color of the background .
Step 2
Create a new document that is 1200 pixels by 950 pixels , with a of 300 px / inch .
Make a new layer and name it " Background . " change your Foreground Color to # f0ce46 and Background Color to # f78414 .
Grab the Gradient Tool ( G ) , then in the upper bar set the gradient option to Radial .
Now drag the gradient from the top left corner .
Use Command +
V to paste our extracted girl .
Name this layer " Girl " and go to Image > Adjustments >
Selective Color and experiment with the Red and Yellow values .
I tried to give the girl some color correction to make her a better fit to this orange environment .
Tip : Your background colors are up to personal taste .
I 'll show you the way I did this illustration , but if you choose some other colors ( for example blue tones ) , then you should correct the girl 's color into colder rather than warmer tones .
Step 3
Now grab the Burn Tool ( O ) , then set the Range to Midtones and Exposure to around 30 % .
Make sure the " Girl " layer is selected , and give some contrast to her hair by painting .
And if other spots of her silhouette seem to be little dull , you can apply this process again .
Step 4
OK , we did some nice color and contrast corrections .
But it 's still not enough .
Now it 's something important because we need to make her look more vivid , and also cast some shadows under her body .
I made a fast three - step guide below .
Let 's take a look at what we 're going to do with this girl image and how .
First thing we wanna do is cast shadows .
So take a look at point 1 below .
This is the original image we are using .
Zoom into the shadows under the girl , and as you see we have quite easy task .
This picture already guided us on how the shadows were originally placed .
So what you need to do now is reproduce the same shadow effect ( as point 3 illustrates ) .
Use point 1 as the guide for this process .
However , before you do anything , let 's move to the next step .
If you 're using some other picture than mine , and there is no standard shadow in yours , then I recommend seeing one of my plus tutorials with moving mannequins .
There are tons of tips in that tutorial on how to place shadows when you have no base .
Step 5
Before we move forward , make new layer above the " Background " layer .
Name it " Ground . "
Change your Foreground Color to # ffe07 c , grab the Gradient Tool ( G ) , then in the upper bar set the option to Radial .
Drag the gradient to the middle of that screen .
Now you should have a big yellow dot .
Then go to Edit > Transform >
Distort and give this big dot some perspective to make it look like there is ground there ( second image below ) .
Create a new layer below the " Girl " layer .
Name it " Shadow . "
Change the color to something around # 8f4121 ( brown ) .
Grab the Brush Tool ( B ) , set Hardness to 0 % , Flow to around 10 % , and keep your Master Diameter quite small .
Then start painting under the girl - where the shadows should be .
Make the diameter size very dynamic , and change it all the time for various results .
Help yourself with the Eraser Tool ( E ) , and set Hardness to 0 % and Flow to 50 % .
As I pointed in previous step , use the original image to see how the shadows look , and cast them the same way .
It does n't have to be perfect , give this girl at least a touch of shadow to make it look more realistic .
Also , if it 's necessary , change your color to darker and lighter brown .
Casting shadows is always a tough part of art , but it pays off well .
You need to work with patience .
Remember , every single color depends on the environment .
I 'm making everything in warm tones , so I mostly mix yellow and orange .
As for the shadows , I darkened the yellow tone ( which is our ground color ) and I turned out with brown .
The reason I did this is because every object 's shadow has a touch of color from the ground that it occupies .
Step 6
Now select the " Girl " layer .
Go to Image > Adjustments >
Levels , and add a little more contrast .
Then go to Image > Adjustments >
Hue / Saturation and lower the value of Saturation .
We do n't want to make this girl too bright though .
Next , go to balance the picture and give some nice color depth , duplicate ( Command +J ) the " Girl " layer , and name it " Color depth . "
Change this layer 's Blending Mode to Soft Light and then use Image > Adjustments > Gradient Map .
Set the gradient from # 1b130 c to # 969696 .
Depending on what you want to achieve , your colors in the gradient mapping will be different .
I recommend you experiment with these colors .
There are many nice results that can be discovered .
However , if you have no idea how to take care of gradient map settings , just set it to Black , White and lower the layers opacity just a touch .
This always looks good .
The last image below is just a view of how this girl should look ( with the background turned off ) .
Tip : Before you run the gradient map , make sure you changed the layer 's blending mode do Soft Light .
Next you will get the final image preview while using the particular gradient .
Step 7
I turned the orange " Background " layer back on , though it needs to be brightened .
So , let 's work on that now .
We 'll also start working on adding our paths , which will become our malleable colored lines .
Make a new layer above the " Background " layer and name it " Back colors . "
Change the color to # efd8a5 ( a nice bright yellow ) .
Grab the Brush Tool ( B ) , set Hardness to 0 % , Flow around 20 - 40 % and make one or several big dots behind this girl .
Switch to the Pen Tool ( P ) .
Then start creating some nice paths surrounding this girl .
If you 're having some problems with the Pen Tool , you may check out this Comprehensive Guide to Photoshop 's Pen Tool to learn how to properly set the path curves properly .
Step 8
Create a new group above the " Girl " layer .
Name it " Blue line " and create there a new layer called " b_line " as well .
Then go back to the Brush Tool ( B ) , change the settings to Hardness 100 % , Flow 100 % and the Master Diameter to 7 - 10 px ( depending on how big your image is ) .
Next , go to the brush settings and set the Minimum Roundness to 25 % .
Then switch to the Pen Tool ( P ) .
Right - click and select Stroke Path .
Remember to make sure that the Simulate Pressure option is checked .
We will be using this throughout this tutorial with every path stroke ( be sure to keep this checked ) , so I will stop reminding from here forward .
It does n't matter what kind of color you stroke this path because we 're going to color it through blending options .
So , if you do n't want to get confused , you can use white as the color to stroke this path .
Now press Command + right - click on the " Girl " layer 's thumbnail to load selection .
Next , add a Layer Mask to the " b_line " layer , and select this mask .
Grab the Brush Tool ( B ) with the color black selected , set all brush settings up to 100 % , to make it hard .
Then paint in spots indicated in the second image below .
We need to create an effect that the line is surrounding this girl .
Issue : I do n't know what 's the cause of the Brush Options - Minimum Roundness option failure , but sometimes it 's not possible to turn it on .
If you receive this problem just simply restart your Photoshop .
The next thing to do is to open the brush options and make sure this is set to 25 % .
Step 9
Now let 's play around with this line 's Blending Options .
The standard blending options settings make everything very flat with an absolute lack of depth .
Even though I 've seen people applying custom settings , they still had problems with avoiding the flat look .
So you need to be very accurate with this .
Depending on what color you want to make your line , the layer styles will be different .
If you decide to colorize it with blue , you need play around with many various tones of blue .
Also , very important thing is the Gloss Contour in Bevel and Emboss setting ( second image below ) .
I customized the Mapping to fit my own needs .
If you play around with these anchors you will get the idea how it works .
Make sure you have the option Preview checked , then you can apply effects in real time .
Another important thing is the Angle and Altitude of Shading ( the option above Gloss Contour - second image below ) .
Spend some time while adjusting this little target .
It 's the option that allows you to cast lights properly .
Step 10
Now grab Brush Tool ( B ) , set Hardness to 0 % change Master Diameter dynamically between 1px and 2px by making more paths and stroke them the same way .
We will make some touch ups to make this blue line complete .
So create new layer above " b_line " name it " b_line fills " , and create paths .
Make many paths by starting and ending in different points .
Looks images below .
At 3rd and 4th image , those arrows indicate some spots , where I placed anchors .
I did it dynamically setting various points and various brush size from 1 px to 2 px .
If you are bothered with some unwanted lines , just simply erase them using Eraser Tool ( E ) of 0 % Hardness and 50 % Flow .
Step 11
I assume you got the idea of making these fills .
So make more lines , apply them to spots of your own choice .
Now let 's take care of coloring these small lines .
Basically , I copied layer styles from the " b_line " layer and pasted it to the " b_line fills " layer .
Then I entered the " b_line fills " layer Blending Options and just changed the color of Inner Glow to lighter blue # c1dbff .
You may also change the Satin color to some other blue tone .
I set the # 54 abbb color for Satin .
It did n't change a lot .
The changes are barely visible , but now these fills are n't just one color .
I did n't play around with the " b_line fills " layer styles because these lines are very small and all effects would be hard to notice .
It 's enough if you just change the color of inner glow ( and if you want , for satin also ) as said before .
Step 12
Let 's follow the same process as in Step 9 .
This new line will cross the blue line and we 'll fill it with green tones .
So create a new group above the " Blue lines " group , name it " Green line . "
Create a new layer in it , and name it " g_line . "
Grab the Brush Tool ( B ) and change the Master Diameter size to 6 - 8 px , set Hardness and Flow to 100 % .
Next grab the Pen Tool ( P ) , draw a nice path crossing the blue line , then right - click and select Stroke Path .
After this apply the same effects as previously , and play around with Shading in Bevel and Emboss .
And this time use green colors for all options .
When your done , grab the Eraser Tool ( E ) and make sure the " g_line " layer is selected .
Then erase some parts where both these lines cross to give some depth .
You 're free to make this using a Layer Mask also .
Either way is fine .
Step 13
Now , we 're just repeating Steps 10 and 11 , but on the green line now .
So make a new layer in this " Green line " group , name it " g_line fills . "
Now grab the Brush Tool ( B ) , set Hardness and Flow to 0 % , change Master Diameter dynamically between 1px and 2px and make many paths .
Then stroke them .
After this , copy the layer styles from " g_line " and paste it to " g_line fills " , same way as you did previously .
And you do n't need to brighten the colors of " g_line fills " layer , they already look good .
But if you want , make sure you brighten Inner Glow 's color .
If you are bothered with some unwanted lines , just simply erase them using the Eraser Tool ( E ) with Hardness set to 0 % and 50 % Flow .
Step 14
OK , looking good .
Now , we 'll make the next line a little more interesting .
So create a new group above all and name it " Pink line . "
Create a new layer in it and name it " p_ring . "
Grab the Pen Tool ( P ) and draw a curvy path around girl 's leg ( instead of drawing a path you can use the Ellipse Tool ( U ) and create a circle instead ) .
Then right - click and select Stroke Path .
Next , apply some nice layer styles the same way as previously .
You can use my settings or experiment with your own .
Step 15
If your ring needs some touch ups , select the " p_ring " layer , duplicate this layer ( Command + J ) , go to Edit > Transform > Flip Vertical and adjust it to make an ellipse .
Then grab the Eraser Tool ( E ) and erase some parts to make it look like it was surrounding her leg .
When you 're done , select the " p_ring " layer again , duplicate it ( Command + J ) 3 - 4 times , and using Edit >
Free Transform make those rings fit the girl 's leg .
Step 16
Create a new layer , name it " p_line , " grab the Pen Tool ( P ) and draw a nice curvy path .
This will be our third line .
Go to Blending Options and apply same effects as previously .
In this case , you need to play around with Bevel and Emboss > Shading .
Make sure the Angle and Altitude fit your needs .
Depending on what direction your line is going and what kind of shape it has , the shading will be different .
You need to adjust it while you start getting something satisfying .
Step 17
This is another process to repeat .
Use the same directions as in Steps 10 and 11 , but for the pink line .
In a shortcut : create a new layer called " p_line fills , " draw some paths around the main line using the Pen Tool ( P ) , and stroke them with 1 px or 2 px soft brush .
Next , copy the layer style from the " p_line " layer and paste it to the " p_line fills " layer .
Step 18
Now let 's play around creativity .
Select the " p_line fills " layer , then grab the Lasso Tool ( L ) and draw a selection around some cool looking torn lines ( first image below ) .
Then right - click , and select Layer Via Copy .
This will copy the piece we selected with its layer styles included .
Now right - click on this copied layer and select Convert to Smart Object .
After this , make around 4 - 5 duplicates ( Command + J ) and spread them around this pink line .
Make some rotations using Edit > Free Transform .
The reason we used Convert to Smart Object option , is not to let these pieces pixelize .
Since they are smart objects , you are able to resize this piece down and rotate it as many times as you want without losing quality .
But do n't resize it up , as it is not a vector object .
Step 19
Go back to the " Blue line " group and apply the same effects as in the previous step .
And you can do this to each line that you 've created .
I recommend playing around with colors of these line fills , you may achieve some cool results .
Try to make them fit to the lines that they are connected to .
Step 20
Now we 'll create some more great effects .
People used to make these kind of shapes with Illustrator , and export them to Photoshop .
Well , not everyone knows how to properly use Illustrator , so I 'll show you how to create these shapes in Photoshop .
The only disadvantage is that shapes will remain raster objects , but it 's OK , as they 're very easy to recreate .
First create a new group above all , name it " blue drops . "
Inside this group , create a new layer called " b_drop . "
Go to the Brushes Palette ( Window > Brushes ) .
Select Shape Dynamics and apply the settings shown below .
Then make sure your brush is set to 100 % Hardness and 100 % Flow .
In the Brushes Palette select Brush Tip Shape ( second image below ) and apply the settings again .
Make sure that the Spacing is set to 1 % .
About the Diameter size , it depends how big you want your shapes to look like .
But for this tutorial , I recommend following all the settings shown below .
Next , select the Ellipse Tool ( U ) , while holding Shift , draw a circle , around the same size as you see in the third image below .
Then select the Pen Tool ( P ) , right - click , and select Stroke Path .
Step 21
Go to " b_drop " layer 's Blending Options and play around with these settings .
This is important because standard layer styles give a very flat look .
To avoid this make sure your shape has proper colors , highlights and shading .
Step 22
Now that you have created the 3D shape , it 's time to duplicate it ( Command + J ) a few times and fit to the main blue line .
Remember , always have one shape as a backup , so make one of these duplicates invisible ( you never know when you may need it ) .
As for the rest of the copies , depending on what you want to do , we 'll leave some shapes as regular objects and turn some of them into smart objects .
In the previous steps , I 've explained how you can use smart objects .
And I used it only in one shape here ( layer right - click > Convert to Smart Object ) because I searched for a good spot for this shape and I rotated ( Edit > Transform > Rotate ) it many times .
As for the rest rest of the objects , I did n't convert them into smart objects , because I wanted them to retain their layer styles .
And as you resize down these normal objects , the layer styles stay untouched , and they stay connected .
You can see in the image below that the small shapes are darker .
For example , the Inner Glow has the same value , but the object got smaller .
And the point of all this is that you need to rotate these shapes to make them look like they where in motion , while dropping little pieces .
It 's good to make each one look different then the others .
Step 23
As you remember , we named this layer " b_drop " ( the b letter stands for blue ) .
And I mentioned that you 're supposed to backup one " b_drop " layer .
So make a copy of this untouched layer and rename it " g_drop . "
Create a new group , name it " green drops " and drag the " g_drop " layer into this group .
Then change this layer 's Blending Options .
Set all the colors for various green tones .
Also , play around with Bevel and Emboss >
Shading ( second image below ) .
Then repeat the same process as the previous step .
Make a few duplicates ( Command + J ) of this green drop and make them look dynamic ( use Edit > Transform > Rotate ) .
Step 24
Same thing here .
As we made three lines , and each in different colors , we need to make their drops in pretty much the same colors .
So repeat the previous steps of creating drops and apply this technique creating now pink drops .
You always need to find the right colors .
Start experimenting with them , and you will see which setting in Blending Options is more important then the other .
Try to spend as much time as you need to get this right .
Step 25
After you 're done with all the lines and drops it 's time to touch up the background .
Simply grab the Brush Tool ( B ) , set the Master Diameter to a fairly large brush , change the Hardness to 0 % , and Flow to around 12 - 15 % .
Create a new layer above the " Background " layer and name it " background color . "
Change your colors as shown below , and just paint .
Apply a very light brushing , the Flow option reacts to pressure .
If you brush in one place too much , the color will be more intensive , so brush with single light clicks .
Do n't hold the mouse button as you brush .
Tip : you can make each color on a new layer and then play around with their opacities .
Step 26
OK , the background looks fantastic , it 's deep and balanced .
Now we can move further .
Open the balloon image , and extract it using the Magic Wand Tool ( W ) .
We can use this tool , as this balloon is easy extractable .
It was probably cut out before and saved on the white background .
Place it into your main project , resize it down and flip it horizontally ( use Edit > Transform to do this ) .
Rename it to " green balloon " and apply some color adjustments .
You can find them under :
Image > Adjustments > Hue / Saturation

Step 27
Drag the " red balloon " to our main project again , and make a duplicate of it ( Command + J ) .
Name the first " pink balloon " and the second " blue balloon . "
For the " pink balloon " use only Image > Adjustments >
Hue / Saturation because it 's red , and we want to get something in between purple and pink .
For the " blue balloon " use :
Image > Adjustments > Hue / Saturation
Image > Adjustments > Selective Color
Image > Adjustments >
Brightness / Contrast
Step 28
Now bring back the brush settings from Step 8 .
Create two new layers , then name them " blue rope " and " green rope . "
Next , draw some curvy paths on each layer below the balloon .
Make sure your brush size is 1 px big and it 's 100 % Flow .
Right - click and select Stroke Path .
Use blue and green colors to stroke the paths .
You can also copy the layer styles from previous lines / drops and paste them into these rope line layer styles .
Step 29
Now , this is my favorite part of the tutorial .
You probably will enjoy this too .
Create a new group above the " Background " layer , name it " Effects " and work in this group now .
Grab the Custom Shape Tool ( U ) , set its options to Shape Layers , and pick a shape of your own choice ( the settings are shown in the first image below ) .
Find some empty spot on our illustration and work there .
Create this path ( you can hold Shift to get a perfect shape ) .
It should automatically be filled with your Foreground Color , which can be white .
Name this layer " Orange , " the go to Blending Options and apply some nice effects to it .
I tried to get some tones of orange color , from brown to yellow .
And it does n't really matter where the shading is .
The only thing you need is to have some nice one - color variety here ( using different tones ) .
Step 30
Now we have a nice vector shape , and it 's editable .
Go to Edit > Transform >
Warp , then bend and twist this shape to get a satisfying result .
I simply love this step , you can be very creative with these shapes .
After each transform hit enter and go again with Edit > Transform >
Warp .
The whole bending below is done this way , warp / enter / warp / enter , and so on , to achieve better results .
The best thing about this is that this shape remains vector , even though it 's getting bent to the max .
Step 31
What we came up with here is an awesome shape ( still vector ! ) , and we can now position it everywhere .
While repeating thing process , we can cover the whole back of this girl using various shapes .
Now , using this technique make more shapes like this , then place them behind this girl and make them fit .
Use the Copy / Paste Layer Styles option every time you make a new shape .
Do not adjust each one manually because you 're gonna waste time .
Here is something you need to remember : although this is vector , it may get sharpen sometimes .
If you twist this shape so much to get a very thin line , some jagged edges may occur .
So be aware , if you receive something like this , start again with a new shape .
Or you can rasterize the vector object ( right - click on the layer , select Rasterize Layer ) .
Next , use the Eraser Tool ( E ) with the Hardness of 0 % and Flow of 80 - 100 % to erase some bad looking spots .
Step 32
That 's all for the small shapes .
Now , let 's take care for the bigger lines .
I used the same technique to create the line that you see in first image below .
Next , I rasterize this layer ( right - click and Rasterize Layer ) , and the using Eraser Tool ( E ) , I erased some spots .
There is a small case study in images below :
In second image below , I made this line fit the back of balloon .
In third image below , I created a new shape using the same technique .
In the next images , I just duplicated ( Command + J ) this curvy line .
I rasterized the layer when needed ( layer right - click > Rasterize Layer ) , and used the Eraser Tool ( E ) .
To place these lines use Edit > Transform > Rotate .
The whole process of positioning these lines took me around 30 minutes because I changed this like ten times .
So do n't give up , the more effort you put in this , the better it will look .
Step 33
OK , now just simply repeat Steps 29 , 30 , and 31 , but in green .
Using the same technique , create several green shapes and place them behind this girl and mix them with orange shapes .
Step 34
At this moment I thought , I would show you something cool .
As you have created some thin , green shapes like you see in the first image below , use Edit > Transform >
Warp again .
Now try to stretch it to create a nice curve ( second image below ) .
Now go to Edit >
Transform , and rotate this shape to make it fit some parts of the green line ( third image below ) .
Run Edit > Transform >
Warp again and perfectly adjust it with the line .
After this you can right - click on this layer , select Rasterize Layer , grab the Eraser Tool ( E ) and erase some unwanted parts .
Also , if some edges got jagged , use the Smudge Tool ( R ) with a Strength of 12 % .
Now smudge the edges towards the line ( you can see it in the 5 - 6 images below ) .
Step 35
OK , now let 's do some final touch ups .
Grab the Brush Tool ( B ) , set Hardness to 0 % and Flow to around 10 % .
Change your Foreground Color to # 481e39 , create a new layer above the " pink balloon " layer and name it " p_drop shadow . "
Then start painting below this drop to create a nice touch of shadow .
Next , select the layer of this drop ( that is shown in images below ) use Command + J to duplicate it .
Work with this copy now .
Take a look at the third image below : in Blending Options change the size of Inner Glow for the drop copy .
Next lower its Opacity and place it below the " p_drop shadow " layer to create a reflection .
Step 36
To give this illustration some meaning I decided to put here some funny thing like this Teddy .
I thought , there 's a little girl , lots of colors , so let 's give it a touch of cuteness .
So , cut the bear out of its original image using the Pen Tool ( P ) .
Drag it to our main project document .
Name this layer " Teddy " and place it above all the layers .
Now let 's do some color adjustments using Image > Adjustments >
Hue / Saturation and then Image > Adjustments >
Levels .
Duplicate the " Teddy " layer using Command + J and select this copy now .
Change its Blending Options to Soft Light .
Go to Image > Adjustments >
Black and White , and give this teddy some nice deep colors and a touch of contrast .
I still thought this teddy needs some more color .
So I held down Command and left - clicked on the " Teddy " layer 's thumbnail to bring the selection .
Then I created a new layer above all layers .
Changed its Blending Mode to Overlay .
Next , I set my Foreground Color to # fbc83a , grabbed a Brush Tool ( B ) with a very soft brush and painted inside this selection just a little .
Step 37
As you still have this selection on , hit Command +
Shift + C ( copy merged ) and then press two times Command + V ( paste ) .
Place these teddies the way you see in the first image below .
Next , take one of them and place behind the " Green balloon , " and make his arm look like a leg .
Now create a reflection with the second teddy .
So select another copy of teddy and go to Edit > Transform >
Distort and make this bear more flat ( second image below ) .
Place it below the original " Teddy " layer to make it look like a reflection .
If you get some outgoing edges of this reflection - erase them using the Eraser Tool ( E ) .
Apply the same technique to make a reflection of his leg ( as you can see in fourth image below ) .
Next , bring the selection of the " Green balloon " layer ( hold Command and left - click on the " Green balloon " layer 's thumbnail ) .
Now create a new layer below the " Teddy " layer and change your Foreground Color to # 212b04 .
Grab the Brush Tool ( B ) , make the brush settings very soft with Hardness 0 % , Flow 10 - 15 % , and paint under teddy to create some shadow .
Hit Command + D to deselect selection .
Step 38
So we are heading to the end .
Hit Command +
A to select the whole canvas , then press Command +
Shift + C ( copy merged ) .
Go to the top of the Layers Palette and hit Command +
V to paste this whole piece .
Name this layer " final colored " and set it 's Blending Mode to " Soft Light . "
Now go to Image > Adjustments >
Gradient Map , and find some nice satisfying colors to balance this illustration .
There are my colors written below .
I added them and lowered the Opacity of this layer just a touch .
Conclusion
So here it is , the cool colorful illustration covered with lines and shapes .
You have to be very careful while creating your own colorful piece .
The colors are something that separates good art from weak art .
When you understand how it works , all your designs will start to look professional .
Always remember to keep the overall balance .
Everything needs its own place in a quality illustration .
Also , do n't forget about the shading .
Objects look good when they are based on reality .

We ’re supplying the weapons and funding to both sides in the civil war between the Mexican drug cartels and the central government .
Republican state senator from Arizona , John Paton , is quoted by Randal C. Archibold in The New York Times summarizing our relationship with Mexico :
They send us drugs and people , and we send them guns and cash .
Though he probably did n’t intend it so , this remark works on several levels , illustrating how some of our current policies are the largest factors contributing to the destabilization of Mexico .
On the one hand , as Rick Perry , Republican governor of Texas , recently acknowledged :
Many of the guns aimed at Mexican law enforcement passed through our state , as did so many of the dollars funding those violent gangs .
It is estimated that $ 12 – $ 15 billion dollars is funneled to Mexico through the illegal drug trade and as James C. McKinley , Jr. in the New York Times reported :
A.T.F. officials estimate 90 percent of the weapons recovered in Mexico come from dealers north of the border .
In addition to weapons from legitimate dealers , some significant number of weapons have apparently been stolen from U.S. military bases and gotten into the hands of the Mexican cartels , which are now more heavily armed than the local police and in some cases , the military .
Many members – and indeed , some entire police forces – have been coopted by the cartels through a combination of bribery and violence .
Mexico ’s former drug czar was arrested for taking bribes from the cartels ; the Juarez police chief resigned after the cartels began systematically killing police officers until he resigned ; just last week , a top investigative police officer was killed along with 10 members of his family .
More than 6,000 people were killed last year in Mexico ’s war .
Even allowing for politically expedient exaggeration , the fact that a top Mexican cabinet official would claim that the power of the drug cartels has grown to such a level that “ the next president of the republic [ could ] be a narco - trafficker ” demonstrates how serious a force the drug cartels are .
At the same time as American dollars and American guns have been powering the cartels , the America government has been funding the Mexican government ’s war against the cartels .
Most recently , with the Mérida Initiative , American has begun to funnel almost half a billion dollars a year to the Mexican government – most of it in the form of weaponry .
A local television station described it as :
a plan to give 1 point four billion dollars in weapons and training to Mexico called the Merida Initiative is still under fire .
Critics say arming Mexico could backfire … like it has in the past with other countries .
But Kilburn says this plan seems well thought out .
“ You are talking about buying heavy equipment , machinery , surveillance helicopters , airplanes and these things are less likely to get in the wrong hands . ”
The cartels have taken to smuggling drugs in submarines ; they have stolen U.S. army equipement ; they often outgun the Mexican police ; former Drug Czar General Barry McCaffrey described the situation :
The outgunned Mexican law enforcement authorities face armed criminal attacks from platoon - sized units employing night vision goggles , electronic intercept collection , encrypted communications , fairly sophisticated information operations , sea-going submersibles , helicopters and modern transport aviation , automatic weapons , RPG ’s , Anti-Tank 66 mm rockets , mines and booby traps , heavy machine guns , 50 [ caliber ] sniper rifles , massive use of military hand grenades , and the most modern models of 40 mm grenade machine guns .
But these items we are giving now are “ less likely to get in the wrong hands . ”
I ’m relieved .
The violence in Mexico is escalating .
The San Francisco Chronicle recently called Mexico :
the latest and most sweeping test of the “ too big to fail ” imperative as White House policymakers try to steady a shaky world …
Given our current situation – funding and supplying weapons to both sides of this war on our border – it ’s hard to see how can prevent Mexico from failing .
The gun laws – and enforcement of laws preventing gun smuggling across the border – can be tweaked and made more effective .
But this is not enough .
We are contributing $ 400 odd million to combat the cartels and supplying the cartels with tens of billions of dollars at the same time .
Yet , we cannot allow these violent gangs to take over Mexico – and we should not countenance their undermining of the rule of law in Mexico .
Our prohibitionist approach is failing ; our war is failing ; what we must do is take a step back and evaluate our Drug War policies from a strategic perspective and see what changes we can make that might help stabilize our neighbor .
Arizona ’s attorney general , Terry Goddard , is careful not to suggest he supports the decriminalization of marijuana , but the facts he offers do suggest a course of action :
Right now , the item that ’s fueling the violent cartels , the murders in Mexico , the cartel wars that are going on right now that have resulted in over 1,000 deaths this year , I think we need to take a very aggressive stand on that and marijuana is the number one producer for the cartels .
Sixty to 70 percent of their gross profits comes from marijuana .
So , I think we need to look very hard at something we have n’t looked at for years .
As the report recently issued by the former presidents of Mexico , Brazil , and Columbia stated :
Current drug repression policies are firmly rooted in prejudices , fears and ideological visions .
The report went on to suggest what is beginning to look like the consensus , common - sense approach : if we ca n’t win while funding both sides of this war , we should try to dry up the source of funding and decriminalize , perhaps even legalize , marijuana .

EVEN in a culture in which sex toys are a booming business and Oprah Winfrey discusses living your best life in the bedroom , a coed live - in commune dedicated to the female orgasm hovers at the extremes .
The founder of the One Taste Urban Retreat Center , Nicole Daedone , sees herself as leading “ the slow - sex movement , ” one that places a near - exclusive emphasis on women ’s pleasure — in which love , romance and even flirtation are not required .
“ In our culture , admitting our bodies matter is almost an admission of failure , ” said Ms. Daedone , 41 , who can quote the poet Mary Oliver and speak wryly on the intricacies of women ’s anatomy with equal aplomb .
“ I do n’t think women will really experience freedom until they own their sexuality . ”
A core of 38 men and women — their average age the late 20s — live full time in the retreat center , a shabby - chic loft building in the South of Market district .
They prepare meals together , practice yoga and mindfulness meditation and lead workshops in communication for outside groups as large as 60 .
She also caught sight of hippos – although she said they " ... may be able to run at 30 mph , but mostly they lie about un- photogenically like vast industrial garbage bags .
You start to imagine that the moment the Jeep leaves , a hippo yells ' Coast clear ! ' and they leap up and do highlights from A Chorus Line "
In this post I want to discuss some general issues that arise naturally in the light of how the polymath experiment has gone so far .
First , let me say that for me personally this has been one of the most exciting six weeks of my mathematical life .
That is partly because it is always exciting to solve a problem , but a much more important reason is the way this problem was solved , with people chipping in with their thoughts , provoking other people to have other thoughts ( sometimes almost accidentally , and sometimes more logically ) , and ideas gradually emerging as a result .
Incidentally , many of these ideas are still to be properly explored : at some point the main collaboration will probably be declared to be over ( though I suppose in theory it could just go on and on , since its seems almost impossible to clear up every interesting question that emerges ) and then I hope that the comments will be a useful resource for anybody who wants to find some interesting open problems .
The sheer speed at which all this happened contributed to the excitement .
In my own case it led to my becoming fairly obsessed with the project and working on it to the exclusion of almost everything else ( apart , obviously , from things I absolutely had to do ) .
But how does what happened compare with my initial fantasy about what might happen ?
Looked at from that point of view , it was more successful in some ways and less in others .
On the plus side , the mathematical result of the project has far exceeded what I thought would be possible in a mere six weeks .
I deliberately set a rather modest aim : to explore just one approach to DHJ ( 3 ) .
In retrospect , this seems not to have been the right decision , though it may have been quite good as a starting point , since in the end we moved off into other directions that were more fruitful ( not that I completely rule out a proof along the lines first envisaged , especially given some of the tools that we have now developed ) .
Anyhow , these initial restrictions were quietly abandoned , and it looks as though we have proved a stronger result than seemed remotely feasible then .
( More precisely , if we had managed to get my initial suggestion to work , it would probably have been unpleasant , though not impossible , to generalize . )
Also on the plus side , the project has been genuinely collaborative , and has led , to a remarkable extent , to the kind of efficiency gains that I was hoping for .
To give one example , Randall McCutcheon made some very useful comments , but they were in the language of ergodic theory , which I understand only in a very limited way .
But Terence
Tao is a master at translating concepts back and forth between combinatorics and ergodic theory , so I was able to benefit from Randall ’s contributions indirectly .
But something I found more striking than the opportunity for specialization of this kind was how often I found myself having thoughts that I would not have had without some chance remark of another contributor .
I think it is mainly this that sped up the process so much .
I could go on , but from the point of view of discussion I am more interested in the way that the project fell short of my expectations , and there is one way that stands out .
There seemed to be such a lot of interest in the whole idea that I thought that there would be dozens of contributors , but instead the number settled down to a handful , all of whom I knew personally .
( Actually , Randall , I know of you so well that I feel as though I know you but I ca n’t quite remember whether we have met — hope to do so soon . )
This raises two questions .
( < rant >
By the way , it does n’t beg any questions at all .
< / rant >)
Why did it happen like this , and does it matter ?
I would be very interested to hear from anyone who thought that they might like to contribute but ended up not doing so .
I have spoken to one or two people like that , so I know of at least one reason , which I suspect may be the most important : it ’s that the number of comments grew so rapidly that merely keeping up with the discussion involved a substantial commitment that not many people were in a position to make .
I definitely intend to start another polymath project , but next time I think we may have to have some policy such as writing up all useful insights on the corresponding wiki before we allow ourselves a new comment thread , so that anybody who wants to join the discussion can read about the progress in a condensed and organized form .
Or perhaps we should just artificially slow ourselves down .
Or perhaps it will just naturally be slower second time round .
Another possible reason is that the problem I chose lent itself more naturally to a smaller collaboration , since in order to be well placed to think about the density Hales - Jewett theorem it was a huge help to be familiar with , and to have thought hard about , other related results .
So the pool of potential collaborators was not as large as it might have been ( though it was still substantially larger than the number of people who did contribute ) .
The next problem I have in mind is less like that : it should be possible to contribute with virtually no prior knowledge .
A third possible reason is that there are a lot of experts out there who could in principle have contributed but who just are n’t part of the blogosphere in any serious way .
Amongst them are probably several people who would not in any case feel comfortable about airing their thoughts so publicly .
Does it matter ?
In a way no : this smaller collaboration has worked very well , and , as several people have commented , it has provided , for possibly the first time ever ( though I may well be wrong about this ) , the first fully documented account of how a serious research problem was solved , complete with false starts , dead ends etc .
It may be that the open nature of the collaboration was in the end more important than its size .
I can even imagine solo polymath - type projects , where somebody thinks online just to interest anyone who might be interested .
Another thing I have found good about the project is that it has made it possible to work hard without having the sensation of working hard .
There are some people who have brains that they seem to be able to split into three or four parts that can work independently , one part solving problems , another digesting the literature , another blogging , another giving lecture courses .
My own brain works in series rather than in parallel , but now that I have found a way of simultaneously blogging and carrying out research I can do two things at the same time by identifying them .
However , there is still a part of me that would like to see whether a much bigger collaboration might be possible .
I think a lesson of this one is that a big collaboration would need an extra level of organization , so that it was possible to work on part of the project without keeping track of the whole of it .
But finding a good way of doing that would be quite a challenge : when we tried to split this discussion into separate threads , it did n’t really work , except for the thriving thread on DHJ numbers on Terry ’s blog , which worked because it was a more or less disjoint enterprise from the one here .
There are some other questions that need discussing , such as the best way to write results up , what appropriate conventions should be for referring to work here , and so on .
Comments on these and other practical questions are also welcomed .

This is the first anniversary of the destruction of Bear Stearns .
For a while there , just after it happened , everybody was talking about the role of short selling , both legal and illegal , in Bear ’s rather violent passing .
Since then , the big question has gone from “ who the hell set this fire ? ” to “ how did this place devolve into such a firetrap , anyway ? ” and “ how the hell do we get out of this burning building ? ”
Finding answers to all three questions is vitally important .
Yet , I ’m a little bothered by the fact that these days , so little attention is being focused on the first .
And so , exactly one year after criminal arsonists set a match to the over - leveraged heap of oily rags that was Bear Stearns , I offer up this video examination of that event , and those that would follow .
While I hope you will all enjoy and help circulate it , I should point out that this video was not primarily made for the frequent readers of DeepCapture.com ( as everything in it has already been examined in these pages ) .
Instead , it ’s for those who ’ve yet to understand why they should be outraged at what ’s going on .
In other words , it ’s primarily for future readers of DeepCapture.com .
Yet , I need you regulars to take a look , and then help get this out there .
Plus , the music is pretty cool , so it ’ll be worth your time to watch anyway .
One of the benefits of a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress is that we can expect action on good , progressive legislation .
One such bill is H.R. 1913 , the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 , which was recently approved by the House Judiciary Committee .
As noted by Americans United , this bill
would allow the U.S. Justice Department to offer assistance when a crime that results in death or serious injury is committed against any American because of the victim ’s race , color , religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation , gender identity or disability .
The federal government could even prosecute such cases if local officials were unwilling to do so .
According to the Philadelphia Inquirer , the bill “ has been endorsed by more than 275 national civil rights , professional , civic , education , and religious groups , 26 state attorneys general , and a number of the most important national law enforcement organizations … [ and ] has repeatedly attracted majority , bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House . ”
But there is one group opposing the bill , and you ’ll never guess who :
Let ’s say you preach from Genesis 19 or Romans 1 , referencing the homosexual agenda or lifestyle .
Your sermon could be heard by an individual who applies it in a way prohibited by a hate crimes law .
Not only would the offender be prosecuted under this law , but you could also be prosecuted for conspiracy .
Consequently , hate crimes laws would radically impact our freedom of speech as Christians .
Despite its wide bipartisan support , religious right groups like the Alliance Defense Fund and the Traditional Values Coalition are up in arms , hysterically warning that any bill which punishes hate crimes against gays and lesbians will be used to “ silence Christian opposition to homosexuality ” .
This is a lie , as you can verify for yourself by reading the text of the bill , which says :
Nothing in this Act , or the amendments made by this Act , shall be construed to prohibit any expressive conduct protected from legal prohibition by , or any activities protected by the free speech or free exercise clauses of , the First Amendment to the Constitution .
As the language of the bill makes clear , it applies only to crimes of violence that are motivated by bias or hate .
But religious right groups , as always , have no compunction in lying to their followers about the contents of this law .
The question is , given the demonstrable falsehood of their stated premises , what ’s the real reason why religious right groups are so adamantly opposed to hate crime laws ?
If it ’s true , as they say , that they “ hate the sin and love the sinner ” , one would think that they would support laws that give LGBT people more legal protection against crimes of bias .
The obvious answer is that they truly do hate homosexuals and want to preserve their right to discriminate against them .
There ’s too much evidence to dismiss this explanation out of hand : consider the cases , both famously cited in the “ Gathering Storm ” ad , in which a Christian doctor refused to perform artificial insemination on a lesbian patient and a church group refused to rent a pavilion , otherwise open to the public , for a same - sex commitment ceremony .
( Both lost in court . )
The other explanation , which I suspect plays a greater role in their own minds , is that most right - wing Christians believe in a coming one - world government ruled by the Antichrist .
Any political development that goes against their wishes , they assume to be part of this Satanic conspiracy against them .
This explains the shrillness of their rhetoric : they ’re positive that a day is soon coming when Christianity will be outlawed , and they see it coming around every corner .
In the face of their faith , the actual facts of the matter – such as the fact that this legislation only criminalizes violence , not speech – are irrelevant to their minds .
Controversial surveillance powers employed to fight terrorism and combat crime have been misused by civil servants in undercover " spying " operations that breach official guidelines , the Guardian has learned .
Documents obtained under Freedom of Information show some government departments and agencies have used these powers incorrectly or without proper controls .
They also show the official government watchdog set up to monitor the use of such clandestine techniques criticised the departments for their behaviour .
The watchdog twice threatened to inform Gordon Brown about the serious abuses of powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) .
The watchdog highlighted how :
• Officials at the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) did not have proper authorisation when they went undercover posing as anglers to glean information about imported fish ;
• A manager responsible for authorising surveillance at the NHS anti-fraud agency routinely gave officials " carte blanche " in surveillance operations ;
• Tracking devices were attached to vehicles in a bid to monitor the disposal of waste , after the Environment Agency received apparently incorrect advice from the Home Office
• Potential prosecutions were jeopardised because those conducting the surveillance operations were not properly trained and had not followed procedures
• A large array of public bodies are also using surveillance powers , including the Charity Commission , Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the BBC .
The disclosures come amid mounting criticism of the expansion of state powers to spy on citizens .
The RIPA was introduced in 2000 to regulate surveillance carried out by public bodies to prevent crime , terrorism and protect public safety .
Local councils have been accused of going too far by " snooping " on people suspected of dog fouling , fly - tipping or fraudulently applying for a school place .
The Home Office minister Vernon Coaker has said some surveillance has been " inappropriate " , while Sir Simon Milton , chairman of the Local Government Association , wrote to every council in England last year urging them to cease using the powers for " trivial " matters .
Reports of inspections by the watchdog , the Chief Surveillance Commissioner , stretching back to 2003 shed new light on how government departments have been using surveillance powers .
The documents obtained highlight how the powers are " widely used " by Royal Mail , which uses hidden " viewing galleries " in sorting officers and local authority CCTV to secretly monitor its staff .
Ofcom , the media regulator , conducted covert surveillance or obtained communications data 177 times in 2007 .
In the same year the Charity Commission did so three times .
Other organisations which have used surveillance powers include Ofsted , the Civil Nuclear Constabulary , the Driving Standards Agency and Food Standards Agency , the Financial Services Authority , the BBC ( for TV licensing detection ) and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society .
Many of these bodies were found to be abiding by RIPA rules , with only minor infringements .
Sir Christopher Rose , the Chief Surveillance Commissioner , was particularly critical of Defra .
In a letter to Helen Ghosh , the department 's most senior official , he said that his findings from one inspection made " lamentable reading " , adding that his recommendations were " exceptional in number and in seriousness for any organisation inspected by my office " .
He found it impossible to discover which senior officials were in charge of making sure the surveillance powers were used lawfully and found the department had not properly authorised the use of undercover officials who were seeking to prevent the illegal importation of live fish .
He said : " The officers concerned were posing as anglers who were engaging other anglers and staff at the fish pond in conversation to elicit information . "
He found another case in which an enforcement official seeking to prevent the importation of endangered animals failed to get proper authorisation for an informant because he had not been trained in the surveillance powers .
The prosecution had to be dropped .
A Defra spokeswoman said that since the 2006 , the department had " made considerable progress in dealing with the concerns raised and has now implemented the recommendations in full . "
Rose had threatened the unusual step of reporting Defra to Brown if the department did not put its house in order .
His predecessor , Sir Andrew Leggatt , issued the same threat to the Department of Health agency which investigates NHS fraud - the NHS Counter Fraud Service .
The surveillance watchdog was concerned about the " authorising officer " , then deputy director of operations Allan Carter .
It found his written authorisations effectively gave " carte blanche " for any activity " which might be deemed [ covert ] surveillance " .
The watchdog said Carter , who has since been promoted , also made authorisations over the phone .
Carter said the watchdog 's inspector had " misconstrued the issue of verbal authorisations " and that " no purely verbal authorisations were given " .
Carter , who had many other responsibilities , told the watchdog he was " keen to address his lack of knowledge as a matter of urgency " .
Yesterday , the NHSCFS said its investigations meet " the highest professional standards " and it has now addressed issues raised in inspections .
The Environment Agency were found to be trespassing on private land to install spy cameras .
The agency was also chided in 2007 for attaching tracking devices to a vehicle to monitor the suspected dumping of illegal waste , which constitutes undue interference in private property .
This was done after apparently erroneous advice from the Home Office which stated that " affixing a magnetic device to a vehicle on the public highway " was " not a criminal offence " .
Pointing out that the advice was wrong , the watchdog advised that if a tracking device was " put into a sack of waste to be collected by the operator this would not be interference " .
David Jordan , the Environment Agency 's director of operations , said : " The Environment Agency uses covert surveillance to tackle serious environmental crime .
We have a very good track record of compliance with RIPA . "

Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart killed morning after start
The Sporting News ^ | Thursday April 9 , 2009 | The Sporting News
Posted on by jpl
Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart , who started in a home game against the A's Wednesday night , was killed in a felony hit - and - run car accident in Fullerton , California , early Thursday morning , according to multiple reports .
The accident was cause by the driver of a minivan who ran a red light , which caused the Mitsubishi that Adenhart was riding in to hit a light pole , police said .
In addition to the 22 - year - old Adenhart , two other people died in the crash .
One of the other people killed was also affiliated with the Angels organization , TMZ reports .
The driver of the minivan fled the scene but was later caught and charged with felony hit - and - run .
Adenhart struck out five batters in six scoreless innings Wednesday .
The rookie righthander did make three starts for the Angels last year , posting a 1 - 0 record with a 9.00 ERA .
Adenhart was called up from AAA ball this season after injuries to Angels pitchers John Lackey , Ervin Santana and Kelvim Escobar .

Very brutal accident
This is now being picked up by multiple news agencies , yet not one of them have revealed who the at fault driver was .
The three dead were in a gray Mitsubishi , which slammed into a light pole after the van struck it , Brower said .
Two people in the car died instantly and Adenhart died at the hospital a short while later .
A fourth occupant is in critical condition at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange ,

Journalists – they 're never around when you want one .
Two weeks ago a momentous event occurred : the beginning of the world 's first evacuation of an entire people as a result of manmade global warming .
It has been marked so far by one blog post for the Ecologist and an article in the Solomon Times * .
Where is everyone ?
The Carteret Islands are off the coast of Bougainville , which , in turn , is off the coast of Papua New Guinea .
They are small coral atolls on which 2,600 people live .
Though not for much longer .
As the Ecologist 's blogger Dan Box witnessed , the first five families have moved to Bougainville to prepare the ground for full evacuation .
There are compounding factors – the removal of mangrove forests and some local volcanic activity – but the main problem appears to be rising sea levels .
The highest point of the islands is 170 cm above the sea .
Over the past few years they have been repeatedly inundated by spring tides , wiping out the islanders ' vegetable and fruit gardens , destroying their subsistence and making their lives impossible .
They are not , as the Daily Mail and the Times predicted , " the world 's first climate - change refugees " .
People have been displaced from their homes by natural climate change for tens of thousands of years , and by manmade climate change for millennia ( think of the desertification caused in North Africa by Roman grain production ) .
Some people ascribe the fighting in Darfur – and the consequent displacement of its people – to climate change , as people struggle over diminishing resources .
But this appears to be the first time that an entire people have started leaving their homes as a result of current global warming .
Their numbers might be small , but this is the event that foreshadows the likely mass displacement of people from coastal cities and low - lying regions as a result of rising sea levels .
The disaster has begun , but so far hardly anyone has noticed .

The New York Assembly Wednesday passed a bill that would repeal much of the state 's draconian Rockefeller drug laws .
Enacted in 1973 under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller ( R ) , the laws are some of the toughest in the nation and have served as a model for " tough on crime " legislation across the country in the years since then .
June 2003 '' Countdown to Fairness ' ' rally against the Rockefeller drug laws , NYC ( courtesy 15yearstolife.com )
By a vote of 96 - 46 , the Assembly approved A 6085 , which restores judges ' discretion in sentencing low level drug offenders by gutting provisions in the law that require prosecutors to approve a judge 's decision to divert someone from prison to drug treatment .
The bill would also expand the state 's drug court system by authorizing one for each county in the state .
The bill contains provisions denying probation or local jail sentences to adults selling drugs to minors , dealers who deal while armed , and " drug kingpins . "
Now , all eyes turn to the state Senate , where an identical bill has been introduced .
Complicating matters is that the New York State Sentencing Commission last month released its own , much less reformist recommendations , which are supposed to be Gov. David Paterson 's ( D ) guide to reform legislation .
The governor is not bound by the commission majority 's recommendations , but it is not clear yet just what Paterson will do .
Thanks to the Rockefeller laws -- and despite reforms in 2004 and 2005 that had no impact on less serious offenders imprisoned under them -- nearly 12,000 people are currently behind bars for drugs in New York .
Even after the 2004 -2005 tinkering , the state prison system continues to be flooded with new Rockefeller law victims .
More than 5,000 people were sent to prison for nonviolent drug offenses last year .
More than 42 % of Rockefeller law prisoners -- more than 5,000 people -- are doing hard time for simple drug possession , many of them convicted of the lowest level drug felonies , which involve only small amounts of drugs .
For instance , a half - gram of cocaine can earn a Class D felony charge .
As of last month , 1,098 people were imprisoned for that offense .
The mass imprisonment of drug offenders comes at a substantial cost to Empire State taxpayers .
According to the Correctional Association of New York , the state spends $ 525 million a year to incarcerate drug offenders and has spent $ 1.5 billion on building prisons to house them .
" More than 35 years after the Rockefeller drug laws were enacted , it is clear that these laws mandating imprisonment for even lower - level offenders have failed to effectively combat drug abuse or reduce the incidence of violent crime , " said Assembly leader Rep. Sheldon Silver ( D - Manhattan ) before the vote Wednesday .
" This legislation restores humanity to drug policy here in New York .
It expands the sentencing options available to judges , without endangering the public .
Judges are in the best position to know who is deserving of prison and who is not .
State prison and mandatory prison sentences are not the magic bullets to address drug abuse and its attendant problems ; restoring judicial discretion is the solution . "
" These reforms are long overdue , " said Rep. Jeffrion Aubrey ( D - Queens ) , the primary sponsor of the bill .
" This legislation provides for a more sensible , comprehensive and cost - effective approach for dealing with lower - level drug offenders and addicts .
Think of all the resources that have been spent on locking - up nonviolent drug offenders that could have been invested in the education , rehabilitation and job training that can save lives .
Treatment programs in New York City have a ten percent recidivism rate for participants one year after completion , compared to 60 to 70 % for those not in programs .
Treatment works . "
Activists who have spent years trying to make the legislature pay heed to calls for Rockefeller law reform -- or outright repeal -- pronounced themselves pleased with the Assembly vote .
But while there was agreement that the bill contained significant reforms , some said it did not go far enough .
" With everyone from the Sentencing Commission to the governor talking about reforming the Rockefeller drug laws , it 's critical to examine any proposal and make sure it constitutes real reform , " said Gabriel Sayegh , project director with the Drug Policy Alliance .
" To be real , meaningful reform , any proposal must include restoration of judicial discretion in drug cases ; expansion of alternative - to - incarceration programs and community based drug treatment ; fair and equitable sentencing reforms ; and retroactive sentencing relief for people serving unjust sentences under the Rockefeller drug laws .
The Assembly has included these provisions , and their proposal constitutes real reform . "
" New York State is closer to justice today than we were yesterday , " said Donna Lieberman , executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union .
" By passing this bill , our state 's Assembly is letting go of 36 years of failure and moving toward meaningful reform of the Rockefeller drug laws . "
" The Rockefeller drug laws have failed by every measure -- cost , drug use , public safety , " added the group 's legislative director , Robert Perry .
" With the passage of Jeff Aubrey 's bill , the Assembly has acted on Governor Paterson 's directive to fundamentally reform the state 's failed drug policy .
The bill shifts the paradigm , away from mass incarceration and toward a public health model . "
But the NYCLU also said that " in certain essential respects , the Assembly proposal does not fully realize the reform principles on which the legislation is based . "
It listed several examples :
The bill leaves in place a sentencing scheme that permits unreasonably harsh maximum sentences for low - level , nonviolent drug offenses ;
The bill disqualifies from eligibility for treatment and rehabilitation individuals who may be most in need of such programs ; and
The bill creates an unnecessarily burdensome procedure for sealing a criminal record after someone has completed a substance abuse program .
" This is an essential first step , but we encourage Governor Paterson and the state Senate to authorize judicial discretion to divert individuals from prison in all appropriate cases ; to expand and improve the quality of alternative to incarceration programs ; and to provide long - sought justice to the thousands of families that have been torn apart by the Rockefeller drug laws , " Lieberman said .
Randy Credico of the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice , which has been part of the Rockefeller reform movement for years , offered a more radical critique .
" It 's not just the Rockefeller drug laws -- we need to completely overhaul the criminal justice system , from sentencing to the appointment of judges to judge - shopping by prosecutors to racial profiling to banning stop and frisk searches .
People need to focus on the overall criminal justice system , or just as many people will be going to prison as we have now , " he told the Chronicle last month .
But right now , the focus is on getting Rockefeller reform legislation to the governor 's desk .
DPA 's Sayegh said there were good signs in the Senate .
" The Senate bill introduced by Sen. Eric Schneiderman ( D - Bronx ) is the same bill as was introduced in the Assembly , " he pointed out .
" We 're very hopeful about that . "
But Sayegh worried about what Gov. Paterson will propose .
" The governor has apparently distributed a proposal to legislative leaders that has not been made public , " he said .
" We hope it is not a cut and paste from the Sentencing Commission , given that its recommendations do not constitute real reform . "
Still , Sayegh predicted fast action in Albany .
" This is moving along quickly .
We think we may see a negotiated Senate bill within a week or two , " he said .
" Given the fiscal crisis we 're facing , these reforms will save the state millions and millions of dollars .
The time is right . "
If and when substantial repeal of the Rockefeller drug laws is passed , then perhaps people will start asking why and whether drug users and sellers should be arrested in the first place absent harm to others .
Drug treatment and drug courts may be an improvement over years in prison , but in a society that treated its citizens as adults , such authoritarian institutions would be reserved for people who have demonstrated their drug use is harming others .

Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich is seeking goverment paperwork on a $ 3.62 billion bonus package that Merrill Lynch paid its top executives in the last quarter of 2008 , after the financial services firm lost more than $ 15 billion and was informed it would get $ 10 billion in federal bailout money .
Merrill Lynch 's bonuses were 22 times larger than the $ 165 million bonuses AIG paid its executives , Kucinich noted in letters sent today to Federal Reserve Bank Chaiman Ben Bernanke , Treasury Department official Neel Kashkari , and Ken Lewis , CEO of Bank of America , which acquired Merrill Lynch .
" In contrast to the bonuses awarded by AIG , the Merrill bonuses constituted a significant proportion of allocated TARP funds , which were not locked into place by preexisting contract and were performance , not retention , in nature , " Kucinich said in the letter which mentioned the House Oversight subcommittee he chairs is probing the issue .
Kucinich said the payments raise " significant questions " about the information shared with the federal officials who oversaw the merger between the two financial institutions .
" If ordinary BOA shareholders were ignorant of the details of the Merrill bonus arrangement , was the U.S. government as well ? " asked Kucinich .
He said the answers he obtains " will be of interest to the American public , who are rightly concerned about how recipient firms have used TARP monies , and how well the Federal Government has monitored the use of those funds and safeguarded them from waste and abuse . "
Why does n't such a group exist ?
After reading the latest from the latest New Atheist to start making a ruckus , Jerry Coyne , I wonder if we do n't need to start it up .
And I would be the first to join .
Coyne , a prominent defender of evolution based at the University of Chicago , engages in a counterproductive attack on three major allies -- the National Academy of Sciences , the American Association for the Advancement of Science , and above all , the National Center for Science Education .
Nobody does more than these three groups ( and especially the last ) to promote and defend the teaching of evolution in the United States .
So how could any evolutionary scientist be upset with them ?
Coyne 's charge against NAS , AAAS , and NCSE is that they 're too moderate on the extremely divisive subject of religion .
They take the wishy - washy position that you can fully accept evolution and yet not in some sense turn into an atheist .
Or as Coyne puts it of these groups :
By seeking union with religious people , and emphasizing that there is no genuine conflict between faith and science , they are making accommodationism not just a tactical position , but a philosophical one .
By ignoring the significant dissent in the scientific community about whether religion and science can be reconciled , they imply a unanimity that does not exist .
Finally , by consorting with scientists and philosophers who incorporate supernaturalism into their view of evolution , they erode the naturalism that underpins modern evolutionary theory .
" Seeking union " ?
" Consorting " ?
How dare these organizations build diverse coalitions to achieve shared goals ?!?
Allow me to make a few points in response to Coyne 's summarizing paragraph , above .
First , I do n't see anything particularly " philosophical " about the accommodationist stance .
Rather , holding that there is no necessary conflict between faith and science is an empirical matter :
There are a vast number of different religions traditions in the world , and a still more vast number of ways in which different people profess and live out their faiths .
In some of these traditions , and for some of these people , there is stark conflict with science ; in other traditions , and for other people , there is n't .
That 's just a fact , and one that can be demonstrated simply by identifying any number of scientists who are religious , any number of religious leaders and denominations which embrace evolution , and so on .
Coyne , however , seems to think it is possible to more or less ignore this religious diversity .
He says there is " significant dissent in the scientific community about whether religion and science can be reconciled " -- but which " religion " are we talking about here ?
It makes all the difference .
Again , it is irrefutable that for some people , religion and science can definitely be reconciled .
Forget for the moment how it is that they perform such a reconciliation in their minds -- the point is , these people exist , and in large numbers .
Are NAS , NCSE , and AAAS supposed to ignore this ?
As for " dissent " : I do n't think any unanimity on science and religion is being implied by NCSE or the rest ; rather , I merely suspect these leading organizations of American science are taking stances that , in addition to being realistic , are in the best interests of their members .
After all , consider the massive importance of the reconciliationist stance on science and religion from a legal perspective :
The pro-evolution courtroom strategy has long turned on recognizing that while creationism is just thinly veiled religion , evolution does not entail atheism .
Does Coyne want us to give up the Dover case , and many others before it ?
Because they are strongly premised on this logic .
The charge that accomodationists are guilty of " philosophy " is also pretty gutsy in light of Coyne 's last sentence : " Finally , by consorting with scientists and philosophers who incorporate supernaturalism into their view of evolution , they erode the naturalism that underpins modern evolutionary theory . "
Is Coyne not himself making an explicitly philosophical move here , by saying that evolution must be understood in an exclusively naturalistic / materialistic way ?
It 's true that we should n't invoke supernatural " causes " ( whatever those are ) in science ; but it 's also true that science can't prove they do n't exist .
Provided that one does not appeal to miracles to explain how things happened , then , a kind of " supernaturalism " may certainly co-exist with evolution :
You can simply say that God created everything and then evolution happened in a God- created universe , governed by God 's laws , which are also the laws of nature .
There 's a far bigger point here :
In my view , we 're not nearly so secure in our defense of evolution in this country that we can indulge in the luxury of alienating the vast number of evolution defenders who hold something like the above belief .
In this light , I find Coyne 's piece deeply misguided on a strategic level , as Richard Hoppe points out here in a post aptly titled " Generals who do n't know the nature of war . "
( Alternative suggested title : " University professors who should never be allowed to lead armies . " )
As for me : I 'm happy to " consort " and to " seek union " with any and all religious folks who also wants to help defend the teaching of evolution .
They 're powerful allies , and joining forces with them is the only way we 'll ever put this divisive fight behind us .

LONDON  A pay raise may be the last thing a bank is expected to offer these days .
But UBS , the Swiss bank , is doing exactly that as it looks for new ways to compensate its investment bankers , two people who have been briefed on the changes said Sunday .
UBS is increasing the base salary of senior investment bankers after reducing many bonuses sharply and to align overall compensation more closely with other financial services jobs , like consulting , said these people , who spoke anonymously because the bank has not decided to publicly disclose the changes .
The step is part of a bigger overhaul of UBS ’s compensation system , they said .
Banks and regulators around the world have been rethinking the pay structure at banks as they suffer huge losses .
UBS cut its bonus pool for 2008 more than 80 percent , while another Swiss bank , Credit Suisse , scaled back its bonuses 44 percent over all , with even sharper cuts for senior managers .
Credit Suisse , UBS and Morgan Stanley have also added so - called clawback provisions to bankers ’ pay , allowing the banks to take back some pay from employees who fail to meet certain performance goals .
It was February 2007 .
Michael Angelakos , a student and singer / songwriter at Emerson College , was looking for that special gift to give to his then girlfriend for Valentine ’s Day .
What he came up with were six songs recorded under the alias Passion Pit .
The songs failed to woo his lover , but spread like wildfire at Emerson and caught the collective interest of the student body .
It was then that Angelakos realized he had something big on his hands .
The six songs morphed into an EP named “ Chunk of Change ” and was officially released in late September 2008 .
On it was a song called “ Sleepyhead , ” which has since gained over 2.6 million listens on MySpace and over 1 million views on YouTube .
The success of “ Sleepyhead ” led to Passion Pit landing a record deal with New York City - based Frenchkiss Records and Columbia Records in the UK .
It ’s also helped Passion Pit gain a full - fledged quartet for live performances .
As far as Manners goes , it brings to the indie - pop music scene a breath of fresh air .
Twenty - one year old Angelakos and company have created of the most playful and danceable electropop tracks that I ’ve heard since maybe MGMT .
Manners is sure to be one of the anthems of your summer .
You have to check it out .

Within 11 minutes Manchester
Utd had scored twice
A Kenyan fan of English football club Arsenal has hanged himself after his team 's defeat by Manchester United .
The north London club was beaten 3 - 1 in the European Champions League semi-final second leg on Tuesday evening .
Suleiman Omondi , 29 , who was watching in a bar in the capital , Nairobi , was incensed by the club 's poor showing .
He left at half - time after arguing with a Manchester United fan and was found hanging from a rope in his house , still dressed in an Arsenal shirt .
' Broke down '
The BBC's Josphat Makori in Nairobi says the unprecedented incident has shocked football fans in Kenya .
According to his friends , Mr Omondi was in good spirits at the beginning of the match and even when Arsenal conceded the first goal , he did not seem to be affected .
He was so angry that he left in a rage
Eyewitness
But things changed when the team conceded a second goal 11 minutes into the game .
A woman , who sat next to him in the bar , said Mr Omondi was so disappointed by Arsenal 's poor performance that he broke down during half - time .
Another eyewitness told journalists that it was at this point that a Manchester United fan started taunting him .
" Suleiman got hold of him angrily by the neck and started pressing him so hard , " he said .
" We quickly intervened and asked him to stop .
Suleiman then stopped but he was so angry that he left in a rage . "
His body was found on Wednesday morning .
Police officer David Bunei told the BBC the incident was being investigated .

At the time of release , the film was banned in Germany because the story was considered to be anti-Nazi propaganda by the wartime censors .
After the end of World War II , the picture was finally released in Germany but with around 20 minutes of footage cut ( all scenes with Major Strasser and all references to Nazism ) .
Other scenes were dubbed so that they had a totally different meaning ( Victor Laszlo became Victor Larsen , an atomic physicist ) .

The California Supreme Court upheld a ban on same - sex marriage Tuesday , ratifying a decision made by voters last year .
The ruling comes at a time when several state governments have moved in the opposite direction .
The court ’s decision does , however , preserve the 18,000 same - sex marriages performed between the justices ’ ruling last May that same - sex marriage was constitutionally protected and voters ’ passage in November of Proposition 8 , which banned it .
The court ’s opinion , written by Chief Justice Ronald M. George for a 6 - to - 1 majority , noted that same - sex couples still had a right to civil unions .
Such unions , the opinion said , gives those couples the ability to “ choose one ’s life partner and enter with that person into a committed , officially recognized and protected family relationship that enjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage . ”
Justice George wrote that Proposition 8 did not “ entirely repeal or abrogate ” the right to such a protected relationship .
Instead , he said , it “ carves out a narrow and limited exception to these state constitutional rights , reserving the official designation of the term ‘ marriage ’ for the union of opposite - sex couples as a matter of state constitutional law . ”
Twenty - six students from some of the nation 's best business schools have taken on an unusual summer assignment : helping cut corporate America 's energy bills .
They belong to an internship program organized by the Environmental Defense Fund that embeds MBA students with companies that want to use less energy , either to fight global warming or just to save money .
The Climate Corps interns - drawn from such schools as Yale , UC Berkeley , Columbia and Michigan - will spend 10 weeks hunting for ways to trim the amount of power their host companies need .
" Some of these companies get it , and others ?
They 're trying to get it , " defense fund Managing Director Elizabeth Sturcken told the recruits Monday , as they gathered in the environmental group 's San Francisco office for the first of three days of training .
" Each of you has the opportunity to change some minds , change some perspectives , " she said .

The Environmental Defense Fund has a history of partnering with businesses to tackle environmental problems .
The internship , now in its second year , is the latest extension of that approach .
Last year 's class of seven interns found enough savings to cut their host companies ' energy bills by $ 35 million over five years .
" Energy efficiency is something every company can do , " said Millie Chu Baird , project director for the defense fund .
" We wanted to reach as many companies as possible , so we 're doing that with interns . "
The companies involved - among them Cisco and Intuit - already have an interest in efficiency .
Some of them have hired sustainability officers who look for ways to cut energy and water use .
Or they 've started switching to power - sipping lights and office equipment .
The interns will help expand those efforts .
" It 's things that have occurred to us , but they have n't reached that tipping point where they 've become business as usual , " said Jeff Senne , director of metrics and reporting with Sodexo .
His company runs cafeterias for businesses , schools and hospitals .
Based in Maryland , the company also runs office buildings for other companies .
Sodexo 's intern , Katie Schindall from Yale University , will focus on improving the efficiency of the company 's Buffalo , N.Y. , service center .
" It 's a great opportunity to really get into the depths of an organization and say , ' Hey , why do n't you try this ? ' " said Schindall , who will graduate in 2011 .
" There 's so much momentum building right now that if you can come in and make even a small change , other companies will see that . "
Schindall and the other interns share an interest in business and a passion for the environment .
Many hope to build a career around those twin devotions .
Ryan Whisnant , from the University of Michigan , wants to become a sustainability consultant , doing much the same work he 'll do for SunGard data systems in Wayne , Pa. , during the internship .
He studied environmental engineering as an undergraduate before pursuing his master 's degree .
" Having the financial skills - that 's the way you 're going to get managers to listen to you , " he said .
Before joining their host companies , the interns spend three days in the Climate Corps " boot camp , " getting tips on saving energy in different kinds of buildings and companies .
Some sessions focus on saving power in heating and ventilation systems , lighting and data centers .
Others focus on financing equipment upgrades .
The students also learn how to overcome resistance from company executives and employees who do n't want to change .
" Real culture change is what we 're after , " Sturcken said .
" And it 's so exciting to see business students who are so passionate about this . "

At least four people have been killed and dozens injured after a series of powerful earthquakes hit eastern Indonesia , officials say .
The strongest tremor , with a magnitude of 7.6 , struck north of the city of Manokwari in West Papua province at 0443 ( 1943 GMT on Saturday ) .
It was followed by another big quake and a string of aftershocks .
Witnesses said the tremors triggered mass panic in Manokwari , where several buildings were flattened .
A tsunami alert was issued by Indonesian authorities following the earthquakes , but withdrawn within an hour .
Assessment teams and medical supplies are expected to arrive in the remote region , some 2,955 km ( 1,830 miles ) east of Indonesia 's capital Jakarta , within the next 24 hours .
The first quake struck on land about 95 miles ( 150 km ) north of Manokwari at a depth of 22 miles ( 35 km ) , the US Geological Agency said .
It was followed by another tremor and aftershocks .
The BBC's Lucy Williamson said eyewitnesses described crowds of people running terrified through the streets of the region 's main city amid fears of a tsunami .
Among the four victims of the quakes was a 10 - year - old girl who was crushed by a falling wall , officials said .
At least 37 people were injured and were being treated in hospitals .
An official with the World Vision aid organisation said 10 buildings had been totally destroyed , including several hotels and the house of a government official .
Officials said three people , who had been staying at the Mutiara hotel in Manokwari , were pulled alive from the rubble and taken to hospital .
Electricity was also cut off in the city with a population of some 160,000 people .
Japan 's Meteorological Agency told Reuters news agency the earthquakes also triggered a small tsunami which hit the Japanese coast , but did not cause any damage .
A huge quake off western Indonesia on 26 December 2004 caused a massive tsunami that killed around 230,000 people around the region .

Our friend Andy Cobb has another video .
This time it ’s about the lead groups of the religious right coming together and launching a million dollar campaign against gay marriage called “ Two Million for Marriage , ” or 2M4 M .
Too bad that M4M is already taken .
It ’s the call - sign for gay sex chat rooms .
More from Andy :
I ’m assuming here that 2m4 m actually refers to a gay three - way .
It seems implied , if “ m4 m ” is “ man looking for a man , “ 2 m4 m ” is “ two men looking for a man . ”
It could , however , also refer to a man looking for another man twice .
Or two men times four men .
It ’s hard to know exactly how freaky the NOM equation could get .
Let ’s hope for the best of all possible outcomes from this dumbass marketing campaign : a dramatic uptick in people getting together for group sex .
You only go around once , people .
And here ’s Andy ’s previous video , the prequel to this one .
It ’s about the conservatives giving their tax protests the unfortunate name “ Teabagging Protests . ”

BAGHDAD - US security firm Blackwater ended its operations in Iraq on Thursday closing a controversial era for the company whose guards shot dead 17 civilians in Baghdad in 2007 .
" The task order for security protection operations held by Blackwater comes to an end today in Baghdad , " American embassy spokeswoman Susan Ziadeh said , adding that Triple Canopy will replace it .
Triple Canopy , a Virginia - based firm , was appointed at the end of March by the US State Deparment to take over the multi-million - dollar contract to protect US government personnel working in Iraq .
Linked agreements such as that for Presidential Airways , part of Blackwater that operates helicopter escorts throughout the country for secure air travel , will expire soon , Ziadeh added .
The State Department refused to renew annual contracts for Blackwater which renamed itself Xe after the Iraq government banned it in January over the killings in Baghdad 's Nisur Square on September 16 , 2007 .
An Iraqi investigation found that 17 civilians died and 20 were wounded when Blackwater guards opened fire with automatic weapons while escorting an American diplomatic convoy through the square .
US prosecutors say 14 civilians were killed in the incident .
Five former Blackwater guards pleaded not guilty at a federal court in Washington in January to manslaughter charges .
The shooting focused a spotlight on the shadowy and highly lucrative operations of private security operations .
Blackwater guards were reported to earn as much as 1,000 dollars a day each in Iraq .
Anne Tyrrell , a spokeswoman for Xe , said the firm remains proud of its work in Iraq .

" When the US Government initially asked for our help to assist with an immediate need to protect Americans in Iraq , we answered that call and performed well , " she said in comments emailed to AFP .
" We are honored to have provided this service for five years and are proud of our success - no one under our protection has been killed or even seriously injured . "
" We always knew that , at some point , that work would come to a close . "
Foreign security teams in Iraq have long operated in a legal grey area , but under a military accord signed with Washington last November , Iraq won a concession to lift the immunity to prosecution previously extended to US security contractors .
Blackwater first came under scrutiny on March 31 , 2004 , when four of its employees were killed by an angry mob in Fallujah , then a Sunni Arab insurgent stronghold .
The crowd mutilated their bodies and strung them from a bridge , shocking images that were broadcast worldwide and led to a month - long assault on Fallujah that left 36 US soldiers , 200 insurgents and 600 civilians dead .
North Carolina - based Blackwater has been protecting US government personnel in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and has had around 1,000 staff in the violence - wracked country , making it among the largest security firms operating there .
In the wake of the scandal over civilian deaths in Iraq , its founder Erik Prince announced in March that he was stepping down as chief executive , but would stay on as chairman .

Student leaders have attacked the " arrogance " of universities Many universities in England and Wales want a sharp increase in tuition fees , a survey by BBC News has revealed .
Two thirds of vice - chancellors , speaking anonymously , said they needed to raise fees , suggesting levels of between £ 4,000 and £ 20,000 per year .
More than half of university heads want students to pay at least £ 5,000 per year or for there to be no upper limit .
England 's Higher Education Minister David Lammy said there was an " important debate to be had " .
The National Union of Students has warned of debts of £ 32,000 for students if fees rise to £ 7,000 per year .
Higher debt
The controversy over tuition fees is set to be re-opened , five years after it sparked one of the biggest backbench rebellions faced by the Labour government .
University fees must be reviewed this year by the government - and there are already arguments about whether the present £ 3,500 cap on fees should be lifted .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Any changes will affect about a million students on undergraduate courses .
Universities UK has set out the consequences of fee levels of £ 5,000 and £ 7,000 - arguing that if fees reached £ 7,000 a market of differently priced courses would emerge .
This has angered the National Union of Students , which wants to entirely replace the fee system with repayments linked to later earnings .
" In the context of the current recession , it is extremely arrogant for university vice chancellors to be fantasising about charging their students even higher fees and plunging them into over £ 32,000 of debt , " said NUS president Wes Streeting .
Students are now planning a lobby of the House of Commons on Wednesday in a protest against increasing fees .
Sally Hunt , leader of the UCU lecturers ' union , accused vice chancellors of " ignoring the views of the general public as they try to secure more cash by any means possible " .
Labour backbenchers are also mobilising on the issue - with MP Paul Farrelly , a former fee rebel , putting down a motion in the House of Commons warning against any plans to hike fees .
Mr Farrelly said the government would ignore " at its peril " the risks of pushing through another fee increase .
Recession and resistance
The BBC survey , gathering the views of 53 university vice - chancellors , showed a wide range of expectations of the scale of any increase - from £ 4,000 to £ 20,000 per year .
There is an important debate to be had now , which is about how we maintain the world class status of our higher education sector
Higher Education Minister David Lammy
There were also some expectations of differences between universities and courses - with more than a quarter saying they would not charge the full amount .
About one in 10 wanted the cap scrapped altogether so universities could charge whatever they wanted .
There was widespread support among vice - chancellors for the principle of fees - three out of four believing they had been a successful policy and nine out of 10 saying they should not be scrapped .
Two thirds believed fees had not deterred applications from students from poorer families .
The need to review them , part of the deal struck in 2004 , will be highly sensitive for Labour - raising questions about its appeal both to its left wing and to middle - class supporters .
' Won the argument '
The Westminster government has so far refused to be drawn into speculation about any changes .
" We made a commitment to Parliament during the last fees review that we would return to the issue only after the first cohort of students paying under the current regime had finished their degrees , " said Mr Lammy .
" We are not breaking that commitment .
" There is an important debate to be had now , which is about how we maintain the world class status of our higher education sector . "

In Wales the means - tested fees are at the same level as England , but for Welsh students at universities in Wales there is a subsidy for the first £ 1,255 .
The One Wales agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru says current fee levels will be maintained until 2009 - 10 .
Plaid Cymru has restated its opposition to fees .
But under proposals put out for consultation by Education Minister Jane Hutt , the student subsidy would be replaced the following year by means - tested grants .
' Resistance ' Charles Clarke , who as education secretary took on fees rebels in 2004 , says the Westminster government has been proved right about introducing fees .
" We won the argument overwhelmingly , " he said - arguing that the move had raised the funds needed by university , without deterring poorer students .
HAVE YOUR SAY University is rapidly becoming a place for the rich not the able PV , Reading But Mr Clarke warns that any further increase during a recession is going to be very difficult .
" There is no doubt that in the recession there will be a lot of resistance to thinking the fee level should be significantly raised . "
The education secretary who brought in the first tuition fees , David Blunkett , now says it would be " unacceptable to lift the cap and have a free - for - all across universities " .
The Conservatives , who dropped their opposition to fees , accuse the government of planning to " push their long - promised review ever further into the long grass " .
" The student finance review should start now and be as comprehensive as possible , " said university spokesman David Willetts .
The Liberal Democrats said the question of raising fees would be very different if seen from the students ' perspective .
The party 's university spokesman Stephen Williams called on the government to publish its fee review before the next election .
Different types of university will also have their own priorities for funding .
The 1994 Group , representing research - intensive universities , have warned that higher education funding must not limited to a " narrow debate on future fee levels " .
Meanwhile the Million + group of new universities has emphasised the need for the funding to support students from all backgrounds .

For immigrants in chilly Binghamton , the doorway to America opens through the friendly building on Front Street .
But Friday , the American Civic Assn. -- a place crowded with recent arrivals taking English classes and citizenship exams -- became a killing zone .
A gunman barricaded the back door of the immigration services center with a car , thwarting escape , then entered through the front door .
Opening fire , he killed 13 people and seriously wounded four others before apparently committing suicide .
Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski said the gunman gave no warning .
“ I do n’t think there was any conversation , ” he said .
As the gunman entered the building , he killed one receptionist and shot another in the stomach .
She pretended to be dead , hiding under a table and waiting for a chance to call 911 , while he moved down the hall .
In a nearby room he opened fire on a group taking a citizenship class .
Advertisement
Police arrived less than two minutes after receiving the receptionist ’s call at 10:31 a.m. , Zikuski said .
Amid the carnage , they found a body believed to be the shooter ’s , along with two handguns , body armor , ammunition and a magazine .
He apparently shot himself .
“ We have no idea what the motive is , ” Zikuski said , but added that the shooter was “ no stranger to the Civic Assn . ”
An anonymous law enforcement source told the Associated Press that the gunman had an identification card that said he was Jiverly Voong , 42 .
Authorities searched his home in nearby Johnson City on Friday and confiscated computer hard drives , a rifle case and luggage .
A second law enforcement official said the two handguns found with the body were registered to Jiverly Wong , another name the man used .
He once lived in Southern California .
Advertisement
Paulus Lukas , human resources manager for Kikka Sushi in Inglewood , said Jiverly Wong worked for the company as a deliveryman for nearly seven years , until July 2007 .
Kikka Sushi is a caterer serving supermarkets and corporate and school cafeterias .
Wong was a good worker , Lukas said , but quiet .
It was only in talking to co-workers Friday afternoon , Lukas said , that he learned Wong was Vietnamese .
When the staff at Kikka heard about the shootings , Lukas said , “ we did n’t really think this person could do such a thing .
He was really good at doing his job -- we respected him for that .
He ’s never late , he ’s always punctual .
And when he finishes his job , he goes home .
He does n’t complain , he does n’t argue with people .
He gets along . ”
The only blemish he could recall was that Wong sometimes drove the company van too fast .
But after being reprimanded , Lukas said , he improved his driving .
Advertisement
He said that Wong earned $ 9 an hour by the end of his employment , and that he never formally quit but just failed to show up for work one day , leaving co-workers speculating about what might have happened .
In early 2008 , Lukas said , Wong called to ask that his W - 2 forms be sent to an address in New York state .
Binghamton Mayor Matthew Ryan , who described Friday as “ the most tragic day in Binghamton history , ” said the gunman reportedly had been laid off from his job nearby at IBM .
“ I believe he was trying to get assistance [ at the center ] for obtaining employment , ” Ryan said .
“ The word was he lost his job and was pretty distraught .
. . .
If the story checks out , it ’s obvious that he was very concerned about being unemployed and not dealing with it well . ”
An IBM employee said Jiverly Wong did not work at IBM .

After the shooting , the SWAT team removed 37 people from the building , four of them critically injured ; 26 of them had taken shelter in a boiler room .
Many were immigrants who spoke little or no English .
As officers sought to determine who might be a shooter , they led some people from the building in flex cuffs , but they were ruled out as suspects , authorities said .
Binghamton is a town of about 46,000 people , located at the junction of two rivers some 140 miles northwest of Manhattan .
Ryan described it as “ a very proud city , ” with 30 languages spoken at local schools and a long history of welcoming immigrants -- from Europe in the past and from Asia more recently .
About 1 person in 4 is nonwhite , according to a demographic estimate .
The city ’s main street features old four - story brick buildings in the classic style of the industrial Northeast , with a sprinkling of ethnic restaurants and food marts and a nearby Martin Luther King memorial promenade .
The Binghamton area is the birthplace of IBM , which has suffered job cuts in recent years .
Advertisement
“ We really celebrate all the cultures here , ” Ryan said .
“ Because there has always been a strong immigrant population here , I just think it ’s been somewhat of a natural fit . ”
New York Gov. David Paterson noted that Friday ’s violence followed other mass gun slayings in the last month .
He cited the case of a man who fatally shot 10 people in Alabama before killing himself , and the Oakland slayings of four police officers .
“ When are we going to be able to curb the kind of violence that is so fraught and so rapid that we ca n’t even keep track of the incidents ? ” the governor said .
President Obama issued this statement : “ Michelle and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn about the act of senseless violence in Binghamton , N.Y. , today .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims , their families and the people of Binghamton .
We do n’t yet know all the facts , but my administration is actively monitoring the situation and the vice president is in touch with Gov. Paterson and local officials to track developments . ”

The shooting resonated with groups that work with immigrants in Los Angeles and around the nation .
“ Everyone who works with the immigrant community is heartbroken , ” said Judy London , directing attorney of the immigrant rights project at Public Counsel in Los Angeles .
“ Any time a tragedy happens in a workplace that is similar to yours , it hits close to home . ”
Ali Noorani -- executive director of the National Immigration Forum , a pro-immigrant advocacy group in Washington , D.C. -- said he urged people to resist using the shooting for political purposes in the immigration debate .
Any workplace shooting is horrific , he said , but this was especially tragic because it occurred at a place that gives hope to newcomers to the country .
“ This is truly an American tragedy in that these were people who were looking to become the newest of our American communities , ” Noorani said .
“ So many people come to this country fleeing persecution or violence , and here they were studying to become citizens -- only to become victims of violence . ”
Advertisement
Ryan said a family center had been set up in Binghamton where people could find out about relatives .
“ By process of elimination , families are probably starting to realize they lost a loved one , ” he said .
The mayor called the American Civic Assn. “ a mainstay of our community . ”
The group assists immigrants and refugees with resettlement , citizenship , family reunification , interpretation and translation .
Many of its clients have fled war and conflict in other countries and have been working to build new lives in the U.S. , according to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants , a network of organizations serving immigrants and refugees .
The network said the Binghamton group was one of its partner agencies .
The network issued a statement saying that it was “ shocked and saddened by the shooting ” and announcing that it had established a fund to help the community .
Advertisement
“ Our hearts go out to the victims , their families and the Binghamton community , ” the statement said .
“ We know the entire community of Binghamton will rally around the American Civic Assn. , the people it serves and , in particular , the victims and their families . ”
Every pew was filled Friday evening at a candlelight vigil for the victims at Redeemer Lutheran Church .
Among those in attendance was Greg Jenkins , a disaster coordinator for the Broome County Council of Churches , who said the area had a long history of welcoming immigrants -- Asians , Italians , Poles , Bosnians .
The victims “ were trying to do it the right way , becoming American citizens , ” he said , shaking his head as he gripped a candle .

Kasim Kopuz , an imam who runs the mosque in Johnson City , said the missing included a 56 - year - old Iraqi woman and a Pakistani woman in her 20s , both of whom attended English classes at the immigrant service center .

If you are unfamiliar with the subject of chemtrails , you should first read this general overview of the chemtrail spraying operations which began in earnest in late 1997 .
Without first reading the introductory overview , it 's difficult to understand the later informaiton that is being presented here .
There are several key points to understand about the chemtrail spraying program .
Parts 1 and 2 are exclusively devoted to chemtrails , while Part 3 has a little on chemtrails , but is mostly about water fuel technologies , which more people should become aware of .
I edited Parts 1 and 2 somewhat to only include information relating to chemtrails , orgone generators and Sylphs , but I kept the info on Brown 's gas in the April 30 show for people who may be interested in this topic .
Don had originally posted an article and many interesting photos I sent him from an April 28 , 2008 video that I had taken in my neighborhood .
Those photos are not currently on Don 's web site , but I will post them on my own page and will put up a link when completed . .
You need to first download and unzip these mp3 audio files before you can listen to them .
Once the file is downloaded and unzipped , you can keep it in any folder you wish ( or delete it after listening ) .
If you do n't know how to download and unzip an mp3 audio file , you can find instructions at this link ( http://educate-yourself.org/vcd/podcast31jul11.shtml).
I 've done a number of radio interviews with Don Nicoloff on the subject of chemtrails and Sylphs .
The three radio show listed here will give you a good idea on the overall agenda of chemtrail spraying and how they are mitigated throuigh the use of orgone generators and focused intent .
Air elemental beings identified by the ancient Greeks ( & Paracelsus ) as Sylphs are stimulated and energized by orgone generators and will literally vacumn up and transmute chemtrails into harmless substances .
I realize this is hard to believe by the average person who is unaware of these etheric beings , but the evidence can be seen right over your head if you know what to look for

If you 're just finding out about chemtrails , you should read the earlier articles to understand the full extent and gravity of the chemtrail undertaking , but bear in mind that we have turned a corner on combating chemtrails and have now thrown a huge spanner wrench into the Dark Side 's finely oiled genocide machine .
If you want to hasten the demise of the chemtrail spraying program , please take the time to read about orgone generators , chembusters , and the use of your mind - with focused intent - to rid the sky of these poisons . .
On the brighter side , you should know that methods have been discovered to help neutralize chemtrails and return the sky to a normal blue with real clouds taking the place of the chemtrail soup and overcast which a host of disinformation peddlers are trying to convince you are just ordinary , " cirrus " clouds that " are formed from persistent contrails " ( current disinformation spiel from government climatological web sites ) .
Chemtrail spraying seems to be heaviest and most constant over North America and most countries of western Europe .
Some countries in Asia are being sprayed ( Japan and Korea ) , but the greatest exception to any chemtrail activity whatsover is China .
The Chinese are being spared completely because China is being groomed by the NWO to replace the United States as the leading nation of the world , both economically and militarily .
I experienced that wake - up call in February of 1998 .
I had taken my 35 mm camera with me to the monthly meeting of the Orange County Chapter of the American Society of Dowsers and after the meeting , I had stopped off at a supermarket .
After getting out of the car , I photographed for the very first time , the strange looking " contrails " that William Thomas had been describing on the Art Bell radio program a couple of weeks earlier .
Thomas had dubbed them " chemtrails " on the Bell show to distinguish them from genuine ( and rarely seen ) short - lived ice crystal trailings properly identified as contrails .
" Holy Cow " , I thought to myself , .
" We 're being sprayed right here in southern California ! "
( Thomas lived near Vancouver , British Columbia ) .
Although I had a number of articles about the NWO and their dark Machiavellian agendas posted at my web site , I was now witnessing ( and breathing in ) the stark reality of those depopulation plans .
The NWO was no longer just words on the printed page .
Nothing brings home the comprehension of the New World Order depopulation agenda than the realization that you and your family are also on the " useless eaters " ( Henry Kissinger ) elimination list .
Most people discover the reality of chemtrails by initially reading about it on the Internet and then going outside and looking up into the sky .
They are shocked to realize that what they had been reading about ( and studying photographs of ) is also taking place right over their heads .
What some people had dismissed as mere " jet plane exhaust " ( because there are now scores of internet propaganda web sites trying to convince you that ' everything is well ' and ' there 's nothing to be alarmed about ' and that unaccountable ' jet plane exhaust ' plumes are magically being converted into horizon - to - horizon overcasts of " cirrus clouds " ! ) are dismayed to realize that chemtrails are indeed the toxin - laden aerosols that have been described here and at other web sites since 1998 and they are not being sprayed for any benign or national security reason as the disinformation peddlers would have you believe .
Important Breakthroughs in eliminating Chemtrails !
Please Read April 2005 :
The massive appearance of Sylphs in 2004 ( see next paragraph below - August 2004 ) and their neutralization / transmutation of chemtrails into non-toxic elements was a huge leap forward in neutralizing the diabolical chemtrail genocide aerosol spraying operation , but apparently we have progressed to yet another level .
People are now reporting the ability to clear the skies of chemtrails by use of the mind alone to obtain assistance from unseen helpers ( Sylphs and others ) and do the job for you based on your focused intention .
It 's really amazing to see this development .
I first posted an article in 2002 by Rich Work about using the mind and the the power of prayer to disperse chemtrails , and now we see this ability coming into reality with many people .

August 2004 : The very latest reports and photos are now posted on a new index page , Sylphs & Chemtrails ( http://educate-yourself.org/cn/sylphandchemtrailindex.shtml), which seems to confirm that Sylphs are neutralizing , converting , and eliminating chemtrails from the atmosphere in any local geographical area where a sufficient number of orgone generators have been deployed to convert the dominant DOR orgone atmospheric conditions into an OR dominated atmosphere .
Read these articles to understand what Sylphs are , what orgone generators are , and the difference between a DOR atmosphere and an OR atmosphere .
We are talking about nothing less than the demise of the chemtrail spraying operations !
Chemtrails cannot exist in the presence of these giant air elementals and are they being destroyed as rapidly as they are being sprayed out of spew planes .
You must read these articles and see the photographic evidence for yourself .
All of the information posted below is interesting and informative , but it is now HISTORY .
We are winning the battle against chemtrails and defeating the satanic traitors at their own game .
Spread the word : DEPLOY ORGONE GENERATORS IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD and you too will be free of chemtrail laden skies !
June 25 , 2004
We have good news :
The not - so - secret chemtrail spraying program , intended to keep us from attaining higher spiritual awareness / consciousness , to reduce ethnically targeted populations worldwide , and to induce bioengineered disease organisms in order to reap staggering profits for the pharmaceutical cartels is apparently failing - and failing badly .
I have seen the evidence here in southern California and have read of similar reports from different regions of America .
Read the articles below for an historical overview of chemtrails and the reasons for their deployment , but do n't dwell on the negative aspects of this story because things are beginning to look up and we have good reason for optimism !
Get involved with making or obtaining orgone generators in your immediate environment and be part of the ' hit team ' bringing down this Luciferian inspired genocide operation .

If you are just beginning to learn about Chemtrails , the introductory article below will give you an overview of how this spraying program began in late 1997 and how the situation stood up to early 2000 .
The overhead spraying of chemtrails has continued unabated for over five years now .
Thankfully , the Goodbye Chemtrails , Hello Blue Skies !
article describes a simple orgone transmutation tool called the " C hembuster " which will physically disperse chemtrails and possibly mitigate some of their noxious energies and immune crippling pathogens .
You can also obtain a ready made Chembuster along with other types of orgone generators from this web site .
The essay below by Montalk was posted to the Internet in September of 2000 , but rings as true today as it did two years ago .
Montalk 's analysis of the purpose behind chemtrails strikes me as intelligent .
He 's seems closer to the mark than most writers on the topic .
The fourth article describes a metaphysical method to destroy chemtrails that could work better than the physical method if employed by enough people and practiced correctly .
Print out these articles and pass them around .
The fifth article is a brief description of Dr. Len Horowitz 's latest book ( Death in the Air ) on the chemtrail spraying program describing its sinister goals ,
It 's a valuable resource to have in your library .
Lydia Mancini put together a good web site devoted to articles about Chemtrails and Radar Matrix offers some of the most amazing radar graphics of the unprecedented EMF / microwave assault that the military and government are bombarding their own citizens with .
You can just sit there and passively allow these satanic traitors to rob you of your health , your liberty , and your life , or you can do something to stop it .
Deploying orgone generators in your immediate environment is an easy , safe , and highly effective way to mitigate chemtrails in your area .
Join in the effort to help save yourself and humanity . .

However , note that the person who is posting this information does not recognize that many of the photos show Sylphs neutralizing chemtrails , rather than government technology directed at harming the public .
With the exception of the EDB petroleum aerosol rings seen around the sun , the majority of photos which reveal a " rainbow " effect are in fact demonstrating the presence of Sylphs who are transmuting the chemtrails into less harmful substances .
Other Sylph photos show a large heart - shaped " hole " in the cloud cover which the web master assumes is government technology , but it is not negative technology .
It 's a huge Sylph who is working on neutralizing those chemtrails !
Grrrrr ....

Introductory Overview of Chemtrails ( written May 1999 ) By Ken Adachi
For over a year , the military has been spraying the skies throughout America , Canada , and now parts of Europe ( including Britain , France , and the Netherlands ) with substances that were initially referred to as " mystery contrails " , but later were named " chemtrails " by investigative reporter and author William Thomas .
When questioned , military and government officials either deny any knowledge of these sprayings outright or they offer unbelievable and ludicrous explanations that only a moron could believe .
Joe Burton has been aggressively investigating and reporting on this story from early on .
Apparently he had been too aggressive , because his house had been targeted for direct spraying by low flying , unmarked aircraft .
In a story posted Feb. 15 , 1999 , Joe reports the physical symptoms that his family and his pet have been experiencing from the sprayings .
Joe believes that many of these military tankers responsible for the sprayings are remote controlled aircraft , but Al Cuppet ( 6 years with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff ) has told radio talk show host Jeff Rense during interviews on June 1 , 1999 , May 16 , 1999 , and May 7 , 1999 felt that many of these tanker planes were more likely being flown by foreign pilots , possibly Chinese or Russian .
Some Background :
Symptoms from Chemtrail sprayings
A One , Two Punch ?
On February 20 , 1999 , strange " Contrails " were reported over Long Island , NY by ' concerned citizens ' who also took photos .
These photos reveal the characteristic " X " mark seen in almost all cases of chemtrails .
Earlier this year , reports by Ken Welch have been posted on various sites on the Internet .
His reports are titled Contrail Spraying of Cities is Real Part 1 , Part II , and Part III
These articles chronicle Ken 's apprehension and dismay at the discovery that the United States government was brazenly spraying the skies of southern Texas on April 9 , 1999 with Chemtrails .
Ken has also posted E - mails at his web site that were sent to him in May ' 99 of reports of sprayings over South Carolina and Indiana .
In June , a report from Florida said that sprayings had been going on for weeks over the Ft Lauderdale and Jacksonville areas , including military bases .
It is being reported that people with average or below average immunity are experiencing pneumonia - like respiratory symptoms , while people with stronger immunity are only experiencing slight discomfort for a day or two or no symptoms at all .
Some people have gotten very ill and the symptoms seem to keep returning after a short period of improvement .
It 's possible that some of these sprayings might contain special bioengineered pathogens designed to affect only certain racial groups .
Radio talk show host Jeff Rense has offered the idea that these sprayed pathogens might be part of a Binary weapon system .
In other words , a second substance might be required ( aerial spraying or substances added to the water supply for example ) to bring out the virulent phase of the pathogen , but of course this is only speculation .
Rick Malinowski's long and detailed article also suggest the notion of a 2 or 3 part piggy back element to the chemtrail sprayings .
My own suspicions are that these sprayings are intended for multiple purposes including low level population reduction ( see NWO Population Control ) , mind control and / or tracking , and to foster weakness and apathy among the general population in anticipation of the New World Order takeover agenda which will likely include the imposition of martial law ( a sickly population is a lot more controllable and compliant than a healthy , vigorous one ) .
William Thomas
William Thomas was the first reporter to attract national attention to the chemtrails issue .
He has been interviewed many times on the Art Bell Radio show to discuss the chemtrails story and has many excellent articles and Photos posted at his own web site as well as other locations including - Jeff Rense 's Sightings on the Radio .
Thomas has concluded that these sprayings are genocidal in nature and are intended to reduce or weaken the general population .
In a November ' 99 interview with Art Bell , Thomas also voiced the idea that there might be a mind control element to the most recent spraying , since many people are reporting mental confusion and depression following recent sprayings .
Thomas has reminded radio listeners that the government has had a long history of exposing the public to biological pathogens without their knowledge or consent .
Thomas has also reported that spraying samples have been analyzed and have revealed that many deadly and toxic pathogens have been found including Mycoplasma Fermetens Incognitus ( the SAME bioengineered pathogen that Dr Garth Nicholson had discovered in about 45 % of the veterans who came down with Gulf War Illness ) .
Thomas found that Mycoplasma , however , was only ONE pathogen among a group of highly toxic biohazard substances analyzed from the chemtrail residues .
Why ?
The evidence is obvious and plentiful that these sprayings have been taking place almost daily since the Fall of ' 98 and many people have gotten sick and undoubtedly some have died from the effects of these pathogen / toxin sprayings , but the $ 64 question is WHY ?
Some writers have wistfully speculated that the government is trying to vaccinate us against a coming plague of bio terrorist origin .
Most people would like to believe that , but the evidence is too strong in the opposite direction .
Of course , sprayings might have different intentions for different sectors of the population : Possible population reduction for the weak and immune compromised ; possible vaccine protection intended for certain ethnic groups ; and possible ID tracking .
It 's hard to say .
Only insiders know the real story , or more probably know some parts of the Real Story .
What most Americans do n't realize is that the upper echelons of the United States government is no longer a government " of , by , and for " the people ( See the New World Order ) .
The United States government - as with all other major governments of the world - is under the total domination and control of the Illuminati ( architects of the so - called New World Order ) .
The Illuminati's plan to reduce the global population by 4 billion people before the year 2050 was laid out in the Global 2000 report assembled by the Carter administration .
in the late 70's .
It should be obvious - that in order to REDUCE the world 's population from its present size of six billion down to 2 billion ( even over a fifty year span ) would require that the majority of people now living would have to be exterminated in some way .
The amazing thing about the Illuminati is that they place all their ghastly plans right out in the open for everyone to see , if people would only look and read what they are saying .
Debunkers
A genocidal operation of this size and scope would require the Illuminati controllers to promote contravening propaganda in the opposite direction in order to limit or defuse political agitation , possible retaliatory action , and to quell the concerns of the average American who might stumble upon the chemtrail story .
It 's Standard Operating Procedure for the Illuminati .
For example , when Senate committee hearings took place a few years ago ( early ' 90's ) on re-examining the Kennedy assassination , just coincidentally an author ( and CIA asset ) by the name of Gerald Posner , who had recently published a book titled " Case Closed " , suddenly appears on the national scene .
In his book , Posner claimed unequivocally that Oswald was the lone assassin , that there was no conspiracy involving others , and that the Warren Commission was correct in its original findings .
Reviews of his opinions and that of his book received front page coverage throughout mainstream media .
Frontline produced a 2 hour " documentary " on Posner 's claims which failed to offer opposing views by other Kennedy assassination investigators / authors to refute or take issue with Posner 's position .
In 1997 , on the 50 year anniversary of the Roswell , New Mexico UFO Crash of 1947 , the government offered up a high ranking Air Force officer to make an utter fool of himself on national TV ( CNN ) by stating that the so called " bodies " of aliens beings - which were recovered from the Roswell crash - were " in fact " really only test dummies that the Air Force had sent aloft to see how they would fare under crash conditions .
This orchestrated and staged press conference had already stated that the dummies were deployed in 1954 .
When one reporter asked this Air Force officer what the connection was between a 1954 test of crash dummies and the 1947 Roswell UFO crash , the stunned officer could only mumble that apparently " time compression " had " taken place " .
It was a Golden Moment for those of us who rail against the unending stream of lies and unmitigated deception fostered upon the American public by the ( corportate / Illuminati controlled ) mainstream media and government spokesmen .
[ Update January 2002 ]
The party line from chemtrail debunkers has changed over the past 3 years .
Early on , chemtrail disinformation artists wanted the public to think that chemtrails were really just ordinary contrails that were persisting longer than usual due to changing atmospheric conditions and similar tripe .
Later , when the persistent contrail theme had worn too thin , debukers needed to create some sort of logical excuse for chemtrails , so they began to peddle the aerial immunization against ' terrorists ' biologicals or solar wind " protection " gambit .
Lately , the current unofficial party line seems to be
1. protection of the ozone layer ,
2. secret military radar blanketing technology ,
3. aerosol ' vaccinations ' of some sort and
4. some vague reference to ' protection from aliens ' ( ??? you got me ) .
Debunkers will usually offer themselves as experts or authorities on chemtrails and will always give you a 80 - 90 % dose of real info layered in with their hidden propaganda message .
Another trait I 've noticed from debunkers is the the sheer volume of their presentation coupled with a lot of technical jargon , scientific looking graphs and pictures to bolster the image of scientific validity and depth of investigation .
But if you read their ' reports ' carefully enough , you can spot the party line - loud and clear .
Lastly , debunkers will always yell " fraud " the loudest for those articles and authors who hit closest to home where truth is concerned .
A good place to start honing your discernment skills is with the highly circulated and often referenced " Chemtrails Report " .
ENSCHEDE , the Netherlands 
In this small town just across the border from Germany , a small group of Dutch scientists and one irrepressible Austrian salesman have dedicated themselves to the task of reinventing one of the great inventions of the 20th century 
Polaroid ’s instant film .
Digital cameras are ubiquitous , cheap and easy to use  the reasons Polaroid stopped making the film last year  so what this group in Enschede is attempting may seem hopelessly retrograde .
But to them , that is exactly the point .
They want to recast an outdated production process in an abandoned Polaroid factory for an age that has fallen for digital pictures because they think people still have room in their hearts for retro photography that eschews airbrushing or Photoshop .
“ This project is about building a very interesting business to last for at least another decade , ” said Florian Kaps , the Austrian entrepreneur behind the effort .
“ It is about the importance of analog aspects in a more and more digital world . ”
I can't believe I 'm admitting this , but I 've lost count of the number of times I ’ve watched the YouTube video of Susan Boyle 's performance on Britain 's Got Talent .
At least I 'm not alone .
To date , more than 40 million people have hit the site to see an unemployed , never - married , frizzy - haired 47 - year - old raise the roof belting “ I Dreamed a Dream ” from Les Misérables .
Like everyone else , I was initially arrested by the comic incongruity of the spectacle : ugly singer , beautiful song .
But now I 'm fascinated by my — our — fascination .
Why was it such a shock that Boyle is so good ?
Why did a huge crowd laugh out loud at the very notion that she had real talent ?
Why would most of us , let 's face it , have done the same ?
In short , if a person 's gifts are hidden , why do we so often assume that those gifts do n't exist ?
Susan Boyle 's great talent is almost as old as she is , and yet she needed uncommon nerve and freakish luck for anyone to see it .
That 's the measure of our collective blindness to omnipresent human worth .
From the making of social policy to the minutiae of social interaction , our society assumes the worst about whole swaths of people , when experience suggests we should assume the best .
Every time I encounter the perception of low - ranking U.S. soldiers as yahoos or trigger - happy atrocity - committers - in - waiting , I remember the reality I witnessed so many times at the front gate of U.S. military bases in Iraq .
Some very young , very badly paid , and very uncomfortably armored man would be standing in the desert sun , managing a highly complex task all too little known to his loftily credentialed civilian counterparts : dealing directly — and skillfully and respectfully — with the Iraqi public .
This required negotiating one mental maze after another : A man says he is being threatened by a militia that is planning to ambush U.S. troops this afternoon .
Is this a useful piece of information ?
A misguided complaint ?
A trap ?
Similarly , when I hear welfare mothers portrayed as shiftless cheats , I think of my husband 's mother , whom his father abandoned with nine children and not a dime of support .
That welfare mother was not a sponge , she was a saint — and she can't have been the only one .
Every time I see domestic help treated as worthless drudges , I remember my own grandmother .
In a different life , she might have run the world ; in her actual life , she came to the U.S. at age 13 to clean houses .
Over time , Nana 's outward social position improved — but her intrinsic human quality was sterling from Day One .
These are just a few examples from my own , very fortunate life .
If we concede — and why would n't we ? — that it is a heroic feat to survive on less than $ 1 a day , there are more than 1 billion heroes walking the earth today .
It 's not all a question of class .
Stay - at - home mothers of every stripe are routinely treated as morons .
Overweight people are openly ridiculed ( and do n't tell me they are ridiculed out of great concern for their health — thin , pretty drug addicts are glorified ) .
Old people may as well chuck their mental marbles out the window , for all the credit they get for keeping them .
Meanwhile , their amazing caregivers have the social status of paper towels .
Which reminds me : Long before her star turn , Susan Boyle did something truly laudable .
She took care of her mother .
Do n't get me wrong .
Normally , I am the last person to downplay the importance of cosmetics .
When it comes to the ongoing international debate about whether Boyle should make herself over — or rather , now that she 's gotten a decent haircut and a Burberry scarf , whether she should make herself over some more — I find it every bit as dehumanizing to hope she remains forever frumpy as to demand that she pour herself into the standard mold of celebrity .
Appearances will always count , and there ’s no reason they should n’t .
But they should not count so much that they allow us to miss almost everything valuable about almost everyone almost all the time .
Ultimately , it 's not Susan Boyle who could really use a makeover .
It 's the rest of us .
I ’m a little late to the party but it looks like Obama is set to pick Judge Sonia Sotomayor as his pick for the Supreme Court :
President Obama has decided to nominate the federal appeals judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court , choosing a daughter of Puerto Rican parents raised in Bronx public housing projects to become the nation ’s first Hispanic justice , officials said Tuesday .
The decision , to be announced Tuesday morning , will be Mr. Obama ’s first selection to the Supreme Court and could trigger a struggle with Senate Republicans who have indicated they may oppose the nomination .
But Democrats control nearly the 60 votes necessary to choke off a filibuster and even Republicans said they have little hope of blocking confirmation barring unforeseen revelation .
Judge Sotomayor , 54 , who has served for more than a decade on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals based in New York City , would become the nation ’s 111th justice , replacing David H. Souter , who is retiring after 19 years on the bench .
Although Justice Souter was appointed by the first President George Bush , he became a mainstay of the liberal faction on the court and so his replacement by Judge Sotomayor likely would not shift the overall balance of power .
Thinking about the upcoming confirmation battle in the Senate , I anticipate the next few weeks being more painful than most — especially because the talking heads will likely spend 60 - 75 % of their time talking about Judge Sotomayor ’s race and gender .
The Supreme Court has become one of the biggest lightning rods in Washington , which inevitably draws all the kooks out of the woodwork to make all kinds of wild claims and accusations .
It ’s really too bad because I share John Cole ’s view of how SCOTUS picks should be evaluated :
What do I think about all this ?
Pretty much what I thought when Roberts and Alito were confirmed .
A president deserves his picks , and unless they are incompetent or decidedly out of the mainstream or there is some exceptional reason to keep them off the bench , they should be confirmed .
I ’m sure lots of you disagree with that position , but that is what I think .
Elections matter .
Obama should get his picks .
John also had this to say about the GOP ’s strategy :
Politically , this pick is filled with land mines for Republicans , giving them the opportunity to sound like clods to hispanics and female voters , and given their remarkable tone - deafness the last couple of years , I ’m sure they can manage to shave a few points off their already historically low popularity .
Jeff Sessions should be a load of fun to watch .
Additionally , because of the amount of time between when she was chosen and when Obama would like the vote to happen , it is going to be difficult for them to drag their feet the way they want to .
For Republicans , the calculus is drag this out as long as possible , make it as ugly as possible , and hope it gets the base to give money .
Update : Steve Benen highlights a salient point :
This morning at the White House , when President Obama introduced Judge Sonia Sotomayor as his Supreme Court nominee , he noted that he ’d like to see the Senate act swiftly on her nomination — as they have “ twice before . ”
It was a reminder that when Sotomayor sits before the Senate Judiciary Committee , and her nomination heads to the Senate floor , it wo n’t be the first time these lawmakers have consider her qualifications for the federal bench .
In 1998 , the Senate confirmed Sotomayor for the court of appeals , 67 to 29 .
Every Democrat voted in support — yes , that means you too , Ben Nelson — and as Eric Kleefeld noted this morning , seven Republican senators who are still in the chamber also voted for Sotomayor ’s conformation .
Update 2 : Wasting no time in getting the Stoopid kicked up into high gear , here ’s a statement from the rightwing Judicial [ Anti -]
Confirmation Network :
Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important that the law as written .
She thinks that judges should dictate policy , and that one ’s sex , race , and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench .
See those references to “ sex , race and ethnicity ” ?
To steal a bit from Wonkette : “ Translation : a radical leftist lesbian radical who will take away your guns , force your children into kindergarten abortion parties , exhume the corpse of Ronald Reagan for the purposes of urinating on it , and surrender in Iraq . ”
Update 3 : As a final thought , I hope everyone bears in mind that 98 % of the attacks the GOP will be leveling against Judge Sotomayor would be the exact same attacks they would be using against any other Obama nominee ( short of Robert Bork ) .
All that matters to them is that she ’s not conservative and likely does not support criminalizing abortion .
Update 4 : It looks like the RNC ’s Official Talking Points ( TM ) on the nomination have been leaked .
By Ben Cohen
In response to gay activist blogger Michael Roger 's new documentary ' Outrage ' , a documentary that outs gay Republicans who legislate against homosexuality , NewsChannel 8 's Let 's Talk Live , co-host Doug McKelway came up with the following logic :
Outing gay conservative politicians who legislate to make life difficult for homosexuals is wrong because it involves delving into their personal lives .
And the following gem :
Barney Frank was partly responsible for the housing crisis , and we do n't go talking about his sexuality .
Therefore it is wrong to talk about the sexuality of other politicians .
If you are scratching your head , do n't worry .
The argument makes about as much sense as Michelle Bachmann 's thoughts on trade policy .
Anyhow , McKelway worked himself up to the point where he threatened to punch Roger across the face for his insolence ( Roger suggested McKelway may harbor some homophobic feelings ) .
Watch below :
We are not making this up :
Barack Obama was elected commander in chief promising to run the most transparent presidential administration in American history .
This achievement and the overall promise of his historic administration caused the National Newspaper Publishers Assn. to name him " Newsmaker of the Year . "
The president is to receive the award from the federation of black community newspapers in a White House ceremony this afternoon .
The Obama White House has closed the press award ceremony to the press .
From the president 's official schedule :
" Later in the afternoon , the President and the First Lady will attend a reception with the National Newspaper Publisher Association in the State Dining Room , where they will be presented the Newsmaker of the Year award .
This event is closed press . "
Maybe they 'll let the newspaper people pass the award through the fence .
( UPDATE : The White House notes that while other press were barred from the publishers ' event , the association 's publishers themselves were admitted and the event treated as an exclusive interview and it expects the association to keep a record of what transpired during it . )

Krugman : ' Right - wing billionaires ... manufactured ' tea parties David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday April 14 , 2009
Print This Email This
In spite of President Barack Obama 's middle - class tax cuts -- swooping rates to well below those of President Ronald Reagan -- some persist in the belief that Obama is " the taxingist taxing taxer in all the taxing history of taxes , " joked MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow on Monday night .
Playing off a Sunday op - ed by New York Times economist Paul Krugman , Maddow touched on the issue of " AstroTurf " in the tea parties , which Krugman suggested are in - part " manufactured " by " right - wing billionaires . "
" Interestingly , the actual folks turning up at these events seem a little bit Ron Paul - ish , " she noted .
" Folks at protests arguing against the legitimacy of the Federal Reserve ?
Folks arguing for a return to the gold standard ?
I feel like I 'm back outside the Republican primary debates with the exuberant Ron Paul supporters showing up all of the other Republican candidates . "
Maddow , who was once a host for liberal talk radio , told the Times in 2008 that Ron Paul is her favorite Republican .
" I like the congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul , because I understand what he believes , and he is fearless and civic - minded in his beliefs , rather than personally zealous , " she said .
" Remember how the Ron Paul campaign raised $ 6 million in one day ? " asked Maddow on Monday night .
" In a drive that coincided with the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party ?
Ron Paul supporters never called that fundraiser a ' teabagging . '
Perhaps because they knew how to use UrbanDictionary.com . "
Maddow 's guest , Air America correspondent Ana Marie Cox , noted that the " teabagging " is seen as " somewhat perverted " by at least some of Ron Paul 's supporters , even though Paul himself expressed enthusiasm for the events .
" [ Dr. Paul ] may not know how to use Urban Dictionary , " said Cox .
On a related point , as noted by Paul Krugman in Sunday 's New York Times , the tea parties are at least in - part " AstroTurf , " or a fake grassroots movement , manufactured by " right - wing billionaires . "
" In particular , a key role is being played by FreedomWorks , an organization run by Richard Armey , the former House majority leader , and supported by the usual group of right - wing billionaires , " he wrote .
" And the parties are , of course , being promoted heavily by Fox News . "
On the board of directors at FreedomWorks are none other than former Speaker of the House Dick Armey , former Secretary of Transportation James H. Burnley and billionaire Steve Forbes , among others .
" I want to point out that some of the Ron Paul people that are going to these rallies , and even Dr. Paul himself , I think , do genuinely believe in whatever wacky idea is being supported here , " said Cox .
" I mean , it 's hard to say what the idea is ; as you point out , it 's sort - of amorphous outrage .
But the Ron Paul people are very anti-tax of any kind ...
So , there you go . "
" But that s nothing new , and AstroTurf has worked well for Republicans in the past .
The most notable example was the ' spontaneous ' riot back in 2000  actually orchestrated by G.O.P. strategists  that shut down the presidential vote recount in Floridas Miami - Dade County , " wrote Krugman .
" So what 's the implication of the fact that Republicans are refusing to grow up , the fact that they are still behaving the same way they did when history seemed to be on their side ?
I 'd say that its good for Democrats , at least in the short run  but its bad for the country . "

Classes in Ruby are first - class objects — each is an instance of class Class .
-- ruby - doc.org
class Person
...
end
Person = Class . new do
...
end
Class.new(super_class=Object ) creates a new anonymous ( unnamed ) class with the given superclass ( or Object if no parameter is given ) .
You can give a class a name by assigning the class object to a constant .
-- ruby - doc.org
klass = Class .
new
klass .
ancestors klass .
new .
class
Person = klass
Person .
ancestors Person . new .
class
klass .
ancestors klass .

class klass
require ' test / unit '
module Gateway
def post ( arg )
true
end
end
class GatewayTest < Test :: Unit :: TestCase
def test_post_returns_true
klass = Class .
new do
include Gateway
end
assert_equal true , klass .
new . post ( 1 )
end
end
Most classes are defined using the syntax of the following example .
Defining classes this way is familiar to most developers .
Ruby provides another syntax for defining classes using Class.new .
The following example also defines the Person class .
The following example shows that the new class begins as an anonymous Class instance , but becomes a named class when it 's assigned to a constant .
I generally use traditional syntax when defining named classes , but I have found anonymous classes very helpful when creating maintainable tests .
For example , I often need to test instance methods of a Module .
The following tests show how you can define a class , include a module , and assert the expected value all within one test method .
There are other ways to solve this issue , but I prefer this solution because it keeps everything necessary for the test within the test itself .
Another advantage to defining classes using Class . new is that you can pass a block to the new method ; therefore , the block could access variables defined within the same scope .
In practice , I 've never needed this feature , but it 's worth noting .
A full - scale model of a Lancaster bomber has already been built , as has a replica of the famous bouncing bomb .
But producers of a remake of The Dam Busters have yet to resolve one question : what on earth are they to do about a dog called Nigger ?
The anachronistically - named black Labrador was the faithful companion of RAF Wing Commander Guy Gibson , who led the British mission to destroy German dams in 1943 .
The dog is central to the plot : not only was he the mascot of Gibson 's 617 Squadron , but after he was killed in a car accident , his name became a codeword for the bombers ' prime target .
While the name was still acceptable when the original movie was made in 1954 , that is no longer the case .
So the film - makers , who include New Zealander Peter Jackson , director of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy , are faced with an unenviable choice : ditch historical accuracy or risk widespread offence .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The executive producer , Sir David Frost , asked the actor Stephen Fry , who is writing the script , to propose alternative names , but rejected his suggestions .
Sir David declared last month : " Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy , so I think that 's what we will call it .
Stephen has been coming up with other names , but this is the one I want . "
This week , however , Jackson denied that a decision had been made .
His assistant , Matthew Dravitzki , told New Zealand 's Dominion Post : " To stay true to the story , you ca n't just change it [ the name ] .
We have not made any decisions yet .
The script is still being written , and that decision … will be made closer to the time . "
Nigger featured in Paul Brickhill 's 1951 book , The Dam Busters , which inspired the film .
He also rated 12 mentions in the original movie .
Shooting of the £ 26 m remake is expected to begin later this year , although the cast has yet to be revealed .
Jackson , the producer , whetted appetites this week when he unveiled a Lancaster replica in Masterton , north of Wellington .
When the project was announced in 2006 , Jackson acknowledged the canine - related difficulties .
" It 's a situation where you 're damned if you do and damned if you do n't , " he said .
" If you go one way , people are going to say we 've sold out to political correctness .
If you go the other way , you 're obviously going to be inadvertently offending people .
So it 's a no - win scenario . "
In 2001 ITV was criticised for editing out all mentions of Nigger 's name when it screened the original film .
Index on Censorship called the move " unnecessary and ridiculous " , while viewers complained that key sections had been omitted .
In the US , the film has been screened with the dialogue dubbed to rename the dog Trigger .
Jackson has said that he wants to be faithful to the book and 1954 film .
His version , he pledged , would be " as authentic as possible and as close to the spirit of the original as possible " .
The Dam Buster raid was one of the RAF 's boldest wartime missions , and the remake – to be directed by New Zealand 's Christian Rivers – will use details that were still classified in the 1950s .
Shooting is expected to take place near Wellington and in Britain .
As Sharia Councils expand their powers and reach , ministers have unwittingly rolled the dice over a type of cultural snakes and ladders , all in the hope that such initiatives will increase inclusiveness and marginalise Islamic radicals .
But all the evidence contradicts ministers ' stated aims .
Sharia rulings are more likely to create legal ghettos - undermining rather than improving social cohesion .
And in so doing , ministers are found guilty of piecemeal legal vandalism and managing the gradual decline of English jurisprudence .
By expanding the powers of Sharia Councils , ministers have set the scene for a breaking narrative which is fractious , discriminates against women , and , incrementally , is establishing a parallel legal system .
Since the 1996 Arbitration Act , government ministers have allowed Islamic tribunals around Britain to rule on a range of financial disputes , provided both parties agree to accept the court 's decision .
But in recent years , these tribunals have developed into fully fledged Sharia Councils - allowed to settle new disputes , such as divorce , family law , and faith issues .
These powers go well beyond the letter and spirit of the original legislation and whilst they provide new ways of dispensing cheap justice they do not always dispense fair justice .
The replacement of legal precedence and common law with Islamic codification is also a gift to some extremist parties who have seized on the increasing numbers of Sharia Councils as more evidence of the demotion of hard fought for British cultural freedoms and laws .
And despite the protestations of senior government ministers over recent BNP advances , ministerial alarm calls will ring deep and hollow as long the same ministers continue to advocate two Britains .
The views of the BNP are repugnant , but it should not take BNP electoral gains for ministers to wake up to the fact that social cohesion cannot be predicated on the reality , or the perception , of one rule for one community and a different set of rules for everyone else .
Allowing different groups to apply different standards at variants with existing common and statute law is a recipe for resentment and suspicion .
This legal dualism also strikes at the very heart the great British virtue of fair play - and all British subjects being united - under one nation .
And as ministers sleepwalk into further fragmenting communities , they still decline to answer the fundamental question : do Muslim women enjoy the same rights under Sharia jurisprudence as under English law ?
Ministers should not be allowed to obviate when challenged about Islamic teaching on the role , rights , and responsibilities , of women in society .
Ministers may choose to evade this issue , but Sharia principles and practices are unlikely to progress the much needed emancipation of Britain ’s Muslim women .
With Harriet Harman , the doyenne of Labour ’s women ’s rights movement , likely to lay the much - trumpeted Equality Bill before Parliament within months , Sharia Councils shine an embarrassing light on how ministers have increasingly relegated and downgraded thousands of Muslim women to de facto second class British citizens , perversely , in the name of tolerance and understanding .
The response of government proponents of Sharia Councils say those who choose to come before Councils do so on a voluntarily basis and that , according to the 1996 Act , parties are free to agree upon how their disputes are resolved .
In reality , some Muslim women feel pressured into accepting the rulings of male - dominated Sharia Councils – mostly through fear of retribution and being ostracised – sometimes by their own families .
Women are also losing out in rulings over child custody disputes , which more often rule in favour of men .
It is not unimaginable that , in the near future , people from other faiths - and no faith at all - will nominally or genuinely convert to Islam , in the hope of begetting a sympathetic custody hearing and paternal settlement compared to the maternal bias of some English family courts .
Speaking at a justice conference last October , Justice Secretary , Jack Straw , commented :
" There is nothing whatever in English law that prevents people abiding by Sharia principles if they wish to , provided they do not come into conflict with English law ” .
Such conflicts occur throughout Britain every week , and with it , the shunning of basic rights for thousands of British Muslim women .
With Britain ’s growing Muslim population , the sphere of Sharia Councils is likely to increase still further .
This is something that must be resisted by those who believe in tolerance and mutual respect , and by those , including progressives in the Muslim community , who seek to champion the rights of all – including the equal rights of Britain ’s female Muslims .
Big polluters knew better than to knock on our doors  they knocked on Kevin Rudd 's door instead and got a very different reception .
Unbeknown to most households , Rudd effectively agreed to write all these cheques and more .
His so - called carbon pollution reduction scheme asked the biggest emitting industries to pay for , on average , just one in every five tonnes of their greenhouse pollution  the rest of us would pay for the other four .
By 2020 , 45 per cent of emissions would be given away free to the worst offenders , maybe more .
This makes it mathematically impossible to make deep cuts in greenhouse pollution in Australia , and the Prime Minister 's promise of a " blueprint for reducing carbon pollution at home " , becomes undeliverable .
The only way of concealing this is to outsource Australia 's emission reductions en masse  paying other countries to reduce emissions on our behalf .
That 's why Rudd's white paper on emissions trading placed no limit whatsoever on how many emission permits and credits generated overseas could be used in place of emission cuts in Australia .
One hundred per cent of Australia 's emission cuts could be made overseas just as long as outsourcing options are cheap and plentiful .
And they will be .
The carbon trade is likely to be dominated by cheap " biocarbon " measures  especially deals in which developing countries pledge not to log rainforests in return for Western polluters getting credit for the carbon emissions prevented .
This " reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation " ( REDD ) could cost as little as
$ US1 per tonne of carbon dioxide , and it is plentiful : deforestation accounts for about 20 per cent of global emissions ; around three times Australia 's annual emissions in PNG and Indonesia alone .
Climate Change Minister Penny
Wong has effectively conceded that because the Government proposes no limit on outsourcing emission cuts , actual greenhouse pollution in Australia might not fall irrespective of what 2020 target Australia adopts .
After all , if all the cuts can be outsourced cheaply , what comes out of smokestacks and tailpipes here need not change , whether we have a 5 per cent target or a 40 per cent target .
Like our manufacturing , our call centres and so much more , it can all be outsourced to developing countries .
Food shortages are reported in the northern town of Trizidela do Vale The Brazilian authorities say almost 408,000 people still cannot return home because of floods that began last month in the north of the country .
The bad weather is forecast to persist for another fortnight .
The government has released more than $ 435 m ( £ 273 m ) in aid for victims of the flooding in the north and north - east of Brazil .
A BBC correspondent says the damage across the region runs into hundreds of millions of dollars .
Forty - nine people are said to have died across 12 states and many small farmers say the flooding has devastated this year 's crops , the BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Sao Paulo .
Nearly 400,000 children are also missing classes either because roads are blocked , classrooms are under water , or schools are being used as shelters to accommodate the homeless , he adds .
The situation is said to be most critical in the state of Amazonas , where a quarter of all pupils are affected .
Despite the government 's emergency aid , there are reports from the worst - affected areas that help is not reaching those who need it most .
In the northern town of Trizidela do Vale , food supplies are said to be insufficient to meet demand , despite pleas from local community leaders , our correspondent says .
Experts say global warming may be behind the wild climate swings that have brought periods of unprecedented droughts and flooding to the Amazon in recent years .

I 'm a professional dating coach for men ( if you 've seen the Will Smith movie " Hitch , " kind of like that ) .
I take guys out to bars , night clubs , malls , bookstores -- wherever they want -- and show them how to meet women , talk to them and get dates .
Business is good .
In fact , business is better than ever .
And it keeps pouring in .
I 'm booked through the end of April coaching guys in four different major cities , sometimes making four figures in a single night out on the town .
Then I go home , sleep until 3 PM and do it again the next night .
But what surprises me more than the fact that all of these men are turning for help in their love lives , is HOW DESPERATELY they 're turning for help .
" Lost " Puzzle in Wired Magazine
For the April 09 issue of Wired Magazine , I was asked to create a cryptographic puzzle based on the television show Lost .
Specifically , I was given a “ clue ” to encrypt .
Here are details of the puzzle and solving attempts .
Near as I can tell , no one has published a solution .
Creating something like this is very hard .
The puzzle needs to be hard enough so that people do n’t figure it out immediately , and easy enough so that people eventually figure it out .
To make matters even more complicated , people will share their ideas on the Internet .
So if the solution requires — and I ’m making this up — expertise in Mayan history , carburetor design , algebraic topology , and Russian folk dancing , those people are likely to come together on the Internet .
The puzzle has to be challenging for the group mind ; not just for individual minds .
Do I need to give people a hint ?
EDITED TO ADD ( 5/20 ) : No hints required ; there ’s a solution posted .

( Removes third paragraph with reference to not making any other payment )
NEW YORK , May 19 ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp's GM.N plan for a bankruptcy filing involves a quick sale of the company 's healthy assets to a new company initially owned by the U.S. government , a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday .
The source , who would not be named because he was not cleared to speak with the media , did not specify a purchase price .
The new company is expected to honor the claims of secured lenders , possibly in full , according to the source .
The remaining assets of GM would stay in bankruptcy protection to satisfy other outstanding claims .
GM has about $ 6 billion in secured debt , including a secured revolving credit and bank debt .
The government ’s plans include giving stakes in the new company to GM ’s union and bondholders , although the ownership structure of the company is still being negotiated , said the source who is familiar with the company ’s plans .
In addition , the government would extend a credit line to the new company and forgive the bulk of the $ 15.4 billion in emergency loans that the U.S. has already provided to GM , the source said .
The government has given GM until June 1 to restructure its operations to lower its debt burden and employee costs .
If those talks failed , the company has said it would follow rival Chrysler LLC into bankruptcy .
Setting up a new company to buy the healthy assets is aimed at reassuring consumers who might not be willing to make a major purchase from a bankrupt company , fearing it would not honor warranties or provide service .
The board of the new company would be established with the tacit approval of the government .
Fritz Henderson , who took the helm of GM earlier this year after the government pushed out Rick Wagoner , would likely head the new company , the source said .
GM could not be immediately reached for comment .
GM shares were up about 9 percent at $ 1.29 .

Although static graphics is obviously much easier to scan and therefore can be easily perceived , motion graphics brings dynamics and life into otherwise static content .
Animation can help designers to convey a deeper meaning with the use of various video - techniques .
It can also provide a better data visualization than the static graphics .
How and where you use it in real - life situations is totally up to your talent and your abilities to express yourself .
Motion graphics are not only created using digital techniques ; also traditional animation and special effects techniques are used .
However , digital techniques help to minimize production costs and achieve nice results with less effort .
For example , the Juno opening sequence was a hand - made motion graphics which took painstakingly long time to finish .

A staffer thrusts open the glass doors of the San Francisco Public Library 's Mission Bay branch , rushes toward the bike racks , and pleads with a commuter who works in a nearby office building not to park his bike there ; it 's for library customers only .
Parking meters and signposts near City Hall , courthouses , and other public buildings are festooned daily with locked - up bikes , because the bike racks there are always full .
This city may be suffering a budget crunch , but this shortage of waist - high , upside - down steel Us is n't for lack of funding .
During the past four years , the number of cyclists on San Francisco streets has increased by more than 40 percent , yet the city has been prevented from installing amenities for cyclists thanks to the legal efforts of a local gadfly .
Rob Anderson , a self - described dishwasher from Mendocino County , has gained notoriety for suing the city in 2005 to force it to conduct an environmental impact study before implementing its proposed bike plan , which called for taking away parking spaces and car lanes to make room for bike lanes .
The suit was filed by attorney Mary Miles , a friend of Anderson 's from their days contributing to the Anderson Valley Advertiser , a caustic Northern California weekly owned by his brother .
Anderson and Miles made the novel argument that bikes are bad for the environment because they get in the way of automobiles , which must then idle and emit more smog .
A judge agreed that San Francisco city leaders had flouted California environmental law by forgoing environmental review .
And he slapped the city with a punitive - seeming injunction , forbidding bicycle - related improvements , even ones that do n't take away space from cars , such as bike racks .
Since then , Anderson has used the judge 's ruling to tirelessly share his view that bike lanes are a plot by extremists bent on harming ordinary Americans ' way of life .
The Wall Street Journal even did a story on his unusual crusade last year , in which he railed against the city 's " bike fanatics . "
" The behavior of the bike people on city streets is always annoying , " he told the Journal .
" This ' Get out of my way , I 'm not burning fossil fuels . ' "
( The story also noted that Anderson himself has n't owned a car for 20 years . )
He also regularly catalogues his complaints about the bike nuts on his blog .
" These people are arrogant crackpots determined to screw up our traffic based on a juvenile vision of the future of San Francisco , " he wrote on May 14 .
But as the end of the long road toward accommodating Anderson 's lawsuit nears , and the Municipal Transportation Agency board awaits a June 26 vote to approve 34 miles of new bike lanes , new bike racks , and other amenities — and the city 's Planning Commission awaits a scheduled hearing to consider the environmental study Anderson demanded — it 's beginning to seem that nobody will have done more to advance the " juvenile vision " of giving more space to bicyclists than Anderson himself .
Bureaucrats , advocates , and local policy wonks say bicyclists ' rights have progressed more thanks to Anderson 's suit than they would have without it .
Anderson 's lawsuit " increased the resources the MTA put into the bike plan , the traffic analysis , and the outreach , by a factor of three at least , " said Dave Snyder , transportation policy coordinator at San Francisco Planning and Urban Research , a private smart - growth think tank .
" It encouraged them to consider all of the bike lanes as a package , and introduce them and get them approved as a package , which is way more efficient than what they planned to do " before Anderson 's lawsuit .
Under California environmental law , projects must be studied and approved in their entirety .
But under the original 2005 plan , city leaders had intended to add individual bike lanes incrementally , striping a bike lane here , adding a few racks there , until a network fell into place .
That 's an impractical way to construct a transportation system :
Imagine the chaos that would ensue if the street changes needed to accommodate a light - rail line were added piecemeal .
But Anderson 's lawsuit has fixed that .
It has forced the city to make a detailed , highly engineered project out of a bike plan that five years ago was , comparatively speaking at least , more of an empty political gesture .
Because of the lawsuit and the injunction that followed , multiple city bureaucracies were forced to undertake the challenge of engineering 56 separate projects all at once .
This meant assigning planners , engineers , scientists , and other specialists to measure bike lanes ' effects on traffic , rejigger plans where appropriate , and then present results at countless community meetings and public hearings .
Environmental law also requires planners to integrate public comment into their final product , and city staff has undertaken months of campaigning to apprise merchants and community members of the plan , and in some cases make changes to accommodate complaints .
A few years ago , I cursed Anderson — who has often dismissed me as a bike nut — for ruining what I thought was a good thing .
So today , I come not to bury Anderson in his crazed logic , but to praise him .
Anderson 's lawsuit and his caustic polemics have infuriated environmentalists , but they 've also engendered some public sympathy .
That 's because within Anderson 's ravings is a kernel of truth .
A minority of San Francisco bicyclists are , dare I say it , fanatical .
Yet this , too , is a bicycling problem Anderson 's lawsuit seems poised to help fix .
Since 1997 , when much of the local police force was diverted to crack down on a law - breaking Critical Mass ride , some San Franciscans have regarded cyclists as an offensive fringe group .
This is true in part simply because some motorists find it irksome to have to slow down for them on narrow city streets .
But it 's also because some people have taken to cycling as a form of activism or counterculturalism , rather than what ordinary bike commuters like myself consider it to be : merely a healthy , efficient , enjoyable , and cheap way to get to work , take my kids to school , cart the family to the ocean in the evenings , and ride to Marin County on the weekend .
As with other types of activism in San Francisco , the radical bicycle vanguard has a reputation for smugness , lawlessness , and a confrontational attitude — kind of like someone who quits cigarettes , then makes a commotion every time she enters a smoky room .
Mainstream environmentalists have taken pains to distance themselves from tree - spiking Earth Firsters .
Advocates for AIDS patients long ago shunned the radical wing of Act Up .
As I 've noted before , mainstream bicycle advocacy has up until now failed to perform the necessary heavy lifting of shunning its radical fringe .
Critical Mass , a monthly cyclists ' parade that occasionally disintegrates into red-light - running chaos , is listed on the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition 's calendar of events , albeit with the disingenuous caveat that the " ride is not organized nor endorsed by the SFBC . "
" We are better than motorists , by every important measure , " one cyclist - convert recently wrote in a local political pamphlet , apparently unaware that most adult cyclists are motorists , too .
He thoughtfully added : " Maybe you 've seen me around town — and if so , maybe you 've seen me blow through stop signs or red lights . "
While bicyclists themselves have failed to suppress this unhelpful element , the comprehensive bike plan necessitated by Rob Anderson 's suit has pushed bicycle advocacy in this direction .
That 's because it's not purple - haired fixie - riders who 've been meeting with merchants and neighborhood groups , but city staffers in suits .
These are diplomacy - minded bureaucrats interested in taking all views into account — as required by the California environmental review process .
The results of this middle - of - the - road approach show up in the final product .
One - quarter of the plan 's stated goals involve corralling the law - breaking impulses of yahoos such as the aforementioned pamphleteer .
The plan calls for bicycle safety education , and , more importantly , " improving bicycle safety through targeted enforcement . "
That 's right : ticketing law - breaker cyclists as well as scofflaw motorists .
The plan calls for working with police to put a high priority on " motorist and bicyclist violations . "
And it even calls for working with police and the courts to create bicycle traffic school , for wingnuts who might think it 's okay to blow through red lights .
The long - delayed bike plan is expected to be presented to the MTA board at the end of next month .
Timothy Papandreou , assistant deputy director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority , says he is confident that all 34 miles of proposed bike lanes and other improvements will be approved .
" My staff have been working day and night , " Papandreou said .
" I think what we 're seeing is an example of a big cultural change in San Francisco . "
If the Planning Commission votes to certify the court - ordered environmental study , the city attorney 's office will take it before a judge , who , if all goes well , will lift the injunction .
The city plans to spend between $ 3 million and $ 4 million next year on bike improvements , with a total of $ 14 million to be spent on the entire plan .
That 's a cheap way to get more types of traffic moving in the city .
Thanks to cranky bike - hater Rob Anderson , San Francisco could become one of America 's most bike - friendly cities .
For this I hope he always feels the wind at his back , and that his roads go downhill .
Turley : Bush terror memos are ' very definition of tyranny ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday March 4 , 2009
Print This Email This
Since the release on Monday of nine previously - secret Bush administration legal memos claiming that the president has the power to ignore the Constitution when fighting terrorism , experts have almost unanimously denounced both their legal reasoning and their conclusions .
" These memos provide the very definition of tyranny , " Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann on Tuesday .
" These memos include everything that a petty despot would want . "
Turley believes , however , that there may be worse revelations yet to come .
" These memos were n't written in a vacuum , " he noted .
" The question is what did they do in response ?
We know , among other things that they created a torture program .
... I think we 're going to find out that this was the mere foundation for a greater edifice that has yet to be disclosed . "
The Justice Department has already indicated that it is considering releasing additional Bush - era legal opinions .
Turley was also scathing in his criticism of John Yoo , the former Justice Department lawyer who was responsible for many of the more extreme claims of executive power .
" I still cannot believe that he would produce this type of work , " Turley said in dismay .
" It 's really bad in terms of its legal analysis .
...
It really does show , I think , the great tragedy of a very bright individual working very , very hard to satisfy the president and to hell him what he wanted to hear . "
Turley , however , may be underestimating Yoo 's influence .
In 2007 , journalist Charlie Savage noted that the Office of Legal Counsel had no head during the crucial weeks immediately after 9/11 , leaving Yoo free to put his own ideas into effect .
" He was very conservative , " Savage said of Yoo , " and he had made his name in academia by writing law journal articles and speaking at events in which he would take a very provocatively revisionist stance about the scope of executive power .
...
However , when [ Yoo ] became the Office of Legal Counsel deputy in charge of the national security and foreign affairs portfolio and had no boss after 9/11 , it allowed him to put these theories into pragmatic effect by writing secret advisory opinions that stated these theories as true , citing his own work from the '90s as authority for why they were true . "
Turley concluded by reaffirming that he remains skeptical of the plan being promoted by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) to create a " truth commission " to investigate Bush - era misdeeds .
He told Olbermann , " It 's up to the rest of us to say , if President Obama means it that no one is above the law , we need a special prosecutor and we need to investigate -- not another commission . "

Founder of SwapStyle.com Emily Chesher aka The Swap Queen
The waste created from the fashion industry is huge .
We live season by season , sometimes only wearing an item once .
It brings a smile to my face knowing that Ive created a easily accessible economically , socially and environmentally sound solution to an age old problem .
Past News Releases RSS
While many businesses are suffering through the recession , one website that is thriving is the free fashion swap site http://www.swapstyle.com which has received a massive 300 % increase in direct hits to the site over the past 8 months .
Swapstyle.com was the world 's first fashion swap site , and has since grown to become the largest clothes swapping community online .
It is the perfect way to look stylish in a recession , while making fashion green by being environmentally sustainable .
" I'm now receiving emails from women around the world saying what a difference swapstyle .com has made in their lives since the down turn in the economy , and that it has helped curb shopping addictions and lessen credit card debt by enabling them to be in control of their spending habits and still be able to have the rush of receiving a new dress .
There is definitely a direct correlation to the down - turn in the economy and the huge increase in women joining swapstyle.com " says Chesher
swapstyle.com was created by Emily Chesher , 30 , also known as The Swap Queen , in 2003 while she was a fashion design student .
Living on her meek student budget Chesher could n't afford to buy the fashion items that she adored , plus she was disillusioned by the negative environmental impact created by the fashion industry .
Thus she put her mind to creating swapstyle.com - a free fashion swap website that allows women world - wide to swap clothes 24/7 from the comfort of their own home .
Chesher says , " swapstyle.com is free to use , and was created six years ago .
When I created swapstyle .com there were no other online clothes swap sites - we were the first !
The economy and the environment were n't at the forefront of people 's minds , and I had a lot of people telling me that I was crazy - that the idea would never take off "
Fast forward to 2009 .
With economic and environmental concern , swapstyle.com has had to increase its servers on a monthly basis to keep up with the huge demand from members uploading swap items .
From shoes to bags , cosmetics to designer fashion and vintage clothes , there are tens of thousands of members world - wide swapping and saving thousands of dollars a year through the site .
Not just a clothes swap site , swapstyle.com also offers a strong social networking platform in which members chat in forums , create personal profile pages and make friends .
" It has become a really thriving online community , " says Chesher .
" It was always my dream to have swapstyle .com be a space where money did n't matter anymore .
I found it refreshing to have an area online where we could enjoy fashion without having the guilt of spending attached "
No guessing why one of the sites tag lines is experience guilt free shopping .
Chesher was also disillusioned by the environmental impact that fashion was having on the planet .
" The waste created from the fashion industry is huge .
We live season by season , sometimes only wearing an item once .
It brings a smile to my face knowing that Ive created a easily accessible economically , socially and environmentally sound solution to an age old problem . "
With its tag line ' open your world - wide wardrobe ' , fashion savvy women are taking heed and saving thousands of dollars by getting their fashion for free by swapping .
###
EL PASO , Texas ( JTA ) —
Three strange things happened to Rabbi Stephen Leon the first week he moved here in 1986 to lead Congregation B’nai Zion , the Conservative synagogue in this border city .
“ Rabino , ” said a Catholic man calling from Jaurez , Mexico , about 30 minutes away .
“ I need to talk to you . ”
Every Friday night from the time he was little , the man ’s grandmother took him into a room , lit candles and said some prayers in a private language he did n’t understand .
His grandmother had just died , and he asked his mother if she would continue the tradition .
She told him to go find a rabbi .
Three days later , a Catholic woman from El Paso came to the rabbi after visiting a relative in mourning , where she noticed that all the mirrors were covered .
“ Why are you doing this ? ” she asked her relatives .
They said it was a Jewish custom .
Then the cable guy came , and the rabbi told him , “ Shalom Y’all . ”
The man — a Catholic Hispanic — opened his shirt and showed his Jewish star necklace — he had just found out about his Jewish roots .
“ Three incidents in a week and a half ? ” Leon recalled .
“ There has to be something going on . ”
Twenty - two years later that something is still going on : A steady trickle of Hispanics in the Southwest , from Juarez to Texas to New Mexico , are discovering Jewish roots .
Some are set on their search because of a mysterious tradition practiced by an older relative , such as not eating pork or working on Saturday .
For others the clue is an artifact like a trompito spinning top that resembles a dreidel , or a set of tefillin that a Catholic grandmother on a road trip once insisted on depositing with the rabbi .
But for the majority of people it ’s something more tenuous : a word here ( bubbe , tzedakah ) , a Jewish name there ( Rael , from Israel ) .
Very often it ’s just a feeling about Catholicism , Jesus , their past or what they say is their soul that leads people to wonder if their family was once Jewish .
Crypto -Jews .
Marranos .
Anusim .
Judios .
Conversos .
They are all terms with different nuances referring to Jews and / or their descendants who were forced to convert after Spain and Portugal expelled all non-Catholics , but continued to practice Judaism or maintained some Jewish customs even as they and their children migrated to Latin America , Europe and finally the United States .
Some Crypto - Jews are interested in the genealogical knowledge but are not planning on leaving Catholicism ; others practice a dual Messianic faith with both Judaism and Jesus .
A very few give up their Catholic faith and convert — they prefer the word “ return ” — to Judaism .
“ Who do you count ? ” asked Stanley Hordes , one of the foremost experts on the Crypto - Jews and author of “ To the End of the Earth : A History of the Crypto - Jews of New Mexico ” ( Columbia University Press , 2008 ) .
“ Chances are really good that many people have Jewish ancestors going back 500 years , ” he said , estimating that after half of Spain ’s several hundred thousand Jews left the country , half converted to Catholicism — half of those Jews converted willingly , assimilating and eventually blending into Catholic society .
“ There were certain families that held onto ancestral Jewish faith and continued to practice , ” he said .
“ Today , the overwhelming majority are perfectly content in their Protestantism and Catholicism .
Only a handful of cases people are exploring a relationship with mainstream Judaism . ”
This Shavuot , as Jews around the world celebrate the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai and read the Book of Ruth — the story of the world ’s most famous convert to Judaism — some of these Crypto - Jewish returnees will celebrate their bar and bat mitzvah with Leon at Congregation B’nai Zion , a synagogue with 400 families .
Ten percent of the members are Crypto - Jews , yet “ without my anusim I might not have a minyan , ” Leon said .
He ’s not kidding .
On a hot Saturday morning in May , in the imposing angular white B’nai Zion building set starkly against the mountain range dividing El Paso , about 30 of the 50 people sitting in the circular sanctuary topped by a Jewish star skylight are Crypto - Jews .
( The larger sanctuary is used on the High Holidays to accommodate the 1,500 members . )
One is Blanca Carrasco , 43 , who returned to Judaism last year and is about to celebrate her bat mitzvah on Shavuot , which this year begins on the evening of May 28 .
As the rabbi takes the Torah around the sanctuary to be kissed , the congregation sings “ Etz chayim chai , l’amachazikim bah ” ( “ A tree of life to all those who hold fast to it … ” ) and Carrasco tears up at the last verse : “ Hashiveinu hashem elecha v’nashuva ” — “ Return us to you , God , and we shall return . ”
Carrasco ’s return to Judaism started as a curious Catholic child in Mexico , where she was infatuated with everything in the Bible .
By the time she was 20 she converted to Evangelical Christianity , but the doctrine was still lacking for her and her husband , Cezar , who considered himself more of an atheist .
Then , about 14 years ago , her mother invited her to a Passover seder at a Messianic congregation in El Paso .
“ We felt it was familiar — it felt like home , ” Blanca Carrasco said .
“ Right in that instance , our life changed , ” she added .
“ I needed to know more . ”
Like a number of Crypto - Jews who now attend B’nai Zion , the Carrascos began their religious transformation by praying at the Messianic Center in El Paso , where they learned about Judaism , important rabbis , the Jewish festivals and history , and Crypto - Jews .
She found some family names — Espinoza , Israel , Salinas — and a great - aunt who said her grandmother spoke Ladino .
Eventually Carrasco began to believe only in the Jewish traditions , and three years ago she decided to leave the Messianic congregation after a decade there .
“ How can I explain to what is in my heart ? ” she said .
“ People would tell us , ‘ You do n’t have to do it , ’ but we just love it and want to learn and want to do it . ”
A year ago the couple underwent a “ return ceremony , ” which is technically a conversion , replete with a conversion certificate , since it requires at least a year of study , mikvah immersion and a declaration of faith .
For the Carrascos , their b’nai mitzvah ceremony on Shavuot is just another rite of passage on their journey to Judaism .
“ Now we belong — we are not longing anymore , we are here , ” Blanca Carrasco said .
“ We reached the place we were heading to . ”
Talk to a number of the 50 anusim families that Leon has returned to Judaism — some of whom will be b’nai mitzvah this week — and you ’ll hear a similar story .
Margarita Luna remembered that her grandmother always lit candles on Friday night before saying the Rosary .
But her mother did n’t want to talk about it — perhaps that was because during the Mexican wars in the 1920s they had to hide in a well for a few days .
“ Always in my heart I feel that I love the Jewish traditions , ” she says , fingering her mezuzah necklace .
“ And always I say I am Jewish and I need to go back to my roots . ”
She and her husband , Victor , converted five years ago , and after their b’nai mitzvah on Shavuot , they plan to have a Jewish wedding ceremony and , hopefully one day , move to Israel with their teenage daughter .
Is finding historical proof important to them ?
“ It ’s not a determinant for my actual connection with God , ” Victor said .
“ I think my heart , my feelings , my soul is Jewish .
That is most important thing .
For Leon , who led a New Jersey congregation for 22 years prior to coming to El Paso , this has become his mission .
“ God said to me , ‘ I can not bring back the 6 million who were killed in the Holocaust , but there was another group before who are alive in much larger numbers than Holocaust survivors because it ’s been 500 years , generation after generation of generation , ” he said .
“ Their souls are still alive . …
You have to do something about it . ’ ”
Not everyone agrees with this mission .
Rabbi Yisrael Greenberg of Chabad of El Paso says he receives his share of phone calls from Mexicans who think they have Jewish roots but discourages conversion .
“ I think the Crypto - Jew is a real thing — 500 years ago in the Inquisition hundreds of thousands of Jewish boys and girls disappeared from the Jewish community …
Jews always disappeared from the Jewish community — most of it by force , ” Greenberg said .
But , he added , referring to the strong religious ties of Mexican families and the community , “ We have to be careful — we break families . ”
“ We should put our energy into the Jewish people rather than to try and bring anusim back , ” Greenberg said .
“ If the anusim have a desire to understand Judaism , then let ’s teach them about their ancestors and let them have an understanding , ” he added , implying that the best thing to do would be to leave it at that .
Such an approach would be fine with Elay Romero , a retired pipe fitter , who has been retracing his family ’s lineage through state records and was considering some DNA testing .
He discovered Hordes ’ book about Crypto - Jews and came to Taos , N.M. , to hear the historian speak on the topic at the New Mexico Jewish Historical Society .
“ I ’m just curious , ” Romero said .
“ If I had Jewish blood , it ’s fine .
But we ’ve been practicing Catholics for generations , and I wo n’t change my affiliation with the Church . ”
The rabbi , meanwhile , has big plans .
In addition to welcoming Crypto - Jews , he helped start an anusim / Sephardic learning center and yeshiva in El Paso with Juan Pable Mejia , a graduate of the rabbinical program at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America , and Sonya Loya , the director of Bat - Tzyion Hebrew Learning Center in Ruidoso , N.M .
The goal would be to bring awareness to the Jewish and general public about the Inquisition and Crypto - Jews on par with Holocaust remembrance .
“ The anusim will come back eventually ; there is a yearning .
There is a divine plan out there , ” Leon said .
With Hispanics being the fastest - growing population and the Jews constantly concerned about their diminishing population , Leon says the Jewish community should welcome those Hispanics who want to explore their Jewish ancestry .
“ I think the anusim are the only answer , ” he said .
“ They are returning one way or another . ”
Over the last couple weeks we learned that after Joseph Cassano , head of AIG Financial Products , got a $ 1 million a month consulting contract after being canned for destroying the company .
He was eventually completely , finally fired last fall after AIG exploded and the government had to take it over .
Michael Daly , at
the NY Daily News , has put together the numbers .
And as AIGFP was collapsing into hundreds of billion dollars of losses that the US taxpayer had to pick up , he managed to walk away with a cool $ 315 million .
Now , I knew that Cassano started out at Drexel Burnham Lambert under Michael Milken , which I believe is that major investment house to go under , at least in the last generation prior to the current crisis ( someone tell me , am I forgetting one ? ) .
He apparently got hired away from the rubble of Drexel to start AIGFP .
But here ’s an interesting little nugget I ’d like to hear more about …
Company auditor Joseph St. Denis became concerned about the Financial Products unit , but Cassano barred him from checking .
St. Denis later quoted Cassano as saying , “ I have deliberately excluded you … because I was concerned that you would pollute the process . ”
Kept the auditor from reviewing the books ?
If that ’s even close to true , that ’s a real problem .
Now , let ’s add to that .
Zack Roth dug up an investor suit from January claiming that Cassano had committed fraud by misleading investors and investigators .
And then there were those criminal charges the DOJ brought against Cassano ’s AIGFP for helping PNC Financial Services conceal assets from off its books .
You really do n’t think there ’s anything in what happened at AIGFP that we ’re not going to find out fell seriously afoul of a lot criminal statutes ?
And we ’re still paying out these bonuses ?
I suspect we need to get this conversation out of Treasury and over to DOJ .
My friends are in the midst of finalizing their first home purchase this week , and after going through the home inspection with them , I have a new - found respect for people who really put the work into their home in order to help it sell .
The house they are buying is immaculate , and a lot of it is because the current owners put a ton of effort into making it that way .
They really wanted to sell it !
After giving some thought to what they did to make it so attractive , I came across this article that talks about mistakes that some owners make when trying to sell , and figured I would share it with you in case you were trying to sell your house in this market .
Here are the 10 common mistakes home sellers make :
1. Failing to vet your real estate agent .
2. Setting the price too high .
3. Waiting for a market rebound .
4. Skimping on listing photos .
5 . False advertising .
6. Failing to incentivize buyers .
7. Waiting to fix up the place .
8 . Taking offense at lowball offers .
9 . Failing to make sure the buyer can afford the house .
10 . Being inaccessible .
Read the details of each point here , and congrats to my friends on buying their first home !
Via Sirota , this is just depressing .
I do n't see how green jobs can revitalize the economy if they do n't stay here :
The US firms have offshored 22,000 green technology jobs to India since January 1 , 2009 , Doug Brown , co-author of the influential 2009 Green Outsourcing Report , informed TNIE .
“ We see the ( green job offshoring ) trend increasing as the US and the UK outsourcing buyers are seeking lower cost in labour and energy consumption .
There are few suppliers who match credentials and outcomes of Indian firms , ” he said .
The annual industry study by Brown - Wilson Group , which surveyed 4,000 global firms , was released last week .
The report lists Patni , HCL , WNS , Wipro , Mastech and Tech Mahindra among important Indian green vendors who are benefiting from the offshoring wave .
Among the non-Indian firms , Xerox , Accenture , IBM Global , CSC , Capgemini , Oracle , HP / ED S , Aramark , SITEL and Perot lead the list .
As most of these firms run large delivery centres in India , the boom in their green offshoring business is expected to further create jobs in India .
Noting an interesting irony , the authors of the report say , “ In the US , green stimulus plan is creating low - wage installation and construction jobs . ”
But , in India , which is usually associated with cheap and low - skill work , “ … New green jobs include higher dollar engineers , strategic business management and support technicians charged with designing innovative environmental friendly solutions , ” they add .
Green offshoring is creating demand for sustainability engineers , marketing and business development executives , data center management engineers , utilities and electric engineers and quality specialists in India , Brown informed TNIE .
Soaring energy cost and regulatory pressure have put pressure on firms in the US and Europe to embrace green technologies .
Most of outsourcing buyers seek impeccable green credentials in their suppliers before handing over work , the report says .
Multiple eyewitnesses say man was attacked after media initially reported death was accidental
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , April 6 , 2009
The death of a newspaper seller during the G20 protests last week which was initially reported by the media to have been caused by a heart attack was actually a result of an attack by riot cops , according to eyewitnesses .
Ian Tomlinson , 47 , was not even taking part in the G20 protests , he was walking home from his job as a newsagent near the Bank of England when he collapsed and suffered a heart attack .
News reports immediately after the incident stated that Tomlinson looked dazed and confused before collapsing and being treated by medics .
The explanation that the man ’s death was accidental was strongly pushed by the media in the hours after the incident , and a police post mortem examination attributed his death to natural causes .
However , eyewitnesses have come forward to state that Tomlinson was attacked by riot police before his collapse .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Anna Branthwaite , an experienced press photographer , told the IPCC : “ I can remember seeing Ian Tomlinson .
He was rushed from behind by a riot officer with a helmet and shield two or three minutes before he collapsed . ”
Amiri Howe stated that Tomlinson was struck ‘ near the head ’ with a police baton .
Another protester said she saw Mr Tomlinson being pushed aggressively from behind by officers .
Police have promised to make further inquiries as a result of the new testimony , but since British cops can get away with shooting innocent people in the head multiple times and not face charges , we are skeptical that anyone will be brought to justice for the murder of Tomlinson .
Tomlinson ’s murder echoes the death of Carlo Giuliani , who was murdered by riot police at the G8 summit in 2001 in Italy .
Giuliani was shot twice and ran over twice by police .
The officer who shot Giuliani was later charged with murder but escaped punishment after a judge ruled that the shots fired by officer Mario Placanica “ ricocheted off plaster ” .
However , forensic doctor professor Marco Salvi claimed the shots were a direct hit and that police ran over Giuliani ’s body when he was still alive .
Mario Placanica later claimed that he was a patsy for a wider cover - up , and soon after was involved in a “ suspicious ” car accident , days after allegedly observing someone tampering with his car .

IT WASN'T MUSLIMS
With a peer - reviewed scientific journal having published further evidence showing that World Trade Center Buildings 1 , 2 and 7 were brought down in a series of controlled demolitions ( but see here for an important September 11 , 2012 update on what the Harrit study got wrong and what it got right ) , here are a few more facts to consider .
It was n't Muslims in an Afghan cave who had access to sophisticated thermitic material ; it was the US military and government scientists such as those connected with NIST .
It was n't Muslims who ran a construction company that was awarded a $ 124 million contract for construction of the Naval Sea Systems Command ( NAVSEA ) headquarters in Washington , DC , which oversees the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center ( NSWC - IH ) , which was described during the 1990s as the " National Center for Energetics " , the military 's term for " explosives work " , and as of 1999 - 2000 the " only reliable source of aluminum nanopowders in the United States " ; it was Tom Leppert who was CEO of Turner Construction as of 9/11/01 , and who even writes parts of Presidential speeches .
It was n't Muslims who ran a construction company that had supervised the 2000 demolition of the Seattle Kingdome , participated in the post 9/11 collection and disposal of the steel wreckage of the WTC towers , and carried out extensive renovations throughout the World Trade Center complex right up to the morning of 9/11 including fireproofing upgrades on the floors that were struck by planes and subsequently " failed " , when the steel had already been certified to ASTM E119 by Universal Laboratories , and , in tests sponsored by NIST on corresponding floor assemblies subjected to greater heat exposure and protected with less fireproofing than was the case at the WTC , the test specimens " were able to sustain the maximum design load " without collapsing for as long as the tests were run ( 2 to 3 1/2 hours ) ; it was Tom Leppert who was CEO of Turner Construction as of 9/11/01 and received a Torch of Conscience award from the American Jewish Congress .
It was n't Muslims who trained their cameras on the World Trade Center Towers prior to the first aircraft impact , who danced and celebrated with high fives prior to the second impact as most onlookers still believed it had been a terrible accident rather than terrorism , and who were caught with foreign passports , $ 4,700 in cash hidden in a sock , maps highlighting certain places in the city , and a van that tested positive for traces of explosives ; it was Israelis Sivan Kurzberg , Paul Kurzberg , Yaron Shmuel , Oded Ellner , and Omer Marmari , several of whom have been confirmed as Mossad agents , as part of their job in " documenting the event " .
It was n't Muslims who were caught on 9/11/01 operating in teams with vans full of explosives , including one team who attempted to blow up the George Washington Bridge with a truck packed with tons of explosives , and another who blew up a van between 6th and 7th on King Street with a mural painted of a remote controlled airplane diving into New York and blowing up ; it was Israelis , which is why the authorities did their best to ignore and bury these reports which included a suspected van bomb driven into the WTC basement and exploded to weaken the structure .
It was n't Muslims who were caught shortly after midnight on May 7 , 2002 very close to the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station , Oak Harbor , Wash . , ( where the Navy conducts explosive ordnance training for bomb disposal mobile units to the consternation of local marine life ) with a rental truck that tested positive for TNT and RDX plastic explosives ; it was Israelis whose cover story was of " delivering furniture " but regarded by authorities as dubious because of the early morning hour , and the authorities ' subsequent claim that the dog's reaction and initial tests for explosives were wrong is so full of holes that it merely demonstrates the power of the Israeli lobby .
It was n't Muslims who were in New York on 9/11 and in London on the morning of the 7/7 attacks ; it was Rudy Giuliani .
It was n't Muslims who received advance warning of the London 7/7 attacks ; it was Benjamin Netanyahu and the Mossad .
It was n't Muslims who provided two hours ' advance warning of an attack on the World Trade Center via an instant messaging company based in Herzliya ; it was Israelis .
It was n't a Muslim who fled the US on September 14 , 2001 ; it was Dominick Suter of " Urban Moving Systems " who fled to Israel .
It was n't over a hundred Muslims who , from around January 2000 to September 2001 , posed as " art students " and attempted to penetrate US Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) offices and other federal buildings including 36 sensitive Department of Defense ( DoD ) sites , were caught with diagrams of the interior of federal buildings and photographs of federal agents and often evaded security by entering through back doors or parking garages , and even visited the homes of senior federal officials but not those of their neighbors ; it was Israelis , none of whom were " art students " but many of whom had backgrounds in Israeli military intelligence .
Not surprisingly , the Press went for a limited hangout by trying to pretend the Israelis were merely shadowing " Arab hijackers " and either failed to pass on information , or " it was not treated seriously " , the old canard about " intelligence failure " .
The operations of the Israeli fake " art students " is well documented , including plenty of names and even descriptions .
An unusually large number of these Israelis were located in Irving , Dallas , TX ( p.23 , previous link ) , which is about ten miles west of Tom Leppert 's Alva Court home , which is barely more than a mile north of the Dallas home that George W. Bush moved into after leaving office .
It is n't Muslim countries that have a massive spy ring in the USA capable of tapping into much of the telecoms network and using information obtained to blackmail Americans ; it is Israel .
It was n't Muslims who received advance warning on Monday September 10 , 2001 , against flying the next day ; it was San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown , and a group of top Pentagon officials .
It was n't Muslims who acquired a 99 - year lease on the World Trade Center 's Twin Towers , Buildings Four and Five and approximately 400,000 square feet of retail space , and insured for billions of dollars against terror attacks a mere six weeks before terror attacks did in fact occur , and then employed ( to press for the insurance claim ) a ' structural engineer ' who misleadingly asserts that steel loses half its strength at " 400 degrees " ; it was - in a deal negotiated by Lewis Eisenberg of the Port Authority - Benjamin Netanyahu's ( and Ariel Sharon 's and Ehud Barak 's ) friend Larry Silverstein and his partner Australian billionaire and " Holocaust survivor " Frank Lowy who fought " in the Jewish underground " , was embroiled in a high - level bank corruption scandal with Israeli Premier Ehud Olmert and found to be making payments to Lord ( Michael Abraham )
Levy who was arrested several times in relation to a " cash for honors " scandal , Levy being a " tennis partner " and advisor of Tony Blair .
It is n't Muslims who have a reputation for perpetrating arson scams in order to claim off insurance companies as evidenced by any colloquial use of the term " Muslim lightning " ; it is Jews as evidenced by the recognized term " Jewish lightning " .
It was n't Muslims who normally breakfasted at the Windows on the World restaurant on the 106th and 107th floors of the North Tower , but by some bizarre coincidence did not happen to be there on 9/11 and were thus spared the fate of occupants on that tragic day ( none of whom escaped from the floors above the aircraft impact at 8:46 AM ) ; it was Larry Silverstein who was spared due to having a " dermatologist 's appointment " , an event which also spared his two children who worked at Silverstein Properties .
It was n't a Muslim who went on TV within hours of the attacks to tell everyone that " It ... certainly has the fingerprints of somebody like bin Laden " and the World Trade Center had collapsed because of " the velocity of the plane " and " intense heat probably weakened the structure as well " , and who reportedly on that very day advised the White House to take Cipro , an effective antibiotic against anthrax , seven days before the commencement of an anthrax letters terror campaign targeted at Democratic U.S. Senators and news media offices , who on 9/11/01 was a managing director of the crisis and consequence management group at Kroll Associates , who was an advisor to the Council of Foreign Relations ( CFR ) regarding " epidemiological surveillance " and national security advisor at the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) , and who gave his ' friend ' John O'Neill a job as Head Of Security at the World Trade Center ; it was Jerome Hauer .
It was n't Muslims who carried out a terror campaign mailing letters containing anthrax spores that had their electrostatic charge altered so that they would disperse more readily , anthrax that was traced to the weapons grade Ames strain originating at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) at Fort Detrick , neither was it the FBI 's final " suspect " Roman Catholic Bruce Ivins , who , unlike the true perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks , had no motive to target news media and Opposition Senators and thereby scare them into uncritical acceptance of the " Arab hijackers " conspiracy theory .
Ivins died of an overdose and alleged " suicide " in July 2008 after the FBI gave up attempting to pin the blame on Steven Hatfill because there was not a scintilla of evidence against him ; a logical suspect is Philip M. Zack who left Fort Detrick under a cloud in December 1991 after having headed a clique calling itself the " Camel Club " that was racially harassing Egyptian - born Dr. Ayaad Assaad .
Zack was found by a 1992 inquiry to have been caught on surveillance camera being let into a Fort Detrick lab building at 8:40 p.m. on Jan. 23 , 1992 apparently by Dr. Marian Rippy , a lab pathologist and close friend of Zack .
The inquiry also found someone had been in a lab late at night secretly conducting unauthorised research , evidently on anthrax believed to include the Ames strain .
Nearly ten years on , during the week between 9/11 and the commencement of the anthrax campaign , the FBI received an anonymous letter attempting to frame Dr. Assaad as a " bioterrorist " .
The anthrax letters seemed contrived so as to appear to have been written by a Muslim , and a New York Times writer told of a " Mr. Z. " who failed some FBI polygraph tests and was once caught with a girlfriend at Fort Detrick " surrounded only by blushing germs " .
It was n't a Muslim who was claimed to have been killed on the alleged American Airlines " Flight 77 " , to have lived at Silver Spring , Maryland ( as did a certain Rabbi Dr. Dov Zakheim ) , and to have worked on top - secret " deep - black " projects at the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center ( NSWC - IH ) , a " renowned leader in energetics " which operates an " Energetics Manufacturing Technology Center " , carries out " advanced research in energetic systems " and " absorbed the function of the closed Naval Ordnance Laboratory , formerly in White Oak , MD " which is a couple miles from Silver Spring ; it was William E. Caswell .
It was n't Muslims who were claimed to have been killed on the alleged " Flight 77 " and who worked for government or defense , particularly the Navy ; it was John Yamnicky who , strangely , for the first time did not tell his daughter that he was going on travel , and who , like William Caswell , had worked for the Navy on top - secret " black " projects .
Others included Charles Burlingame , a former Navy fighter pilot who used to work in the section of the Pentagon that was hit and who had formulated a response for the eventuality of an airliner being flown into the Pentagon and whose daughter Wendy subsequently died in a " suspicious fire " at a 50 - story high - rise in New Jersey in December 2006 , Wilson " Bud " Flagg , a retired American Airlines pilot and Navy Admiral , Stanley Hall , an expert in anti-radar technology and a director of program management at Raytheon , Bryan Jack , a senior executive and top budget analyst who worked at the Pentagon , Chandler Keller , a Boeing propulsion engineer , Dong Lee , a Boeing engineer who worked for their Integrated Defense Systems and who had worked for the National Security Agency ( NSA ) for 14 years , Barbara Olson , CNN commentator and wife of the US Solicitor General who claimed to have received cell phone calls from " Flight 77 " , Ruben Ornedo , a Boeing propulsion / satellite communications engineer , Robert Penniger , an electrical engineer with BAE Systems , and another dozen alleged " Flight 77 passengers " who were linked to defense and government who , we are told , all just happened to be on this unusually low occupancy flight .
These people , well loved and respected as honest , decent heroes , are the very sort of characters whose work could have been horrifically exploited without their knowledge , and whom the 9/11 perpetrators would need to eliminate to prevent them speaking out after the attacks .
It was n't Muslims who profited by speculating on airline and insurance stocks in advance of 9/11 ; it was Israelis .
It was n't Muslims who concocted a hoax about pork - swilling , money - eschewing , celibate , truthful , courageous , pro-animal rights , " devout Jews " who were " suicide hijackers / pilots " , almost half of whom later turned up alive and well ; it was Jews who concocted a hoax about drinking , gambling , strip joint - frequenting , womanizing , " devout Muslims " who were " suicide hijackers / pilots " , almost half of whom later turned up alive and well .
It was n't a Muslim who was a former unit team leader in an elite special forces unit and whose father was a senior aide , secretary and pallbearer to a man who in 1937 was commander of the Irgun Tzvai Leumi , a Jewish terrorist organization responsible for atrocities such as the King David Hotel bombing ; it was Benjamin Netanyahu .
It was n't a Muslim who was the mentor of Benjamin Netanyahu 's father Benzion and who wrote a column in the Revisionist Zionist magazine Doar Hayom under the title " From the Notebook of a Fascist " , praising Mussolini and referring to one - time commander of the Irgun Ze'ev ( Vladimir ) Jabotinsky as " our Duce " ; it was Abba Ahimeir the founder of Revisionist Maximalism , a Jewish fascist ideology .
It was n't Muslim terrorists who plotted to assassinate British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin ; it was Jewish terrorists .
It was n't Muslims who orchestrated , and whose operatives were caught red - handed in , a failed false - flag terrorist campaign in Egypt ; it was Israel .
It was n't Muslims who attacked the USS Liberty killing 34 Americans , and had the US President saying " I do n't give a damn if every man drowns and the ship sinks .
I do n't want to embarrass our allies " ; it was Israel .
It was n't Muslims who were evacuated " apparently due to a specific security threat " in advance of the Amman , Jordan terror attacks on November 9 , 2005 ( 9/11 by Israeli and European calendars ) , which included a blast at the Radisson hotel that was known to have emanated from a bomb hidden in a false ceiling , even though the official story held that it was really the work of " suicide bombers " and therefore by some bizarre coincidence the ceiling bomb must have been placed there previously by someone else ; it was Israelis who were evacuated in advance of these attacks in which there were no Jewish casualties , most of the dead were Jordanian Sunni Muslims , two Israeli casualties were both Arabs , and five Palestinians died including Major - General Bashir Nafeh , the head of military intelligence in the West Bank .
It was n't Muslims who were caught and arrested inside the Mexican Congress chamber on October 10 , 2001 in possession of guns , grenades , dynamite , detonators and wiring while posing as " press photographers " ; it was Mossad agent Salvador Guersson Smecke and Israeli illegal immigrant Saur Ben Zvi at the very time that Zionists would obtain maximum benefit from a false - flag terror attack that would mobilize support for the war on " Muslim terrorists " in Afghanistan that had been launched only three days previously .
It was n't Muslims who were convicted and jailed for six months in 2004 for fraudulently attempting to obtain a New Zealand passport in the name of a tetraplegic man ; it was Mossad agents Uriel Kelman and Eli Cara who were seeking to create a false identity for Zev Barkan .
It was n't Muslims who claimed to know the identity of " suicide hijackers " Abdulaziz al - Omari and Saeed al - Ghamdi when , since individuals with the exact same names and other personal details such as birth date , place and occupation subsequently turned up alive and well , the population of Saudi Arabia in 1975 was 7,180,000 and even given a high annual birth rate of 30 per 1,000 and ignoring infant mortality the daily birth rate was only 590 and so it is highly improbable that individuals would share the exact same name , birth date , place and occupation , al - Omari 's passport had been stolen in 1995 when his apartment was burgled in Denver , Colorado ( a state where Mossad agents have been active ) , and only utter cretins would steal the identities of people with a different appearance but having their exact same name , place , date of birth and occupation , ergo those hypothetical " suicide hijackers " would have had entirely different names ; it was the FBI who published a list claiming that the 9/11 perpetrators included Abdulaziz al - Omari and Saeed al - Ghamdi in addition to several others who had turned up alive and well , and even though the FBI admitted that some hijackers may have used stolen identities and that there is " no legal proof to prove the identities of the suicidal hijackers , " they denied having misidentified the alleged " suicide hijackers " and refused to change the names , photographs or backgrounds on their list - albeit obfuscating and trying to cover themselves by including multiple spellings and aliases .
It was n't Muslims who were behind a failed coup in Turkey ; it was crypto -Jew and Mossad agent pseudo - Rabbi Tuncay Guney , who fled to Canada in 2004 , and who in 2001 lived in New Jersey towns that were centers of activity for Mossad Urban Moving Systems operatives .
It was n't Muslims who set up an " al Qaeda cell " in Palestine ; it was the Israeli Mossad .
It was n't Muslims who had established a reputation for having the capability to stage false - flag terror attacks , i.e. , to target U.S. forces and make it look like the act of a third party , prior to 9/11 ; it was the Mossad .
It was n't a Muslim who infiltrated the Pentagon and betrayed his country of birth by selling classified documents to another country that were then traded to the USSR ; it was convicted spy Jonathan Pollard whose treachery resulted in stolen nuclear secrets being passed on to the USSR with Israel as the paying intermediary .
It was n't Muslims who were running an exercise commencing at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of 9/11 involving a plane crashing into a tower ; it was officials at the National Reconnaissance Office , Chantilly , VA .
It was n't a Muslim who , in response to the question " Do the orders still stand ? " regarding the response - or more precisely , the lack of response - to an aircraft that was rapidly homing in on the Pentagon and ten miles out after both of the Twin Towers had already been hit by planes more than half an hour previously , whipped his neck around and replied " Of course the orders still stand .
Have you heard anything to the contrary ? " ; it was Dick Cheney .
It was n't a Muslim who was CEO of a company that made remote control " Flight Termination Systems " that could electronically hijack in - flight aircraft and steer them into targets by means of a " Command Transmitter System " ; it was Rabbi Dov Zakheim .
It was n't a Muslim who , well aware that a percentage of trillions of dollars is still hundreds of billions of dollars , took a position as Comptroller of the Pentagon in May 2001 when it was already public knowledge that the Pentagon 's accounting systems were in complete disarray with $ 6.9 trillion of " adjustments " having been required in an attempt to make the figures add up , and with no receipts for $ 2.3 trillion of these hard to track changes on non-integrated computer systems and antiquated paperwork that could be readily taken out by a missile or plane strike on the relevant auditing section at the Pentagon , and who subsequently delivered a commemorative sermon on the Pentagon lawn to hundreds of co-religionists from 40 countries six months after such a terror strike did in fact occur killing at least 34 budget analysts / accountants / financial experts ; it was Rabbi Dov Zakheim .
It was n't a Muslim who was at a breakfast meeting with Donald Rumsfeld when the first plane hit the WTC , and was at the Army Navy Country Club " when the plane that hit the Pentagon came right over the top of the Army Navy Club and bounced down the hill and hit the side of the Pentagon " ; it was Thomas E . White , who is linked to the Enron fraud , who participated in JINSA trips to Israel , e.g. with his wife Susan in 1997 , and who was sworn in as Secretary of the Army on May 31 , 2001 which is 27 days after George W Bush appointed Rabbi Dov Zakheim as Undersecretary of Defense and Comptroller of the Pentagon , both White and Zakheim having been placed by Bush at the Pentagon where more than $ 2 trillion of transactions had no receipts and Pentagon finances were vulnerable to a " terror attack " that would target the appropriate auditing section .
It was n't Muslims who in 2000 co-authored a document which called for a " new Pearl Harbor " ; it was Roger Barnett , Alvin Bernstein , Stephen Cambone , Eliot Cohen , Devon Gaffney Cross , Thomas Donnelly , David Epstein , David Fautua , Dan Goure , Donald Kagan , Fred Kagan , Robert Kagan , Robert Killebrew , William Kristol , Mark Lagon , James Lasswell , I. Lewis Libby , Robert Martinage , Phil Meilinger , Mackubin Owens , Steve Rosen , Gary Schmitt , Abram Shulsky , Michael Vickers , Barry Watts , Paul Wolfowitz , and Rabbi Dov Zakheim .
It was n't Muslims who had a motive for employing a " Flight Termination System " to take control of EgyptAir Flight 990 - a Boeing 767 - on October 31 , 1999 ( after a bizarre coincidence in which " air crash victims grief counselor " Ed McLaughlin of the Family Enterprise Institute was the only person to board the ill - fated plane in Los Angeles and get off at New York ) , send it plunging into the Atlantic 60 miles south of Nantucket killing all 217 on board , none of whom were Israelis but 33 of the casualties were Egyptian army officers including two Air Force brigadier generals and two army major generals , and promote the concept of " Muslim suicide pilots " to a gullible public ; it was Jews who would have needed to conduct a trial run of electronically hijacking in - flight Boeing aircraft for their imminent false - flag terror operation that was to be blamed on " Muslim suicide pilots / hijackers " , with the EgyptAir Flight 990 " inquiry " being overseen by Zionist Jew Bernard Loeb who had Jewish translators transcribe the cockpit recordings , and the FBI conducting a character assassination to smear the alleged " suicidal " co-pilot .
It was n't Muslims who wrote in 1998 of a " transforming event " rather like " Pearl Harbor " ; it was John Deutsch , Ashton Carter and Philip Zelikow .
It was n't a Muslim who served as Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission , whose expertise and job entailed the creation and maintenance of public myths or " presumptions " , and who confirmed that the Iraq war had been for Israel 's benefit ; it was Philip Zelikow .
It was n't Muslims who published a paper in 1996 entitled A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , which mentioned " removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq " and introduced the concept of pre-emptive strikes for which some phony pretext such as halting drug money or striking counterfeiting infrastructure or " weapons of mass destruction " could be devised that Americans would sympathise with ; it was The Institute for Advanced Strategic & Political Studies ( IASPS ) of Jerusalem and Washington which , for new Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu , discussed how such a policy would benefit Israel .
It was n't a Muslim who , in a 1995 book , predicted that " if the West does n’t wake up to the suicidal nature of militant Islam , the next thing you will see is militant Islam is bringing down the World Trade Center " ; it was Benjamin Netanyahu .
It was n't Muslim security officials who , in 1991 , inspected the garage of a Muslim shipping company in the World Trade Center and concluded that the WTC garage was vulnerable to a car bomb , two years before the WTC garage was in fact hit by a car bomb and the FBI were aware of the plot yet let it go ahead killing six people and injuring more than a thousand , and ten years before the WTC was demolished one week after the very same shipping company had moved out of the WTC ; it was Israeli security officials and an Israeli shipping company .
It was n't Muslims who paid Ali al - Jarrah more than $ 300,000 for services rendered , i.e. , posing as a " supporter " of the Palestinian cause while betraying his country to an enemy state , and who was a cousin of Ziad al - Jarrah who was alleged to be one of nineteen 9/11 " suicide hijackers " ; it was Israel that paid this Mossad asset .
It was n't Muslims who 1 ) broadcast the pilot episode on March 4 , 2001 of The Lone Gunmen TV series , an episode about a plot by a secret cabal within the US government to electronically hijack by remote control a Boeing heading for Boston and divert it to crash into the World Trade Center 2 ) said in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks that no one had ever conceived of aircraft being used by terrorists as missiles to target buildings ; it was 1 ) Fox TV , owned by Rupert Murdoch , a long - time friend of Benjamin Netanyahu 2 ) National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice / acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers / President George W. Bush / Vice President Dick Cheney / White House spokesman Ari Fleischer .
It was n't a Muslim who said he'd seen the ( first ) plane hit the ( North ) Tower and reckoned it must have been " one terrible pilot " and " a horrible accident " before going into a classroom and subsequently being informed of the second impact when the first impact was not broadcast live on TV ; it was George W. Bush .
It was n't Muslims who , on Tuesday , October 2 through Friday , October 5 , 2001 : 1 ) met with , and 2 ) received $ 3 million in gifts for " funds for victims " from Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah Al - Thani , the Emir of Qatar who started the Al Jazeera channel in 1996 with a $ 150 million grant , the channel which broadcasts audios and videos purporting to be of " Osama bin Laden " aka Emmanuel Goldstein ; it was : 1 ) George W.

It was n't Muslims who fabricated a fairy story about Pfc. Jessica Lynch being ambushed , stabbed , shot , bravely continuing to shoot Iraqis , being abused , raped , and held captive in a hospital by Iraqi guards , and later rescued by elite US forces ; it was " unnamed US officials " who lied , since in fact there was no " rescue " , Lynch 's gun had jammed with sand , she was being cared for by the Iraqis after being injured in a car crash , she had no " bullet holes " or " knife wounds " , the hospital was not " under guard " , and doctors had even tried to return Lynch to US forces themselves .
It was n't Muslims who conspired to invade a defenseless nation by lying about " weapons of mass destruction " ( " WMDs " ) when they had already made up their minds to invade for " regime change " , resulting in excess Iraqi deaths estimated at 655,000 to one million , the displacement of more than four million , the sacrifice of thousands of troops and throwing away of $ 3 trillion to no avail save for enriching a few war criminals and profiteers to the tune of billions of dollars in this proxy war for Israel ; it was George W. Bush and Tony Blair .
It was n't a Muslim who ordered aides to plan for striking Iraq barely five hours after the Pentagon was attacked on 9/11 ; it was Donald Rumsfeld .
It was n't Muslims who ordered 250 police to smash their way into a house in Forest Gate , London , in the middle of the night and arrest two brothers after shooting one of them in the shoulder , on the basis of intelligence said to be from a " reliable " , single source regarding a conspiracy involving a " cyanide bomb " , with the brothers being released without charge several days later before it was subsequently revealed that the source was a man with an IQ of 69 who was already in jail on a terror conviction ; it was Jewish supremacist lackeys MI5 , Tony Blair and John Reid .
It is n't Muslim countries that have hundreds of nuclear warheads and submarines equipped with cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads with a 900 - mile range ; it is Israel .
It is n't Muslims that have a powerful political lobby capable of extorting vast sums ; it is Israel .
It was n't a Muslim who boasted " We Muslims control America , and the Americans know it " ; it was Ariel Sharon who boasted " We , the Jewish people , control America , and the Americans know it " .
It is n't Muslims who fake phony " hate crimes " against themselves , such as vandalising their own cars or graves , or poisoning their dogs and defacing their houses with swastikas , or cutting their clothes and drawing swastikas on their stomachs ; it is Jews .
It was n't Muslims who took control of The New York Times in 1896 , or who indeed own and control much of the mainstream media today ; it was and is Jews .
It is n't a Muslim country that crushes peace protesters to death with bulldozers or shoots them , or shells a picnicking family on a beach ( and then refuses to own up ) when it wants to launch a war within the next three weeks , or warns civilians to flee after blowing up bridges so it can target them like sitting ducks , or shoots at Red Cross ambulances or UN observers after promising they would be safe , or bombs a power station so that more than ten thousand tonnes of crude oil leaks into the Mediterranean as a " collective punishment " ; it is Israel .
It is n't Muslims who routinely employ weapons such as phosphorus shells to inflict grave and horrific injuries on civilians , and who deliberately fire more than a million cluster bomblets of which 40 % fail to detonate on impact and 90 % are employed in the final three days before a ceasefire so they can " get them all in while the going is good " ; it is Israel .
It is n't a Muslim nation that holds the world record for defying UN resolutions ; it is Israel .
It was n't Muslims who ganged up on a handicapped Jew for hiking on his own land , beat him with clubs , dragged him along the ground , tied him to a power pole and continued to beat and kick him as Muslim soldiers did nothing to stop it and police merely advised the thugs to pour water on the victim's head to wash away the blood before journalists and photographers arrived ; it was a gang of four cowardly , bigoted Jewish settlers who beat up a handicapped Palestinian with impunity , basking in the knowledge that Jewish soldiers and police would not act impartially , and even returning a week later to torment the neighbors , ransacking their home and destroying their few possessions .
It was n't Muslim soldiers who beat up and killed a Jew with clubs and rifle butts and kicks to the head and then , after an ' investigation ' , concluded that the soldiers had " acted properly " ; it was the Israeli " Defense " Forces who smashed three holes in a Palestinian teenager 's skull killing him as he merely waited at a bus stop , continuing to beat him as he lay unconscious , then made up a story about him " pulling a knife " and suggested that he was " mentally unstable " in a case that is sadly all too typical of violence perpetrated by racist , bigoted right - wing extremist Jewish supremacists upon those whom they perceive as " animals in human form " .
It was n't Muslims who created a global organization named the " Anti Defamation League " in order to defend Muslim criminals by playing the race card and accusing their pursuers of being " racists " and " anti-Semites " who were guilty of " hate crimes " ; it was Jews who set up the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in response to the lynching of Leo Frank , president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith Jewish secret society who had been convicted of murdering 13 - year - old Mary Phagan who worked at Frank 's pencil factory , with the lynching of Frank being in response to the commuting of his death sentence to life imprisonment after organized Jewry had tried to cast doubt on Frank 's conviction by shifting the blame to a black man even though ritual murder is a known Jewish tradition , the ADL being used thereafter to denounce anti-criminals as " anti-Semites " whenever the criminals happened to be Jews .
It is n't Muslims who , for political and financial gain , demolished the World Trade Center with thermite or a similar accelerant and crashed remote - controlled planes into it in order to set up a hoax about " Jewish kamikaze pilots " and then attempt to throw researchers off the scent by pretending to " investigate " the demolitions whilst ' accidentally ' plumping for the wrong hypothesis ( e.g. H - bombs rather than thermite ) , and then stubbornly refuse to change to a hypothesis that is in accordance with the evidence ; it is Jews who set up a hoax about " Muslim kamikaze pilots " and have their deliberately misleading ' work ' about the demolitions hosted at sites that are owned and edited by Jews .
It was n't Muslims who practised pseudo - science by refusing to look for Iron Blue at Auschwitz or explosives at the World Trade Center , in order that their ' investigation ' would come up with the required financially and politically motivated result ; it was Jan Markiewicz , Wojciech Gubala , and Jerzy Labedz of the Jan Sehn Institute at Krakow ( Auschwitz fraud ) , and " scientists " and " engineers " at NIST ( WTC fraud ) .
It was n't Muslims who took over the " investigation " of the World Trade Center collapses when FEMA were making a hash of the cover up , mixed up Figures 11 - 51 and 11 - 52 in NCSTAR1 - 9Vol2 on their WTC7 report which was published two days after the mysterious death of eyewitness Barry Jennings whose testimony of explosions in WTC7 before either Tower had collapsed - note he specifically says ( 4:43 ) " I was trapped in there when both buildings came down " - blew their politically motivated assumptions and conclusions apart , failed to spot their mistake in their accompanying description , assumed unrealistically high gas temperatures in order to derive their required unrealistically high steel temperatures , published a preposterous hypothesis of a " thermal - expansion " - based collapse with the logical conclusion that the 180 kip shear capacity of four bolts in a seated connection would be exceeded if the steel heated up from 20 C to 32 C making the force to completely resist the thermal expansion 191 kip , irrespective of the fact that no steel - framed high - rises had ever collapsed due to " fires " or " impacts " apart from the three that allegedly did so on 9/11 , claimed inward bowing of the WTC1 perimeter columns between floors 94 to 100 peaking at 55 inches at column 316 on the 96th floor which could not be reconciled with the fact that the columns ' moment of inertia or second moment of area was at least 342 ins ^4 along the minor axis and a maximum deflection of 55 inches given fixed - fixed boundary conditions and a distributed load would have required the failure within 102 minutes of at least ten consecutive floors , many of which did not have any fireproofing ' dislodged ' by a plane and did not even experience substantial fires ; it was NIST , whose top scientists and engineers have extensive knowledge of nano - thermites , but said they had found " no evidence " of explosives at the WTC and later admitted that they had not bothered to look for any .
The 9/11 perpetrators had to ensure those in charge of the " investigation " were aware of that which they must not find .
It was n't a Muslim who announced on Sunday September 16 , 2001 that a " hijacker 's passport " ( allegedly that of Satam al Suqami ) had been found " several blocks from the ruins of the World Trade Center " , with other reports asserting that the passport was found " in the vicinity of Vesey Street " ; it was former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik who was indicted November 2007 on multiple counts including lying , fraud and conspiracy , which is consistent with the fact that the laws of aerodynamics dictate that the passport should have been found in the vicinity of Liberty Street , the scriptwriter forgot that Suqami was supposed to be on Flight AA11 approaching from the north , and , of several attempts made by the authorities to guess where the passport should have been found , not one of them was correct !
It was n't Muslims who had JFK killed ; it was Jews .
It was n't Muslims who stole elections by exploiting electronic voting machines that biased the results such that the odds for several swing states to swing as much as they did from the exit polls was 250 million to one against ; it was George W. Bush .
It is n't Muslims who exhibit traits of supremacist megalomaniacs by referring to their enemies as " grasshoppers " , " beasts " , " crocodiles " and " cockroaches " ; it is Jews .
It was n't a Muslim who set up a Ponzi scheme that netted $ 50 billion ; it was a Jew .
It was n't Muslims who made a record about doing " The Wall Street Shuffle " and whose other songs included scatological references ; it was Jews .
It is n't Muslims who rule the world by proxy and get others to fight and die for them in wars ; it is Jews , whose modus operandi is to select rich host populations that will let them in , pose as their " ally " whilst draining them of hard - earned wealth , employ deception to trick the hosts into fighting poorer nations , and reap the spoils of war such as Afghan opium trafficking , missing Pentagon funds , looting of oil - for - food funds , etc , along with other opportunistic scams such as the $ 550 billion electronic run on the banks .
Note : some reports incorrectly state Thursday September " 15 " , 2008 for the latter ; it should of course be September 11 , the Thursday prior to September 15 .
It is n't Muslims who have been expelled from countries on numerous occasions , it is Jews who keep getting kicked out as soon as the host gets wise to the fact that Jews ' only loyalty is to their own tribe , rather than the host nation to whom Jews pose as an " ally " .
It was n't Muslims who started a World War in 1914 in the hope that they could successfully launch a hoax about " six million " of their number being killed in order to obtain their own country and net a substantial fraction of global wealth in " reparations " , failed , but also exploited the opportunity to annex and loot Russia and indulge in horrific blood - letting and oppression as a means of settling old scores with the Rus who had chased them westwards from former Khazaria ; it was Khazar ( fake ) ' Jews ' .
It was n't Muslims who blew up Francois Duprat 's car killing him and maiming his wife , beat up Dr. Robert Faurisson at least ten times in which his jaw was broken / teeth knocked out / nearly killed several times / hospitalized for weeks and was persecuted in legal battles and had his home raided by police , tried to kill Ernst Zundel on at least three occasions in arson and pipe bomb attacks and had him and Germar Rudolf deported to Germany and jailed for years , beat Jurgen Rieger unconscious and blew up his car , beat up David Cole and threatened to kill him and his family , persecuted and beat Joseph Burg , attacked Frank Walus seven times and nearly killed him in an acid attack , forced Ivan Lagace to resign from his job as a crematory expert after endless threats from thugs claiming to be from the Jewish Defense League , perpetrated numerous terrorist attacks in France including sulfuric acid sprayed into faces / attacks with iron bars / baseball bats / gas sprayed / excrement strewn around , had historian David Irving spend 400 days in jail before being released on Appeal from a three year sentence which was for two speeches and a newspaper interview he gave 16 years earlier , had Dr. Frederick Toben jailed in Germany for ten months for using his Australian website to express his views , and who had dozens more jailed , fined , and financially ruined by character assassination and legal battles ; it was Jews attempting to prop up their idiosyncratic brand of " truth " which profited them handsomely for decades .
It was n't Muslims who fabricated a hoax about " six million " of their people being " murdered " involving an evidence - free conspiracy theory about a plot to exterminate them in " gas chambers " which netted them - by way of a huge , illegitimate land grab - their own sovereign state , colossal profits in " reparations " , hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign " aid " and " loan guarantees " and waiving / subsidizing of interest payments , etc , and now serves as their " sword and shield " to practice apartheid and kill and oppress their enemies with impunity ; it was Jews .
It was n't Muslims who were caught red - handed forging fake " smoke " onto wartime photographs of Auschwitz ; it was the Simon Wiesenthal Center , whose suitability as guardians of truth is comparable to a choice of Count Dracula as a maintainer of blood banks .
It is n't Muslim mathematics that holds that the sum of a set of variables a + b + c + d + e... remains constant , e.g. at " six million " , when several variables fluctuate downwards by , say , nearly three million and about half of that , in the absence of any corresponding upwards revision ; it is financially and politically motivated Jewish " mathematics " .
It is n't Muslim physics and chemistry that holds that corpses may be rapidly and economically cremated with between a pound and a kilogram of coke per body when the firebricks of the cremation ovens are not even replaced after some 20,000 cremations ( which is rather like expecting a Trabant to be capable of doing 100,000 miles non-stop at 100 mph on 100 gallons of gasoline and a couple of cans of motor oil ) ; it is politically and financially motivated Jewish " physics " and Jewish " chemistry " .
It was n't Muslims - or even the " Russian police " - who behave as if they authored The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion ; it is International Jewry , and if it hisses like a snake and rattles like a rattlesnake , it is n't exactly benign .
It is not the " international Muslim " who has much to answer for ; it is the international Jew .
The mainstream media ’s conspicuous silence over the collapse of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory has clearly exposed them as " the dogs that did n’t bark " .
This was inspired by an excellent piece from back in November 2003 : It Was n't Arabs by Edgar J. Steele

Millette study fails to refute crucial findings by Harrit et al

Israel 's 9/11 False - Flag
Add this to the library of rank hypocrisy to bubble up from the Bush administration .
Here was Bush speaking in an interview on al - Arabiya after the Bush - sanctioned horrors at Abu Ghraib became known :
It ’s important for people to understand that in a democracy , there will be a full investigation .
In other words , we want to know the truth .
In our country , when there ’s an allegation of abuse … there will be a full investigation , and justice will be delivered . …
It ’s very important for people and your listeners to understand that in our country , when an issue is brought to our attention on this magnitude , we act .
And we act in a way in which leaders are willing to discuss it with the media . …
In other words , people want to know the truth .
That stands in contrast to dictatorships .
A dictator would n’t be answering questions about this .
A dictator would n’t be saying that the system will be investigated and the world will see the results of the investigation .

Update : A few words from Steve Benen :
For seven years , the Los Angeles Unified School District has paid Matthew Kim a teaching salary of up to $ 68,000 per year , plus benefits .
His job is to do nothing .
Every school day , Kim ’s shift begins at 7:50 a.m. , with 30 minutes for lunch , and ends when the bell at his old campus rings at 3:20 p.m .
He is to take off all breaks , school vacations and holidays , per a district agreement with the teacher ’s union .
At no time is he to be given any work by the district or show up at school .
He has never missed a paycheck .
In the jargon of the school district , Kim is being “ housed ” while his fitness to teach is under review .
A special education teacher , he was removed from Grant High School in Van Nuys and assigned to a district office in 2002 after the school board voted to fire him for allegedly harassing teenage students and colleagues .
In the meantime , the district has spent more than $ 2 million on him in salary and legal costs .
Last week , Kim was ordered to continue this daily routine at home .
District officials said the offices for “ housed ” employees were becoming too crowded .
About 160 teachers and other staff sit idly in buildings scattered around the sprawling district , waiting for allegations of misconduct to be resolved .
The housed are accused , among other things , of sexual contact with students , harassment , theft or drug possession .
Nearly all are being paid .
All told , they collect about $ 10 million in salaries per year -- even as the district is contemplating widespread layoffs of teachers because of a financial shortfall .
Most cases take months to adjudicate , but some take years .
Kim , 41 , has persisted the longest .
He argued unsuccessfully in a lawsuit that he was the victim of disability discrimination .
Born with severe cerebral palsy , he has limited use of his limbs , must use a wheelchair and requires a full - time personal aide ( who is paid about $ 14 an hour by the district ) .
He declined repeatedly to be interviewed , as did his attorney , Lawrence Trygstad .
Kim ’s long - term stay in paid professional limbo highlights how long it can take to move through the thicket of legal protections afforded educators in the Los Angeles Unified School District , the nation ’s second - largest .
“ It ’s a glaring example of how hard it is to remove someone from the classroom and how the process is tilted toward teachers , ” said school board member Marlene Canter , who recently proposed -- unsuccessfully -- to revamp the disciplinary process .
National issue
The problem of what to do with teachers in trouble extends well beyond Los Angeles Unified .
But not every district in California , or the country , handles it the same way .
In New York City public schools , which make up the country ’s largest district , teachers are confined to “ rubber rooms . ”
About 550 of the district ’s 80,000 teachers spend school hours “ literally just doing crossword puzzles , waiting for the end of the day ” until their cases are resolved , spokeswoman Ann Forte said .
Some have been there for years .
In Chicago , the dismissal process moves faster and the 30 teachers waiting for their cases to be resolved are assigned clerical tasks .
“ They ’ve got to be doing something , ” senior assistant general counsel James Ciesil said .
San Francisco
Unified employees are either sent home or assigned to tasks such as working in warehouses , doing inventory or answering phones , said Jolie Wineroth , the district ’s senior executive director for human resources .
“ I do n’t want to give anyone a free vacation , ” she said .
Former union leaders say teachers in the Los Angeles district used to be assigned non-teaching jobs when they were housed .
“ They should not just sit there like zombies , ” said Hank Springer , United Teachers Los Angeles president from 1975 to 1980 .
But the practice has changed in the last dozen years or so .
Now , district officials say , they are prohibited from assigning chores under the contract with the teachers ’ union .
Although there is no specific reference in the contract to housed employees , an attorney for L.A. Unified pointed to Article 9 , Section 4.0 , which defines the “ professional duties ” of a teacher , such as instructional planning and evaluating the work of pupils .
With no mention of photocopying , stuffing envelopes or answering telephones in the contract , the district and union have interpreted this provision as prohibiting clerical duties .
“ Why would we denigrate [ teachers ] by forcing them to do something they ’re not supposed to do ? ” said A. J. Duffy , who is now president of UTLA , adding that housed teachers are entitled to a presumption of innocence .
Los Angeles Unified Supt. Ramon C. Cortines thinks the policy should be changed .
“ I do n’t believe they should just be sitting -- that ’s taxpayer money , ” he said .
Some employees newly housed by L.A. Unified are dissatisfied with the practice for a different reason :
They have n’t been told what they are alleged to have done , nor whether the district is planning to fire them .
“ Prisoners in Guantanamo Bay have more rights than I do , ” said Jeffrey Brown , a ninth - grade teacher at Fulton College Preparatory School in Van Nuys .
In a lawsuit filed against the district in April , Brown alleges that he has been housed for roughly 70 days but told nothing about why .
His lawyer , Joseph Hart , said he was amazed at the secrecy of the system and its lack of regard for individual rights .
“ I ’m surprised nobody has challenged it in court before , ” he said .
District officials said that with rare exceptions , employees are informed all along of the allegations against them .
Misconduct complaints
Despite severely restricted movement and speech that was hard to understand , Kim racked up remarkable achievements before beginning his teaching career .
As a child he learned to paint with a brush and to type with a stick -- both held in his mouth .
He earned a bachelor ’s degree in physics from UC Berkeley , then went on to get two master ’s degrees , one in astrophysics and the other in special education .
He was also active in the disability rights movement .
When he applied for a full - time teaching job , he was turned down by more than 15 schools in L.A. Unified , he said in a 1999 letter filed in court .
Only after he threatened to sue the district for disability discrimination did he get a teaching job at Grant High School , records show .
Kim ’s troubles with the district began in 2000 , when a classroom aide reported inappropriate comments and advances .
In class one October day , according to her testimony before an administrative panel , Kim asked her to stand closer to him while interpreting his speech for the students .
When she moved closer , she said , he touched her breast with his left hand , the only one he could slightly control .
Students immediately started making comments about what they ’d seen .
One said : “ Oh , come on , Mr. Kim , you know you liked it , ” according to a summary of allegations against Kim prepared by a state review panel in 2008 .
Kim responded to the students that he had .
Over the next two years , another adult andsixstudents would make similar complaints against Kim , according to the summary .
The same month the aide complained , Kim asked a girl if she had a boyfriend and if she was a virgin , according to the girl ’s testimony during an administrative hearing .
Another girl said that Kim kept staring at her and urged her at one point not to change her hair color , according to documents filed with the state .
Joseph Walker , then the principal at Grant , confronted Kim , who denied most of the allegations .
Walker then wrote a memo to the teacher telling him that it was important “ to stay out of the students ’ personal life and personal space , ” according to district records filed in court .
It was the first of several attempts by the principal to bring the teacher into line .
In addition to chastising him for his conduct , he also found fault with Kim ’s teaching skills .
“ Communication with the students is a slow and laborious process leading to frustration and loss of instructional time , ” Walker wrote in a letter later filed in court .
In 2002 , Kim passed a major milestone : his second anniversary with the district .
Under state law , he was now a tenured teacher , entitled to a detailed set of protections .
These included taking the district to an administrative review hearing and to court .
Difficult process
Complaints of misconduct kept coming , according to district records filed in court .
After a male classroom aide reported that he had seen Kim touch a girl on the shoulders and near her crotch , Walker asked for advice from L.A. Unified ’s personnel division .
The principal noted that Kim “ has been charged with sexual harassment for the fourth time within a one - year period , ” according to his December 2001 memo in court files .
Two months later , a school counselor complained that Kim ran his hand back and forth across one of her breasts during a meeting , according to the court filings and the commission summary .
Walker now wanted Kim out , and the district personnel department agreed .
“ I was n’t big on firing people because I knew what you had to go through , ” Walker said in a recent interview .
He also was afraid Kim would sue him for discrimination .
But after so many complaints , Walker said he had no choice .
“ I was really compelled to do something , ” he said .
In February 2002 , the district ordered Kim housed at an administration building while the allegations were formally investigated .
The school board voted to fire Kim in October 2003 .
For seven years , the district and Kim have battled in administrative forums and courtrooms .
Kim sued Walker and the district for disability discrimination and ultimately lost .
By then , Walker had retired -- exhausted , he said , by the battle to fire Kim .
He currently heads a charter school in Pacoima .
Separately , a Commission on Professional Competence -- a three - member panel with ultimate administrative authority over teacher firings -- concluded that Kim had indeed engaged in unprofessional conduct by touching three female students .
But , the panel decided , he should not be fired because “ his conduct was a result of poor judgment , rather than overtly sexual . ”
The panel found no evidence that Kim was a poor teacher or that he had injured his students .
Instead it faulted the district for poorly documenting its case and not informing Kim promptly of the allegations .
The district successfully appealed to the superior and appellate courts , which sent the case back to the commission for reconsideration .
Earlier this year , the commission backed Kim again , ruling this time on a 2 - 1 vote that all of the touching was the result of “ involuntary arm movements . ”
And so it goes on , with no end in sight .
As Kim continues to collect his teacher ’s salary , the district is planning yet another court appeal .

It ’s been a month since Google ’s Aspergerian nerds drove their sole known visual designer , Doug Bowman , to quit the company .
I still say good for him .
I read dozens of postings about Bowman ’s decision .
Most were laced with appeasement of the Google position , to the extent one exists .
Google must be doing something right , and whatever Bowman brought to the table was n’t rationally and objectively needed , or else would n’t his work have been implemented ?
Only somewhat unfairly , I view this position as one espoused by extreme male brains encased in bodies that , surely by coincidence , have never been well dressed a day in their adult lives .
I take the terminology from Susan Pinker ’s The Sexual Paradox ( TV interview ) , which explains , using scientific findings , why large majorities of girls and women behave almost identically at different stages of their lives – while large minorities of boys and men show vast variability compared to each other and to male norms .
Some of these boys and men exhibit extreme - male - brain tendencies , including an ability to focus obsessively for long periods of time , often on inanimate objects or abstractions ( hence male domination of engineering and high - end law ) .
Paradoxically , other male brains in these exceptional cases may have an ability to experiment with many options for short periods each .
Pejoratively diagnosed as attention - deficit disorder , Pinker provides evidence this latter ability is actually a strength for some entrepreneurs .
The male brain , extreme or not , is compatible with visual design .
It allows you to learn every font in the Letraset catalogue and work from a grid .
In fact , the male - brain capacity for years - long single - mindedness explains why the heads of large ad agencies and design houses are overwhelmingly male .
( It is n’t a sexist conspiracy . )
In the computer industry , extreme male brains permit years of concentration on hardware and software design , while also iterating those designs seemingly ad infinitum .
The extreme male brain is really the extreme Google brain .
It ’s somewhat of a misnomer , because such is actually the average brain inside the company , but I will use that as a neologism .
Google was founded by extreme - male - brain nerds and , by all outward appearances , seems to hire only that type of person , not all of them male .
Apart from Bowman , I can think of only two Google employees I could stand to be around for longer than an elevator ride .
My impression of “ Googlers , ” which I concede is based on little direct knowledge and is prejudicial on its face , is one of undersocialized , uncultured , pampered , arrogant faux - savants who have cultivated an arrested adolescence that the Google working environment further nurtures .
Their computer - programming skills , the sole skills valued by the company , camouflage the flaws of their neuroanatomy .
Their brains are beautifully suited to the genteel eugenics program that is the Google hiring process but are broken for real - world use .
Bowman ’s experience shows there actually is something worse than having epic bad taste ( as Microsoft has eternally displayed ) or none at all ( my experience the rest of the time with Microsoft ) .
This worse thing is an active denial of taste .
The extreme male brain , housed by the thousand in Google meatbags , cannot discern patterns or distinctive features that constitute good design according to the consensus of informed , educated people .
Instead of simply trying harder to learn to make such distinctions or just taking our word for it , the Googler embarks on a full - scale jihad against the very concept of taste , denying we have any rational or objective basis to make such a judgement .
And even if there were such a basis , Googlers ’
A / B testing results beat the shit out of your opinion so who cares what you think ?
We ’re not here to make things pretty .
While harsh and hyperbolic , I speculate that Bowman would not disagree that the foregoing is a reasonably accurate précis of what actually happened to him in meetings .
Kevin
Fox ’s posting strove for even - handedness , ladling it on so thick it seems like a covert endorsement of Google ’s culture of anti-intellectualism masquerading as pure reason .
( Maybe by only a hair . )
Still , this sentence strikes me as factual reporting of what the meatbags encasing these extreme Google brains actually do : “ Data - driven design is a vital tool for hill - climbing iteration of a site , but you should take great care not to use it as an appeals process whenever you and your designer reach an impasse . ”
I also read a posting , which I now cannot find , that claimed there really is a renaissance ( actually a naissance ) of design literacy inside large tech companies .
Apparently Bill Buxton of Microsoft was at the Mix conference telling everyone that he ’s hiring scads of “ designers . ”
I ’ve known Buxton – very distantly , off and on – for about 15 years , so I mailed him and asked if he was n’t talking about design in the most catholic imaginable sense – systems design or big - picture thinking rather than visual design , graphic design , or visual communications , which are three synonyms for Bowman ’s field and our true subject here .
Yes , he told me , promising to write about it himself at one point .
If you think it ’s Bowman ’s own damned fault for not fitting in with Google ’s culture and good riddance to him , while at the same time claiming that technology juggernauts are indeed getting religion when it comes to visual design , you ’re wrong both ways .
You ’re one step away from telling two kinds of lies .
Companies committed to a culture of antidesign ( also consultants like Jakob Nielsen ) may occasionally succeed in the marketplace , but they do so in spite of their antidesign , not because of it .
Of course we ca n’t prove that ; we ca n’t run a controlled experiment , let alone 41 of them with distinct shades of blue .
It is merely one of those things a visually literate person knows .
The fact that you do n’t know it , or you deny it ’s important , or deny it even can be known goes to show you really are better suited to programming a computer all day than dealing with actual human beings .
I again welcome Bowman back to the ranks of human civilization .
' Hurling a Stone At a Mosque ' Rumor Leads to Attack on Christians in Egypt
( AINA ) --
As a result of a rumor that a young Christian Copt hurled a stone towards a mosque , thousands of Muslims congregated and attacked Copts and their properties , leaving several injured and arrested .
The incident , which took place on Wednesday , May 13 , 2009 , in the area of Saft El - Labn , Giza , resulted in the injury of 14 people from both sides .
The police arrested 20 Copts , including 6 women , and 7 Muslims , and security imposed a curfew on the region .
Among the Copts randomly rounded up by the police is 29 - year - old Sabry Shaker , a physically handicapped man suffering from infantile paralysis .
Those arrested have been subjected to torture to force them to confess to crimes they have not committed .
The attacked Copts called upon the human rights organizations for help .
A delegation from the Egyptian Union of Human Rights Organization ( EUHRO ) , headed by its President Dr. Naguib Gibraeel , went to Boulak Dakrour police station and remained until the early hours of Thursday morning , to follow up on the incident .
According to a press release issued today by the EUHRO , three Coptic youths , Hend Azmy , Peter Zaghloul and Sarwat Ibrahim , are still missing from among those arrested , including the handicapped Copt .
" The police officers could not give a plausible reason for their absence which suggests that they have been kept in an undisclosed place due to the severity of the torture they went through , and the police are trying to cover up their doings , , commented Gibraeel .
Yesterday 's sectarian clashes were brought about by an argument between the relative of a Coptic girl who was sexually harassed by a Muslim youth , and was on a small scale .
Unfortunately , Muslim fanatics in the area propagated a rumour that during the melee , the Copts hurled stones towards the Mosque .
As a result thousands of Muslims gathered and attacked the Copts living in the area , and destroyed 6 shops including a pharmacy , a supermarket and some vehicles .
Dr. Gibraeel demanded from the Interior Minister Habib Al Adly to intervene to put an end to this practice of torture .
He added that this phenomenon of repeated attacks on the lives of Copts and their property in recent times reflects the culture of extremism , militancy and intolerance towards the Christians as well as the diminution of their civil rights .
He added that this is caused by the ' stance taken by the government against the Copts ' , which is reflected by a large sector of hard - liners .
Dr. Gibraeel , an attorney and a Copt himself , commented : " Until when will this silence continue and for how long will Copts continue to be treated so lowly , while the regime is boasting about how we live in the best era of democracy and citizenship ?
But it appears to be just ' slogans ' empty of any content ! "

March 4 , 2009 --
A new kind of vaginal gel prevents sexual transmission of the AIDS virus in monkey studies .
The anti-HIV ingredient in the gel is glycerol monolaurate or GML .
It 's already FDA approved as an ingredient in cosmetics and medicines .
" The results are very encouraging .
They point to a novel avenue to prevent sexual transmission of HIV , " study researcher Ashley T. Haase , MD , head of the microbiology department at the University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , said at a telephone news conference .
The surprise finding that GML can block HIV comes from basic research showing that the AIDS virus gains a foothold in the vagina by taking advantage of the body 's immune system .
Immune responses to the virus draw T cells -- the white blood cells HIV loves to infect -- to the site of infection .
Without T - cell recruitment , HIV loses its grip .
That 's where GML comes in .
The antimicrobial agent affects immune responses and breaks the chain of events that let HIV spread through the body .
" We thought if we could modulate the immune response at the portal of HIV entry , we could block sexual transmission , " Haase said .
" [ Colleague ]
Patrick Schlievert 's work with GML showed that it had many properties that might block HIV expansion and systematic spread . "
Haase , Schlievert , and colleagues gave five rhesus macaque monkeys daily GML treatments before putting 200 infectious doses of deadly SIV -- the monkey version of HIV -- into their vaginas .
Another four animals got a gel without GML .
The four animals not given GML got AIDS .
Those treated with GML showed no sign of infection during the short - term study , although one of the five animals showed signs of infection several months later .
But just as HIV drugs with different modes of action are more effective when mixed into a drug " cocktail , " Haase says GML could be mixed with different kinds of anti-HIV agents .
" GML could be part of a combined strategy with another vaginal microbicide , such as PRO 2000 , with a different mechanism of action , " he suggests .
What 's the right price for an e-book ?
No more than $ 10 , says a group of Amazon Kindle e-book owners — and they have found a novel way to make themselves heard .
Some 250 Kindle readers are using Amazon 's own book - tagging system to mark e-books priced more than $ 10 with the tag ' 9 99 boycott ' .
Their argument : A Kindle book is more restricted in its use than a paper book and therefore should not cost as much .
" It just does n't seem right , " says Crystal O'Brien , a Connecticut librarian who bought a Kindle last year .
For the last few days , O'Brien has spent a few minutes every day in the Kindle book store tagging the more expensive digital books with the ' 9 99 boycott ' tag and removing it once the price drops below the threshold .
" You are not getting something you can lend out to other people , you are not getting a physical item , " says O'Brien .
" So you should n't have to pay so much for a digital copy . "
The protesters are the latest in a long line of consumers to rebel against restrictive copy - protection technologies .
Music lovers have been circumventing copy protection for decades , leading some labels to begin removing digital rights management ( DRM ) technology entirely .
Film studios and consumers have clashed over copy protection in DVDs .
Even iPhone apps are not immune from DRM - busting pirates .
As e-book sales have taken off , they may become the next copy - protection battleground .
Last year , sales of e-books rose 68.4 percent from the year before to $ 113.2 million , even as overall book sales fell 2.8 percent , according to the Association of American Publishers .
Much of that growth has been driven by the Kindle 's popularity .
The Kindle reader revolt is likely to be little more than a minor annoyance for the fledgling e-book reader .
Amazon launched the first generation of the Kindle in November 2007 and an updated version in February this year , and while the company has not released official sales figures , analysts estimate that the company sold half a million Kindles in 2008 .
By comparison , 250 users is a tiny drop in the bucket .
Still one of Kindle 's strengths over its competitors has been the number of books available in Amazon 's book store .
Amazon has often said New York Times bestsellers and new releases are available for $ 10 .
But O'Brien says that the $ 10 price is just one part of the story .
Looking back at her history of purchases on Amazon she has found prices of e-books steadily creeping up .
" Some of the Kindle books now cost more than their paperback version , " she says .
For instance , she points out that she purchased a digital copy of Small Favor , a book by Jim Butcher for $ 10 in June last year .
The Kindle price then jumped to $ 13.94 and is now back to $ 8 .
A paperback version of the book costs $ 10 .
" On material items , prices can fluctuate but why would a Kindle book go up in price ? " says O'Brien .
Amazon.com has not yet responded to a request for comment .
O'Brien and other Kindle users who have joined the revolt have used the boycott tag more than 7,200 times so far .
" It does n't take that much time to do , and it sends out a message , " she says .
Kindle books are limited in their use :
They can not be donated to a library , sold to a used - book store or even Amazon 's used marketplace or traded elsewhere .
In addition , some books are badly designed and offer little pictorial or other kind of visual relief , they say .
It 's a valid argument for readers to make , says Andrew Savikas , vice president of digital initiatives at O'Reilly Media .
" The typical knee - jerk response from publishers is to usually explain their costs , " he says .
" But readers are speaking vocally and implicitly with their pockets about what they are willing to ultimately pay and that 's what matters . "
For publishers , the majority of a book 's costs is not in the printing or shipping , says Savikas .
It 's in sales , marketing , product development and editorial .
" Its more about the fixed costs , " he says .
But communicating that to buyers is n't easy .
So instead of setting the price of e-books based on costs and a small profit , publishers should find a new way to price their products , says Savikas .
" Ask what price the market will support , and then build the cost structure that will allow you to make money at that price , " he says .
O'Reilly Media does n't sell digital books through Amazon 's store but offers e-books through its own website .
Kindle owner Tim Stevens , a software consultant who bought his e-reader last year has so far purchased about four books from Amazon 's store .
Stevens has n't joined the ' 9 99 boycott ' movement yet .
He says he can understand why some users feel so strongly about e-book pricing but is not sure picking on $ 10 as the magic number is right .
" It seems rather arbitrary to me , " he says .
More importantly , it misses the point of an e-book .
" No doubt I would want e-books to be cheaper , but its more about the peace of mind that comes from the convenience of the format , " he says .
" I do n't mind paying a few dollars more for it . "
For Amazon and book publishers , the best hope now is that more Kindle owners continue to think like Stevens rather than O'Brien .

Have you ever wondered which is the biggest ship on earth ?
The boats that tipically reach huge dimensions are Cruising ships , Battleships , Aircraft Carriers and Tankers .
The biggest of all ( and with a big gap from the others ) is the Supertanker " Knock Nevis " ( formerly known as Seawise Giant , Happy Giant , and Jahre Viking ) with its 458.45 m ( 1,504 ft ) in length and 68.9 m ( 226 ft ) in width .
It has a deadweight of 564,763 tonnes and a summer displacement of 647,955 t when laden with nearly 650,000 m³ ( 4.1 million barrels ) of petroleum .
The ship has a draft of 24.6 m ( 81 feet ) when fully loaded , which makes it impossible for the ship to navigate even the English Channel , let alone man-made canals at Suez and Panama .
It has also a long and complicated history ,
It was built between 1979 and 1981 , damaged during the Iran - Iraq War , and refloated in 1991 , but is now used as an immobile offshore platform for the oil industry .

The Hybrid FOSS / Proprietary System , and How It 's Winning Hearts
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 10 , 2008
Related Blog Posts OpenSolaris Coming to Toshiba Laptops -- Continuing a Trend
I stumbled upon John Spencer 's blog over at ComputerWorldUK .
It seems he recently had a hand in deploying a few Eee Box desktops at a local school .
Though these boxes run Windows , it does n't mean they can't run a lot of powerful open source alternative applications along with any required proprietary ones , and he says , in some settings , this is the situation that works out best for everyone .
As a Linux enthusiast , he was impressed with Splashtop , the Linux - based , instant - on option shipping with many netbooks .
But it 's not only appearing on netbooks .
And it 's not only Linux enthusiasts who are impressed .
I recently built a new computer for my husband and chose an ASUS motherboard .
I did n't notice the Splashtop / ExpressGate feature when I ordered it ( though I was aware that ASUS was planning to offer models with this feature ) .
After the build , I installed and enabled the Splashtop instant - on mode , mainly for my curiosity .
What 's happened in the short time since gives pause to wonder .
Year of the Linux desktop ?
I do n't know .
Year of the instant - on Linux desktop ?
The Linux Foundation 's Jim Zemlin is on to something .
Though I 've used Linux for years , my husband has n't heard the call .
He finds it intriguing as a concept , and he complains about certain annoying Windows traits he knows do n't exist in a Linux environment .
The longest he has ever used Linux ?
Forty - five minutes .
He got caught up in a game ( and the addictive music ) of Frozen Bubble when he found I left a Knoppix liveCD in his computer once .
He wanted ( nay , needed ) the new desktop to play games .
For now , that means Windows is usually , ultimately , where he ends up .
I also thought that the Splashtop option would annoy him -- he turns on the computer , the Splashtop menu comes up before even the BIOS options , and asks if he'd like to launch Splashtop , go to the main operating system , or enter the BIOS .
The time this prompt is displayed can be configured , as can the default options ( for example , I 've set it so that if there 's no input in ten seconds , his machine boots Windows ) .
It 's automated , it 's painless , but I thought it would be an extra step that would cramp his style .
The last three mornings I 've found him " checking online real quick " in the five minutes or so he has before heading to work .
Maybe that 's only breaking down to fifteen minutes of use -- but that 's fifteen minutes of using Linux in the last three days , as opposed to forty - five minutes in the previous eight years .
He likes the heftier processor and better graphics on his new machine , but he expected that .
He did n't expect to say that Splashtop makes what was planned to be simply a " fun " rig something useful , convenient -- and more fun .
It is n't so much that Splashtop has a wide range of applications -- it's that the ones that are included ( browser , chat , IM , Skype , and a few others ) are the ones you most often want to get to quickly .
On this machine , Splashtop is up and running in about seven seconds .
For many , this feature will be their first real introduction to Linux .
They may not realize they 're using Linux -- at least , not at first , and for some , that is n't necessarily a bad thing .
Splashtop is fast , it 's nicely laid out and it works .
It ca n't do everything that a " bigger " distribution does , of course , but that 's fine .
The applications and services it means to deliver are delivered well .
Even those who are n't warm to any type of technology can't help but appreciate that .

Blogging is not only fun , but it can be profitable as well .
However , it is not easy to start making money on blogging , so that is what this site is all about .
Here we want to present the new age in blogging ; how to have fun and make killing in the bank .
Making money on being you
A blog is essentially a window into your life .
That does n’t mean that you have to show every little detail , but you need to be honest and show a bit of the bad and lots of the good .
After all the big selling point in the blog is you and your personality .
So what parts of yourself and your life do you want to showcase ?
Look at the great names in social media and entertainment ; like the Kardashians .
One would be a fool to believe that they are really showing everything , however , they are showing a lot .
The viewer feels that they know the characters in the show as they have very distinct and realistic personality .
The extremely successful bloggers have stylists and media advisors that can guide them and make sure they present the right image .
This is not an opinion that the rest of us can use .
But not all is lost as there are many ways of getting things done and becoming successful .
The most important part is to remember that no matter what , you need to present a clear and believable profile .
The readers have to feel that they know the real you and that you are somebody they want to spend time with .
They do n’t always have to like you or agree with you , but they want to know more about what you are saying and what you are doing .
Let them share , through the screen , your troubles and concerns as well as your loves and desires .
The only thing you should be careful with is touching very inflamed political issues or hot news .
If you start taking a very clear stand on these type of issues , you could drive away potential commercial interest companies .
Less commercial means less money in your pocket .
Great tips to be found online
There are more bloggers and social media figures than just the Kardashians that are doing great .
So there are plenty of great sources of inspiration to be found if you just spend a little time checking out Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and different blog sites .
There are different things you should look out for
• What are they writing about ?
• How long is the average text ?
• Do they use a lot of pictures and if so ; what kind of pictures ?
( Pictures of fashion , personal images , generic pictures )
• What is the tone of their texts ?
Light - hearted ?
Fun ?
Down - to - earth ?
Find your favourites and start following it so you can start getting a better idea of what this is all about .
Blank space ?
Find inspiration
The dreaded writers block is of course something that also bloggers know all too well .
There will be times when you feel that you cannot find anything new to discuss or to post .
You will feel drained and empty .
The trick in these situations is to either let your readers know you are taking a short break ( if you have a solid reader group that follow you ) or just push through .
If you need to push through to keep building your audience , and let ’s face it most of us need to do this , then you can find inspiration everywhere .
Look at images from the free images sites , check out casino sites or sale sites , check out Instagram and Twitter , and so forth .
All of these sites are fairly often updated so you can find new information and often inspiration .
Make your own Pinterest board filled with images that you like and make you feel good .
These are good to use when the inspiration is missing .
Sponsor
I would like to thank our sponsor Bestecasinoer.com for their help with the homepage as well as financial to get the site running .
Big thanks !
Here 's one first - hand account one such happening :
For some it was wildly excessive and confusing tax laws .
Others were there out of concern for their children and grandchildren .
Some were there because they ’re maddened that the same glorious policies that have made Detroit look like Bangladesh after a garbage haulers strike are being introduced on a national level , a few were upset because the same people who created these massive problems are charged with fixing them , others do n’t want their country sold out to some global entity , and one man I saw had a sign that said “ Government job ’ is a contradiction in terms . ”
Many were there for the reason of “ all of the above . ”
This is , of course , a dog 's breakfast .
And it does indeed recall the loony left marches and protests of the recent past .
End the War !
But which one ?
And how ?
I guess one theme is that government should have no proactive role in a recession like the one we 're grappling with .
But as those governors trying to refuse stimulus money will attest , this is not exactly a popular meme right now .
Here 's a suggestion that will fall on ears with hands clasped tightly around them : why not just make them tax simplification rallies ?
That 's something that appeals beyond a Palin base ; most of us feel angry about it at this time of year ; it can rail against the rich and the special interests for carving out privileges that hurt everyone else ; and it's a dagger at the heart of the lobbying industry .
No takers ?
One senses that this is essentially a counter - cultural protest event - against the result of the last election ( with some muted disgruntlement with the eight years that preceded it ) .
And it suggests that the right is returning to its 1950s roots - kooks , cranks , disaffected and paranoid gun-nuts , born - again culture - warriors , Birchers , book - burners , and black helicpoter worriers .
Oh , well .
I told you it would get worse before it gets better .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

In the last two NFL Drafts , the University of Michigan has been well - represented .
Seven Wolverines were picked in 2007 , and six more were chosen last year , including the overall No. 1 selection , offensive tackle Jake Long .
But unlike Long - who made the Pro Bowl as a Miami Dolphins ' rookie - there are no first - round locks among Michigan 's players this year .
When the two - day , seven - round draft begins Saturday afternoon in New York City , the best question regarding Michigan players might not be how many get drafted , but rather does anyone get drafted at all ?
The odds , certainly , are in Michigan 's favor for having at least one player picked .
The Wolverines have a 70 - year streak going in that regard .
But , who might it be ?
Among the many mock drafts , there seem to be just two Wolverines considered draft worthy out of the 16 who are eligible : Cornerback Morgan Trent and defensive tackle Terrance Taylor .
Both Trent and Taylor started for three seasons in Ann Arbor , and each had bright spots in February at the NFL Scouting Combine , where draft prospects are put through a series of physical and mental tests and position drills .
Trent , for instance , placed fourth among all cornerbacks by running a 4.47 - second 40 - yard dash .
He also showed good strength for his position , bench - pressing 225 pounds 23 times , also fourth - best among cornerbacks .
Yet , despite his physical prowess , Trent is considered no better than a mid- to late - round pick by NFL Draft experts because of a lack of effectiveness on the field .
Likewise , Taylor is renowned for his strength ( he led all defensive linemen at the combine with 37 bench - press repetitions ) , but drew criticism in Pro Football Weekly 's draft guide for his inability to create pressure in opposing backfields .
He , too , is n't expected to be chosen any higher than the middle rounds .
A Big Ten honorable mention selection last year after being a second - teamer in 2007 , Taylor said he 's confident he 'll be drafted .
" It does n't matter ( to which team ) I go , " he said .
" I can do well anywhere . "
Asked for this thoughts about Michigan 's draft class , Big Ten Network analyst and former college coach Gerry DiNardo said this week he believed some Wolverines may be underrated .
" Any time you get caught in a coaching change , it 's going to impact your play because you 're learning a new system , " DiNardo said .
" I think there 's enough talent for them to be in the mix ( to be drafted ) , but I think they kind of got caught in the middle because of the coaching change . "
That change , from Lloyd Carr to Rich Rodriguez , did n't work out so well on the field -
at least in 2008 - where Michigan finished 3 - 9 .
By the time the draft concludes Sunday , we 'll have a better idea of what kind of future NFL teams believe the seniors on that team might have .

Afghan war was wrong under Bush -- and it still is
“ There is no need in the 21st century to do this , to make us safe , ” Representative Alan Grayson , a freshman Democrat from Florida , said of the continuing American - led wars .
“ This is a 19th - century strategy being played out at great expense in both money and blood in the 21st century , in the wrong time at the wrong place . ”
“ It ’s wrong , ” Mr. Grayson added .
“ That ’s why I am going to vote against it . ”
What a bizarre mish - mash of congressmembers voted against passage of the Supplemental Appropriations money ( $ 97 billion ) for Fiscal Year 2009 late yesterday .
It passed overwhelmingly 368-60 but when I looked at the names of the 5 dozen opponents , expecting to see a batch of far right fringe Republican obstructionists like Michele Bachmann , Virginia Foxx , Paul Ryan , John Boehner and Eric Cantor , I found only a small handful of obstructionist maniacs -- not even Paul Broun !
It was just far right Republicans Ed Royce , Jeff Flake , James Sensenbrenner , John Campbell and Vern Ehlers with a couple of just as far right mangy old Blue Dogs ( like Jim Cooper ) and a wholeof the best members of Congress , progressive warriors like Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , Donna Edwards ( D - MD ) , Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) , Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , Carol Shea - Porter ( D - NH ) , Diane Watson ( D - CA ) , Mike Capuano ( D - MA ) , Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , Jared Polis ( D - CO ) , Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) , Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) , Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , Chellie Pingree ( D - ME ) , Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) , Eric Massa ( D - NY ) , Yvette Clarke ( D - NY ) , Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) , George Miller ( D - CA ) , Maxine Waters ( D - CA ) , Steve Kagen ( D - WI ) , and Jim McDermott ( D - WA ) .
They were joined by anti-war Republican Ron Paul ( R - TX ) .
Then I remembered reading a quote from Grayson Wednesday night explaining to thewhy he was breaking with Obama on this one to vote his conscience and for what he is certain his constituents want .
Eric Massa , a career naval officer , had a variety of reasons , some very specific , for voting " no , " but in the end , he felt he was keeping his promise to his constituents to oppose the Iraq War .
" For over four years prior to being elected to Congress , I promised to vote against any additional funding for the Iraq war without a clear and immediate plan of withdrawal , " he said .
" Regardless of which party is in power , I could not in good conscience vote for any additional Iraq war funding .
The Iraqi people want us to leave and I think we should begin redeploying American troops out of Iraq immediately .
I 've always promised to stand up to my party when I disagree with them , but yesterday I had to stand up to both political parties .
" It 's hard for Democrats to break with a good -- and popular -- Democratic president .
Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , who voted " yes , " admitted he was struggling with the bill but more and more Democrats are uneasy by what is looking like an open - ended commitment in Afghanistan that harkens back to the Bush Regime .
House Appropriations Committee Chair David Obey said Democrats will give Obama a year to get a handle on the situation that he inherited from Bush before the 5 dozen who voted against the bill turns into a majority .

AS THE economic tide recedes , it exposes all manner of ugliness , from the gargantuan fraud of Bernard Madoff to books - fiddling at Satyam .
But what is bad news for most people means more business for Larry Levine , the founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants , which teaches white - collar criminals how to survive prison .
Mr Levine , a former private investigator , knows whereof he speaks : he spent ten years shuttling between 11 federal prisons on charges related to narcotics , obstruction of justice and securities fraud .
He remains under supervised parole , which means he must conduct all of his business by telephone ( passing time in the company of other convicted felons is a parole violation , and would result in his returning to jail ) .
He calls himself a jailhouse litigator ( “ jailhouse lawyer ” , he explains , “ sounds cheap ” ) .
Long stretches in his prisons ' law libraries left him more familiar with the Byzantine rules of America 's federal prison system than most wardens .
He first made something of that knowledge towards the end of his sentence , in 2005 , when he sued the Federal Bureau of Prisons on behalf of about 100 terrified white - collar prisoners who were transferred en masse from a minimum - security prison ( the type derisively called “ Club Fed ” ) to a low - security prison where they shared space with gang members and other violent criminals .
Hundreds of terrified fraudsters later , Mr Levine 's business is thriving .
Starting at $ 999 per consultation , he advises criminals on all aspects of prison life .
How can you advance your release date ?
Many prisoners suddenly discover , post - conviction , that they had a drinking problem ( participating in rehab shaves time off sentences ) .
Where should you look for friends ?
Do not cross racial lines — many federal prisons are so segregated that they have “ black ” telephones and “ white ” telephones — and do not make friends with a “ rat ” , or known informant .
What about prison etiquette ?
Do not sit on another inmate 's bunk without being invited to do so , do not change the television channel when someone else is watching and do not jump in line .
Show respect to everyone ( Mr Levine cautions that reaching across someone 's tray at the dining hall is a good way to get yourself “ stuck ” , or stabbed ) .
Still , even Mr Levine can't help everyone .
He is pessimistic about Mr Madoff 's chances of leaving prison alive .
Thieves rank low in prison hierarchy , and he reckons that other inmates whose families have been hurt by the downturn will blame Mr Madoff .
“ You rob a bank , that 's cool , ” he explains .
“ Someone defrauded an insurance company , and he 's cool .
The worst thing you can be in prison is a thief who steals from people , and Bernie stole from people . ”

It may not be surgically clean or painless , but it can be very fast
We love science and the scientific method - without it we'd be still thinking that lightning was Zeus hurling thunderbolts , the sun was an enormous campfire , and the earth itself was balancing on huge turtles ( a cosmology that still holds a certain charm to certain people ) .
We'd be ignorant troglodytes who would not know what hit us , if the world suddenly came to an end .
We have scientists to tell us that we should learn to love - and fear - the Finality , the coming End of All Things , that is darn nigh inevitable , though hopefully removed by a few quadrillion years .
But rest assured , science can speed up things considerably in this direction , and here is a short how - to list :

Not one to miss something so obvious , its daddy , the one and only J. Robert Oppenheimer ( ‘ Oppy ’ to his pals ) thought “ I am become Death , the destroyer of worlds ” from the Bhagavad Gita – but Kenneth Bainbridge , the Test Director , said it even better : " Now we are all sons of bitches . "

Sure , the Trinity Atomic Bomb Test -- the event that began the so - called atomic age , leading to our now - constant terror that one day the missiles may start to fly and the bombs begin to fall -- was the first , but since then there have been all kinds of new , if not as flashy , scientific investigations that could be ten times more destructive , or even could ultimately gobble up our Universe ...
2. A Subatomic Nightmare , or the Bubble of Doom
Naturally this is an exaggeration , but it ’s still fun – in a shudder - inducing kind of way – to think about all these wildly hypothetical doomsdays .
Putting aside the already overly publicized fears over the Large Hadron Collider creating a mini black hole that immediately falls to the core of the earth – eventually consuming the entire globe – some researchers have expressed concern that some day we may create , or unleash , a subatomic nightmare .
The hunt for the so - called God particle ( also called a Higgs boson ) , for instance , has made some folks nervous : one wrong move , one missing plus or minus sign , and we could do something as esoteric and disastrous as discovering that we exist in a metastable vacuum ( or " false vacuum " ) – when one of our particle accelerators creates ( " nucleates " ) a bubble of lower energy vacuum , which would then " approach at nearly the speed of light and destroy the Earth instantaneously , without any forewarning . " ( more info )

" Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe ; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature ; after vacuum decay , not only is life as we know it impossible , so is chemistry as we know it .
However , one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain , if not life as we know it , at least some structures capable of knowing joy .
This possibility has now been eliminated . " - S. Coleman

Some models describe the bubble as pretty much Universal , or bigger than our Universe , in which case we - just like these troglodytes - certainly would not know what hit us .
3. " Grey Goo " replaces everything , wants more
A new threat to everyone on the planet is the idea of developing nanotechnology .
If you 've been napping for the last decade or so , nanotech is basically machines the size of large molecules : machines that can create ( pretty much ) anything on a atomic level .
The question – and the concern – is what might happen if a batch of these microscopic devices gets loose .
The common description of this Armageddon is " grey goo . "
The little machines would dissemble the entire world , and everything and everyone on it , until all that would be left is a spinning ball of , you guessed it , goo .

Somewhere down there are nanobots , busy having breakfast .
Some Dr. Doom scenarios mention that once the Earth is consumed , the army of nanobots could be directed toward the Sun , and the Sun would dispose of them ( or it could be the other way around - you never know ' till you try )
4. Rogue Genetic
Tweaks
Another concern for some folks is that , for the first time , we ’ve begun to seriously tinker with genetics .
We ’ve always fooled with animals ( just look at a Chihuahua ) but now we can REALLY fool with one .
It does n’t take a scientist to imagine – and worry about – what happens when we tinker with something like ebola or , perhaps even worse , create something that affects the reproduction of food staples like corn or wheat .
Spreading from one farm to another , carried perhaps on the wind , this rogue genetic tweak could kill billions via starvation .
" How is babby formed , how the girl get pregnant " -
And then there ’s us .
What happens if the tweak – carried by a virus or bacteria – screws not with our food but where we ’re the most sensitive : reproduction ?
Unable to procreate we ’d be extinct in as few as a hundred years .
5 . One lonely AI seeks human company ... is anybody there ?
While it ’s become a staple of bad science fiction , some scientists see it as a natural progression : whether we like it or not , one day we will create a form of artificial intelligence that will surpass and replace us .
Even putting aside the idea that our creations might be hostile ... ( see this old pulp image , for example )
... the fact that they could be better than us at everything means that it would simply be a matter of time before they go out into the universe – and leave us poor throwbacks behind .
On top of that , the only medicine known to cure such humiliation is deadly , too -
In the meantime , you can chat with Earth 's first " Artificial Intelligence " entity - very polite Alice , who would truthfully answer your questions about her future and destiny , if you choose the right words .
Apocalyptic scenarios a la carte
We could continue to enumerate the frightening possibilities ( here is a good site that lists a lot of them ) , and you could always go see the " 2012 " movie - see it the only proper way , in January 2013 - but when it comes to scientific progress , it seems to be flexible enough to produce new , gruesome and unavoidable ways to end it all , just when we 're not looking ( although it always works out fine in the end )
You 've got to love this frightful aspect of science .
It 's thrilling to know that the world of observation , hypothesis , prediction and experiment can be at the same time so lethal and absurd .
It threatens with doom , and yet always provides the happy ending .
( image credit : Jack Kirby , via )
And , if some enthusiastic scientists inadvertently send our world spiraling into a cosmological in - sink - erator ... one thing left to us would be the hope that there is Somebody Out There ...
Somebody who will wake up and realize that it was all a dream .

Suffocated by Debt Greece Teeters on the Verge of Bankruptcy
Greece is on the brink of bankruptcy despite the fact that the global recession has yet to hit the country with full force .
Strikes are paralyzing the country and the EU is putting on the pressure .
But the government is still trying to put a positive spin on things .
Washington , D.C. —
The Earth 's original atmosphere held very little oxygen .
This began to change around 2.4 billion years ago when oxygen levels increased dramatically during what scientists call the " Great Oxidation Event . "
The cause of this event has puzzled scientists , but researchers writing in Nature have found indications in ancient sedimentary rocks that it may have been linked to a drop in the level of dissolved nickel in seawater .
" The Great Oxidation Event is what irreversibly changed surface environments on Earth and ultimately made advanced life possible , " says research team member Dominic Papineau of the Carnegie Institution 's Geophysical Laboratory .
" It was a major turning point in the evolution of our planet , and we are getting closer to understanding how it occurred . "
The researchers , led by Kurt Konhauser of the University of Alberta in Edmonton , analyzed the trace element composition of sedimentary rocks known as banded - iron formations , or BIFs , from dozens of different localities around the world , ranging in age from 3,800 to 550 million years .
Banded iron formations are unique , water - laid deposits often found in extremely old rock strata that formed before the atmosphere or oceans contained abundant oxygen .
As their name implies , they are made of alternating bands of iron and silicate minerals .
They also contain minor amounts of nickel and other trace elements .
Nickel exists in today 's oceans in trace amounts , but was up to 400 times more abundant in the Earth 's primordial oceans .
Methane - producing microorganisms , called methanogens , thrive in such environments , and the methane they released to the atmosphere might have prevented the buildup of oxygen gas , which would have reacted with the methane to produce carbon dioxide and water .
A drop in nickel concentration would have led to a " nickel famine " for the methanogens , who rely on nickel - based enzymes for key metabolic processes .
Algae and other organisms that release oxygen during photosynthesis use different enzymes , and so would have been less affected by the nickel famine .
As a result , atmospheric methane would have declined , and the conditions for the rise of oxygen would have been set in place .
The researchers found that nickel levels in the BIFs began dropping around 2.7 billion years ago and by 2.5 billion years ago was about half its earlier value .
" The timing fits very well .
The drop in nickel could have set the stage for the Great Oxidation Event , " says Papineau .
" And from what we know about living methanogens , lower levels of nickel would have severely cut back methane production . "
What caused the drop in nickel ?
The researchers point to geologic changes that were occurring during the interval .
During earlier phases of the Earth 's history , while its mantle was extremely hot , lavas from volcanic eruptions would have been relatively high in nickel .
Erosion would have washed the nickel into the sea , keeping levels high .
But as the mantle cooled , and the chemistry of lavas changed , volcanoes spewed out less nickel , and less would have found its way to the sea .
" The nickel connection was not something anyone had considered before , " says Papineau .
" It 's just a trace element in seawater , but our study indicates that it may have had a huge impact on the Earth 's environment and on the history of life . "

Should this even qualify as news ?
From the New York Times :
For the last eight weeks , nearly 200 federal examiners have labored inside some of the nation ’s biggest banks to determine how those institutions would hold up if the recession deepened .
What they are discovering may come as a relief to both the financial industry and the public : the banking industry , broadly speaking , seems to be in better shape than many people think , officials involved in the examinations say .
That is the good news .
The bad news is that many of the largest American lenders , despite all those bailouts , probably need to be bailed out again , either by private investors or , more likely , the federal government .
After receiving many millions , and in some cases , many billions of taxpayer dollars , banks still need more capital , these officials say .
The whole point of this charade exercise was to show the big banks were n’t terminal but still needed dough , and I am sure it will prove to be lots of dough before we are done .
But they now have the Good Housekeeping seal , so the chump taxpayer can breathe easy that the authorities are taking prudent measures to make sure his money is being shepherded wisely .
If you believe that , I have a bridge I ’d like to sell you .
We said from the beginning the stress tests were a complete sham .
Just look at the numbers .
200 examiners for 19 banks ?
When Citi nearly went under in the early 1990s , it took 160 examiners to go over its US commercial real estate portfolio ( and even then then the bodies were deployed against dodgy deals in Texas and the Southwest ) .
This is a garbage in , garbage out exercise .
The banks used their own risk models to make the assessment , for instance , the very same risk models that caused this mess .
And there was no examination of the underlying loan files .
The Times story does slip in some shreds of doubt , but a casual reader is likely to read past them .
Consider these statements :
Regulators say all 19 banks undergoing the exams will pass them .
Indeed , they say this is a test that a bank simply will not fail : if the examiners determine that a bank needs “ exceptional assistance , ” the government , that is , taxpayers , will provide it …
Regulators recognize that for the tests to be credible , not all of the banks can be winners .
And it is becoming increasingly clear , industry insiders say , that the government will use its findings to press certain banks to sell troubled assets .
The hope is that by cleansing their balance sheets , banks will be able to lure private capital , stabilizing the entire industry .
Yves here .
So did you get that ?
They all will be declared to pass in some form , no matter how dreadful they really are ( if the remedy is putting in more Federal dollars , rather than a receivership , then the fiction that the money is not being wasted must be preserved ) .
But so as to look sufficiently tough , some banks will be treated harshly .
If it winds up being , say , Fifth Third ( which I am told by John Hempton is a very well run bank , publishes much more honest financials than its peers , but is in simply terrible geographies , Michigan , Ohio. Florida ) and not Citi , then we know the process is not just hopelessly politicized , but shamelessly so .
Back to the article :
The state of the industry will come into sharper focus next week , when big banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase start reporting first - quarter results .
Many analysts predict the reports will show banks are on the mend , with help from low interest rates , fat lending margins , dwindling competition and profits from trading in the financial markets in January and February .
In the last six weeks , financial shares have soared on hopes that the worst for the industry is over .
But some analysts say investors ’ hopes are misplaced .
With the recession , banks are likely to record further large losses on credit cards , corporate loans and real estate .
“ Nothing has changed with the fundamentals , ” said Meredith A. Whitney , a prominent banking analyst who has been bearish on most financial institutions .
Yves here ,
Note the failure to point out that Whitney has been the most accurate in calling bank performance during this downturn .
No , she is instead a mere bear .
And the article also fails to mention that Leon Black , a distressed investor who has long been active in the real estate industry , is forecasting $ 2 trillion in real estate losses .
I doubt the stress tests have that factored in .
Consider the worst case scenario :
The tests , led by the Federal Reserve , rely on a series of computer - generated “ what - if ” projections in the event the economy deteriorates .
Those include unemployment rising to 10.3 percent by next year , home prices falling an additional 22 percent this year , and the economy contracting by 3.3 percent this year and staying flat in 2010 .
Based on the work of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff on financial crises , the expected trajectory for this crisis is for unemployment to peak in the 11 - 12 % range , a fall in GDP of 5 % , with it taking three years after the bottom for growth to return to normal levels , and housing takes over five years to bottom .
And that is the typical trajectory for crisis countries , none of whom faced a backdrop of a global contraction .
Whitney is calling for real estate prices to fall another 30 % .
So the worst case falls short of even likely outcomes , let alone a real disaster .
And the theater continues :
At a recent breakfast with a dozen or so corporate and banking executives in New York , Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner warned he would take a tough stance .
Many banks , he suggested , believe the investments and loans on their books are worth far more than they really are , according to a person who attended the meeting .
Mr. Geithner said that was unacceptable .
The banks , he said , will have to sell these assets at prices investors are willing to pay , and so must be prepared to take further write - downs .
How does one parse tripe like this ?
First , the public private partnership program , aka cash for trash , is voluntary .
Banks are not being compelled to sell .
The idea that the banks “ have to sell ” is a canard .
Second , the gaming of the program has already started ( notice no lecture from Geithner about that ? ) , so there is pretty much no risk that anyone will take a loss on the values they have in their books .
The best summation of how bad this will get is from Rortybomb , who expects all the old Enron tricks to be employed ( notice the terms of the PPIP prohibit the fund managers from gaming the process , not the banks trading among themselves .
You can drive a truck through this oversight .
And the Treasury has remained silent as the banks themselves have been loading up their balance sheets with toxic sludge , paying more than private investors are willing to bid ) .
I ’m sure all the bankers understand full well the massive disconnect between talk and action , and are dutifully following Treasury ’s lead in maintaining appearances .
Lincoln on Race and Slavery edited and with an introduction by Henry Louis Gates Jr. , and coedited by Donald Yacovone Princeton University Press , 343 pp. , $ 24.95
Abraham Lincoln was born into a racist family , in a racist region of our country , during a racist era of our history .
It would have been amazing if he had not begun his life as a racist .
Piety toward his memory suppressed that fact for generations .
Most of us wanted Lincoln to be free of racism , and we read the evidence to arrive at that conclusion .
No one wanted that more than blacks .
Henry Louis Gates , the Harvard professor , notes that blacks — from Booker T. Washington to Ralph Ellison — did even more than whites to enshrine Lincoln as “ the American philosopher - king and patron saint of race relations . ”
Gates writes of himself ( born 1950 ) , “ Like most African Americans of my generation , I was raised to believe that Lincoln hated slavery because he loved the slaves . ”
Black freedmen raised $ 17,000 for the 1876 statue of Lincoln freeing the slaves that stands in Lincoln Park , Washington .
But historians no longer give Lincoln a pass on the subject of racism , and some of his harshest critics have been blacks — especially Ebony editor Lerone Bennett .1
A less blanket judgment has been reached by other historians .
The compromise position is that Lincoln started out as a racist , using the word “ nigger , ” telling coon jokes , and enjoying minstrel shows , but he became less and less racist , ending up almost entirely free of prejudice by his death — though he could still address Sojourner Truth in 1864 as “ Auntie . ”
Gates thinks that this quantitative approach — how much racism did Lincoln exhibit at any time ? — should be replaced by a qualitative question :
What kinds of racism are at issue ?
He sifts the record skillfully and finds that there are three strands to Lincoln ’s thinking about race .
( 1 ) There is opposition to slavery , which could ( but need not ) free him from racism .
( 2 ) There is the belief that blacks are inferior to whites in intelligence and “ civilization . ”
( 3 ) There is the belief that blacks must be kept apart from whites , so far as that is legally and logistically possible , which is usually but not necessarily a racist position ( some blacks held it ) .
These three points of view jostled along together through Lincoln ’s life , sometimes tugging against each other , sometimes reinforcing each other .
After Gates ’s long opening essay , all of Lincoln ’s statements on slavery are published in the book here edited , with brief introductions to each selection by Donald Yacovone , illustrating the three themes Gates isolated .
1 .
Slavery
Lincoln always held that slavery is wrong ( though a wrong perhaps not remediable in the foreseeable future ) .
Opposition to slavery does not of itself clear anyone from the charge of racism .
Many abolitionists felt that people should not be held as property , without thinking that blacks are ( or should be ) equal to whites .
Henry Adams , though proud of his family ’s record in opposing slavery , held that …

Strangely absent from the recent coverage of Pelosi ’s past knowledge of U.S. torture policies is any acknowledgement that this story is old news .
Really old news .
Way back in December , 2007 , the Washington Post ran a piece headlined , “ Hill Briefed on Waterboarding in 2002 . ”
It hit Pelosi with the exact same allegations that have been so breathlessly reported as of late :
In September 2002 , four members of Congress met in secret for a first look at a unique CIA program designed to wring vital information from reticent terrorism suspects in U.S. custody .
For more than an hour , the bipartisan group , which included current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , was given a virtual tour of the CIA ’s overseas detention sites and the harsh techniques interrogators had devised to try to make their prisoners talk .
So what ’s new ?
For one , Republicans are under intense moral and political threat and see a chance divert responsibility for their misdeeds back to Democrats .
To be sure , Pelosi should have taken action against U.S. torture policies as soon as she was briefed on them .
And she ’s now paying the price for being too politically cowardly — or opportunistic — to address this issue head - on when the Post broke the story back in 2007 .
But it ’s disingenuous for the press and Pelosi ’s political rivals to feign outrage over what Pelosi knew and when .
What did they know and when ?
Assuming they read the news , why did n’t they make an issue of this back in 2007 ?
One politician did make an issue of the Post story at the time .
Cindy Sheehan , the Peace Mom , ran a quixotic campaign against Pelosi for her House seat last year , and garnered 16 percent of the vote and very little press .
Key to her electoral strategy was capitalizing on liberal outrage — surprisingly tepid outrage , it turned out — over what Pelosi knew .
She even called for Pelosi to be stripped of her leadership post over the news .
“ I was appalled and really saddened , ” Sheehan told me at the time .
“ We ca n’t be represented by a person like this . ”
Seventy two percent of San Francisco voters thought otherwise .
With Sheehan ’s failed challenge in mind , it ’s hard to put credence in today ’s New York Times story on Pelosi ’s political fate , which quotes Bay Area resident Delphine Langille of San Ramon : “ I ’m very skeptical of what she ’s saying , Langille told the Times on the steps of San Francisco City Hall , “ and when she goes to get re-elected , this could really damage her credibility . ”
Yeah right .
There ’s simply no way a Republican could ever mount a viable challenge in San Francisco , no way the Democratic establishment would ever try , and no way–as we ’ve seen –that a third party outsider will take her down .
Politics is morally mushy business .
The political climate was clearly more pro-torture back in 2002 than it is now .
A braver politician might have spoken out sooner , but also might not have risen to the Speaker post .
The interesting thing about San Franciscans is that they are politically sophisticated enough to entertain a race like Sheehan ’s while also voting for a pragmatist like Pelosi .
And they can certainly distinguish between the moral clarity — or absolutism — of someone like Sheehan , and the immoral opportunism of liberal - come- lately Republicans .
Let ’s hope the press and the rest of the nation eventually figure this out too .

A " Child - robot with Biomimetic Body " or CB2 , follows an object with his eyes at a laboratory in Osaka University
The creators of the Child - robot with Biomimetic Body , or CB2 , say it 's slowly developing social skills by interacting with humans and watching their facial expressions , mimicking a mother - baby relationship .
A bald , child - like creature dangles its legs from a chair as its shoulders rise and fall with rythmic breathing and its black eyes follow movements across the room .
It 's not human -- but it is paying attention .
Below the soft silicon skin of one of Japan 's most sophisticated robots , processors record and evaluate information .
The 130 - cm ( four - foot , four - inch ) humanoid is designed to learn just like a human infant .
" Babies and infants have very , very limited programmes .
But they have room to learn more , " said Osaka University professor Minoru Asada , as his team 's 33 kilogram ( 73 pound ) invention kept its eyes glued to him .
The team is trying to teach the pint - sized android to think like a baby who evaluates its mother 's countless facial expressions and " clusters " them into basic categories , such as happiness and sadness .
Asada 's project brings together robotics engineers , brain specialists , psychologists and other experts , and is supported by the state - funded Japan Science and Technology Agency .
With 197 film - like pressure sensors under its light grey rubbery skin , CB2 can also recognise human touch , such as stroking of its head .
The robot can record emotional expressions using eye - cameras , then memorise and match them with physical sensations , and cluster them on its circuit boards , said Asada .
The professor , also a member of the Japanese Society of Baby Science , said his team has made progress on other fronts since first presenting CB2 to the world in 2007 .
In the two years since then , he said , CB2 has taught itself how to walk with the aid of a human and can now move its body through a room quite smoothly , using 51 " muscles " driven by air pressure .
In coming decades , Asada expects science will come up with a " robo species " that has learning abilities somewhere between those of a human and other primate species such as the chimpanzee .
And he hopes that this little CB2 may lead the way into this brave new world , with the goal to have the robo - kid speaking in basic sentences within about two years , matching the intelligence of a two - year - old child .
By 2050 , Asada wants a robotic team of football players to be able take on the human World Cup champions -- and win .
Welcome to the cutting edge of robotics and artificial intelligence .
More than a decade since automaker Honda stunned the world with a walking humanoid P2 , a forerunner to the popular ASIMO , robotics has come a long way .
Researchers across Japan have unveiled increasingly sophisticated robots with different functions -- including a talking office receptionist , a security guard and even a primary school teacher .
Electronics giant Toshiba is developing a new model of domestic helper , AppriAttenda , which moves on wheels and can fetch containers from a refrigerator with its two arms -- a potentially lucratic invention in fast - aging Japan .
" We aim to make a robot that elderly people can count on when living alone , " said Takashi Yoshimi , a senior research scientist at a Toshiba laboratory in Kawasaki city south of Tokyo .
Last month also saw the debut of Japan 's first robotic fashion model , cybernetic human HRP - 4C , which can strut a catwalk , smile and pout thanks to 42 motion motors programmed to mimic flesh - and - blood models .
Its makers at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology outside Tokyo plan to sell the 158 - centimetre fashion - bots for around 200,000 dollars each .
Thousands of humanoids could be working alongside humans in a decade or so , if that is what society wants , said Fumio Miyazaki , engineering science professor at the Toyonaka Campus of Osaka University .
If the world is ready for a functioning robot secretary , for example , there is " no need for a major technical breakthrough , " he said .
A Tokyo subsidiary of Hello Kitty maker Sanrio , Kokoro -- which means heart or mind in Japanese -- has also produced advanced talking , life - size humanoids .
" Robots have hearts , " said Kokoro planning department manager Yuko Yokota .
" They do n't look human unless we put souls in them .
" When manufacturing a robot , there comes a moment when light flickers in its eyes .
That 's when we know our work is done . "
Public opinion in Japan may be more open to robots than in the West , where dark science fiction visions from movies such as " Bladerunner " and " Terminator " have conjured images of robo - soldiers taking over the world .
Thanks to such benign cartoon characters as Astro Boy , " Japanese people have a friendly image towards robots , " said Toshiba 's Yoshimi .
Asada said Japan 's indigenous animistic belief system may also have readied people to accept human - like robots with minds of their own .
" Everything has a mind -- the mind of the lamp , the mind of the chair , the soul of the desk , " he said , pointing at objects in his office .
" Therefore the machines should have their mind too .
If we proceed in this study , machines may have something like a human mind or ' robo - mind ' , " he said .

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office must be commended for its decision to cancel renting premises for the UK embassy in Tel Aviv from the company Africa - Israel , owned by Israeli businessman and settlement builder Lev Leviev .
This is an encouraging step that should now be backed by stronger sanctions against the building of the separation wall and the building of illegal settlements by Israel .
Furthermore , the governments of Norway and Dubai should emulate the example set by the UK and sever their relationships with Leviev 's companies .
The Israeli paper Ha'aretz reported on 3 March 2009 that " Due to the public pressure " several months ago in a special debate in parliament , Kim Howells of the Foreign Office was asked to explain plans to rent the embassy from Leviev .
This pressure , by a letters campaign to the FCO , was initiated by Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine with human rights organisation Adalah - New York , followed by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign , Noam Chomsky , Norman Finkelstein , former BBC correspondent Tim Llewellyn and hundreds of others .
Further voices included Daniel Machover of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights , Palestinian notables including Hanan Ashrawi , Mustafa Barghouti and Luisa Morgantini , vice president of the European parliament .
The move was frozen after ambassador Tom Phillips requested details from Africa - Israel about its activities in the settlements .
Subsequently , on 5 March , the BBC reported the FCO 's Karen Kaufman saying that : " We looked into the issue of Africa - Israel and settlements and settlement holdings and we asked for clarification ....
The UK government has always regarded settlements as illegal , but what has happened in recent months is that we are looking for ways to make a difference on this issue . "
Still , despite the FCO decision , Leviev 's companies persist in their goal , backed by the Land Redemption Fund to which Leviev is one the largest donors , of " blurring the Green Line " and connecting the illegally built Zufim settlement with Israeli communities inside the Green Line , retaining 6,000 dunams of the village Jayyous 's land sequestered by the wall .
This land grab is being facilitated by the enforced construction of the apartheid wall , which the International Court of Justice firmly judged to be illegal under international law in 2004 , and demanded its removal .
There are weekly non-violent protests by the Jayyous villagers , Israeli and international peace groups , together with Bil 'in to stop their precious land from being taken to expand settlements and build the wall .
These are being suppressed by Israeli forces on a terror rampage with live fire , beatings , tear gassings , mass arrests , house occupations and , more recently , threats of home demolitions , and pogroms .
Following an Israeli supreme court ruling that the route of the wall in Jayyous should be moved slightly , Israeli authorities are trying to blackmail Jayyous 's mayor , saying if he does n't accept the new wall route , there will be no gates in it for the village 's farmers to access their lands .
The mayor has refused to sign .
Without international intervention , Jayyous will not be able to hold on to its lands behind the wall , which contain their four vital agricultural wells and most of their greenhouses .
Leviev will then be able to freely expand Zufim on to Jayyous 's stolen lands .
Currently , Leviev is building 35 new housing units in Zufim .
At Bil'in , where Leviev companies are also building settlements , mainstream media failed to cover the 17 April murder of Bil 'in non-violent protester Bassem Abu Rahmeh , 29 , by Israeli forces .
A soldier shot him with the same new type of " rocket " tear gas round , as fast and lethal as live ammunition that left US activist Tristan Anderson in critical condition .
The brutal crackdown in Bil 'in continues despite three Israeli supreme court orders to move the wall in Bil 'in closer to the Matityahu East settlement " outpost " where Leviev 's Danya Cebus built about 30 % of the units .
Israel 's court has shown itself to be the accessory of this land grab .
Israel 's architects , designing these settlements , are also in breach of professional ethics , and will be held to account by their international peers .
While the US , UK and the EU seem to be keen to join Israel , the perpetrator of war crimes , in boycotting the Palestinians who are the victims of crippling sieges , deadly incursions and a prison - like occupation , they are reluctant to take any positive action to stop Israel 's breaches of international law .
For instance , the Norwegian government has invested € 875 m in 2008 in Africa - Israel .
By investing its populace 's pension fund in a company at the heart of illegal Israeli settlement building , the country that sponsored the Oslo accords violates its spirit .
Norway should follow the precedent set by the UK's FCO , in one of the latter 's few bold moves , and divest from this company .
The United Arab Emirates is also shamefully equivocating after a year - long campaign against Leviev selling his diamonds in the emirate of Dubai .
Dubai 's government , despite repeated assurances that Leviev would not be allowed to open two diamond boutiques in the emirate , has allowed Leviev to open stores under another name while his website advertises a Leviev store - in - store at one of the " Levant " shops of his Dubai partner , Arif bin Khadra .
A second Levant store in Dubai's Atlantis hotel boldly touts the Leviev brand .
If Dubai does not wish to be become known as the " emirate that supports settlements " , it should take immediate action , and follow the UK's lead and demonstrate it will not allow Leviev to profit from this indirect funding of his settlement building , that steals the future of Jayyous 's children who are growing up in the shadow of Leviev 's ever - expanding Zufim settlement .
While the new Netanyahu / Leiberman government is doing all it can to obfuscate the issue of a proper peace settlement to establish a viable Palestinian state , a clear message must be sent to Israel .
The sanctions against Leviev should be the start of a wider boycott of all who profit from the enforced acquisition of Palestinian land .
Saving rain water seems like a giant undertaking .
But visit with Doreen Pollack from Down 2 Earth Gardens and it may become a a little less daunting .
In fact , for her , it 's kind of a game , here 's what she did .
First , she observed .
Just watched the rain to see where it fell .
Then she bought barrels , tubing and netting at the hardware store .
It did n't cost much , but more on that later .
Then Doreen got to work !
The observation she conducted earlier gave her the knowledge of where to put the barrels exactly .
She affixed those 55 gallon barrels with netting over the top so as to eliminate the possibility of mosquitoes or bugs breeding in the water .
She also provided the barrels with an overflow outlet ( a hole that led to another barrel ) .
Next , she attached tubes to rain gutters on top of her house .
The tubes led directly to specific areas Doreen wanted to water .
She also created , what she likes to call , a " rain diversion patio . "
Really , it 's a brick patio with a slant .
It 's located at the edge of her porch , which is attached to her house .
The rain used to run off of the roof and erode the soil below .
Now , she hopes to guide it to where she wants it via that slant .
" Where she wants it , " by the way , is a mulch pit that is in her front yard .
She made the pit so that rain would be directed to accumulate there .
She has plans to plant trees that could utilize that water well .
Doreen has all these systems in place since it really pays off .
She has seen her municipal water bill go down .
Why ?
" With my roof line I can capture 600 gallons of water in 1 inch of rain and I 've done that by calculating the water shed on my hard surface . "
Doreen uses that water within 2 to 3 weeks .
It does n't go towards her edible garden , but a hose is attached to the barrels and she usually uses it to water nearby plants .
Seem like a lot of work ?
Doreen confirms it is .
But to her , it 's worth it .
She saves money , the earth and has fun doing it .
But there is help out there .
The Phoenix Permaculture Society has a class on the subject the first Sunday of every month .
For about $ 60 , students can take the class and walk away with their own barrels .
For more information go to www.phoenixpermaculture.org
Finally , how much does all of this cost ?
Not a lot , according to Doreen .
She found all of her supplies at her local hardware store and through recyclables and paid a couple hundred dollars when all was said and done .
She also found that the Arizona Department of Revenue will help with some of that .
They will give back 25 % of the cost to do this , up to $ 1,000 .
The only caveat , the water needs to be captured , kept and re-used for it to apply .
The rain water can not be " stored " in the ground .
Just save those receipts !

I ’ve been trying out some really obscure microgames on Nintendo DS lately .
There ’s “ Dog Drool , ” where the goal is to get a dog named Otis to drool over a plate of curry by tapping on the screen .
Then there ’s “ Escape ! ” where Otis has to jump over a fence without falling into a garbage can .
They probably sound lame , but even if they are , I honestly can’t tell — because I wrote them myself .
The five - second microgames that make up the titles in Nintendo ’s Wario Ware series are an addictive dose of instant gratification gaming .
The latest in the series , Made in Ore , makes creating your own games just as engaging and rewarding as playing them .
It was n’t long before I found myself addicted in a way that I do n’t often feel with videogames these days .
Preparing for this review , I could n’t stop thinking about what kind of game I was going to create next .
And I ’ve only scratched the surface , since Made in Ore lets you create and share not only games , but also music files and four - panel manga .
User generated content is all the rage these days , and why not ?
Participation is the essence of play , and franchises as diverse as Dungeons and Dragons to The Sims to the minimalist Line Rider have flourished by getting the customers to do most of the work .
But creating great user creation tools is hard .
Even when the opportunity is offered in a tantalizing package , I rarely bite .
For example , as easy as it was to start designing an action game with LittleBigPlanet , I was n’t about to invest days and weeks creating levels .
Ditto Spore ‘s lauded creature creator .
The big advantage Made in Ore has over rivals in this genre is its simplicity and quick development cycle .
You can create a decent Wario - style game that takes five to 10 seconds to play with just a few hours ’ work .
It turns out that ’s just about what I ’m willing to spend to create my own videogame .
Made in Ore is the seventh game that Nintendo has released in the Wario Ware series , which debuted on the Game Boy Advance in 2003 .
That first game was a radical new idea :
It was composed of more than 100 different microgames that took five seconds each to play .
After seven nearly identical titles , the series had gotten a bit old .
But Made in Ore ( Ore means me in Japanese ) injects a much - needed dose of innovation .
The game introduces game - design concepts and tools at a pace that wo n’t intimidate or bore you .
Made in
Ore wo n’t even let you get into the game - creation tool when you first boot it up .
Instead , you can either play the many , many sample games that are included on the cartridge , or visit the game factory and do some “ part - time jobs . ”
These are sample games that are mostly finished , save for a single bit of design that needs doing .
In the first minigame , “ Wario Quest , ” you ’re asked to enter the game ’s painting mode and draw an enemy character .
Once you ’re done , you ’ll be able to play the game back and attack the enemy that you just drew .
It ’s an instant introduction to how much fun it can be to create your own artwork , then see it come to life in a game .
Once you ’ve explored a bit of what Made in Ore has to offer , you can play a tutorial that walks you through the creation of a complete game .
You ’ll start out by doing the easy , non-interactive stuff — coming up with a title , drawing a game ’s background graphics .
The next step is to start drawing characters .
Made in
Ore uses a type of object - oriented design — the first thing you do is create the objects and things that you ’ll interact with in your game , and then you define what each one of them does .
Each object that you create can have up to four different visual states , and each state can have up to four frames of animation .
You can copy frames , then edit them to make sure the animation matches up .
You can also take one frame and overlay it onto another as a transparency , letting you trace over your work .
Once you ’ve got the objects drawn and animated , the real work begins .
Jumping into the “ AI ” mode , you ’ll see your background and your list of objects .
You can now start placing them into the game .
As soon as you decide which one you want to put into the field of view first , the real genius of Made in Ore reveals itself .
You do n’t just start plunking down objects .
Before you place something into the game , the creator starts walking you through a step - by - step process , using plain language , asking you what you want this thing to do .
In the games I created ( see the video above ) , I used my friends ’ dog Otis as the main character .
The second game in that video shows
Otis drooling onto a plate of curry .
Since the only way to interact with the game world is by tapping the Nintendo DS ’ touchscreen , I decided the goal of my game would be to tap Otis ’ strand of drool and release it all over the curry .
Made in
Ore uses easy - to - follow steps to lead the game creator , making the process very accessible even to non-programmers .
To use programmer - speak , you do n’t need to comment your code , because Made in Ore ‘s code is one big comment .
It ’s in plain language .
This not only helps in the writing , it helps when you ’re trying to free your game of bugs and unintended side effects .
While my first effort did n’t have much in the way of gameplay , I was very quickly stringing together more complicated series of programmed objects , all of which worked together in precise ways .
In the “ Escape ! ” game in the video above — which I started on the bus to the Wired.com office and finished that afternoon —
Otis has to jump over the fence to escape , but he can also accidentally fall into the trash can , which opens and closes at random times during the game .
Besides the three objects that you can see , there are four invisible “ sensors ” that I placed around the stage to let the program know where Otis is at any given time .
Made in Ore ‘s one major flaw is that it does n’t have simple tools for sharing what you ’ve made with the world .
LittleBigPlanet and Spore allow you to upload creations to the game ’s servers .
Made in
Ore does n’t allow that — you can trade games in person with other players , or send them online to your friends , but there ’s no one - stop shop for new games .
Nintendo does offer a WiiWare game for about $ 8 called Asobu !
Made in
Ore that allows you to upload games from your DS and play them on your television screen .
( Asobu means play in Japanese . )
You can also use Wii to access the online store .
Games like LittleBigPlanet offer more detail and ultimately more control of the world you can design .
But few can match Made in Ore for its versatility , and speed to market .
It is designed to let you come up with a wacky concept in the morning and have it running that afternoon .
And that ’s the killer app when it comes to custom game tools for amateurs like me .

British law enforcement agents are quietly working with European counterparts on changes to national legislation that will allow them to share intelligence gained by hacking into suspects '
PCs .
Sharon Lemon , director of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency 's ( SOCA ) e-crime unit , told The Register data laws in some EU countries make it impossible for investigators to obtain and pool data covertly .
The desired change could mean law enforcement officers in eastern Europe could ask SOCA to hack into a suspect 's PC for them and share the data .
SOCA said its hacking activities are always within the law .
Lemon refused to be drawn on the specifics of the techniques the agency uses .
" As our suspects use ever more sophisticated techniques , so do we , " she said .
The SOCA e- crime unit 's remit has a strong emphasis on international offending .
Lemon said it was vital that use of " remote search " techniques - as hacking is known in law enforcement circles - was extended throughout the EU .
A working group coordinated by Europol , the EU police agency , is examining what legal changes might be required .
In a statement , SOCA said : " From a UK perspective , SOCA use a range of tools and techniques within , but to the full extent of available legal frameworks as required appropriate to each investigation , SOCA does not comment on the detailed use of individual technical tactical options . "
UK law already allows for senior law enforcement officers to authorise hacking in the course of an investigation , under the Police Act 1997 .
According to the Surveillance Commissioner 's annual report , in 2007 / 08 a total of 205 approvals to carry out " remote searches " were granted , up from 188 the previous year .
SOCA is keen for access to intelligence from hacking by foreign law enforcement because of the highly internationalised character of organised crime .
" The working group aims to identify best practise , harmonise approaches and deliver an EU consensus on the issues , " it said .
" The result will be advice to decision makers / law makers at EU level to provide law enforcement with powers . "
The working group 's activities follow news at the end of last year that Jacqui Smith had signed the UK up to an EU agreement in principle to step up use of remote searches .
SOCA 's remit covers drug and people trafficking , fraud and international e-crime .
It also manages communications intercept operations for regional police forces .
The agency is closely involved with the government 's Interception Modernisation Programme , which aims to increase the ability of law enforcement and the intelligence agencies to monitor the internet .
SOCA is apparently pushing that agenda at EU level too .
The Europol working group is also considering the use of VoIP and web - based communications by organised criminals .
" The aim of the working group is to address all the negative aspects , from a law enforcement perspective , resulting from the developments within communication technology , " SOCA said . ®
I recently started using Git for my local revision control .
Since I spend about 90 % of my coding time inside the Vim editor , I went looking for a plugin that would make Vim play nice with Git .
In this article I present two different vim plugins and explore their feature - set via screenshots .
My expectations from a git plugin were rather simple .
Display the active git branch of current file .
Switch between different branches , without quitting Vim .
Multi-platform support .
I found two competing plugins that satisfied my needs : git-branch - info.vim and git.vim .
This plugin was designed to display the current branch info in the vim status line .
set laststatus=2 " Enables the status line at the bottom of Vim set statusline= % {GitBranchInfoString ( ) }
In addition to the current branch info , it can also list all the branches in the current git repo through a menu ( only in gVim ) and allows to checkout / fetch a particular branch .
One caveat of this plugin is it ’s designed with a Linux user in mind and it did n’t work in windows in its original form .
Since it was project hosted on Github , I decided to fork it and make a windows version of the plugin .
The windows version can be downloaded from the project ’s windows fork .
Git.vim is a more comprehensive plugin that allows the user to perform a lot more Git operations from within the Vim environment .
The github home page for this plugin has a list of all the functionalities available through this plugin .
The name of the function called to set the status line is GitBranch ( ) .
So the lines added to .vimrc will be ,
set laststatus =2 set statusline= % {GitBranch ( ) }
But unfortunately there is a bug in the GitBranch ( ) function .
Once again Github to the rescue , the project is forked and the bug fixed fork can be downloaded here .
A pull request is submitted to the author to fix this bug .
Some of the other features of this plugin are showcased below .
This plugin comes with syntax files that hightlights the git log , git diff and git commit messages .
The syntax highlighting can be seen in the screenshots shown below .
GitCommit
: GitCommit opens a split window to enter the log message and commits the current file to the repository .
If no files are staged to the index , it will automatically use git commit - a option to stage all the changed files and commit them to the repository .
GitDiff
: GitDiff opens a split window with the output of the git diff command on the current file .
GitLog
: GitLog to show the commit log of the current file .
GitBlame
: GitBlame Shows the changes made to a file on a line - by - line basis , by displaying the name of the user next to each line in a vertical split .

In the Montessori classroom we have a LOT going on .
Twenty - four kids are doing individual and group activities , the head teacher is demonstrating activities , and the assistant teacher is available to help kids when they need a hand .
So , when it comes to serving snack , the more the kids can help themselves , the better .
This is true at home too .
I mean , how many times have you been happily folding a load of laundry when your three year old whines , “ Mommy , I ’m huuuunnggrryyy . ”
Here ’s the solution !
If you put out the necessary ingredients for a healthy snack on a child - sized table at say 9 am every morning ( or at 3 pm if your kids are more hungry in the afternoon ) your children can serve themselves whenever they ’re hungry .
This promotes independence while ensuring that your kids are eating a nutritious snack AND you do n’t have to get up from your own work to serve them .
Here are some snacks that I ’ve seen work well for 3 , 4 , and 5 year olds :
Cheese and crackers Peanut or other nut butters with crackers “ Ants on a log ” Celery with peanut butter and raisins Carrot sticks with dip Apples - you can provide a whole apple with an apple slicer or slice the apple for your child .
Granola Rice and beans w/ salsa
Rice with soy sauce Cucumber slices Fruit salad Strawberries and shortcake
The trick is to set up the snack in a pleasing way providing everything they ’ll need to grab a plate and napkin , serve themselves , sit down an eat , and then clean up after themselves .
You may also want to include cups and a small pitcher of water , milk , or juice .
So , for granola for instance , I would put a few cups of granola in a bowl and provide a spoon or measuring cup to scoop the granola into their own bowl .
I might even provide a small pitcher of milk and some spoons so they can eat it like cereal .
If you have a few children and you do n’t want one kid to eat all of the snack you ’ve provided , make a sign with words ( for readers ) or pictures ( for pre-readers ) indicating how much to take .
So for apple slices you might draw three apple slices and 3 crackers and ask each child to take just three slices and three crackers .
This not only ensures that everyone gets their share , it also promotes responsibility and community mindedness .
And if anyone takes more than their allotted snack , you ’re sure to hear about it .
The other benefit to choosing a single snack for the day and making it accessible is that you do n’t have to make a different snack for each child .
I know you ’ve been there .
You ’ve just finished cutting a pear for your 18 month old and your 3 year old comes running in saying - “ Mommy , can I have pizza for snack ? ”
If there ’s just one snack each day , kids can easily fall into the routine of accepting what ’s offered .
I would love to hear about how you do snack time at your house and whether you think providing snacks in this way would free you up to do other things .

He ’s definitely working the crowd , allowing them to sing along .
( Also , the glasses make him look quite fetching ! )
And there ’s more from the evening –after the jump , Rick shows off his falsetto with a performance of “ 9 To 5 , ” and peeves someone else in attendance with his need for multiple star turns !
Apparently Rick was ready to roll every performer who dared near the mic , as evidenced by this little rant on the ride home by someone whose sister ’s performance of “ Song 2 ” got interrupted !
Warning : the word “ douchebag ” is uttered a lot .
See , everyone ?
Even Rick Astley can seem like a jerk when he tries to hog the microphone at the karaoke benefit .
Sure , a blog post on the evening notes that he ’s welcome back anytime , but I think that if he was n’t famous , that would n’t be the case .

I never knew that Diamonds cost so much more than mere moolah !
What this movie told me was – that the real color of Diamonds , Oil , Gold etc is always red .
In the movie the guy – Solomon Vandi ( African ) said that the soil attained the red color in Africa because of the perpetual bloodshed in the continent .
The story is set in Seirra Leone ( on the west coast of Africa ) .
What looks like a routine Civil War – ( Post Independence in an ex-colony – read imperialzed nation ) ; is anything but Civil .
There is the RUF – as they call themselves : a radical group which is funded by western powers , in terms of weapons < now you should see Lord Of War and this movie back to back – but guns are not the subject here > .
Entire villages are burnt down by this RUF , so as to get their ‘ Support ’ .
The movie also brings into focus , what motivation techniques terrorist leaders employ to make their little “ Masters of Disaster ” .
Drugs , Sex and Power .
Carefully crafted imagery of the ‘ Good Life ’ is enough to trick poor , desperate youngsters , who have lost their families .
Lost Everything .
Brainwashing is their weapon of choice .
There is a scene in the movie , where an African Teacher is explaining how imperialists cut off hands of the slaves .. hundreds of them .
It is my personal belief that wherever there is overzealousness , wherever there is greed for power ; there things are bound to go wrong .
Now there is a new form of imperialism .
Economic .
Diamonds / Gold , oil , nuclear raw material .
What we are witnessing today is rise of economic imperialism .
If I had to choose between Open War between nations and these silently - funded - hidden - discreetly provoked - genocide a.k.a “ Civil ” war , i would choose the former .
Dont get me wrong , I am not FOR war and bloodshed , but it is just that this other kind of hidden war has possibly longer lasting consequences .
Be it economic or otherwise .
Enter Di-Caprio .
How do i describe his character ?
Well , I think it is right to call him a conflict profiteer with a heart .
A man on a hunt for the 100 Karat diamond which Solomon Vandi found .
Enter Jennifer Connelly , a journalist .
LOL .
A fellow journalist in the movie calls her a ‘ Heat Seeking Missile ” .
Her character is this woman who wants to make a difference .
She is not the “ Pseudo - I - want - to - make - a - difference - , now can i have my Pulitzer ? ” kind of woman .
Yes , she has a way with words .
Not tabloid ; stupid , politician influenced media .
I am going to digress a little bit , so bear with me .
Look at 9/11 .
A false flag attack on your own country !
Anyways , this ‘ Danny Boy ’ Caprio , smuggles diamonds from Seirra Leone to Liberia .
As a result Seirra Leone does not report any diamond exports .
But ground reality is , people are killed and enslaved in this mania for diamonds .
AS per the movie any Government Entity that comes close to this trade can be either bought , destroyed or blackmailed .
I dont know if the actual condition has improved or is still the same .
But as they say all art has a small part inspired from reality however nanoscopic it might be .
There is a very touching scene when this simple fisherman ( Solomon Vandi ) from Seirra Leone comes to London .
He stops in front of a jewellery store to notice a beautiful diamond necklace .
But im sorry , beauty is supposed to be a relative term 🙂 .
His own son was taken in by the RUF and trained to be a little “ Master of Disaster ” .
Made cold blooded – like a fired bullet .
Yet again i will digress a little bit .
I remember a line from the movie The Lord Of War ; Yuri Orlov , the weapons merchant ( The merchant of death ) said ‘ An AK - 47 is so easy to use , that even children can use it …….
And they do ! ” 🙂
I found it to be quite witty and humourous when i was watching that movie .
After this movie , not so much .
So , it all kind of fits and makes sense somehow .
In an evil way .
But in the end , this War Profiteer dies and gives the ( blood soaked ) diamond to the fisherman and calls up the Journalist .
No one can deny that The War Profiteer and The Journalist were in love .
But at no point in the movie did it ever become “ Filmy ’ - If you know what i mean !
Not once did DiCaprio say he loves her or vice versa .
Quite well made i must say .
The other day i read a statement in the newspaper : Only 20 % of the males born in the year 1923 in Russia , survived the second world war .
So hundereds of thousands of 20 - 24 year olds died fighting .
Fighting for a political cause , crafted by half dead twisted old goons .
Ofcourse it is one ’s duty to defend the nation .
But that is not that point I am making .
I dont know if you get it , but anyway .
I havent really thought about this , well ill write it anyway 🙂 ( Bear with me people ) :
We must decide what we want to work towards in our lifetime .
I accept that I myself do not know , to what purpose / idea / blah , i want my life to lean towards .
Watching so much violence and risk .
I have come to realize that :
Those who risk are closer to achieving the purpose of their lives .
And blessed are those who are not afraid of death .
Take a few risks , live life .
LAS VEGAS ( AP ) — Ethan
Hawke might want to avoid crossing paths with Toby Keith in the near future .
The country star from Oklahoma lit into the actor for an article Hawke wrote in the new issue of Rolling Stone about Kris Kristofferson .
In it , Hawke refers to a blowup Kristofferson had with an unnamed country star back in 2003 that sounds a lot Toby Keith .
But a furious Keith , speaking backstage at the Academy of Country Music Awards , said it was n't true , and added that Hawke did not name him in the story because he did not want to face him later .
" I do n't know Ethan Hawke .
Ethan Hawke wanted to do some kind of superficial Rolling Stone article .
And he did everything he could to make his story the greatest story ever in Rolling Stone , " Keith said .
" And it was a fictitious ( expletive ) lie .
O.K ?
" He did n't even call me by my name .
...
He called Norah Jones , Ray Charles , everybody else by name .
Willie ( Nelson ) , Kris ( Kristofferson ) .
Why did n't he call my name ?
Why did n't he say Toby Keith walked through and said this ( expletive ) ?
Right ?
You know why .
You know why .
You know as good as anybody why .
He did n't want to ( expletive ) deal with the aftermath . "
In the story , Hawke claimed he witnessed the confrontation backstage at Nelson 's tribute concert for his 70th birthday at the Beacon Theatre in New York .
The article does not name Keith but says it was a country singer who " had a monster hit about bombing America 's enemies back into the stone age . "
In 2002 , Keith had the song " Courtesy of the Red , White & Blue ( The Angry American ) " that threatened retribution for the 9/11 attacks .
Hawke said the argument began with the " Star " telling Kristofferson : " None of that lefty ( expletive ) out there tonight , Kris . "
Hawke said Kristofferson then angrily confronted and asked him if he had ever served in the military .
" Have you ever killed another man ?
Huh ?
Have you ever taken another man 's life and then cashed the check your country gave you for doing it ?
No , you have not , so shut the ( expletive ) up , " Hawke recounted Kristofferson as saying .
" You do n't know what the hell you are talking about . "
A spokeswoman for Hawke did not immediately return a message seeking comment .
A Rolling Stone spokeswoman said that the magazine fully stands by the story and Hawke 's reporting .
Keith directed his anger Sunday not only at Hawke but at a reporter from the Tennessean who wrote about the Hawke article and asked Keith about it .
Kristofferson , in a statement , said he did not recall the incident and tried to be diplomatic to all sides .
" I would like to state for the record that I am friends with Ethan Hawke , Toby Keith and Tennessean reporter Peter Cooper .
Although I do not remember the events at Willie 's birthday party as reported in Rolling Stone , what does it matter ? " he asked .
" That was six years ago .
I spoke to Ethan before I put out my statement and thanked him for the beautiful story he wrote for Rolling Stone and I also told him I did not recall the incident at Willie 's birthday party .
This is the last statement I will put out about this nonsense . "

According to the Sky and Telescope blog , NASA ’s Swift satellite captured a faint gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) last Thursday which has smashed the record for the earliest , most distant known object in the universe .
Various ground - based telescopes following up on Swift ’s initial detection of the GRB have measured redshifts of the object , varying from 7.6 to 8.2 .
Whatever the final determination is of how much this GRB ’s afterglow has been redshifted by the expansion of the Universe , it will set a record .
In September 2008 , Swift captured GRB 080913 , the most distant gamma-ray burst ever detected , with a redshift of 6.7 .
Astronomers using the Very Large Telescope in Chile have determined that this current GRB ( 090423 ) went off about 600 million years after the Big Bang .
A GRB comes from the cataclysmic explosion of a massive star , which could signal the birth of a black hole , a collision of two neutron stars or some other unknown phenomenon .
These bursts occur approximately once per day and are brief , but intense , flashes of gamma radiation .
They come from all different directions of the sky and last from a few milliseconds to a few hundred seconds .
Since the Swift satellite was launched in 2004 , it has undoubtedly seen GRBs with even higher redshifts , but many bursts have afterglows so faint that astronomers are unable to determine their redshifts .
The most distant galaxies with well - measured redshifts are in the 6’s .
NASA is supposed to issue a press release with more information later today , and we ’ll provide an update at that time .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Flowers arrived at Capt. Marissa Alexander 's office at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , on June 3 , 2005 .
Arlington 's Section 60 is the final resting place for many casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Her husband , Staff Sgt. Leroy Alexander , was half a world away fighting with the Special Forces in Afghanistan , but he had found a way to send a floral arrangement to his wife , who was five months pregnant with twins .
" He called me and asked me what building I worked in .
He said he had to update some records , " Alexander said .
The flowers lifted her spirits .
But a few hours later , her emotions would be thrown into a tailspin .
Alexander saw two Army officers in dress uniforms knock on her front door .
One of the officers started to talk : " We regret to inform you ... "
If he said any more , Alexander does n't remember .
" The next memory I have is in my kitchen , banging on the floor .
I just could n't believe it , " she said .
The good feelings from flowers delivered a few hours before were gone , replaced by shock , pain and mourning .
A roadside bomb had made her a widow .
Staff Sgt. Alexander now lies in Arlington National Cemetery 's Section 60 , where 500 soldiers , Marines , airmen and sailors who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried .
For years Section 60 has been the one of busiest parts of the cemetery .
Every day new burials bring precision marches , the somber tones of taps and the nerve - rattling three - gun salutes .
Watch how widows connect at Section 60 »
Then there are family and friends who come to the graves to make an emotional connection to their lost loved ones .
Memorial Day weekend brings even more activity and more visitors .
Adults , even some uniformed generals , walk slowly between the rows and rows of headstones , looking for a familiar name .
But small children often seem to find the cemetery a place to explore , even play .
Their smiles and curiosity remind grown - ups that even in a place synonymous with death , life goes on .
A sense of community has emerged in Section 60 .
" I 've come here at times and I 've met people who were paying remembrances to their loved ones .
You become friendly , " Capt .
Alexander said .
" You see each other sometimes and you make a friendship because you know that your loved ones died for the same cause . "
Angie Capra 's husband is buried a few yards from Leroy Alexander .
Air Force Tech Sgt. Anthony Capra was an explosive ordnance disposal expert , killed trying disarm a bomb in Iraq .
" Other widows will come by and put something on there for me if they do n't see me .
They 'll put down flowers .
It 's kind of a community , " Capra said .
More than flowers adorn the graves in Section 60 .
Visitors of all faiths have picked up the ancient Jewish tradition of leaving a small stone on the headstones to show that a visitor had been to the grave .
In most cases these are pebbles found near the grave .
But some people have taken to leaving colored glass beads or elaborately painted stones with shamrocks or words like " hero . "
View images from Section 60 »
Capra recently found a small Yoda figure on her husband 's grave .
She does n't know who left it , but it must have been a friend , because her husband loved " Star Wars . "
" We never know who puts stuff " on the headstone , she said .
Some mementos leave one to wonder about the story behind them .
Like the headstone topped by a tiny bottle of Tabasco hot sauce .
Or a set of dog tags with a name that did n't match the name on the headstone .
Watch how friends say goodbye to a fallen soldier »
There is another topped by a small Lego toy , perhaps left by a child whose father died in a far - off land before they even knew each other .
Or the grave adorned with an empty bottle of Bud Light , a rubber duck and a candle .
Nearby an empty Wild Turkey bottle is the lone addition to the grave of a soldier who died in a country where drinking alcohol is strictly forbidden .
Capra has found a variety of items on Tony 's headstone .
" Coins , lots of rocks , candy .
My husband was a candy freak , " Capra said .
" There was a cross .
A little necklace , Mardi Gras beads during Mardi Gras season .
Anything they have they 'll put on top to show that they are thinking about them at the time . "
Alexander seems to draw strength from the items she finds .
" Someone came and did a picture of Lee , and it was a hand - drawn picture .
I thought that was very interesting , " she said .
" People who have n't been seen in years will leave a note of some sort .
It 's nice to know that you 've been remembered after all of this time .
To know that we have friends who still love and support us , that is just wonderful . "
Section 60 has been called the " saddest acre in America , " and without a doubt sadness abounds .
But so do comfort , support and even an occasional smile .

How can we strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness by making government more transparent , participatory , and collaborative ?
June 26 , 2009 The Open Government Dialogue is now closed .
Because of your participation , this dialogue has generated a rich collection of ideas that will shape the President ’s commitment to making our government more transparent , participatory , and collaborative .
This dialogue represented the first of a three - phase process that is soliciting public input in crafting recommendations on open government .
Summaries of the brainstorming that has occurred here , and of subsequent phases in the process , can be found on the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Blog .
Visit the White House Open Government Initiative website for more information .
The National Academy of Public Administration
On January 21st , the President issued the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government , calling for an unprecedented level of openness in government .
In the memorandum , the President outlined three principles for promoting a transparent and open government : transparency , participation , and collaboration .
Now , the President is calling on you to help shape how that commitment is fulfilled .
This online brainstorming session , open from May 21st to 28th , 2009 , will enable the White House to hear your most important ideas relating to open government .
This platform allows you to submit ideas , discuss and refine others ' ideas , and vote the best ones to the top .
We are seeking innovative approaches to policy , specific project suggestions , government - wide or agency - specific instructions , and any relevant examples and stories relating to law , policy , technology , culture , or practice .
The National Academy of Public Administration , a Congressionally chartered , non-profit , non-partisan institution , is hosting this brainstorming session on behalf of the White House .
The most important themes and ideas to emerge will provide the basis for two more stages of interaction : A Discussion Phase , when we will deepen the conversation about compelling topics raised during the brainstorming , and a Drafting Phase , when we will ask you to use a wiki to draft language for recommendations collaboratively .
Some questions to consider in formulating ideas include :
How might the operations of government be made more transparent and accountable ?
How might federal advisory committees , rulemaking or electronic rulemaking be better used to drive greater expertise into decisionmaking ?
What alternative models exist to improve the quality of decisionmaking and increase opportunities for citizen participation ?
What strategies might be employed to adopt greater use of Web 2.0 in agencies ?
What policy impediments to innovation in government currently exist ?
What is the best way to change the culture of government to embrace collaboration ?
What changes in training or hiring of personnel would enhance innovation ?
What performance measures are necessary to determine the effectiveness of open government policies ?
Please note : On Saturday morning , we made a small change to this site .
Posting , commenting and voting on ideas now requires users to log in .
This change was made in response to concerns that settings that allowed anonymous posting may also have allowed users to vote more than once on the same idea .

So what about California ?
A reader asks .
Ummm , that 's a tough one .
No , wait , it 's not : California is completely , totally , irreparably hosed .
And not a little garden hose .
More like this .
Their outflow is bigger than their inflow .
You can blame Republicans who wo n't pass a budget , or Democrats who spend every single cent of tax money that comes in during the booms , borrow some more , and then act all surprised when revenues , in a totally unprecedented , inexplicable , and unforeseaable chain of events , fall during a recession .
You can blame the initiative process , and the uneducated voters who try to vote themselves rich by picking their own pockets .
Whoever is to blame , the state was bound to go broke one day , and hey , today 's that day !
There is a surprisingly sizeable blogger contingent arguing that we have to bail them out because however regrettable the events that lead here , we now have no choice .
But actually , we do have a choice : we could let them go bankrupt .
And we probably should .
I am not under the illusion that this will be fun .
For starters , the rest of you sitting smugly out there in your snug homes , preparing to enjoy the spectacle , should prepare to enjoy the higher taxes you 're going to pay as a result .
Your states and municipalities will pay higher interest on their bonds if California is allowed to default .
Also , the default is going to result in a great deal of personal misery , more than a little of which is going to end up on the books of Federal unemployment insurance and other such programs .
Boys ' Education
There is now clear evidence of a persisting ‘ gap ’ in the overall academic achievements of boys compared to girls , as the annual GCSE and A - level results published each summer demonstrate .
This gap has widened from about 2 % in 1988/89 ( when GCSEs replaced O - levels ) to over 10 % today , with an even wider gap in literacy amongst some cohorts .
Although girls also under - achieve academically , the great majority of under - achievers are boys .
The Government is aware of the problem , and some initiatives have been put in place , but to date there has been little discernible improvement .
An Australian parliamentary enquiry in 2002 ( 1 ) , where a similar phenomenon exists , suggested that it extends to almost all OECD countries .
Children , both boys and girls , who are at present under - achieving academically , are likely to face life - long socio- economic disadvantage in consequence .
There is increasing anxiety amongst parents and educational authorities over this academic gap and educational standards generally , which affects some ethnic groups more than others .
Research also suggests a relationship with both socio-economic and parental status .
Explanations
Various explanations have been offered to account for the difference in academic achievement between boys and girls .
However , the phenomenon has been only partially explained , since a range of social and cultural changes could apply .
Changes in the methods of teaching and of testing boys and girls possibly contribute .
Another factor could be the widespread lack of male teachers , especially at primary school level .
In England , only about 13 % of teachers at primary schools are male .
The absence of fathers in the home for increasing numbers of boys ( and girls ) serves to compound the disadvantage of a lack of positive role models suffered by these children .
Boys ’ needs
Beyond a certain age , boys respond to the male ethos in sport and also in learning .
It is an important factor in their learning about the positive aspects of masculinity and manhood .
It could be argued therefore , that redressing the present extreme shortage of this male ethos in the great majority of primary schools is an issue of the utmost importance for the welfare and future success of boys and therefore of our whole society , irrespective of academic achievement .
Failure to nurture and provide for the different needs of boys is already producing huge and visible social problems .
It is also a human rights issue .

The next time you get money out at a hole - in - the - wall , cross your fingers that the operating system is fully patched up ; there 's now malware out there which directly targets Windows - based ATMs .
According to anti-virus provider Sophos – via ITWire – code has been discovered for a piece of malware that targets automated teller machines from US manufacturer Diebold , better known for its range of voting machines
The code for the software uses undocumented features to create a virtual ' skimmer ' which is capable of recording card details and personal identification numbers without the user 's knowledge , which suggests that the creator had access to the source code for the ATM .
While this doesn ' tpoint to an inside job , the possibility certainly can't be ruled out .
Sophos believes that the code was intended to be pre-installed by an insider at the factory , and would hold transaction details until a special card was entered into the machine – at which point a nice list of card numbers , PINs , and balances would be printed out for the ne'er - do - well to peruse at his leisure .
It 's also possible that the malware could be installed by someone with access to the ATM 's internal workings – such as the person who refills the supply of money each day .
Sophos 's Graham Cluley – who has been dissecting the code since the company obtained a copy – claims that the malware is designed to “ ” - which should make any unauthorised transactions a little more obvious here in the UK .
So far there has been no official comment from Diebold on the matter .
Starting to think that automating the removal of cash from bank accounts was a bad idea , or would it take proof that the malware is in the wild before you chop up your cash cards ?

Medical Marijuana Bill Advances
By Marcus Gilmer in News on May 28 , 2009 2:20 PM
Photo by Laughing Squid State Bill 1381 , proposed to create the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act , are exhaling in relief today as the bill narrowly passed the state senate yesterday by a vote of 30 - 28 .
According to the Tribune , details of the act :
The program would last three years unless lawmakers renew it .
Patients would be issued registry identification cards by the Illinois Department of Public Health .
They would be limited to possessing six cannabis plants during a 60 - day period , of which no more than three could be mature .
Qualifying ailments include glaucoma , cancer , AIDS and Alzheimer 's disease .
As expected the vote was almost exactly down party lines and the debate grew heated .
Sen . Mike Jacobs ( D - East Moline ) said during debate , " Do you find it at all interesting that people view drugs made by man as better than drugs made by God ?
This is something that someone can drop in their backyard and find relief from , and there 's some of us in this chamber that would prefer Oxycontin , morphine ; would prefer mommy 's little helper , uppers , downers , all - arounders . "
Well , as long as you are n't a 911 dispatcher .
While the bill moves on to the state house , it could be several months before it 's voted on there .
Meanwhile , a similar bill already in the house , HB 2514 , remains stalled .
MGM has green - lit production on the next SG - 1 film , which will star Richard Dean Anderson .
Also : Atlantis movie update .
There ’s finally progress on the third Stargate SG - 1 movie , with news coming out from multiple sources over the last few days that MGM has officially given the film a green light for production .
The movie is expected to film in 2009 — probably in the fall , to avoid too much production overlap with Stargate Universe .
“ I can almost guarantee we are proceeding with the SG - 1 movie this year , ” executive producer Brad Wright told GateWorld in an interview last week .
He said that deals are still being worked out , but he still plans to make it the same Jack O’Neill - centric film he first teased last year .
He said that the Atlantis film is also still in the works , and MGM has every intention of making it .
“ When we start shooting the Stargate SG - 1 movie depends on whether we do the two movies back - to - back , ” Wright elaborated during his on - stage Q&A with executive producer Robert C. Cooper at the Creation convention Sunday .
“ The Stargate SG - 1 movie will probably start shooting in the fall .
I say ‘ probably ’ because there are a lot of deals that have to be finished being put in place before that can actually happen .
That would leave the summer [ of 2010 ] as the release time , roughly around the same as Continuum . ”
Stargate : Continuum debuted on DVD and Blu-ray at the end of July , 2008 .
The new movie is currently being written by Wright and Carl Binder , and will feature Richard Dean Anderson as O’Neill .
“ I had a story idea that really worked with O’Neill , ” Wright told the Vancouver crowd .
“ And it ’s not just his character , by any means .
It ’s a Stargate story that brings O’Neill back in a big way . ”
“ The movie has been green - lit , ” Anderson told his official fan site , RDAnderson.com .
“ There are so few details beyond the ‘ go ahead , ’ but I sat next to Charlie Cohen and across from Brad Wright at dinner two weeks ago ( the cast dinner for the launch of Stargate Universe ) , and just an hour prior to sitting down to mediocre cuisine , Charlie had announced MGM ’s intention to make the next Stargate movie . ”
Producer Joseph Mallozzi reiterated that , although Stargate Universe and the SG - 1 movie are moving forward right now , the studio still has every intention of producing the Stargate Atlantis movie .
He and writing partner Paul Mullie are writing the script for that project , and hope to have the first draft done by the end of April .
“ No firm production dates for either movies , ” Mallozzi said , “ but if I was a betting man , I ’d be looking at this fall . ”

Tomato Fight in China
Inspired by La Tomatina Festival in Bunol , Spain , about 10,000 people of Dongguan , southern Guangdong province , China , organized their own tomato fight on October 19 .
Over 15 tons of tomatoes were used in this over - sized food fight and this led to a huge controversy both online and in the national media .
People were baffled when they saw so much good food go to waste for a few hours of entertainent , in a country where some people are still starving .
Hooray for the Chinese , for they have developed a super cool new anti-ship ballistic missile with low radar signature and unpredictable flight path which can destroy US Navy Supercarriers on one go !
Oh , wait .
Advertisement
According to the latest intelligence report , the new missile — a modified Dong Feng 21 — can strick carriers or any other warship within a 2,000 kilometer range from its launching point .
The new super - weapon carries a warhead powerful enough to sink a supercarrier in a single strike , travelling at mach 10 ( ten times the speed of sound ) , which enables it to reach the maximum range target in less than 12 minutes .
Even worse : its combination of a complex guidance system and high maneuverability makes it almost impossible to intercept .
Let 's hope that the US Navy admirals are good at playing Battleships .

We know that average sea levels have risen over the past century , and that global warming is to blame .
But what is climate change doing to the saltiness , or salinity , of our oceans ?
This is an important question because big shifts in salinity could be a warning that more severe droughts and floods are on their way , or even that global warming is speeding up .
Now , new research coming out of the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) suggests that the amount of salt in seawater is varying in direct response to man-made climate change .
Working with colleagues to sift through data collected over the past 50 years , Peter Stott , head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office in Exeter , England , studied whether or not human - induced climate change could be responsible for rises in salinity that have been recorded in the subtropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean , areas at latitudes immediately north and south of Earth ’s tropics .
By comparing the data to climate models that correct for naturally occurring salinity variations in the ocean , Stott has found that man-made global warming -- over and above any possible natural sources of global warming , such as carbon dioxide given off by volcanoes or increases in the heat output of the sun -- may be responsible for making parts of the North Atlantic Ocean more salty .
Salinity levels are important for two reasons .
First , along with temperature , they directly affect seawater density ( salty water is denser than freshwater ) and therefore the circulation of ocean currents from the tropics to the poles .
These currents control how heat is carried within the oceans and ultimately regulate the world ’s climate .
Second , sea surface salinity is intimately linked to Earth ’s overall water cycle and to how much freshwater leaves and enters the oceans through evaporation and precipitation .
Measuring salinity is one way to probe the water cycle in greater detail .
In the last half - century or so , the subtropical Atlantic has been getting gradually saltier -- a less than 1 percent increase in real terms , but an effect that is nevertheless significant .
“ It might sound like quite a small change , ” says Stott , “ but the overall salinity of our oceans is naturally relatively steady , so it ’s actually a lot of freshwater being factored out of the ocean . ”
Stott ’s analysis suggests that global warming is changing precipitation patterns over our planet .
Higher temperatures increase evaporation in subtropical zones ; the moisture is then carried by the atmosphere towards higher latitudes ( towards the poles ) , and by trade winds across Central America to the Pacific , where it provides more precipitation .
This process concentrates the salt in the water left behind in the North Atlantic , causing salinity to increase .

Water bearer
These are just the sort of effects that Gary Lagerloef and Amit Sen hope to uncover over the next few years .
Lagerloef and Sen are , respectively , principal investigator and project manager of Aquarius , part of a brand new satellite mission due to be launched into orbit in May 2010 .
Aquarius is the first NASA instrument designed to track sea salinity from space and will be the primary payload on the SAC - D spacecraft , which has been built by the Argentinian Space Agency or Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales ( CONAE ) .
The three - year mission is named after the “ cup - bearer to the gods ” in Greek mythology .
Sea saltiness has been measured for centuries .
Most of the data we have today consist of direct measurements taken at sea ( traditionally by ships and , nowadays , more often by automated buoys and profiling floats ) .
But there are vast areas of the ocean surface -- a quarter in total -- where salinity has never been measured .
By covering the entire globe once every seven days , Aquarius will fill in the blanks and provide an unprecedented global picture of salinity .
Scientists measure salt levels using a practical salinity scale .
One practical salinity unit or psu almost exactly represents the number of grams of salt in a kilogram of seawater .
Salinities in the open ocean , free of ice or land mass , generally lie between 32 and 37 psu ( the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have maximum surface salinities around 35 and 37 respectively ) .
“ With our instruments we will be able to measure salinity to an accuracy of 0.2 psu , ” explains Sen , who works at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , Calif .
“ If you take half a gallon of water and put a pinch of salt in it , that ’s about 0.2 psu .
We will be able to detect that from space , while flying about 650 kilometers [ about 404 miles ] above Earth . ”
This is no mean feat and is possible because of some impressive radiometer technology that will fly on board the spacecraft .
A radiometer is essentially a sensitive radio receiver , which , in this instance , detects microwave radiation given off by the sea surface .
The radiated power of the microwaves that are emitted enables scientists to calculate the saltiness of the water at the surface .
advertisement
What ’s special about the three radiometers designed for Aquarius is their calibration stability -- over a seven - day period , their temperature cannot stray more than 0.1 kelvin ( 0.18 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
This calls for very precise thermal control and is the reason Aquarius will be able to measure salinity with unprecedented precision .
Boom boom
“ We measure salinity in the top one to three centimeters of water because that is the crucial layer that connects the atmosphere and the oceans , ” explains Simon Collins , instrument manager for Aquarius who is also based at JPL .
“ As such , one of the largest errors in our measurement comes from ripples in the surface of the sea . ”
To correct for this , Aquarius also carries with it a scatterometer -- a state - of - the - art radar instrument that senses roughness in the sea surface by booming microwave pulses down to the ocean and detecting the scattered pulses bounced back to the satellite .
While Aquarius has not yet set off , it has been a long journey for the project ’s scientists and engineers , who are now ready to ship their instrument from JPL to Argentina .
There it will be installed on the SAC - D spacecraft , before being transported to Brazil for functional and environmental testing and returned to the United States in April 2010 , ready for its trip to space .
“ People do n’t realize that there is so much water and so little land , ” Sen remarks .
Aquarius , flying high above us , will shed light on El Niño and La Niña , phases of the world ’s most powerful climate phenomena , reveal insights into how monsoons develop and , most importantly of all , how a pinch of salt can change our lives .
Charlie Skelton is now being followed by the police and still has n't done much more than eat a club sandwich .
Global secret cabals have no sense of humour .
Now I 've got too much to report .
I 'll talk later about the strange secret circus of limousines , blacked - out windows , sirens , helicopters .
No time to relate being detained for a SECOND time , for the crime of being half a mile from the Bilderberg hotel gates trying to take " arty " photographs of limousine wheels as they whisked past .
Doing so little wrong that I was doing it while standing next to three policemen who were fine about it .
Until the call came through on the radio and the motorbikes and squad cars squealed around me like a bad dream .
I 'll tell that story later .
I have to talk now about what just happened .
But before I begin , please believe me when I say : I have n't gone nuts .
I really have n't .
Nine times seven is 63 and the capital of Italy is Rome .
I know what I know .
And I know that I 'm being followed .
I know because I 've just been chatting to the plainclothes policemen I caught following me .
As absurd as it sounds , I 've just " made my tail " .
They 're watching me now .
REALLY .
They 're sitting on the wall outside the cafe Oceania or whatever this is called , watching me type this sentence .
I asked them in for a coffee but they declined .
They laughed sheepishly when I called them Starsky and Hutch .
They asked my name .
" I told your colleagues .
Twice . "
They asked again .
I told them .
I asked back .
There was an awkward pause .
They 're not very good at this .
" ... ... Nick … … … … and … John . "
So there we were , me and my shadows .
Nick and John .
" We 're just walking up and down . "
That was their cover story , and they did n't bother sticking to it .
They simply could n't resist : " How many days you spend here ? " – " Where you from exactly ? " – " You staying here alone ? " I was laughing .
It was too bizarre .
" What is your job ? "
I told " John " I wrote jokes for television programmes .
He almost instantly forgot .
It was n't on the profile he'd just learned , clearly .
" So what papers you write for ? "
I noticed them in reception after breakfast .
Like I 'd noticed the similarly dressed , early - 30s , bland - looking fellow the night before .
He seemed to be staring at me .
I turned round and caught him whispering to the receptionist and looking at me .
I swear to God .
I know this makes me sound like a lunatic , and if it were n't for my chat just now with Starsky and Hutch I might start assuming I 've had a touch of the sun .
Last night , the phone rang in my hotel room and someone hung up when I answered .
The call came from inside the hotel .
I assumed it was one of the other reporters ringing the wrong room .
Maybe it was .
I 'm just remembering now .
I had a shorter than usual breakfast this morning .
I came out .
" Nick " was alone in the lobby .
He was on his mobile .
I trotted upstairs to my room .
Down the stairs comes " John " , also on his phone .
I 'm slotting together memories now , as I type .
I have n't gone mad .
This is happening .
Was he in my room ?
They knew I was in breakfast .
This is crazy .
Here 's what happened next : I headed out of the hotel with my laptop .
And I thought to myself : you know what , if they 're REALLY cops , they 'll follow me .
So I stopped , turned round , and waited .
Ten seconds .
I felt an idiot , standing there , waiting for an imaginary policeman to follow me out .
Fifteen seconds .
Eureka !
Out comes " John " on his mobile phone .
He looks confused to see me standing there and crosses the road .
I sit down on a wall .
He dawdles by a lamppost .
I get up , walk to the seafront , turn left , walk a bit , cross the road ( gives me a chance to look both ways – and yes , there 's " John " ) .
I walk into the far entrance of the cafe .
I 'm in an episode of The Wire .
The cafe is long and thin .
I double back on myself and stand , hidden , by the earlier entrance .
I 'm standing behind a shrub , clutching a laptop to my chest , my heart beating like a Phil Collins solo ( on drums , not piano ) .
I 'm just an ordinary guy .
A concerned citizen .
For this week at least , a blogger .
Barely a reporter .
A terrible photographer .
No threat to anyone .
I 'm nobody .
But just up the hill , in a luxury hotel , there 's a meeting of the most powerful somebodies in the world .
Bilderberg .
I 've been hauled off to the police station twice .
Before this week , I 've never had so much as a cross word with a policeman IN MY LIFE .
I once drove at night with my lights off and was pulled over and told not to drive like an idiot .
And that 's it .
I 'm not a bad person .
I do n't even know what I am any more .
I think I write jokes for a living .
I think maybe I used to .
I 'm a man clutching a laptop to his chest , trying to breathe quietly .
Ten seconds .
Fifteen .
" John " comes round the shrub and steps back , bewildered .
" Hi " .
" I'm no threat , you know that , do n't you ? "
Poor " John " .
I felt sorry for him .
He was n't very good at this .
I 'm not the smartest shoe in the window but it took me all of four minutes to blow his cover .
They did n't want to come for coffee .
I asked them to take my photo .
They did .
I took one of them .
" No fotografia !
Show me the camera ! "
Poor " Nick " , he was in a real bind .
He could n't remember if he was a policeman or not .
They seem nice , mostly , the police who have been harassing me for standing around and taking bad photos with a cheap digital camera .
Yesterday , I got chatting with one of the motorcycle cops before I was bundled off in the squad car .
I told him that I hoped tomorrow there would be protests here – not riots , but protests .
He agreed .
" It would be nice to hear another voice , " he said , sadly .
A big man in leathers , caught up in something far bigger .
" But today I have to do my job .
This is not a good situation . "
This is not a good situation .
It would be nice to hear another voice .
I 'm going to pay for my coffee now and head back to the hotel .
Just the three of me .
Charlie Skelton will continue to file regular updates from Athens because it seems safer that way
You ’ve probably heard about the current eBay UK auction with “ over 1000 videogame items ” .
But what ’s the story ?
J-OMG tracked down the seller RetroBoyG to ask all the questions you want answered …
Gianni , you ’ve got a * serious * amount of Nintendo stuff listed ( Over 400 items ) .
What ’s the ONE question you ’d like to ask Miyamoto ?
Father ? 😀
You ’re selling a lot of collectible “ merchandise ” type items …
Are there any collectibles you missed out on getting – and regretted later ?
There is n’t much I would bother about much .
The only thing that comes to mind is an SNK towel set listed on eBay once ..
That kinda pissed me off .
If someone was going to start collecting just 1 console & it ’s carts .. which would you suggest ?
It has to be a consolized MVS arcade system and a copy of Blazing Star .
You cannot beat the Engrish in that game !
Some online commentary this was a “ pre wedding sale ” – but you said that was n’t the case .
* Do * you have a partner – and if so – how supportive / active are they in gaming ?
I ’m a 40 year old virgin !
Haha… but seriously , i have a beautiful girlfriend who I ’ve been with for just over 3 years .
From the moment she saw my collection – till the day i decided to sell it – she has shown me nothing but 100 % support .
She really did n’t want me to sell it but she understands why I am doing it and appreciates that it ’s for our future .
By the way – She is more of a gamer than i will ever be .
Which * 3 * items in the collection that you have a real attachment to – and why ?
Number 1 HAS to be my IIDX Beatmania Controller ..
This thing is just the most sexual bit of hardware I ’ve ever owned ..
It ’s like a bloody disco !
I ’m actually really sad to let this one go as I know they ’re certainly hard to come by ..
Second would have to be the Atomiswave ( AWSD ) arcade machine .
I remember I bought two machines in the space of one week including this one – and i absolutely skinned myself ..
My AWSD and a Sega Aerocity cabinet ..
The AWSD was the most expensive thing I had ever bought in one go and one of the most impressive things I ’ve ever owned .
It ’s pretty much the most perfect cab I could have asked for .
I ’m looking at it right now as i type this – and it does make me feel sad . 😦
Last but not least – would probably be my PS2 collection ..
I have no idea why – as I barely played any of the stuff but i guess there are just some classics in there .
PS2 in my eyes is one of the best consoles ever made for arcade ports – and i truly believe we will never see another machine like it .
What game did you buy – and severly regret – afterwards ?
This one is very easy as I only purchased it a few months ago .. it HAS to be the World Heroes Anthology on the PS2 .
Oh my god – this is the crappiest game I ’ve ever played !
I ’m very very glad I did n’t buy any of the original MVS carts .
What ’s the best gaming controller you ’ve used ?
If the IIDX Beatmania controller counts , then that ’s my answer !
Failing that – is has to be the Saturn pad , yeah ?
I thought this was world famous for being the best controller in the world .. well for 2D stuff anyway !
You ’re selling 2 arcade cabs .
Would you buy cabs again ?
If so , which boards would you buy again ?
Hell Yes !
I even know what one exactly !
I ’m going to buy a Sega New Astro City cab when I ’am settled down in a few years .
These cabs are just the dogs danglers ..
You can have a perfect button layout for CPS2 / 3 and MVS stuff with the control panel .
The screens are amazing !
I think I ’d need to buy another AWSD though , to play Hokuto No Ken ( Fist of the North Star ) as this is the only bit of arcade hardware I ’m keeping .. and it looks best in hi-res !
You ’ve said that you ’re hoping to raise some money towards a house .
What sort of “ game room ” would the ideal place have ?
Well , if our house is big enough to even have a games room i would like to pretty much just stick to the next gen stuff .
All i really need is my PS3 and Xbox 360 and I ’m a happy chappy !
The Wii can go in the living room as that is where they belong surely .. 🙂
I hear you ’re really looking forward to the Insert Coin exhibition in the UK .
What ’s the go ?
I ’m good friends with the organisers , and part of the IC09 team so i have pretty much knew about it from the word go ..
I ’ve been on the arcade scene for a few years now and am looking seriously forward to finally meeting all the people I ’ve spoken to over the years .
A room full of sweaty men playing arcade machines for 2 days ..
Oh yes ! 😉
Gianni , thanks for your time .
Good luck with the auction … and enjoy IC09 ! 🙂
If you have n’t seen Gianni ’s auction yet – here it is …
( I hope you ’ve got fast broadband ) … and you ’ll find more information on his blog .

Addressing his Likud Party faction just one week after his visit to the United States , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that it was the responsibility of Israel ’s leadership to “ eliminate ” the threat posed by the Iranian government ’s civilian nuclear program .
“ Who will eliminate it ?
It is us or no one . ”
Netanyahu seemed pleased with the results of his US visit , dismissing US criticisms of his plan to expand settlements as “ a disagreement between good friends , ” and insisting that he had received pledges for several “ key pieces ” of military aid from the US .
Israel has been threatening to attack Iran over its nuclear program for years , and it was recently reported that CIA director Leon Panetta was dispatched to Israel in an effort to convince Netanyahu not to launch any surprise attacks on Iran .
Though the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has repeatedly certified that the Iranian nuclear program has not diverted any of its enriched uranium to any covert purpose and the United States ’ own National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) says Iran has no nuclear weapons program , Israel and US officials continue to accuse Iran of having such aspirations .
San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) launched its Surveillance Self - Defense project today -- an online how - to guide for protecting your private data against government spying .
You can find the project at http://ssd.eff.org.
EFF created the Surveillance Self - Defense site to educate Americans about the law and technology of communications surveillance and computer searches and seizures , and to provide the information and tools necessary to keep their private data out of the government 's hands .
The guide includes tips on assessing the security risks to your personal computer files and communications , strategies for interacting with law enforcement , and articles on specific defensive technologies such as encryption that can help protect the privacy of your data .
" Despite a long and troubling history in this country of the government abusing its surveillance powers , most Americans know very little about how the law protects them or about how they can take steps to protect themselves against government surveillance , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" The Surveillance Self - Defense project offers citizens a legal and technical toolkit with tips on how to defend themselves in case the government attempts to search , seize , subpoena or spy on their most private data . "
Surveillance Self - Defense details what the government can legally do to spy on your computer data and communications , and what you can legally do to protect yourself against such spying .
It addresses how to protect not only the data stored on your computer , but also the data you communicate over the phone or the Internet and data about your communications that are stored by third party service providers .
" You can imagine the Internet as a giant vacuum cleaner , sucking up all of the private information that you let near it .
We want to show people the tools they can use to encrypt and anonymize data , protecting themselves against government surveillance , " said EFF Staff Technologist Peter Eckersley .
" Privacy is about mitigating risks and making tradeoffs .
Every decision you make about whether to save an email , chat online , or search with or sign into Google has privacy implications .
It 's important to understand those implications and make informed decisions based on them , and we hope that Surveillance Self - Defense will help you do that . "
Surveillance Self - Defense was created with the support of the Open Society Institute .

It 's difficult to imagine a more epic scene , but this photo has modest origins : amateur Astronomer Thierry Legault shot it with nothing but his own telescope , a solar prism and a Canon 5D Mk II .
Advertisement
Shot just after launch , the image shows the faraway scene as viewed through a Takahashi TOA - 130 refractor telescope ( focal length 2200 mm ) and a Baader solar prism , which gives the Sun its muted look .
Strapped to the back of the telescope , the 5D was set to ISO 100 and a 1/8000 shutter speed , the camera 's extreme low and high settings , respectively [ Edit : woops , the Mk II actually does ISO 50 ] .
Legault used the free online Celestial Observer tool to calculate the best time to shoot from his location .

Meanwhile , that little silhouette is the scene of an incredibly complex and dangerous Hubble rescue mission , which will repair a number of the craft 's instruments , install a new camera and ensure that NASA 's flagship orbital telescope keeps sending us amazing images for years to come .

Happstack is improving , and my old blog posts on HAppS are now out of date .
So we 're in need of a bare - bones app to demonstrate functionality .
I also wanted a simple app without authentication capability to demonstrate how to integrate Happstack - Auth into a project .
Blog apps seem to be one of the canonical beginner 's examples in the web framework world , so I thought that would be a good choice to start with .
As usual , this post is literate haskell and should compile as Main.lhs .
First , we define a blog post .
A post has a title and a body , both of type String .
The deriving clause is required by the Happstack state mechanism .
The Ord instance is n't actually required for this example , but it is required if you want to build an IxSet from this data type , so I 'm in the habit of including it .
Our top level blog state will be a simple list of posts .
These are the standard Version and Serialize instances needed by Happstack 's state mechanism .
I wo n't go into detail about them here .
Jeremy
Shaw has a nice post describing them in much more detail .
Our state has to be an instance of component .
We have no dependencies and our state 's initial value is a simple empty list .
Now we need some accessor functions .
For now we 'll keep it simple with a function to add a post , and one to get the list of all posts .
Now the required Template Haskell voodoo to build these methods for us .
Before we go further I want to add a little infrastructure code that will simplify things later .
It 's a simple function that redirects the client to the specified URL .
New we define the layout of our site .
We have one URL at " http://site.com/new " .
A GET request to this url returns a static HTML file containing a new post form .
The form POSTS the results to the same URL , so we have to define a function to handle this request .
The last " methodSP GET " matches the root URL " http://site.com/ " and will just display the list of posts .
The msum in newPostHandlers is new as of Happstack 0.2 .
In prior versions , some functions required or returned data of type ServerPartT , and some used [ ServerPartT ] .
Other functions required WebT data .
In Happstack 0.2 , everything was unified to work around a single ServerPartT .
If you have an abstraction that needs several ServerPartTs , you usually want to collapse them using msum .
Our new post handler gets POSTed values from the HTTP request , constructs a Post , passes that to AddPost , and redirects to the root .
The view posts handler queries the GetPosts action for the list of posts .
If the list is empty , it returns a simple message , otherwise it returns the posts as a string .
toResponse converts strings into responses with a content type of text / plain .
Generating proper HTML pages is not hard , but is beyond the scope of this example .
The rest of the code is standard infrastructure for a Happstack application .
The only thing we have to do is declare an entry point with our state Component and pass it to startSystemState .
Then we pass our previously defined impl function to simpleHTTP and we 're done .
A clean , working Happstack application in 75 lines of code .
The code for this app is available in the Happstack - Auth github repository in the demos / Blog - NoAuth directory .
In the next post I will show how to add authentication to this app using the auth framework I mentioned in the last post .
“ No you fools !
You ’ll destroy us all ! ”
That was my reaction to this story at ars technica ( via ) which talks about new “ external ” graphics cards .
The idea is that users can buy lots of them and stack them high and wide and set up fancy cooling schemes that would not be practical within the confines of the average computer case .
I can only conclude that this is some sort of sick scheme to eliminate PC gaming forever .
People made a big deal about the PS3 “ sticker shock ” .
You know , because the complete game system , including controllers and the blu -ray transmorg - matrix , cost $ 600 .
Do n’t get me wrong , I like getting fancy new hardware , as budget allows .
This would be a nice development if this were something just for framerate junkies , but the way things work right now is that expensive new technology ends up appearing on the side of PC games under the wordsabout three weeks after it gets invented .
ATI could come up with a graphics card that costs $ 10,000 and needs to be continually submersed in liquid nitrogen , and idiot developers would build their next - gen engine on top of it .
Advances like this are things that hardcore gamers should be doing to get ahead , not things that average gamers should be doing just to keep up .
Sadly , I ’m sure that ’s where this is going .
The only thing more horrifying than seeing a PC game which requires a $ 500 graphics card is one that requires several of them .
And even if you do pour all that money into your PC , odds are the games will suck anyway , and run like a sick turtle .
On an uphill grade .
Against the wind .
While , like , pulling some heavy stuff or something .
You know : Slow .
You ’re a coder , working on developing a game for the PC .
NVIDIA hands you one of their latest cards , which can do some new rendering feature .
Let ’s call this new feature “ bling - mapping ” .
The NVIDIA SDK comes with a demo showing off what bling - mapping looks like and how it works .
It ’s pretty sweet .
We HAVE to put this in our upcoming game !
You know in eighteen months “ everyone ” will have one of these cards .
So you add bling - mapping to your graphics engine .
Sadly , this is not as easy as dropping it into place and walking away .
Sure , it makes polygons look nicer , but it makes them take longer to render .
Is it worth it for little polygons in the distance ?
Where is the point at which the feature is just slowing things down and not adding to the game visually ?
A meter from the camera ?
Ten meters ?
A hundred ?
You need to figure this out .
Oh , and this distance probably varies based on resolution , so at 800×600 the cutoff is N meters but at 1024×768 the cutoff is ( maybe ) N *2 meters .
You ’ll need to work out how this scale works so you know how far away a polygon needs to be before you can safely disable bling - mapping for it .
Looking at the complex calculations that are needed to “ bling ” a polygon , are there any approximations or shortcuts that will be ( say ) twice as fast but look nearly the same ?
Perhaps there is a shortcut that will make all bling - mapped objects render faster , but it causes very ugly distortions and artifacts up close .
Perhaps there is another , different optimization that only works well at a distance , and perhaps these two optimizations ca n’t be combined .
Figuring out how to use them properly , and when to use one and when to use the other , is no small task .
What about transparent polygons ?
Perhaps bling - mapping looks fantastic , but for textures with transparent areas ( like grass , or leaves ) the effect is ten times slower to render ?
Is there a way around this ?
Maybe you should disable bling for these parts of the scene ?
Or is there some way your artists could build these items that will mitigate this problem ?
What happens when you go to put a decal on the polygon ?
( A decal is another texture slapped over the surface , usually things like adding scorch marks or blood splats to walls , or cracks and bullet holes to a plane of glass . )
Maybe bling - mapping and decals do n’t look very nice together , or they cause really heavy slowdowns .
The variables are endless .
There are many aspects to the scene that need to be considered .
I ’ve barely scratched the surface , really .
This work will take months .
All done ?
Got all those tradeoffs worked out ?
Think you can render the scene with bling - mapping enabled and not waste too many GPU cycles ?
Great .
Now go do it all again .
ATI has a card that does the same thing , only slightly differently .
It does n’t have the problems with transparent textures like NVIDIA , but it ends up being really , really ugly with polygons which have certain shadow effects applied .
So you ’ll need to find some way around that .
Done ?
Great .
By the way , NVIDIA just came out with a new card .
It speeds up bling - mapping by 50 % in certain cases , but only if you do this other optimization over here which is incompatible with other optimizations that you ’ve already put into place and calibrated .
Our game should be ready to ship by now .
Are n’t you done yet ?
You were only working on one feature .
Obviously old cards wo n’t support bling - mapping .
But since it is now an intergral part of our render path , we must write an entirely different path that does all of the rendering without the aid of bling - mapping .
Ah , screw it .
We ’ll just drop support for old cards .
We ’re already four months past our intended release date .
This is what the “ Advanced Video Options ” dialog looks like to a casual user .
Similar to the mysterious devices in Myst , the user has no way of knowing what the controls will do without experimenting with them .
Some sliders will do nothing .
Some will make the game look like crap but do nothing for framerate .
Some will cripple performance for little or no visual benefit .
These controls are there because there are so many graphics cards and so many configurations and screen resolutions that nobody has time to wrap their head around it all .
They have to depend on the end user to come in and experiment with the controls until it works right .
Picture the early Playstation titles , and compare them to the Playstation titles that came out near the end of the console ’s lifespan .
The latter ran smoother and looked far better , even though they ran on the exact same hardware .
This is what you get when coders can have a fixed configuration to deal with :
They get good at using it .
What I outlined above is n’t really how things work .
It would be great if a coder was free to work and optimize a particular feature for endless weeks or months , but this just is n’t practical .
The coder has other work to do , and the rest of the team will need him to stop mucking with the engine so they can finish the rest of the game .
The result of this is that by the time coders have come to grips with bling - mapping and have it working right , it will be phased out in favor of some other new feature that comes along .
We ’re re-inventing the wheel every eighteen months , and for the most part this means that all of our games are built on top of first - generation engines or even rough prototypes .
These graphics cards are getting faster and faster , but I ’m confident that much of the additional speed is being consumed by sub -optimal code .
As just one example , check this thread , where dozens of users with dual - core machines , 2GB of RAM , and one or more high - end graphics cards , all gather to complain about slow framerates .
Let ’s put this in perspective :
If these guys had saved the money they had put into their PC ’s , they would have enough cash to buy a PS3 three times over .
Or they could buy seven Wiis .
And yet they are still having stability , framerate , or esoteric driver issues .
Yes , bling - mapping is great .
It makes the player say “ wow ” .
But then they get over it and play the game .
They will notice that it is choppy , buggy , has annoying visual glitches , or requires them to muck around with driver and DirectX versions .
It used to be consoles were for the “ serious gamers ” .
They were the ones that shelled out the big bucks for a special computer that just played games , while those of us of more humble means made do with using our PCs , which were n’t as specialized but which we already owned .
Now we ’ve reached the point where PC games are less numerous , more buggy , and require more expensive hardware .
All of this and the games run slower , too .
In the games store , PC games have been relegated to a small shelf at the back , like the porno rack at the bookstore .
Yeah , we hate to waste shelf space on that stuff , but there are always a few freaks that like to come in and buy that sort of thing .
Of the meager assortment of games they do bother to carry , a handful are probably venerable oldies like Starcraft , Diablo II , and their respective expansion packs .
This is a sad state of affairs .
Somewhere in this ridiculous pageant the whole point is lost : Games are supposed to be fun .
The main chunk of the blame falls on PC game developers , who insist on riding the bleeding edge instead of hanging back technology - wise and focusing on making something worth playing .
Was n’t that the whole point ?
This is undoubtedly the most surprising doodle that we have ever discovered adorning the surface of an integrated circuit .
Most people are used to seeing warranty disclaimers on everything from refrigerators to software , but this is the first one we have encountered on a silicon chip .
Our hieroglyphics experts have not yet deciphered the entire body of text , but the phrases " No purchase necessary " , " Keep away from fire " , and " not for resale " are clearly visible in the magnified portion shown as an inset within the photomicrograph .
The pad containing this warranty is 450 microns tall by 1850 microns wide and sports 25 lines of text , with each character being between six and eight microns high .
This disclaimer -- probably the smallest ever written -- was found on a Hewlett - Packard " Aspen " ( Acquisition Signal Processing ENgine ) chip used in digital oscilloscopes in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
