Combining diamond anvils and powerful lasers , laboratory researchers have developed a technique that should be able to squeeze materials to pressures 100 to 1,000 times greater than possible today , reproducing conditions expected in the cores of supergiant planets .
Until now , these pressures have only been available experimentally next to underground nuclear explosions .
" This lets us explore a new regime of chemistry and reproduce the conditions of more extreme planets , " said Raymond Jeanloz , a professor of astronomy and of earth and planetary science at the University of California , Berkeley .
Jeanloz and colleagues at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , New Mexico State University and France 's Atomic Energy Commission report their development in this week 's online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
To date , Jeanloz and his colleagues have achieved pressures near 10 million atmospheres using the 30 kilojoule ultraviolet Omega laser at the University of Rochester 's Laboratory for Laser Energetics in New York .
They hope eventually to use the 2 megajoule laser of LLNL's National Ignition Facility to achieve more than a billion atmospheres of pressure .
Jeanloz was instrumental in the development 25 years ago of diamond anvil cells , which squeeze liquids and solids to pressures of 4 to 5 million atmospheres , slightly higher than the pressure at the center of the Earth .
With diamond anvils , the temperature as well as pressure can be varied , and experimenters can study the compressed samples for long periods .
Laser - induced shock waves can produce tens of millions of atmospheres , but only for a split - second and at very high temperatures .
This technique also requires lasers the size of a building .
" By combining the two , we can get to higher pressures and much higher densities than either of the methods alone , " Jeanloz said .
" High density is really important , because we are trying to understand what happens as you bring atoms really close together , and compare our observations to quantum mechanical calculations . "
The combined methods also allow experimenters to tune the temperature over a wide range independent of density , something almost impossible to do with laser - induced shock waves alone .
Though this is possible in diamond anvil cells , studying a tiny hot sample is challenging , according to Jeanloz .
With the development of techniques to reach high pressures , scientists are discovering an entirely new realm of chemistry , Jeanloz said .
" When we squeeze materials to a million atmospheres pressure , the chemistry is changed dramatically , " he said .
" Materials go from being transparent insulators to becoming metallic or even superconducting .
The periodic table is completely changed at high pressures .
" There is reason to expect that when we go from the million atmosphere range to the billion atmosphere range , again there will be huge changes in chemical bonding and material properties . "
Some of the most dramatic discoveries have involved the composition of material inside Earth .
Diamond anvil experiments have shown that the most dominant mineral in Earth 's mantle is perovskite , a combination of magnesium , silicon and oxygen formed only at extremely high - pressures , above 100,000 atmospheres .
Jeanloz has shown through similar experiments that Earth 's rocky mantle dissolves into the liquid metal core where they meet at the core - mantle boundary , about 1,800 miles under our feet .
An interest in even higher pressures comes as astronomers have discovered more than 200 planets outside our solar system , most of them giant planets and supergiant planets tens or hundreds of times bigger than Jupiter .
" The center of Jupiter is at about 70 million atmospheres , " which until now has been inaccessible , Jeanloz said .
" We want to be able to understand the hundreds of planets that have now been found that are massive enough that their central pressures are many hundreds of millions of atmospheres , and maybe a billion atmospheres . "
In a diamond anvil , a tiny sample - either liquid or solid - is compressed between the tips of two diamonds .
In the combined technique , several powerful laser beams zap one of the diamonds , vaporizing it and sending a shock wave through the sample that compresses it even more .
The shock wave compresses the sample for 1 to 2 nanoseconds , enough time to study the properties of the sample , which can range from hydrogen and helium , the stuff of stars and giant planets , to elements that comprise Earth .

Swanson : This is David Swanson with Sibel Edmonds .
It 's great to talk with you , thanks for being here .
Edmonds :
Thanks for asking me for this interview , David .
Swanson :
So I should ask , I guess , before I start , are you under any gag order ?
Are there things that you can and cannot talk about ?
Edmonds :
Well - that 's a very interesting question , David , because when the government invoked the State Secrets Privilege , it was specifically for the court procedures , so there wo n't be any court hearings , and as far as the courts are concerned , my case is gagged and classified .
Separately , they invoked the retroactive classification order on Congress and this was for the Senate Judiciary committee in May 2004 - and the way the imposed this gag order - and I have to emphasize that this gag order was illegal , because in order for them to retroactively classify congressional investigations , the Attorney General for the Justice Department had to meet three criteria and he did not .
But even though the gag order was illegal , at that time in May 2004 , the Senate Judiciary committee complied with it , they complied with an illegal gag order .
But I 've never had a gag order placed on me as far as the public statements , or any other investigative procedures are concerned , but as you know they have declared everything in my case , including my languages , and what I did for the FBI , classified .
Now the question is whether this classification that they 're using is even legal , or justified .
As you know the executive branch has complete control over the classification .
Swanson :
So you are not allowed to discuss what languages you speak ?
You 're forbidden to say that ?
Edmonds :
Well - that 's what they have ordered , and that 's what the court has actually ruled in their favour - but the interesting this is if you were to go and just google my name , you will see everywhere that my language skills are all listed there - because it 's public information .
I mean , take a look at the implications of this , based on this classification , I can't even have my resume out there because when you put your resume , and you put your language skills , that would be violating classification .
But my resume has been out there , and the government has not come to me and told me to pull my resume .
They have been playing this game because they can get away with it in court , and Congress - but as you can see , this information is readily available - it 's public .
The same thing is true with my university degrees - the government specifically declared my Masters degrees , my undergraduate degrees , and the topics of those studies as classified !
This is the Kafkaesque thing that I have been trying to point out to people , and we have n't had much media attention on this - when they can go , in this ridiculous way , in this ludicrous way , to invoke ' privilege ' and classification - even on information that is readily available in public .
Swanson :
For those who still do n't know what your story is , and what you did , and why the government would be taking these sorts of actions , why do n't start at the beginning and just go very briefly , but maybe if I say a couple of things , tell me if I ’m wrong ...
You were hired by the FBI just after September 11 when they decided that it would be a good idea to hire translators who knew foreign languages - and the foreign languages that you were hired to work on were Turkish , Farsi , and Azerbaijani .
And your background is one of having lived in Iran , Turkey and the US - and having had struggles in those previous countries with repressive governments and censorship and corruption and having thought , somewhat hopefully , about the US when you came here as being a country of freedom and transparent government .
Am I on the right track ?
Edmonds : Absolutely .
I was a believer and I took my citizenship oath in 1995 , I really took that oath , as you take any oath , seriously , and I was so proud to become a citizen of this country and have the constitution , and all the principles , and the Bill of Rights applying to me .
As you know , those rights are non-existent in countries such as Turkey and Azerbaijan and Iran - in most places in the world , people are not even allowed to write about those rights , forget about even demanding them .
Swanson :
What made you inclined to take a job with the FBI as a translator ?
Edmonds :
There needs to be a brief explanation - three years before I took that job , I was doing my studies in forensic science and criminal justice , and I had applied for an internship position with the FBI , not a full time or permanent job position , and at that point they were interested in my language skills , but they basically messed it up .
I sent them the application , I took the polygraph test for that internship position for their language department , and somehow in 1999 they lost all that information - not only mine , but from 150 other applicants they had for language specialist positions .
These documents , these files were lost within the FBI - or at least that 's the explanation they gave to these applicants .
And then the 911 terrorist event took place and I 'd turn on the TV and kept hearing the Director of the FBI pleading for language specialists - especially for the languages that I speak - because they were desperate for language specialists .
And at that point it was a duty to go and say " Look - I have these skills , you need these skills for the nation , and I 'm offering it to you . "
So I took this position as a contract language specialist for those languages and my top secret clearance was issued and I started working five days after 911 .
Swanson :
And they were in pretty bad shape , right ?
How many skilled translators of Turkish materials did they have at that point ?
Edmonds :
At that point they had no Turkish language specialists ...
In fact , they had an unofficial division for years , and they had people coming , on and off , from DOD , or the State Department on loan , and working on certain projects , but they did not even have a formal division for Turkish .
They had a small division for Arabic language , and they also had a large division for Farsi - the language spoken in Iran .
As you know , because of the Cold War , most of the emphasis was placed on Russian languages - so they had a very large division for the Russian language .
Since 1991 , the need was not as great for those languages , and they never fortified the other divisions - so they had a lot of Russian translators , and a lot of Chinese translators , very few Arabic language specialists , and a mid-size Farsi department .
And more than the size , and this is quantity - vs- quality , the department was not even managed , because the solid good working people ( at the FBI ) are mainly agents , but the language division is not managed by the agents - that division , for all these languages , is managed by administrative people .
These people are former language specialists who have been promoted to supervisory positions who oversee the language division , and you have no direct involvement from the agents - so you have this layer of administrative people blocking the interaction between the agents and the language specialists .
The second reason is that the language division is considered the most classified and sensitive unit in the entire FBI - so the clearance we had , and the access we had , was far more sensitive than the agents ' .
So even when an agent wanted to come to the division and work for a few minutes with a particular language specialist , that agent had to be escorted to the division , and watched , because everything is managed on a ' need - to - know ' basis , and let 's say an agent is coming to that division to talk with a Turkish language specialist , he may be exposed to some other information from , let 's say , the Chinese counter - intelligence , or Arabic , for let 's say Saudi Arabia .
And they did n't want that to take place , so there was this great separation between the agents and the language specialists - and that itself brought a lot of problems with it - because you had these bureaucratic layers in the middle and the agents were very frustrated because they wanted to work directly with the language specialists .
You know , a lot of people consider the language specialists as like a clerical job , but you need to realize , when the information comes and you ’re looking at all sorts of intelligence , whether it 's counter - intelligence or criminal , related to all these different languages and countries , the first people exposed to it are the language specialists .
Before that information gets transferred to agents or analysts , the first person who sees it is the language specialist in charge of that particular language - and that language specialist is in a position to decide whether or not , this particular piece of information , whether it's a wiretap or document , is important enough to be translated , whether or not it should be translated verbatim - in detail , or just a summary translation .
So by the time that information goes to an analyst or an agent , it has already gone through this filter of the language specialist .
So not only do they need to have language skills , linguistic skills , the translators also need to have training and enough information and knowledge to be able to make that decision in terms of what is important , and not , what is urgent , and not urgent .
Swanson :
There 's a saying in Italian " Tradutorre traditore " which means " The translator is a traitor " - which is something that poets and authors think - and this gives new meaning to that phrase .
If you have someone in that position who is not doing their job , who has other interests and loyalties , they 're in a position of enormous power because no - one else has seen , or can understand the information that has come in .
So you took this job 5 days after 911 and you were not translating newspapers and public materials , so we can hope that someone at the State Department was doing that - you were translating wiretapped calls , transcripts and so forth , and by March of 2002 you were fired .
Why were you fired ?
What happened in between ?
Edmonds :
Well - I 'll try to answer that briefly , because so much information is already available on the net , in various publications that have come out that basically summarize the issues that I reported
Swanson :
Ok - what 's the best place for people to go ?
Edmonds :
They can go to my website - www.justacitizen.com - and there are plenty of documents there , both official documents and various interviews etc summarizing the case and there are court documents there .
But if I were to summarize the 3 or 4 general areas that I reported in terms of the serious problems ...
One had to do with , and this took place almost within the first two months I was there , that had to do with information related to counter - terrorism division dealing mainly with the 911 terror attacks - and in order to deal with it , not only did it deal with information available after 911 , but the agents and the divisions went and actually retrieved a lot of documents and wiretap conversations - some of them dating back to 1999 / 2000 - on various suspects , or people they believed maybe were suspects .
So they wanted to review a lot of things that took place even before 911 .
So you were not only dealing , after 911 , with information that started coming in , or being obtained after the terrorist attack , but a lot of information that either was translated - verbatim or in many cases summary translations - or things that were maybe overlooked that were retrieved , again from the archives , and this was a decision made by the higher - ups , and for some of those materials to be reviewed again to see what was missed , or what was not translated correctly etc .
Swanson :
But you clearly came upon things that the FBI did not want to see made public - would have found embarrassing .
Things that you made public to the extent that you were able , that things were poorly translated , things were missed , things were done wrong , and you reported to higher - ups that you had colleagues who were not doing their work properly .
Edmonds : Correct - and , again , there were two categories involved .
In some cases it was either intentional or unintentional , unintentional due to incompetence - certain information that was not translated before 911 or they were translated inaccurately .
And I also emphasize intentional cases that I reported .
The second category ( of things that I reported ) was other information that was available and there were significant issues , significant cases , that were not pursued because of ' certain diplomatic relations ' and this is something that a lot of people have a hard time understanding , and that is , selective selection of information .
That is , let 's say certain information came from , let me give you a hypothetical example , let 's say it came from Iraq , or certain Iraqi individuals , you can bet that would be processed because of the Axis of Evil Doctrine by our President
Swanson : Whereas Saudi Arabia is ' less evil ' , for example ?
Edmonds : Absolutely !
Or you would have in certain cases , there were certain cases that you had several individuals or entities from different nations , let 's say , Pakistan , or Turkey , or Israel - and that information , due to pressure by the State Department , they were not transferring that information from counter - intelligence ( they were obtained under counter - intelligence , ok ) - to the counter - terrorism division - even though they were relevant , extremely relevant , directly relevant .
So the agents were very frustrated because , another thing your listeners hopefully will grasp here , when we say ' the FBI ' it 's not the entire FBI .
All the agents that I worked with , they were great individuals , they were patriotic , they were as frustrated as I was - and they were outraged that these layers from the Pentagon , and the State Department , that they were interfering with their investigations - because automatically they had the right , the obligation , to transfer that information that they obtained from counter - intelligence , let 's say , involving money laundering tied to some terrorist activities , by let 's say , Turkish individuals , or some Pakistani individuals , or entities here in the US ( whether official governmental related entities , or others ) - to counter - terrorism to be pursued because they considered the relationship with Pakistan and Turkey too sensitive and they did n't want to mess it up .
Swanson :
And so when you ran up against these issues - facts that you thought important that were being covered over , you went higher and higher up , correct ?
And so you spoke with people like Deputy Assistant Attorney General , or the Director of the FBI - did you ever get anywhere ?
And how high did the problem go ?
Edmonds :
You are right on target , because again , there 's this misconception out there .
People think ' OK , a whistleblower sees some wrongdoing and they just jump out there and go to the media and leak the information . '
I spent 3.5 - 4 months - first I went to my supervisors , but they were a part of the problem .
Then I went above them , I went to the division chief , then I went to the FBI headquarters , I went all the way up to the Director - Director Mueller .
And I filed these issues , and when I filed them , I filed them with the supporting documents .
- it was not me saying ' This is what I think is happening . '
Because it was within the FBI , I was presenting them - let 's say there were certain forms , certain documents - to the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility - OPR - and the amazing thing that took place was , immediately I started seeing this reaction to it towards me .
First , the FBI management accused me of having gone to congress , and disclosing this information to congress , and I had not done so at that point .
I did n't believe that I needed to go to Congress at that point .
They did not believe me - they said 'we are suspicious that you have been communicating with congress on these classified issues and doing this via email communication ' - so I had agents coming to my house and removing my home computer - my husbands computer - without a warrant !
They took it , and then took it to pieces , and they did n’t find anything - and so I said ' OK - maybe it was a misunderstanding . '
Two weeks later they issued an order for me to take a polygraph test , and the polygraph test was to determine whether I had gone to Congress .
Their fear was not the classification , the fear was whether this was going outside the FBI - and I passed the polygraph because I had not gone to congress at that point .
Then they started removing my jobs , and as you know , finally I was terminated , and during these 3 - 4 months , I presented them with these 3 or 4 different categories of very important issues .
The other important case ( that I reported on ) , had to do with certain public officials , corruption cases , that the FBI had obtained - and again , this was the operation that was taking place between 1997 and 2002 - and I ’m talking about solid evidence .
And these officials are high - profile public officials .
Swanson : People as high as say Congressman Denny Hastert ?
Edmonds :
Well , that information has been public , with the Vanity Fair article , and he was only one of the people , at least from the elected officials side - one of several .
And they had at least 2 or 3 people in the Pentagon ( ed : Feith and Perle ) , and they had at least one person in the State Department ( ed : Marc Grossman ) - and they had this documented information , evidence , on these people actually not serving the interests of the United States - and giving out extremely sensitive information to other ...
Swanson : To Turkey .
Edmonds :
Well , when you say " Turkey " - not necessarily the government of Turkey that we consider an ally , but to entities that who are driven by certain interests - many of them financial interests that have to do with the military industrial complex - and they had this information , and those same individuals - not the ones from Congress necessarily , but the ones from the State Dept and Pentagon .
( ed : Perle , Feith , Grossman )
They were not only doing it with one country - because that operation was the sister operation of another investigation that dealt with Israel , but the FBI was not translating these from counter - intelligence to investigation units , and they were supposed to do that .
They were supposed to transfer and let the counter - espionage unit in the FBI , and the criminal division handle it .
But they were not ( transferring these cases ) .
So this was another case that I reported internally - and I never got anywhere with it as far as the FBI was concerned - and later , of course , when Ashcroft came out and invoked the State Secrets Privilege , Ashcroft himself inadvertently explained it !
There is a sentence there saying " The State Secrets Privilege is being invoked in order to protect certain sensitive diplomatic relations and business relations of the US " - this is an exact quote from Ashcroft , explaining why the State Secrets Privilege was invoked .
Swanson : Right !
' Business relations ' as though the US is a business ...
It 's amazing to me that you put one honest person in the FBI for a few months and they end up reporting a number of different scandals and failures , and it makes you wonder what goes on the rest of the time .
And the story of what happened , you sued , and they got it thrown out on grounds of ' State Secrets ' - from what I 've read there have been threats to your family , a suspect colleague of yours has left the country effectively with the result that they can't be called to testify , and I guess at least some of the allegations that you 've made have been confirmed , if not made public , by the Inspector General at the Justice Dept who said that you were basically fired in retaliation - is that right ?
Edmonds : Absolutely , and the most amazing aspect of it is , let 's say you have a Justice Dept and the FBI who is willy - nilly invoking this privilege to cover - up criminal wrongdoings , but then you have these judges in the Federal Court , due to this fear of ' Oh , I 'm going to be violating some classification and helping the terrorists ' or for whatever reasons , going along with it , and this happened in the lower court , it happened in the appellate court .
I do n't know if you remember this , but during the appellate court hearings , these three judges closed the court to the public and the media , and after we argued our case , when the ACLU was representing my case before the appellate court , and then it was the government 's attorneys turn to argue their case , they asked us , the plaintiffs - my attorneys and I - to step out of the courtroom because we could n’t even hear what argument the government had !
I mean , how can you argue in court against something that you do n't even know what it is ?
So this is the Kafkaesque aspect of it , and what our country has come down to .
Swanson :
And you 're not a prisoner in Guantanamo - you 're an employee of the FBI !
Not that they should n’t have these rights either .
This is the throwing out of the right to stand and hear the evidence against you that 's been part of American and British justice for hundreds of years .
Edmonds :
It 's more than that , David .
They are doing it to an American citizen .
What made me really outraged was the fact that nobody in the media really reported on this .
Here is an American citizen , not a terrorism suspect - and yes , they are misusing that big time , and it 's against all sorts of human - rights principles that we are supposed to have here - but the fact that they are doing it to an American citizen , not someone who is a suspect in a criminal case , or terrorism case , this is an American citizen who is being deprived of her due process and her Fourth Amendment , and nobody in the media picked it up .
The implications of this , now they are doing it successfully , unfortunately , to American citizens .
What does it say about where we are today as a nation ?
And the disregard they have to the Bill of Rights , and our constitution ?
Swanson :
And information that the FBI made public , or gave to Congress , they classified that retroactively right ?
They went back and decided we should make this stuff classified after it was out there !
Is there any possible respectable explanation for that kind of secrecy ?
Edmonds : Absolutely not .
In fact , later on in court , and this is the Project on Government Oversight - POGO - they sued the Justice Dept and they said " No .
This information was available for two years .
More than 30,000 websites have already downloaded it .
How could you classify something that has been out there for two years ? "
Later , the FBI conceded and they did n't go through the lawsuit , they said ' Fine - you can publicize it . '
Despite that fact , the Senate Judiciary Committee , the congress , still did n't put those documents back online , they are still afraid to put it out there .
That is the part that is so mindboggling - which brings us to another important point .
I went to Congress , I went to the appropriate committees , the Senate Judiciary committee and later I went to Congressman Waxman 's committee - that 's the Government Reform Committee - and I observed the classification rules , I went inside the SCIFs - these are the secured facilities they have where they can receive classified information where you can present them with documents , and details , and file numbers etc .
Initially , we had Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy , a Democrat and a Republican - this was in the summer of 2002 .
These two senators , together , came out publicly and they said ' We started investigating this case , we have already interviewed the FBI officials , they confirmed all her allegations to us , and she 's 100 % credible .
We need to turn the FBI upside down ' - and this comment that ' We need to turn the FBI upside down ' was made by Senator Grassley on CBS 60 Minutes , with 5 + million people watching .
Swanson :
And what was the follow through ?
Edmonds : Nothing .
Initially , they promised that there would be this major public hearing , they were going to bring these witnesses - because I 'm not the only witness .
Some of these people 's names are not public because they have n't come out to blow the whistle publicly , but they have to congress and the Justice Dept Inspector General 's office filing exactly the same reports that I filed .
They started doing this in 2002 in April , May .
Swanson :
Are some of them still employed ?
Edmonds :
Some of them are retired - and you 're looking at veteran FBI agents who were in charge of these operations .
They want to testify under oath , they want to testify publicly , and they have filed these reports .
So we got the promise from Congress that there will be a hearing , these agents will testify , they will bring in the bad guys from the FBI and have them testify under oath - and then , nothing .
A deafening silence .
Swanson : A lot of Americans expected that of the Republican Congress .
We 've now had 2.5 months of a Democratic Congress , with Senator Leahy now the Chairman .
Now Senator
Leahy can do more than just write letters and complain about Senator Grassley - what has the difference been ?
What change have you seen ?
Edmonds :
Well , we are hoping to see the change .
Let me first do the distinction between the Senate and the House .
With the Senate , even though we have had Democrats gaining the Majority , we have n't had almost any support from almost any Senate offices .
Unfortunately , somebody like Senator Feingold , who I respect tremendously , he 's not on the appropriate committee - but you 're looking at Senator Leahy , you 're looking at Senator Akaka , they are still acting as though they are being repressed there - and they do n't want to touch these issues .
And of course , you know , people like Senator Clinton - and there are so many of them , and again , it 's mind - boggling how these people , after getting the voters who said ' We need change , ' they 're not doing what they were asked to do - the reason they got re-elected , or some of them who got elected .
In the House we have a little bit more positive situation because we have some great individuals , people who I respect tremendously , Chairman Conyers , and Chairman Waxman , who have already started fairly well , and again it remains to be seen with some of the issues .
I 'm still hoping that they will do more , but at least we have had some positive response .
We ’ve got a hearing for whistleblowers through congressman Waxman 's office and congressman Waxman 's committee - the Government Reform Committee - introduced one of the best , I would say the only good legislation to protect whistleblowers which will include national security whistleblowers - from the agencies like the FBI , NSA , CIA etc .
We are so thankful for that - but when it comes to my case , because it is so controversial , because it is so packed with damning information , they have not been willing - and this is specifically congressman Waxman 's office - the Government Reform Committee - to come out publicly and commit to this hearing .
And there is nothing , David , nothing that stops them - they have subpoena power , they do n't even need to use it a lot because there are so many agents , and I have their names , and they are willing to go and testify under oath .
We have been asking congressman Waxman to come out publicly and say ' We are going to hold this public hearing ' - and I ’m going to emphasize the word ' public ' -
I have had closed hearings which act like these black holes - you go there and you give the information and nothing happens .
This information belongs to the American public and until that happens we wo n't find out about some unbelievable criminal activities that are taking place within our government agencies .
So last week we started this public action campaignthat you 're aware of , and I 'm very thankful to your website because you published that and you have been one of the supporters and you have signed on to this petition .
We have 30 organizations - and this is transpartisan , David .
We have the ACLU , OMB Watch , Project on Government Oversight , GAP ( Government Accountability Project ) , National Coalition against Censorship , OpenTheGovernment.org - we have people from the right , we have libertarian organizations like Liberty Coalition , we have People For the American Way , your organization .
Thirty major organizations have come together and put together this petition , serving congressman Waxman and his committee - and this happened last week - saying ' We want you to have open , public hearings on this case ' - not about the whistleblower being fired - about what were the issues that were being covered up , and are still covered up , and ( calling ) other agents and other witnesses to testify so we can take this information to the American public and we 'll see some accountability .
And so far we have received no response , David .
We have 15000 citizens who have signed this petition , we have 30 major organizations , we have had hundreds if not thousands of people calling in the past few days , and we are still waiting to hear from Chairman Waxman 's office to publicly say that ' Yes , we are going to hold these public hearings , ' and have these witnesses , these veteran agents , these high level FBI people who are willing to testify , to testify .
We want to introduce these documents that have no information that is ' state secrets ' or that will hurt our national security - but information that will let the public know that here we have appointed officials and elected officials who are out there engaged in treason !
Now , some people may consider the way I 'm characterising this as maybe outrageous , or an exaggeration , but I do n't know what else to call it , David .
When you have people , for greed , for money , selling out information , covering up cases , giving out our true State Secrets information to entities - whether or not they 're allies , Israel or Turkey or Pakistan - these people are engaged in treason .
And these cases are documented , the files , the wiretaps , go back to 1997 , 1998 .
They are documented , there are documents , there are witnesses and we need to expose these people and we need to see criminal indictments against these people - and it will ( happen ) .
All we need is for this hearing to take place , for people to testify , and for the documents to be introduced , then you 're going to see criminal indictments against these people .
Swanson :
That 's extremely well said , and I think it 's exactly right .
This is the purpose that Congress serves - to hold public hearings , not to issue reports quietly from friendly witnesses , but to use the power of the subpoena , and putting people under oath , and in front of cameras - and this congress has not done this on the fraud that took us into this war , and has not done it on the mis-steps that allowed 911 to occur , and this is what we put a Democratic majority in the there for in hope of , and we have yet to see it .
If people want to get involved and help push for this to happen with your case , how can they do that ?
Edmonds :
The best thing they can do , and the time to do it is right now because we just released this petition , they were just served last week with this petition signed by 15,000 people and signed by 30 organizations , is for all your listeners to call Congressman Waxman 's office , both the committee 's office and his personal office , and demand - send letters , call , because calling is effective , send letters and emails , and say ' We want you to come out publicly and commit to his hearing , and have this public hearing take place ' because they listen .
Unfortunately we do n't have a good , independent mainstream media - otherwise we would n't be in this position in the first place , David .
You mentioned Iraq , and the illegal war - with all these cases , unfortunately , our mainstream media acted as enablers .
They sit in the middle there and they did n’t do what they were supposed to do , they 're still not doing it , and they 're leaving the public in the dark .
So because we do n't have the mainstream media we have people like you .
We have websites like yours , we have some of these great organisations who are doing it on behalf of the public .
Swanson :
And we have some very talented film - makers , I have n’t seen it yet , but who have made a documentaryof your story , right ?
Edmonds : Yes David - and it 's ironic , because here it took these French producers , coming from France , on behalf of this Channel2 French network to put together for a year and a half , these directors and the producers worked on this case to document it .
And they also did a lot of investigative work - but they had to come from France to put it in place here on a case , on an issue that implicates US officials , and has implications for the American public .
And the Vanity Fair article that you mentioned , that was done by this great reporter , David Rose , who is British , he lives in England - he had to come and do a one year investigation to that piece out , and I do n't know what our mainstream media reporters are doing , but we are depending on foreign nations , and other countries , to do what our own mainstream media should be doing here .
And again , as I said , that 's why it 's up to these organizations , activists like you and your listeners to take that two minutes , maybe less than two minutes , and call Chairman Waxman , and remind him that he 's the Chairman , there 's no obstacle .
This case is not allegation , it 's not a case that needs to be investigated , that has already been done .
Even the Dept of Justice 's own Inspector General 's Office has put out a report vindicating the case .
We have had bipartisan congressional statements saying that this is credible , and absolutely confirming it .
So this is not taking something that is unknown .
He 's the Chairman , he has the power , there 's nothing that stands in his way , this is a confirmed case , let 's see some justice and accountability .
I do n't want anything my job , about why I was fired , about why they did these wrongdoings - yes , they did it to me , that is me personally being affected , and it also sends a chilling message to other whistleblowers - but that is secondary .
The most important thing is there are individuals who are engaged in acts of treason , okay .
People from the State Dept , people from the Pentagon - some of these individuals are already under some quasi- investigations .
I mean , we hear things about Douglas Feith , we are hearing things about Richard Perle , but trust me , they are not putting everything that there is out there .
Because when you are looking at organizations like the American Turkish Council here , and you see the sister organization is AIPAC .
AIPAC helped form the American Turkish Council - look at the board members , look at the people .
You will see the same people involved in both fronts , because it is the same operation .
And you come across the same individuals over and over again .
You know , I do n't understand how the case only ended up stopping with Larry Franklin - and I still can't believe that the evidence that they had from the parallel investigation did n't get its way into the court .
You need to look at individuals like Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , Marc Grossman , Dennis Hastert , and others .
And documented evidence they have collected on these people .
What are they doing with this information ?
Swanson :
It 's an excellent question .
All of those people and more need to be subpoenaed and put under oath , and on camera , and we need to get some information to the public , without which we 're not going to have a democracy .
So I would encourage everyone to take your suggestion , and call Congressman Henry Waxman , and ask for open , public hearings on this issue .
And go to where ?
The National Security Whistleblowers Coalition website ?
Edmonds :
If you could publish the information - Luke Ryland has put together an action campaign page with all of that information with Congressman Waxman 's office phone number , fax information , email etc .
It 's a very good website done by Luke Ryland , and I would appreciate it if you would add that information so your listeners can go to that website and also the phone numbers for Chairman Waxman so that they can call and contact , that would be great ( see contact details below ) .
Swanson :
We will do that , no question .
Thank you very much for taking this time to open some eyes to what still needs to be looked into .
Edmonds :
Thank you David , and thank you for everything you have been doing , because as I said , our only basically is you people , us , and those of us who are saying ' Let 's defend our country against all enemies - not foreign , , but also domestic ' - and that 's what you have been doing so we are thankful for everything you have been doing .
Thank you .
The firm clearly had the expertise — it was a leader in underwriting and trading bonds and esoteric securities backed by mortgages .
In addition , Ralph R. Cioffi , who ran the funds , had played a major role in building the Bear Stearns mortgage business .
So , in August , the Bear Stearns High - Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund — the second fund that eventually had huge losses — was started with $ 600 million in investments , mostly from wealthy individual clients of Bear Stearns , and at least $ 6 billion in money borrowed from banks and brokerage firms .
Bear Stearns and a handful of its top executives invested a mere $ 40 million in both funds .
The timing could not have been worse .
By the end of last year , housing prices in many areas were cresting and beginning to fall .
The decline began to expose lax lending standards in the subprime market .
Soon borrowers started falling behind on payments just months after they closed on their loans , forcing several large lenders into bankruptcy protection .
The Bear Stearns funds , like so many others , had invested in collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs , which invest in bonds backed by hundreds of loans and other financial instruments .
Wall Street sells CDOs in slices to investors .
Some of those pieces have low yields but they are easily traded and carry less risk ; others are more susceptible to defaults and trade infrequently , which makes them difficult to value .
Last year , $ 316.4 billion in mortgage - related CDOs were issued , about 77 percent more than the year before , the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said .
At first , the Bear Stearns hedge funds appeared to weather the storm .
But in March , the older fund registered its first loss .
One investor , who asked not to be identified because he was trying to recover his investment , said that when he moved to get his money out , he was told investors had tried to redeem 10 percent of the fund .
By April , the older fund was down by 5 percent for the year , and the newer fund had fallen 10 percent .
We 're working on it . . .

No it 's not an attack .
We had some issues with the primary web server , so we 've done a bit of fixin .
The fixin aint ' final , but foolishly we 've gone ahead and brought it back up already .
We appreciate everyone 's patience while we work to restore what we can and take this opportunity to better what we must .
Links will most certainly be dead until revived and I imagine this will happen in a stepwise fashion .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Pellets made out of aluminum and gallium can produce pure hydrogen when water is poured on them , offering a possible alternative to gasoline - powered engines , U.S. scientists say .

Hydrogen is seen as the ultimate in clean fuels , especially for powering cars , because it emits only water when burned .
U.S. President George W. Bush has proclaimed hydrogen to be the fuel of the future , but researchers have not yet found the most efficient way to produce and store hydrogen .
The metal compound pellets may offer a way , said Jerry Woodall , an engineering professor at Purdue University in Indiana who invented the system .
“ The hydrogen is generated on demand , so you only produce as much as you need when you need it , ” Woodall said in a statement .
He said the hydrogen would not have to be stored or transported , taking care of two stumbling blocks to generating hydrogen .
For now , the Purdue scientists think the system could be used for smaller engines like lawn mowers and chain saws .
But they think it would work for cars and trucks as well , either as a replacement for gasoline or as a means of powering hydrogen fuel cells .
“ It is one of the more feasible ideas out there , ” Jay Gore , an engineering professor and interim director of the Energy Center at Purdue ’s Discovery Park , said in a telephone interview on Thursday .
“ It ’s a very simple idea but had not been done before . ”
On its own , aluminum will not react with water because it forms a protective skin when exposed to oxygen .
Adding gallium keeps the film from forming , allowing the aluminum to react with oxygen in the water .
This reaction splits the oxygen and hydrogen contained in water , releasing hydrogen in the process .
“ I was cleaning a crucible containing liquid alloys of gallium and aluminum , ” Woodall said .
“ When I added water to this alloy -- talk about a discovery -- there was a violent poof . ”
What is left over is aluminum oxide and gallium .
In the engine , the byproduct of burning hydrogen is water .
“ No toxic fumes are produced , ” Woodall said .
“ When and if fuel cells become economically viable , our method would compete with gasoline at $ 3 per gallon even if aluminum costs more than a dollar per pound . ”
Recycling the aluminum oxide byproduct and developing a lower grade of gallium could bring down costs , making the system more affordable , Woodall said .
The Purdue Research Foundation holds title to the primary patent , which has been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .
An Indiana startup company , AlGalCo LLC . , has received a license for the exclusive right to commercialize the process .

The Law of Attraction is working in your life whether you 're aware of it or not .
And it may explain why you are attracting the things in your life that you do .
Here is everything you need to know about it .
The History of the Law of Attraction
While the Law of Attraction is getting quite a bit of publicity these days , the concept has been around for centuries and has been known — and used successfully — by great minds throughout history .
According to books like The Secret , there ’s evidence that the law of attraction was used by Beethoven , Einstein , and even Jesus , but you ’ve also used it in your own life whether you ’re aware of it or not !
This is because the Law of Attraction works whether or not you ’re aware of it .
The main reason for the current focus on it is that if you ’re aware that you 're using the Law of Attraction , you can control what you attract into your life .
How the Law of Attraction Works
Basically , the Law of Attraction works like this : you create your own reality .
What you focus on , what you emote about , is what you draw into your life .
What you believe will happen in your life is what does happen .
This is n’t as simple as it seems , however , or everyone would have the lives that they want naturally .
For example , people who are in debt and continually tell themselves , “ I need more money , ” do n’t find more money , they continue to attract “ need more money ” because that is the reality that they create .
Why It Works
Many people wonder why this works , and there is more than one explanation .
The two main schools of thoughts go along these lines :
The Spiritual Explanation : Many people believe that the Law of Attraction works by aligning God or the Universe with our wishes .
We are all made of energy , and our energy operates at different frequencies .
We can change our frequency of energy with positive thoughts , especially gratitude for what we already have .
By using grateful , positive thoughts and feelings and by focusing on our dreams — rather than our frustrations , we can change the frequency of our energy , and the law of attraction brings positive things into our lives .
What we attract depends on where and how we focus our attention , but we must believe that it ’s already ours , or soon will be .

What we attract depends on where and how we focus our attention , but we must believe that it ’s already ours , or soon will be .
The Traditionally Scientific Explanation :
If you ’re one who needs things to be a little more easy to prove , there is also a different explanation for how the law of attraction works .
By focusing on attaining a new reality , and by believing it is possible , we tend to take more risks , notice more opportunities , and open ourselves up to new possibilities .
Conversely , when we do n’t believe that something is in the realm of possibilities for us , we tend to let opportunities pass by unnoticed .
When we believe we do n’t deserve good things , we behave in ways that sabotage our chances at happiness .
By changing our self - talk and feelings about life , we reverse the negative patterns in our lives and create more positive , productive and healthy ones .
One good thing leads to another , and the direction of a life can shift from a downward spiral to an upward ascent .
Proof That the Law of Attraction Works
Whatever the underlying reason , reams of anecdotal evidence confirm that the law of attraction works .
And , for those science - minded folks out there , research does seem to support the positive effects of the Law of Attraction as well .
For example , research on optimism shows that optimists enjoy better health , greater happiness , and more success in life .
( The traits of optimists are that they focus their thoughts on their successes and mentally minimize their failures . )
One of the foundations of therapy is that changing your self - talk can change your life in a positive direction .
And millions of people have found success with positive affirmations .
Law of Attraction Caveats
One problem with the book The Secret , and with some people 's interpretation of the Law of Attraction , is that it 's singularly the belief we hold those good things will come to us that will bring us all that we desire , without any sort of action behind that belief .
Studies on optimists show that it is the optimistic viewpoint that drives the proactive behaviors that in turn bring optimists such great results in their lives .
Optimists do n't receive their benefits from their attitudes alone — it 's the behavior the attitudes inspire that creates real change .
More importantly , critics of The Secret and other books about the Law of Attraction point out the very real concern that people may start to blame themselves for negative events that are outside their control , such as accidents and injuries , layoffs due to the financial crisis , or major illnesses .
We can't always control our circumstances , but we can control our responses to them .
In this vein , the Law of Attraction can provide the optimism and proactive attitude that 's associated with resilience in difficult situations , but must not be used as a tool of self - blame .
Our responses to the challenges we face can make us stronger in the end , and the Law of Attraction can be used for that end , but should not be applied negatively , or it can be more destructive than helpful .
Taking the Next Step
Now that you understand the Law of Attraction , you can harness this power in your own life .
A first step would be to test your own habitual thought patterns to see whether you tend toward optimism or pessimism and learn more about changing habitual patterns of thought .
Additionally , this article on using the Law of Attraction can help you make many positive changes in your life .
Now is the time to start ; your future is in your hands !
Forget About Having Your Friends Over for Dinner ; in Missouri It ’s Your Enemies You Want to Invite
For years , I ’ve begged my wife to let me buy a gun .
The only reason I want one is that , if an intruder enters my house and tries to terrorize my family , I would like to be able to defend us .
The baseball bat under the bed just does n’t seem sufficient to do the trick .
Never mind that I am a total coward and would no doubt hand the gun to my wife and tell her to go fight the bad guy — at least I ’d be able to imagine the scenario would play out differently .
Smartly , my wife has told me we need a better reason than that to justify owning a gun .
Given my own heroic fantasies , I heartily endorse a new law passed in Missouri which , according to STLtoday.com , stipulates that “ people are not required to retreat from an intruder and can use deadly force once the person illegally enters their home , vehicle or other dwelling , including a tent .
The bill provides an absolute defense against being charged or sued for using such force . ”
In most places , you need to prove you were in real danger of being hurt or killed in order to justify the use of deadly force .
From a crime deterrence theoretical perspective , this law makes sense to me .
A burglar has no legitimate reason to be in your house .
Burglary is a crime with high social costs ( victims feel an awful sense of violation when their home is ransacked , even if the burglar does n’t get much ) , but relatively low expected punishments for the criminal because arrest rates are low .
Most victims never see the burglars , so they ’re difficult to catch , as opposed to street robberies .
I did a rough calculation many years ago in an academic paper , and if I remember correctly , the risk of lost years of life for burglars who were shot and killed by their victim amounted to about 15 % of the total prison time they could expect to serve for their crimes .
In other words , if you are a burglar , being killed by the resident should be a serious concern .
If this law encouraged more residents to kill intruders , there would likely be fewer burglaries .
On the other hand , this law probably wo n’t have much real impact on crime .
The kind of people that shoot burglars when they catch them in their homes are likely to shoot the burglar whether such a protective law is in place or not .
( That is , more or less , my reading of the evidence on concealed weapons laws . )
I think that , in practice , they mostly let you off the hook legally if you shoot an intruder .
If victim behavior does n’t actually change , there is little reason for burglar behavior to shift .
Even worse , you get a bunch of bumblers like me trying to fight burglars under the new law , and we end up getting shot .
The law does bring to mind some interesting possibilities , however .
If there is someone you dislike so much that you want him dead , all you need to do is figure out how to get him to come inside your house , and make it look plausible that he was an intruder .
Maybe you could tell him that you are having a late - night poker party and to just let himself in and come upstairs to join the game .
Or maybe say there ’s a surprise party for a mutual acquaintance , so all the lights will be out , and to come to your bedroom at 2 a.m .
Never underestimate the creativity and deviousness of humans — or the speed with which Law and Order will take the first example of this and turn it into an episode .

The writer speaks with Truthdig about his new book , “ Blackwater : The Rise of the World ’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army , ” privatization in America and abroad , and our dysfunctional democracy .
( running time : about 24:29 mins / 22.4 MB )
Transcript :
James Harris :
This is Truthdig .
James Harris here with Josh Scheer on the other side .
We have author , writer and journalist Jeremy Scahill on the phone .
Before we get into the book , how are you ?
Jeremy Scahill : Good , it ’s good to be with you and with Truthdig .
Harris :
All right , you ’ve written a new text , [ on ]
Blackwater USA , and we ’ve been reading some of the reviews .
Some good , obviously , and some bad .
I read the bad stuff , but I ’d like to know what your intentions were in writing this book — what drove you .
Scahill : I ’ve spent many years going in and out of Iraq .
I first went to Iraq in late 1998 when the Clinton administration was gearing up to attack the country , and indeed President Clinton bombed Iraq for four days in December of 1998 .
And that was my first visit to the country , and I went in and out of Iraq many times between then and 2003 .
And I actually spent a fair bit of time in the Iraqi city of Fallujah .
And so , on the morning of March 31st , 2004 , four men identified as civilian contractors were ambushed and killed in the Iraqi city of Fallujah , and then the Bush administration responded with this merciless revenge attack , laid siege to the city , killed hundreds of people , displaced tens of thousands of others .
I started to investigate : Who were those guys who got killed in Fallujah ?
Whose lives were so valuable that the Bush administration felt it was necessary to go in and essentially wipe out an entire city ?
And that began a several - year process of investigating the company Blackwater USA .
Josh Scheer :
And some of the background information I was reading , it talked about the USS Cole bombing and that was their first big government contract and that ’s what kind of led us to them now .
Can you give us a brief history of this company and … you talk about who their founder is and his support for this president .
…
How did you guys cover that in the book ?
Scahill : Blackwater USA was founded by a man named Eric Prince .
And Eric Prince is … currently in his late 30s , but at the time of founding Blackwater in 1996 he was believed to be the wealthiest person that had ever enlisted in the U.S. Navy SEALs , which is widely considered to be the most elite force within the U.S. military .
And Eric Prince came from a very conservative evangelical Christian family in the state of Michigan .
His father was a pull - yourself - up - by - your - bootstraps businessman who started a very successful auto parts manufacturing business called Prince Manufacturing .
And what the company was best known for was inventing the now ubiquitous lighted sun visor .
Any time you ’re in your car and you pull down that visor and it lights up , that ’s Eric Prince ’s family that invented that .
So this company was very successful throughout the 1980s and 1990s , and really , young Eric Prince watched as his father used his very successful business as a cash - generating machine to fund the rise of the Republican revolution in 1994 that brought Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America to power .
To give the kick - start money to Gary Bauer to start his group , the Family Research Council .
They were heavy funders of James Dobson and Focus on the Family .
And so young Eric Prince grew up in this family that was very strict Calvinist in their religion and then real free - market - gospel followers .
And so he saw this sort of model from his father , and that really has been the model that he has picked up and ran with as he ’s built up his Blackwater empire .
Scheer : I was reading a fact that was kind of shocking … one in every 60 soldiers in the first gulf war was a contractor .
And in this war , it ’s one to one .
You know , what have you noticed , I mean is this war unique ?
Is this the most contractors we ’ve ever used ?
How do you see these contractors , and what ’s their role in Iraq that we ’re seeing today ?
And in modern warfare in general ?
Scahill : The Bush administration came to power with the most radical privatization agenda in U.S. history , and we see it in our schools , we see it in prisons , we see it in healthcare , we see it in local law enforcement in the United States , federal law enforcement as well .
And now with the so - called war on terror and the occupation of Iraq , we ’ve seen the most militant privatization agenda sort of unfold before our eyes .
Donald Rumsfeld , on September 10th , 2001 , gave one of his first major addresses at the Pentagon , and he laid out a plan for a wholesale sort of overhaul of how the U.S. would wage its wars .
And he talked about a small - footprint approach and the use of the private sector , and at one point Rumsfeld said because governments can’t die , we need to find other incentives for bureaucracy to adapt and improve .
And of course this was one day before this sort of new Pearl Harbor moment happened on September 11th and all of a sudden Rumsfeld and Cheney get this blank canvas on which to paint their privatization dreams .
And so what we ’ve seen is as tanks rolled in , in March of 2003 , to Iraq , they brought with them the largest army of private war contractors ever deployed .
Now , as you say , there ’s some 100,000 contractors —
I actually think there are probably more than that .
That ’s a strangely round number .
But the fact of the matter is that we know from internal government audits that were done on the Iraq occupation that there are some 48,000 employees of private mercenary companies operating in Iraq right now .
And what these companies do is they give the Bush administration extraordinary political cover .
Their deaths do n’t get counted , their injuries do n’t get counted , their crimes do n’t get reported , they do n’t get investigated , they do n’t get prosecuted .
The fact of the matter is that with 100,000 - plus contractors in Iraq , there ’s only been one indictment of a contractor for a crime or violation committed in Iraq .
And that contractor was n’t even a mercenary contractor .
It was a private contractor doing support work for the U.S. military .
So what we see is a sort of revolving door .
The mercenaries provide the Bush administration with the ability to bloat the occupation forces — effectively double the number of occupation personnel on the ground — and then in turn the Bush administration has given them almost total free - for - all environment where there ’s no accountability , there ’s no oversight , there ’s no effective laws governing their presence there .
And it ’s interesting that Blackwater USA and its executives are heavy funders of the campaigns of President Bush and his Republican allies , and that these are the very individuals that have essentially created a Wild West environment for these contractors in Iraq .
Scheer :
With the contractors , though , I feel some sort of sympathy .
Not … obviously [ for ] the Prince family , but with the guys on the ground because these guys were once military or law enforcement . …
What would you say to that ?
You know … when a helicopter goes down and four guys who were contractors die , I feel sympathy the same way I would if we lose one of our own soldiers .
…
Do you feel like that same kind of sympathy ? …
Scahill :
Well , I think that there are different types of motivations at play here .
On the one hand , I ’ve gotten to know some of the families of Blackwater contractors that have died in Iraq .
And when you talk to those families and you say , you know , what did you think was going on when your son went over there , or your husband went over there ?
These people all believed that their loved ones were extending their patriotic duty to defend their country .
They believed that what they were doing for Blackwater was what they had done as active - duty U.S. military personnel .
And so their motives in going over to Iraq , some of these guys , was simply to continue serving their country , and that ’s how they viewed it .
And a lot of these guys are loyal Republicans and they believed in the Iraq war and so they felt that they were doing their part to defend their country .
But the flip side of it is you also have guys who are just straight - up thugs who go over there — they ’re soldiers of fortune , you know , they ’re making six , seven times what a regular U.S. soldier is making .
They have much better equipment , much better body armor and they ’re simply in it for a buck .
And I think that those are the guys that we really have to watch , because … we ’re essentially privatizing the war to forces over which there ’s no effective system of accountability .
So yes , these guys are over there in the most violent and volatile country in the world .
But the fact of the matter is that they have a choice on whether or not they want to be going over there , and they ’re getting paid very well for doing it .
The soldiers that Bush sends over there as cannon fodder do n’t have a choice in the matter .
You got guys that signed up to stop floods in the state of Pennsylvania [ who ] all a sudden find themselves in the middle of Baquba .
That ’s not [ what ] they signed up in the National Guard for .
So , I think we do have to draw a line between the mercenaries and the active - duty soldiers there , in terms of how much sympathy we extend to them .
Scheer : No , and I understand that point of view , but when … people that I ’ve talked to … go and say it is a volunteer Army and we know with stop loss and what you talked about with the National Guard sent over … for maybe the next 20 or 30 years .
But with these contractors , some of them , they went over there with good intentions and they ’re doing such a harried job , it ’s just such a confusing time . …
Scahill : I think that the point you ’re making , though , we have to break it down a little more and I think it depends on the category that an individual falls into .
As I said , I know personally the families of guys that have died over there and I ’ve done extensive research into their backgrounds , the kinds of people that they are , talked to their friends , and the fact of the matter is that a good part of these guys are probably guys who say , “ I believe in defending my country and so I want to go over there . ”
Now I personally think that there ’s nothing , there ’s no defense of the United States happening in Iraq right now .
This is an offensive aggressive war — but they believe it .
And in going over there , their motives are true to what they believe .
But I also think that there are a tremendous number of these guys who say , “ Hey , I want to make a thousand bucks a day , tax free .
I ’ll go over there for two months and I ’ll come back and I ’ll live off that fat for the next year .
And that ’s problematic when you give people an incentive that ’s monetary to go and fight a war , that ’s no longer about defending the nation - state .
That ’s private profit motive for being engaged in a brutal , bloody , offensive war .
Scheer : Now , could we be in this war without the contractors ?
I mean , could we continue this war without them , because — .
Scahill : No .
Scheer : — Because it seems like there ’s so many of these guys .
They ’re really doing a lot of the work that … our regular soldiers would do , right ?
Scahill :
Let me tell you about … what Blackwater is doing in Iraq ; see , a lot of people do n’t understand the role that Blackwater is playing in Iraq .
Blackwater is largely not working for the U.S. military in Iraq .
Blackwater has been paid $ 750 million , three - quarters of $ 1 billion , by the U.S. State Department alone , since June of 2004 .
And what Blackwater does is it guards the senior U.S. officials in Iraq .
It guards Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad , it guards State Department officials , it ’s guarded 90 congressional delegations , including that of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
And so what the U.S. has done is to outsource what some would argue is one of the most mission - critical operations in Iraq :
The protection of the senior U.S. officials on the ground in Iraq .
So Blackwater really is at the front lines of protecting the most hated people in Iraq , and the fact that the U.S. sends that into the private sector speaks volumes to the faith that the administration or lack of faith that the administration apparently has in the active - duty U.S. military .
But what contractors also do is they take away , they chisel away at the democratic process in this country because if you can deploy 100,000 contractors , that ’s 100,000 soldiers you do n’t have to convince to enlist in your military .
That ’s 100,000 soldiers whose deaths are n’t going to be counted in the official toll .
And what I think is one of the most disturbing realities of this privatized war is that an adventurous president like Bush can simply just purchase soldiers to wage these wars .
You no longer have to go through the Congress , you no longer have to try to convince young people in this country to join the military in the same kinds of numbers .
You can hire troops from the United States , Chile , Columbia , Bulgaria , Honduras , Nicaragua , you name it .
It ’s a total subversion of what should be a necessary resistance to offensive wars .
Harris : But Jeremy , due respect , that ’s speculative .
Half of what you just said was speculation .
What ’s the alternative for furthering the fight against terror ?
You may say “ go home , ” but that ’s a whole different argument .
If we recognize that we are a nation built on war — we come across a conflict every 10 years or so .
It ’s … our MO .
So how do we do this without privatization ?
Scahill :
Well , I would totally reject you saying that what I was saying was n’t grounded in fact .
The fact of the matter is that the Iraq occupation is an aggressive offensive war that would not be possible without the use of private contractors .
That ’s explicitly what I ’m talking about .
And the fact of the matter is that now a majority of the people in this country oppose the war .
A majority of the world opposes the war and the occupation of Iraq .
And without these privatized mercenaries running around Iraq , the Bush administration would have a very difficult time maintaining its occupation of Iraq , its partial occupation of Afghanistan , now its aggressive posturing towards Iran .
These guys have changed the face of war - making , and I think it ’s a very ominous development .
Scheer : I have to say … the fact is in the first gulf war , it was justified — and that ’s why the U.N. came in .
That ’s why 60 or more countries came in and gave troops .
[ Editor ’s note : Actually , roughly 30 countries . ]
With this war , it ’s not justified .
We do n’t need private contractors in other wars , because if the war is justified enough , other countries will come and help and that ’s kind of the idea of countries coming together , right ? …
Harris :
From your standpoint , is it about furthering the evidence against Bush and this war , or is it about doing something about the fact that we are privatizing most of what we do ?
This is not only true in Iraq .
This is true for insurance , this is true for social services , this is becoming a part of our American culture .
So , as opposed to privatizing , how do we governmentize these kinds of issues ?
Scahill : Let me give you an example .
The fact is that the Bush administration failed to build a coalition of willing nations to operate in Iraq .
Yes , they had some nations that gave them a few hundred troops here and there and the British had 10,000 troops .
But the reality was that they were unable , as Josh was just saying , to build a coalition of nations as they did in the so - called Gulf War .
So what we ’ve found is that the way that the Bush administration has internationalized its presence in Iraq is to recruit , through private companies , soldiers and other contractors from third countries to go and deploy in Iraq .
Take the case of Chile , for instance .
The nation of Chile — 92 percent of the population was against the Iraq war .
Chile was on the Security Council at the time it went up for a vote and was against the Iraq war .
And yet Blackwater and other companies went into Chile , hired up hundreds of their soldiers and deployed them in Iraq as part of the so - called coalition of the willing .
Take the case of Honduras .
They pulled their troops out of Iraq in 2005 .
Another U.S. mercenary company went into Honduras and hired those exact soldiers and redeployed them to Iraq .
So as we talk about the ramifications of privatization in warfare , we have to look at the fact that not only is the democratic process in this country being subverted by it , but the democratic processes in other countries are being subverted by it .
It ’s a total , sort of , banging at the bottom of nation - state status .
They ’re really chiseling away at not only our democracy but the democratic processes in other countries .
How dare the Bush administration deploy troops from countries that have said “ we wo n’t join your coalition of the willing ” ?
That , to me , is an extraordinary development in this history .
Harris :
You ’re saying that they are tampering with our democracy .
That is the kind of destructiveness and destructive attitude that I think has defined this administration .
What ’s the next step ?
What do you hope to see happen after your book does well ?
Scahill :
Well , I think there are a couple things that I ’ve tried to do .
First of all , the book is long .
I did n’t expect it to be as long as it is .
It ’s about 380 pages , and then , if you count , there ’s also about 2,000 footnotes in the book .
And one of the things I tried to do with the book , also , is to tell an alternative history of the war in Iraq .
Alternative to what we ’ve read in the major papers in this country .
So , for instance , I tell the history of the city of Fallujah .
I get deeply into the background people like Paul Bremmer and John Negroponte and the various individuals that run the Blackwater company .
And what I think is the key point right now is that we need to start seriously looking in this country at the privatization of war as part of the bigger privatization agenda .
Look at the prison system in this country right now .
Not only do we have private corporations running prisons , but we also have faith - based prisons .
One of Eric Prince ’s , the founder of Blackwater , one of his close political allies , Chuck Colson , was Nixon ’s hatchet man .
One of the first people that went to jail for the Watergate conspiracy .
Chuck Colson has now reinvented himself as this evangelical leader .
He runs a faith - based prison in Sugar Land , Texas , the former district of then - House Majority Leader Tom DeLay .
And he runs the lives of 200 prisoners and they are running it as a Christian missionary operation .
And Chuck Colson speaks openly about how we need to bring the Christian word into the prisons to battle the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in prisons .
And so we see it in the prisons , we see it in law enforcement .
Right now in this country there are more private law enforcement agents than there are official law enforcement agents .
That ’s incredible !
That should disturb people .
Because it ’s not just about “ is the private sector more efficient than the government ? ”
It ’s about accountability and oversight .
Where are the laws that govern these privatized forces ?
We ’ve seen that in Iraq there ’s no laws that govern them , and in a way it ’s the same at home here .
If your kid gets killed by a private security guard outside of a Best Buy , what happens ?
How do you get justice for your son ?
I mean , I have a friend whose son was killed by a security guard .
He ’s gotten nowhere with it .
What laws govern these people ?
Harris :
Do you think it ’s apathy ?
This is public information .
Bob Herbert , Paul Krugman — pick a liberal journalist .
They ’ve all talked about the privatization and how it is overtaking our American citizenship .
Jeremy , I ’d be interested to know , what do you think has us so paralyzed that we ’re not responding ?
We ’re not up in arms about this , as I think we should be .
Scahill :
Well , I think you ’re cutting at something really important here .
I do agree with you that a lot of this stuff is in the public sphere , but I do n’t think people understand how deep it has cut at this point .
I was surprised , I wrote an Op - Ed for the L.A. Times [ Jan. 25 , 2007 ] and basically stated a bunch of things that we already know .
There are 100,000 contractors in Iraq ; the war has been greatly privatized .
And I got so much mail from people who said “ I had no idea about this , ” including from congressional offices .
And so I think that as much as we may think that this stuff is in the public sphere , that we may think people know about this , I do n’t know that that ’s so true .
And I think that this is something that ’s really going to come back to bite us and is coming back to bite us very fast .
And the fact of the matter is that Blackwater is expanding to California .
They ’re looking to open a new facility in San Diego .
They ’re expanding to Illinois .
They ’ve applied for operating licenses in all coastal states in the U.S.
Their representatives met recently with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss doing disaster response in California after earthquakes .
This is all part of that privatization agenda , and the companies that benefit from it are well - connected companies , and that sort of embodies everything that President Eisenhower warned against in his farewell address when he talked about unchecked corporate power with the rise of the military - industrial complex .
Scheer : Jeremy , I want to ask you about this because , there was the Greenwald movie , [ “ Iraq For Sale ” ] about private contractors and there ’s CACI . …
They ’ve sued now , people with … blogs , and they ’ve gone after , say , Randi Rhodes on Air America , and they ’ve gone after these people .
Do you feel safe with going after someone like this ?
Because they ’re connected to military , they seem not to have any oversight .
What was your opinion writing this book ?
When you were at people ’s homes and talking to people at the company and doing the research , did you feel like you were in danger ?
Or that Blackwater might sue you ?
Or that now you ’re a target ?
Scahill : I think all of us as journalists , when you take on powerful people , when you take on powerful corporations , you have to know what you ’re getting into .
I think the fact of the matter is , when you look at the lawyers that represent Blackwater , it ’s almost overwhelming .
Their current counsel of record is Kenneth Starr , the man who led the impeachment charge against President Clinton in the 1990s .
Their former lawyer was Fred Fielding , who is now Bush ’s White House counsel .
They have an army of powerful Republican lawyers .
And also , the fact of the matter is , this is a mercenary company .
These are guns for hire .
These are frightening guys .
But if I spent too much time wondering about if someone is going to break my kneecaps , or am I going to get sued , I ’d be paralyzed .
And the fact of the matter is , I believe with all of my heart that these guys need to be exposed , because I do think that it cuts to the very heart of the threats facing not only us in this country and the future of American democracy but people in Iraq , Afghanistan , countries throughout Africa — the mercenaries would love to deploy in Darfur .
They ’re already going into Somalia .
These are life - and - death issues , and I think that if we truly want to be independent journalists , we have to be willing to take risks .
And part of that risk of going up against a major war contractor or mercenary company like Blackwater is maybe they ’ll sue you , maybe they ’ll break your kneecaps .
Scheer : People want to go out and go home , they read your book , they ’re inspired .
Where ’s a lot of your research coming from ?
What can people do if they want to continue exposing companies like Blackwater ?
Scahill :
One of the main things that I did , and it was a grueling process , was to file a whole series of Freedom of Information Act [ FOIA ] requests .
I methodically went through and tried to get every single contract that Blackwater has , with not only the federal government , but I also looked into local governments here in the United States and tried to get a comprehensive picture of the company ’s operations .
And sometimes I succeeded and got documents and was able to get contracts and other business arrangements that Blackwater has .
And I still have many , many FOIA requests that are pending and that are being reviewed and are being checked out by various offices .
My researcher who I worked with , a great journalist named Garrett Ordower , he and I interviewed several of the people who were involved with the founding of Blackwater and talked to them extensively about the original vision of the company and what they saw as the problems of the current direction that it ’s headed in .
I talked to a lot of family members of Blackwater contractors in Iraq and interviewed some Blackwater contractors .
Although I have to say that Blackwater as a company refused to grant me any interviews .
They thanked me for my interest in the company but said that they would not be able to accommodate my request for interviews .
And that ’s exactly what happened with Robert Greenwald .
He tried very aggressively to get Blackwater to come on the record , and of course they would n’t do that .
And I also relied heavily on the reporting of some great beat reporters in Blackwater ’s backyard .
From newspapers like The Virginian Pilot and the Raleigh News & Observer .
They ’ve done great base reporting on Blackwater , just sort of drumbeat coverage of the company .
So a lot of it had to do with getting documents , working the phones , traveling around and talking to people , reading every possible news report that ’s ever emerged on the company .
So , over the course of months and months , sort of piecing together this portrait of a private army .
Harris : I encourage all of you out there to have a gander at this text .
[ On ] Blackwater USA .
In this fight against privatization , there are consequences .
And Jeremy in his text scratches the surface .
This is Truthdig .
In today ’s Washington Times , Brian Riedl has a great column detailing just where your tax dollars go .
As Riedl notes , in 2007 the Federal Government will spend $ 24,106 per household .
Here are just a few examples of where that money goes :
Social Security / Medicare : $ 8,301 .
The 15.3 percent payroll tax , split evenly between the employer and employee , covers most of these costs .
This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees , which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring Baby Boomers .
If nothing is done , taxes eventually will need to rise by $ 11,651 per household ( adjusted for both inflation and rising incomes ) to pay all promised benefits .
(…)
Anti-poverty programs : $ 3,550 .
Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families .
Other low - income spending includes : Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) , food stamps , housing subsidies , child - care subsidies , Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) and low - income tax credits .
Despite recent rhetoric about “ cuts for poor , ” federal anti-poverty spending now tops 3 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) for the first time ever , and state and local governments add another 2 percent of GDP .
Interest on the federal debt : $ 2,071 .
The federal government is $ 9 trillion in debt .
It owes $ 5 trillion to public bond owners , and the rest to other federal agencies ( mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund , which lawmakers raid annually ) .
Despite rising debt , record - low interest rates have limited costs .
As interest rates rise back to normal levels , these costs will spike .
(…)
Community and regional development : $ 282 .
The doubling of spending in this category since 2004 comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , which is financing much of the Hurricane Katrina relief .
So , as you fill out that 1040 this week , ask yourself if you ’re getting your money ’s worth , and whether it ’s just possible that you could find better ways to spend that $ 24,106 .
It 's a stunning letter .
And it 's one of the most important letters to come from a senior military official in a very long time .
The very fact that it is necessary reveals the extent of the damage that Bush and Rumsfeld and Cheney have done .
But the fact that it is addressed to every servicemember in the field from their commander in the field shows that honor is not dead in the US military , and that repair is possible .
Marty Lederman is right to detect some political interference .
I suspect that Cheney insisted on inserting the word " frequently , " to insist that torture is not always useless and unnecessary .
But Petraeus is finally doing what no one has yet done in this war : he is asserting the immorality , illegality and dishonor of torture and abuse from a position of authority .
It has taken six years to hear that clarity again , after the shameful stain of this president 's record .
Here 's the letter in full :
10 May 2007 Soldiers , Sailors , Airmen , Marines , and Coast Guardsmen serving in Multi-National ForceIraq :
Our values and the laws governing warfare teach us to respect human dignity , maintain our integrity , and do what is right .
Adherence to our values distinguishes us from our enemy .
This fight depends on securing the population , which must understand that wenot our enemiesoccupy the moral high ground .
This strategy has shown results in recent months .
Al Qaeda ’s indiscriminate attacks , for example , have finally started to turn a substantial portion of the Iraqi population against it .
In view of this , I was concerned by the results of a recently released survey conducted last fall in Iraq that revealed an apparent unwillingness on the part of some US personnel to report illegal actions taken by fellow members of their units .
The study also indicated that a small percentage of those surveyed may have mistreated noncombatants .
This survey should spur reflection on our conduct in combat .
I fully appreciate the emotions that one experiences in Iraq .
I also know firsthand the bonds between members of the “ brotherhood of the close fight . ”
Seeing a fellow trooper killed by a barbaric enemy can spark frustration , anger , and a desire for immediate revenge .
As hard as it might be , however , we must not let these emotions lead usor our comrades in armsto commit hasty , illegal actions .
In the event that we witness or hear of such actions , we must not let our bonds prevent us from speaking up .
Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy .
They would be wrong .
Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal , history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary .
Certainly , extreme physical action can make someone “ talk ” ; however , what the individual says may be of questionable value .
In fact our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual ( 2- 22.3 ) on Human Intelligence Collector Operations that was published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees .
We are , indeed , warriors .
We train to kill our enemies .
We are engaged in combat , we must pursue the enemy relentlessly , and we must be violent at times .
What sets us apart from our enemies in this fight , however , is how we behave .
In everything we do , we must observe the standards and values that dictate that we treat noncombatants and detainees with dignity and respect .
While we are warriors , we are also all human beings .
Stress caused by lengthy deployments and combat is not a sign of weakness ; it is a sign that we are human .
If you feel such stress , do not hesitate to talk to your chain of command , your chaplain , or a medical expert .
We should use the survey results to renew our commitment to the values and standards that make us who we are and to spur re-examination of these issues .
Leaders , in particular , need to discuss these issues with their troopersand , as always , they need to set the right example and strive to ensure proper conduct .
We should never underestimate the importance of good leadership and the difference it can make .
Thanks for what you continue to do .
It is an honor to serve with each of you .

On Thursday and Friday of last week , the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly 2 % .
Given the soaring price of oil and the subprime mortgage crisis , many students of the financial markets were puzzled by this seeming burst of irrational exuberance .
A visit to exoplanet.eu , however , suggests that investors and speculators were placing buy orders in response to the rapid recent increase in the number of known planets .
During the first two quarters of ’ 07 , the extrasolar planet detection rate has been running more that 100 % above the rate reported for the most recent full fiscal year .
When asked about the impact of the new discoveries , one metals trader was quoted , “ Well , Mate , the Marketplace has been pricing in the core- accretion theory for several years now .
That means we ’re looking at a Z of ~0.1 for each one of these planets coming in , so that ’s roughly 30 Earth masses of ore per extrasolar planet .
If we use the solar gold assay , that works out to one quintillion ounces of new proven reserves for each discovery .
With gold at $ 660 , we ’re starting to talk real money . ”
Jocularity aside , the raft of new planet discoveries is having a noticeable impact on the correlation diagrams that can be explored at the exoplanets .eu site .
One ( likely statistically insignificant ) curiosity is the lack of Saturn - mass planets in this year ’s crop to date .
At the low - mass end , Neptunes such as Gl 674b are turning up with increasing frequency , and the detection - rate for Jupiter - mass planets and above also remains strong .
This dichotomy is very much in line with a key prediction of core- accretion in its simplest form .
The rapid gas accretion that occurs once the planet mass reaches ~30 Earth masses should tend to make Saturn - mass planets relatively rare .
Another interesting diagram results when one plots the masses and eccentricities of the known RV - detected planets .
A glance at the resulting diagram indicates that low - mass planets tend to be on more circular orbits .
Could this be hinting at two populations of planets and ( perhaps ) two different formation mechanisms ?
It ’s hard to tell .
Much of the effect comes from the fact that low - mass planets need to have short periods in order to be detectable .
Short - period planets , in turn , are far more affected by tidal circularization of the orbits .
The plot is also reflecting the still - mysterious ( but well known ) shortage of high - mass hot Jupiters .
All over Europe thousands of people are being threatened with court action for allegedly sharing games like Dream Pinball 3D on P2P networks .
Now , documents obtained by TorrentFreak show details of the anti-piracy company 's techniques for identifying alleged file - sharers on the internet and the gathering of claimed ' forensic quality ' evidence for use in court cases .
In March we reported in some detail about the case of 500 UK file - sharers being legally pursued following claims that they uploaded games from the German publisher ‘ Zuxxez ’ onto file - sharing networks .
Since then , many people have been in touch with the law firm who sent the threatening letters , demanding evidence that they actually did something .
TorrentFreak has obtained copies of the latest letters and within the claimed evidence is a description of how the anti-piracy system used by Logistep AG ( the company hired to track the alleged pirates ) is supposed to work .
The cleverly named “ File Sharing Monitor ” is the system being used by Logistep to gather evidence against file - sharers .
It is actually just a modified version of the Shareaza P2P application that is configured to search for infringing files , and collect the information from the hosts that share these files .
The “ File Sharing Monitor ” only targets Gnutella and eDonkey users , so it is still unclear how they track down BitTorrent users .
Here is how it works :
1 . The client connects to the P2P network , searches for sources of the infringing file , and collects the IP addresses that were gathered through the search .
2 . The client requests to download ( a piece of ) the file from the host that was found through the search .
3 . The filename , file size , IP - address , P2P protocol , P2P application , time , and the username are automatically inserted into a database , if the host permits the download .
4 . This is the “ best ” part .
The application does a WHOIS search for the ISP information and automatically sends an infringement letter to the ISP if needed .
The claim is that the “ File Sharing Monitor ” is totally foolproof and that it can provide forensic - quality information to a court in order that file - sharers be punished .
The question remains whether an IP - address is sufficient evidence to sue a person for downloading copyrighted material .
Recent cases suggest that the RIAA and the MPAA will need more evidence than that .
Here is the ‘ evidence ’ for the functioning of the Logistep system .

The race to hack the iPhone is on .
Forum threads are buzzing with action , but so far the only achievements are the downloading of the iPhone firmware , and some sniffing of the traffic over the USB cable between iTunes and iPhone
The root password , and that of the default user , named " mobile " have also been cracked .
That 's significant as the root account gives access to the deepest levels of the operating system ( it is also called the " superuser " ) , but there is no terminal access to enable a login yet .
So what are the immediate goals , and what will be the consequences for both Apple and AT&T ?
Bypass activation .
This is the big one .
If achieved , it will open up the possibility of unlocking the SIM lock and also the Network lock ( which ties the phone to a particular provider ) .
This would n't hurt Apple ; it would just sell more phones , but AT&T makes its money from phone contracts .
Allowing the iPhones to use other networks , or on no network at all , would undermine AT&T 's exclusive deal with Apple .
For users , an unlocked phone would allow them to use the iPhone with Wi-Fi or as an advanced iPod : they would get everything but voice and data .
The $ 600 price tag might be expensive for an 8 GB iPod , but for an iPhone with WiFi , Mail , web browsing and Google Maps , it 's not too bad .
Install Third Party Software .
There were a lot of complaints when Steve Jobs revealed at Apple 's WWDC programmers conference that there would be no software development kit ( SDK ) for the iPhone .
This is understandable .
You hardly ever see an SDK on a v1.0 product as the manufacturer wants room to tweak before opening up the platform .
Open it too early and simple v1.1 fixes can break third party applications .
This wo n't stop hackers trying to install their won software .
The iPhone runs full OS X , albeit stripped of the parts a phone does n't need , like printer drivers .
If hackers can gain access to the file system , they 'll be able to install anything on there .
Currently the file system is sandboxed , meaning the the iPhone offers little if any hooks for other programs , but like we say , it 's OS X in there .
It wo n't be long .
Consequences
Hackers are a curious bunch .
They can't help but tinker .
Apple and AT&T have nothing to fear , and geeks might turn the iPhone into a hacker magnet , like the WRT54g wireless router from Linksys .
Because Linksys built the router on open - source software , they were obliged to release details of it's inner goings on , and the router sold like hot cakes .
Below is a list of what we know about the state of the iPhone hacking world .
Some of this information is from the forums and has not yet been corroborated .
The iPhone runs OS X , which means there is a UNIX layer under there , which means shell access should be possible .
The iPhone file system is sandboxed inside iTunes , which means that it should be impossible to load anything unauthorized onto the iPhone from there .
Any hacks will have to go straight into the phone , However , the hacks might possibly be reset upon subsequent iTunes syncs .
The root password for all iPhones is now known ( alpine ) .
So is the password for the " mobile " user account ( dottie ) .
A simple client application has already been written ( Mac and Windows ) which will print a listing of the sandboxed files in the iPhone .
It should work without activating the phone first .
Once the iPhone has been activated ( and only then ) , non AT&T iPhone SIM cards will not work .
Various error messages are displayed .
BUT :
( Unconfirmed ) Erica Sadun of TUAW claims that her iPhone will work as an iPod , with WiFi enabled ( Safari and Mail work fine ) when using an inactive SIM after activation with a on a pre-pay AT&T plan .
It also works without a SIM .
This thread over at Hackint0sh details the root password crack .
In a comment in a previous posting the claim was made that President James Madison was a " Biblical " Christian .
It is my belief that the evidence shows Mr. Madison was not a Christian of any kind .
I briefly responded in the comments there but decided to expan my remarks here for a more public presentation .
A Memorial and Remonstrance to the Virginia General Assembly
Prince Messiah ’s Claim to Dominion Over all Governments : and the Disregard of His Authority by the United States , in the Federal Constitution
It is believed , that there never existed , previous to this constitution , any national deed like this , since the creation of the world .
A nation having no God !
In vain shall we search the annals of pagan Greece and Rome , of modern Asia , Africa , pagan America , and the isles of the sea — they have all worshipped some God .
The United States have none .
But here let us pause over this astounding fact .
Was it a mere omission ?
Did the convention that framed the constitution forget to name the living God ?
Was this an omission in some moment of national frenzy , when the nation forgot God ?
That , indeed , were a great sin .
God says , " the nations that forget God , shall be turned into hell . "
[ Ps. 9:17 . ]
It was not , however , a thoughtless act , an undesigned omission .
It was a deliberate deed , whereby God was rejected ; and in the true atheistical spirit of the whole instrument , and of course , done with intent to declare national independence of the Lord of hosts .
Mr. Jefferson ’s successor , Mr. Madison , was educated by godly parents , with a view to the Ministry of reconciliation .
He commenced the study of Theology , under the care of Dr. Witherspoon , President of Princeton College , where he attended a prayer meeting of the pious youth of that Seminary , who were preparing for the Holy Ministry .
When he returned from Princeton to his fathers house in Virginia , Mr. Jefferson was a young village lawyer , who had attracted the notice of the neighborhood , by his regular business habits , in collecting debts , drawing indentures , &c .
Madison , to the grief of his parents , abandoned the study of Theology , and entered the office of the infidel and libertine Jefferson , as a student of law .
Though Mr. Madison has pledged himself neither in public nor private , to the belief of Christianity , yet he is not known to have employed his influence , like Jefferson , in attempts to abolish the Christian Faith .
James Madison , the fourth President , after Washington , Adams and Jefferson , opposed linking Christianity with government as much as his predecessors .
He was one of Jefferson ’s strongest and most vocal allies .
He believed that the First Amendment and disestablishment of religion meant that America had “ extinguished forever the ambitious hope of making laws for the human mind . ”
Madison felt so strongly on the issue that he insisted that a Congressional chaplain would be a violation of the Constitutional separation of church and state .
For the same reason he opposed paid chaplains in the military .
In 1774 Madison wrote William Bradford , Jr. : “ Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise , every expanded prospect . ”
In his Madison opposed any establishment or support for religion by the state .
He wrote : “ During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial .
What has been the fruits ?
More or less in all places , pride and indolence in the clergy ; ignorance and servility in the laity ; in both superstition , bigotry , and persecution . ”
He also said : “ What influence in fact has ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society ?
In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of civil authority ; in many instance they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny ; in no instances have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people . ”
The Virginia General Assembly heeded Madison and rejected the call for supporting religion .
Instead it passed Jefferson ’s Religious Freedom Act. Madison advocated the “ total separation of the church from the state . ” Madison ’s personal religious views , however , are a bit harder to discern .
He was rather quiet on the matter but this would be in keeping with his view that public officials should keep their religious values out of politics .
Unlike some of the Founders who quiet explicitly stated their viewpoints with Madison we have to try and tease his views out of context .
And , it should also be remembered that Madison succeeded his good friend , Thomas Jefferson , as president .
So Madison was well aware of the vicious smear campaign engineered against Jefferson by the Religious Right of the day .
Having seen a concerted effort to destroy Jefferson ’s reputation and career by orthodox Christians Madison had every reason to be circumspect .
Certainly Madison began adulthood as an orthodox Christian .
Shortly after his graduation from , what would become Princeton , he wrote a friend suggesting that their generation become “ fervent advocates in the cause of Christ . ”
But as historian James Hutson , for the Library of Congress , noted : “ Two months later Madison renounced his spiritual prospects and began the study of law ...
For the rest of his life there is no mention in his writings of Jesus Christ nor of any of the issues that might concern practicing Christians .
Late in retirement there are a few enigmatic references to religion , but nothing else . ” Biographer Irving Brant quoted Rev. Alexander Balmaine regarding Madison .
Balmaine was married to one of Madison ’s cousins and was the minister who performed his marriage ceremony .
And Balmaine said that Madison ’s “ religious feeling , however seems to have been short lived .
His political associates were those of infidel principles , of whom there were many in his day , if they did not actually change his creed , yet subjected him to a general suspicion of it . ”
In addition Brant quotes the local Episcopal Bishop , William Meade , who recounted that a conversation with Madison took an unexpected turn , at Madison ’s instigation .
The comments made by Madison , wrote the Bishop , “ left the impression on my mind that his creed was not strictly regulated by the Bible . ”
And Brant quoted a gentleman who had dinner with Madison .
Madison queried the man about “ how the cause of liberal Christianity stood with us , and if the Athanasian creed was well received by our Episcopalians .
He pretty distinctly intimated to me his own regard for the Unitarian doctrines . ” Bishop Meade said that whatever “ may have been the private sentiments of Mr Madison on the subject of religion , he was never known to declare any hostility to it . ”
He , like the deist Washington , attended a local church and invited ministers to his home but “ did not kneel himself at prayers . ”
And Hutson notes that Madison went for long stretches of time without bothering himself with any church service .
And at one point he told the governor of Vermont , with Jefferson standing there , that he had not attended church for “ several years ” .
Certainly the Rev. James Wilson , a Reformed Presbyterian minister , felt that Madison was an infidel .
In his attack on the US Constitution , ( 1832 ) Rev. Wilson laments the lack of a Christian founding .
Wilson claimed
As far as Wilson could see not one of the seven residents of the White House , to that date , had been a Christian .
For Washington he says : “ There is no satisfactory evidence that Washington was a professor of the Christian religion , or even a speculative believer in its divinity ... ” and he “ was President of the convention , that voted the name of the living God out of the Constitution . ”
Wilson notes that Adams , who was a Unitarian , took office next followed by Jefferson , “ an avowed infidel , and notoriously addicted to immorality . ”
And then we come to James Madison : Rev. Wilson called President Monroe “ a second rate Athenian Philosopher ” and declined to say much about Presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson since they “ are yet in public life ” but the said that no “ Federal Cabinet since the first formed , has given any more evidence for the fear of the Lord , than did that of Washington .
” It would be fair to say that the “ preponderance of the evidence ” is that Mr. Madison was a deist but it is not “ beyond a shadow of a doubt . ”
But then it does n’t have to be .
The evidence that does exist certainly indicates that Madison was not a Christian .
His close friendship with Jefferson must have had some impact on his ideas especially since Jefferson was so strongly an opponent of Christian theology in his personal life , something no close friend would fail to notice .
To have worked this intimately with a man for decades would , no doubt , have required some meeting of the minds on this matter .
That Madison , even more so than Jefferson , was the architect of the doctrine of separation of church and state , gives more credence to the theory that he was deist .
At the same time , what is missing , is one shred of evidence James Madison ever expressed an orthodox view of Christianity after he began his lifelong friendship with Jefferson .
With some evidence that Madison was a deist , and none indicating he remained an orthodox Christian , the most honest conclusion is that he probably became an infidel , as his friend , Rev. Balmaine stated .

Researchers studying Thomas Jefferson 's Y chromosome have found it belongs to a lineage that is rare in Europe but common in the Middle East , raising the possibility that the third president of the United States had a Jewish ancestor many generations ago .
No biological samples of Jefferson remain , but his Y chromosome , the genetic element that determines maleness , is assumed to be the same as that carried by living descendants of Field Jefferson , his paternal uncle .
These relatives donated cells for an inquiry into whether Jefferson had fathered a hidden family with his slave Sally Hemings , a possibility that most historians had scoffed at .
But researchers reported in 1998 that the Jefferson family chromosome matched perfectly that of a male line descendant of Eston Hemings , one of Sally Hemings ' sons .
The genetic evidence was not conclusive by itself but made a strong case combined with the historical evidence that Hemings had indeed become Jefferson 's mistress after the death of his wife , Martha .
Geneticists at the University of Leicester in England , led by Turi King and Mark Jobling , have now undertaken a survey of the branch or lineage to which Jefferson 's Y chromosome belongs .
Jefferson's Y chromosome belongs to the branch designated K2 , which is quite rare .
It occurs in a few men in Spain and Portugal and is most common in the Middle East and eastern Africa , being carried by about 10 percent of men in Oman and Somalia , the geneticists report in the current issue of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology .
Puzzled at the lack of K2 Y chromosomes in Britain , given that Jefferson 's family traced its origin to Wales , Jobling 's group decided to scan a special population most likely to carry K2 -- that of men named Jefferson .
Of 85 British Jeffersons tested , just two proved to have Y chromosomes of the K2 lineage .
The paternal grandfather of one was born in Yorkshire , that of the other in the west Midlands .
Discovery of these two English members of K2 supports the idea that Thomas Jefferson 's recent paternal ancestry is from Britain .
Had they not been found , Jobling 's team writes , the geographic distribution of K2 would have made the Middle East seem the most likely origin of Jefferson 's family .
The fact that K2 is common in the Middle East , however , raises the possibility that Jefferson had a Jewish ancestor , Jobling said .
Jewish Y chromosomes resemble those of Middle Eastern peoples , and the Jewish diaspora is one way Middle Eastern chromosomes entered Europe .
But because so little work has been done on the rare K2 lineage , " our research raises the possibility , but does n't help anyone to answer it either way , " Jobling said .
Michael Hammer , a geneticist at the University of Arizona , said he had compared the Jefferson Y chromosome with those in his database of Y chromosomes and found close matches with four other individuals .
There was a perfect match to the Y chromosome of a Moroccan Jew , and matches that differed by two mutations from another Moroccan Jew , a Kurdish Jew and an Egyptian .
Hammer said he would " hazard a guess at Sephardic Jewish ancestry " for Jefferson , although any such interpretation was highly tentative .
Sephardic Jews are descendants of those expelled from Spain and Portugal after 1492 .
Bennett Greenspan , president of Family Tree DNA , a DNA - testing service , said that among the 90,000 Y chromosome samples contributed to his database , K2 occurred in 2 percent of Ashkenazim , Jews of central or northern European origin , and 3 percent of Sephardim .
" Whether the non -Jews with K2 are descendants of Jews or come from an earlier migration into Europe is hard to say , but my sense is that it 's separate migrations from the Middle East , " Greenspan said .

You ’re probably familiar with the case of Roy Pearson vs. the Chung cleaners over a pair of damaged pants that were allegedly worth $ 54 million .
Here ’s a recap for those who do n’t know what the current state of affairs is .
The Chungs now owe over $ 100,000 in legal costs from the suit , which Pearson is refusing to pay pending appeal .
So there are fundraisers being held to pay for their expenses .
Sounds great , right ?
Perfectly noble .
But if you look closer , all ’s not what it seems .
The major Chung fundraiser is being underwritten by the Chamber of Commerce , one of the largest and fervently anti-consumer lobby groups around .
If you ’re wondering why it is that every contract you sign–from cell phone contracts to homeowner agreements – has a clause in it that prevents you from suing for damages and being forced into expensive one - on - one negotiations with the other side , well , you can thank the Chamber for their efforts .
Under the guise of wanting to rein in “ frivolous lawsuits ” and the like , the Chamber and its astroturf allies have done everything in their power to restrict , limit , or outright destroy the right of consumers to sue for fraud , malpractice , or damages :
Malpractice â€œreformsâ€ are only the thin end of the wedge for a much bigger agenda .
Lined up behind the doctors are most of the Fortune 500 , a formidable coalition led by insurance and tobacco companies , far - right think tanks and dozens of well - heeled pressure groups , many of them fronts for corporate interests .
Buoyed by the conservative tide flowing through the country , this coalition has stepped up the pressure to enact damage caps and other measures .
Before unleashing its campaign ads , the Chamber of Commerce had already poured $ 100 million into an antilawsuit lobbying and publicity blitz that claimed product liability suits add a â€œtort taxâ€ of $ 809 per person every year to the cost of goods and services .
Stories highlighting the lawsuit abuse â€œproblemâ€ have become a staple in Readerâ€™s Digest and the newsweeklies .
Think about this when you hear about pet food recalls , data breaches , asbestos leaks , birth control failures –these are things that can literally harm and kill thousands , and without the power to seek redress in a court of law , people are essentially left to just shut up and take it .
Every time you bitch and moan about “ frivolous lawsuits , ” you need to ask yourself what you would do when it happens to you .
Luckily , both that LiveJournal audience and the readers of DCist were savvy enough to see that the Chungs ’ plight –which is legitimate and undeserved by any standard–is now being converted into a right - wing talking point , and the CoC fundraiser is being underwritten by unsavory elements like local D.C. right - wing rag The Examiner and conservative blog Townhall.com .
Extreme cases like Roy Pearson ’s mania should not be used as an excuse to dismantle the rights of Americans to demand accountability from business .
It ’s not enough to simply say you ’ll shop elsewhere .
Not when your pets die , your babies are harmed , when you ’re at risk for cancer , or you lose your life savings to data thieves–or any one of a million other wrongs that would not be redressed if we could n’t get our day in court .
Of course , I would be remiss if I did not point out that not only are trial lawyers a huge bastion of support for Democratic campaigns , but that John Edwards himself was a successful trial lawyer before running for the Senate .
Anything that would limit Democratic power bases is something the GOP goes for–so attacking Dem supporters using “ tort reform ” is a major part of the playbook .
So if you want to support the Chungs , do n’t let yourself be fooled into handing over money to an organization devoted to making your life miserable .
Give to them directly , or if you ’re in D.C. , stop by and throw some business their way .
Ed Babinski found a website by former seminarian Craig Lee Duckett that has a lot of good stuff on it .
This whole site is a work in progress .
Be sure to see Duckett 's online book , Descending Babel .
Here are 25 reasons why Duckett is no longer a Christian :
1 ) The world simply does not behave the way described in the Bible
2 ) The words used to define Christian Doctrine are representative of things whose existence cannot be ' proved ' outside of language
3 ) The Fall of Adam & Eve ( and resulting Doctrine of Original Sin ) is incoherent and contrary when compared to scientific evidence and other doctrines
4 ) The concepts of Heaven and Hell are equally morally and ethically reprehensible
5 ) Historical Evidence shows much of the Old Testament was appropriated from earlier Sumerian , Babylonian , Egyptian , Canaanite , & Persian Myths
6 ) The Account of the Flood and Noah's Ark bears striking similarities to the Epic of Gilgamesh and other pre-dating Creation / Flood myths
7 ) Persian Zoroastrianism altered Jewish Doctrine during the Babylonian Captivity
8 ) The influence of the pseudepigraphal Book of Enoch on the mystical Good - Evil dichotomy of Christian Doctrine
9 ) The influence of Philo of Alexandria on the development of Christian Doctrine
10 ) The ancient gods and goddesses that were assimilated by the Hebrews to become Elohim EL & Yahweh YHWH
11 ) Myths of Dying - Resurrecting God-Men Born of Virgins that Pre-Date the Story of the God-Man Jesus
12 ) The Problem of Evil ( Theodicy ) and the Hiddenness of God
13 ) Natural ( Empirical / Scientific ) vs. Supernatural ( Faith / Language - Based ) Belief Systems
14 ) The Gospels are not ' eyewitness ' accounts but anonymous third - person narratives
15 ) The ' Evolution ' of the Christian Canon and Jesus ' Godmanship
16 ) Saul / Paul of Tarsus and the ' Re - Creation ' of the Christian Myth
17 ) Archaeology and Biblical claims

19 ) The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Essenes
20 ) The Nag Hammadi Library , Ugaritic Texts , and Armana Tablets
21 ) Canonical and Extracanonical books , the Gnostics , and Church Councils
22 ) Examined objectively , the Bible is rife with errors , contradictions , misstatements , and inconsistencies

The stigma of being a prostitute runs deep in Latin America
They have renamed one of the major parks in the city Prostitutes ' Plaza and a book has been launched about abuse and exploitation .
The women have been marching and handing out condoms .
It is part of a national campaign to admit prostitution exists and provide better security for women involved .
On the city street maps , the park is called Mercy Plaza but the locals all call it Once Plaza , since it sits at the heart of the working - class Once neighbourhood .
Only now the women who , come nightfall , work around here have renamed it Prostitutes ' Plaza .
' Taking control '
On the ground by the main statue they have daubed the words " No woman is born a prostitute " .
It is the title of a book published by two women , Sonia Sanchez and Maria Galindo , which looks at Argentine society and the role prostitution plays within it .
" We 're taking control of the streets , " said Maria .
" It 's a small but important step . "
Sonia said : " We 're saying enough is enough .
Prostitution is n't a job .
It 's sexual exploitation and it's big business . "
Other slogans daubed , then painted over , around the square read : " The pimps rule here " and " Here they exploit the bodies of girls , and the police do nothing " .
Blackstone said it would grow the Hilton business
Under the deal , Blackstone is paying $ 47.50 for each Hilton Hotels Corporation share , a 32 % premium over their closing price on Tuesday .
Blackstone said the deal had been approved by Hilton 's board , and was due to be completed by the end of 2007 .
The surprise announcement comes two weeks after Blackstone raised $ 4.13 bn through floating a 13.2 % stake .
Private equity firms are investment companies that raise money from private sources rather than by using the stock market .
Our priority has always been to maximise shareholder value

Quick Guide : Private Equity
They typically buy up businesses they believe can fare better , with a view to improving their performances and eventually , selling them on for a profit .
Blackstone said it intends to grow the Hilton business .
Numerous hotel brands
The private equity firm already has a number of hotel investments , including La Quinta Inns and Luxury Resorts and Hotels .
US - based Hilton 's other brands include Conrad Hotels , and the Waldorf - Astoria Collection .
Blackstone 's co-founders , Stephen Schwarzman , 60 , and Peter Peterson , 81 , earned more than $ 2.4bn between them from last month 's share sale .
Hilton said the deal would be good news for its shareholders .
" Our priority has always been to maximise shareholder value .
[ The deal ] provides compelling value for our shareholders with a significant premium , " said Hilton co-chairman and chief executive officer , Stephen Bollenbach .
The global network of Hilton hotels were reunited as one company in 2006 after a 42 - year split .
The reunion happened after Hilton Hotels Corporation ( HHC ) paid $ 3.3 bn to buy the 400 international Hilton hotels owned by UK - based Hilton Group .
The division took place in 1964 , when HHC sold off all its overseas hotels to concentrate on the US market .
" How do you know he was n't fooling you ? "
" Because he cried when he left me . "
" ... a time before there was television , when an author might support a family by writing stories that satisfied uncritical readers of magazines , and earning thereby enough free time in which to write serious novels .
" This old man 's hope has to be that some of his earliest tales , for all their mildness and innocence and clumsiness , may , in these coarse times , still entertain . "
, he was 47 .
He 'd struggled for 20 years to earn a living as an American writer , working as a public relations man for General Electric , an advertising copy writer , and even a car salesman .
" All I wanted to do was support my family , " Vonnegut wrote in 1999 .
" I did n't think I would amount to a hill of beans .
" But this forgotten period of his life also includes a haunting story about television , a World War II story , and Sammy Davis Jr. With two children , " I needed more money than GE would pay me , " Vonnegut wrote in his introduction to Bagombo Snuff Box : Uncollected Short Fiction .
" I also wanted , if possible , more self - respect . "
Vonnegut hoped to spend his life writing short stories for magazines , and began tapping his experiences in World War II — and in the world that followed .
But in the 1950s the magazines publishing his fiction were exterminated by the ultimate juggernaut : television .
"
You can't fight progress , " Vonnegut wrote bitterly .
" The best you can do is ignore it , until it finally takes your livelihood and self - respect away . "
In 1958 his sister died — and then her husband a few days later — and the 36 - year - old would consider abandoning writing altogether .
In another world , Sammy Davis Jr. was a rising star .
Though the 32 - year - old had yet to join Frank Sinatra 's Rat Pack , he was making a name for himself as an entertainer in Las Vegas and on Broadway .
In a 1989 biography , Sammy remembered asking his agency for a role in TV dramas , and being told a black actor would be too jarring for audiences in the south .
" Baby , " he replied , " have you any idea how jarring it must be for about five million colored kids who sit in front of their TV sets hour after hour and they almost never see anybody who looks like them ?
It 's like they and their families and their friends just plain do n't exist .
" Sammy 's genuine pain found echoes in one of Vonnegut 's stories .
D.P. — published in Welcome to the Monkey House — tells the story of the only black boy in a German orphanage .
( " Had the children not been kept there ... they might have wandered off the edges of the earth , searching for parents who had long ago stopped searching for them . " )
When the boy spots a black American soldier , he mistakes him for his father .
Sammy was cast as the soldier in a television adaptation of the story .
Though TV was killing Vonnegut 's career , he 'd ended up as the co-author on this single teleplay .
( Ironically , it was to appear in a showcase of half - hour dramas sponsored by his old employer : .)
The published story ends with the young boy explaining his newfound hopes to the other skeptical orphans .
In the teleplay , the heart - wrenching scene is played out .
The alienated soldier — an orphan himself — finds himself abandoning the boy , yelling " Go away !
I 'm not your father !
" I do n't need you !
" Then he realizes he can't do it .
He collapses to his knees , and sobs " I need you .
" And he promises he 'll be back .
Sammy remembers that " everybody on the set was crying . "
Future President Ronald Reagan even wandered in — then the host of GE Theatre — and said warmly that " It 's going to be a wonderful episode .
" And according to Sammy 's biography , his Hollywood agent Sy thought it was a milestone for America .
" Well , sweetheart , you 've made television history .
When they write the books about the tube , they 've got to write that Sammy Davis Jr. was the first Negro actor to star in episodic television ...
You 'll have opened those doors for others to follow . "
Sammy remembered that " It did n't matter what as long as they broke out of it being just maids and butlers .
" But there was one problem .
General Electric worried that nearly two - thirds of their products were sold " below the Mason - Dixon line , " according to Sammy 's agent .
His biography remembers that painful conversation .
" They say they will be ostracized by their white customers and dealers .
So there 's no way we can use that show .
" The sponsor is the boss ...
GE paid for the show , and it 's GE 's right to bury it .
" The show finally aired — in a doomed time slot competing against Rock Hudson 's first television appearance ever .
But surprisingly , it beat Hudson 's ratings in New York , Chicago , Philadelphia , and Los Angeles — and was only a half point behind nationwide .
The reaction was surprisingly positive , and GE even cast Sammy in two more episodes .
And somewhere , America began to change .
Before publishing , Vonnegut struggled through another 10 years of writing .
In Bagombo Snuff Box he complained that when he published Mother Night and The Sirens of Titan , " I got for each of them what I used to get for a short story .
" But eight years before his death he'd look back fondly on the 1950s in America , remembering it as " a golden age of magazine fiction ... "

Interesting .
Someone just told me that I was on Pownce – which is odd , because I never signed up for an account .
Lo and behold , here “ I ” am .
I ’m not terribly upset about it at this point , but that ’s pretty much my identity – and the people following “ me ” may not know that that ’s “ me ” or have no idea who I really am .
This is indicative of the problems all these stupid - ass social network sites face :
There was no verification that this person , using my name and photo , obviously intending to make people believe that the profile was my own ( despite having jumped up and down about how I was n’t really ready to try Pownce yet ) , is really me – who he or she claims to be .
Why ?
No , seriously – why ?
This is n’t * MY * fault – it ’s Pownce ’s , and they ’re not the only social network with this severe identity shortcoming .
If this is an identity - oriented service , where the hell is the identity check !?
Some of these people may think this is really me .
It ’s not , and if it was – I certainly would n’t use that profile picture ( taken at the first Desktop Linux Summit a few years back ) .
Some of these “ friends ” may have no idea who the hell I am , yet have added me as a friend – which makes little to no sense if this person really is n’t me , or I ( not “ I ” ) did n’t initiate the relationship .
Sorry , man – that ’s not me .
You already know where to find me , and it ’s not on Pownce at the moment .
If someone claimed this profile in my name to reserve it for me , I appreciate the gesture – but please , I really do n’t feel comfortable with putting my identity here when it ’s already BLATANTLY obvious that the system is just as lousy as every other social network on the planet ( in terms of identity and ABSOLUTE BENEFIT to the account holder ) .
One reason I stuck with Twitter is because it ’s simple , it lets the world know what I ’m up to , and I do n’t feel like my identity is getting monetized out the wazoo without proportional benefit .
Sadly , this is an industry - wide problem – not a Pownce - specific one ( although they ’re making it all too easy to point out the flaws inherent in the entire ecosystem of social networks ) .
Why do I pick to join one network over another ?
I do n’t know .
I really do n’t know .
But I can tell you one thing for sure : I do n’t like it when people pretend to be me .
Why the hell you ’d ever want to pretend to be me is beyond me , but I guess that ’s the point ?
A grim - faced George AuClair Jr. wandered his 25 - acre patch of desert looking every inch the broken man .
“ I ’m ashamed of what happened here , but you ca n’t lie about it , ” said the Torres Martinez tribal member .
“ You have to own up when you do wrong . ”
Not far away , bulldozers piled up mountains of junk from AuClair ’s illegal dump , a dump so toxic it has been declared a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency .
He now faces millions of dollars in fines .
AuClair ’s site is n’t unusual .
Illegal dumps are spread across the Torres Martinez reservation like ugly wounds , making it the most polluted tribal land in California , Nevada and Arizona .
Vast swaths of desert have been transformed into toxic trash heaps threatening the tribe and nearby communities .
There are at least 26 illegal dumps here , including the largest one in the state .
Federal officials struggle to shut them down , but new ones pop up all the time .
Advertisement
“ I would say this is in its own league , ” said Clancy Tenley , EPA ’s tribal program manager .
“ I do n’t know of any place that has this level of pollution . ”
Unlike the nearby Agua Caliente , Morongo and Cabazon tribes , the Torres Martinez are poor .
They do n’t have luxury hotels , spas or , until recently , even a casino .
But they do have land : 24,000 acres of it stretching from Riverside to Imperial counties , and even under the Salton Sea .
And as development in the Coachella Valley has exploded , some tribal members have cashed in by offering land to those looking to cut corners on waste disposal costs .
Golf course trimmings from clubs throughout the Coachella Valley have arrived in unmarked trucks , and drums of oil , car batteries and sewage also wind up there .
Even waste from nearby cities found its way onto the reservation via unscrupulous contractors .
And when the pile gets high enough , it ’s often just burned .
Advertisement
The result , federal officials say , has been widespread contamination along with toxic smoke drifting over cities , schools and farms across the Coachella Valley .
“ We find new dumps on a regular basis , ” said Ray Paiz , battalion chief for the Riverside County Fire Department in Coachella .
“ What has occurred out there is not only wrong , but it ’s a shameful criminal act . ”
So far AuClair , 50 , is the only owner expressing any shame .
His site had it all .
Fires routinely sent poisons into the air ; more than 34,000 square feet of arsenic and chromium ash littered the place .
Transients also lived there ; drug abuse was rife , and there was at least one killing , say police and the EPA .

AuClair ’s biggest mistake was burning thousands of toxic wooden grape stakes .
“ How could we have known grape stakes were treated with arsenic and chromium ? ” he asked .
“ There was no sign saying , ‘ This is hazardous to your health . ’ ”
And he insists his own health was n’t damaged .
“ I lost my hair , but I think that was a thyroid problem , ” he said , “ and I get headaches , but that could be anything . ”

Still , the site is small compared with other illegal dumps on the reservation .
A few miles away , looming up from the desert floor is a plateau 40 feet high , 300 feet wide and nearly 1,000 feet long , composed almost entirely of human excrement .
It ’s been dubbed Mt. San Diego because of where the sewage originated .
A mile or so from that is the towering Lawson dump , the biggest in California .
The 40 - acre site has mountains of debris 50 feet high and a million tons of buried waste .
Subterranean fires smolder endlessly , occasionally flaring up through cracks .
Since a federal judge shut it down last year , there have been more than 20 fires injuring nine firefighters .
“ It ’s the largest dump I have seen in my career , and I have been doing this since 1986 , ” said Scott Walker of the California Integrated Waste Management Board .
“ Nothing else compares . ”

School nurses in the Coachella Valley have reported high levels of asthma , bronchitis and skin rashes among local students that they attribute to smoke from dump fires , especially the Lawson facility .
In response , Loma Linda University recently sent a team of researchers to survey the pupils and will issue a report before the school year is out .
“ We think the community health has been impacted , and we want the schools to know , we want the families to know and we want the tribe to know , ” said Rick Alvarez , assistant superintendent of the Coachella Valley Unified School District .
Despite flagrant violations of federal law , it ’s only in the last year that the dumps faced serious enforcement action .

“ Over the years the tribe , the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the EPA tried different things to combat this problem , but it was n’t until we all began to work together that things got done , ” said Tenley , the EPA manager .
“ There has been a radical transformation , especially in the last 12 months .
Ten dumps have been closed . ”
Before that , layers of bureaucracy , tribal politics and intimidation allowed operators almost free rein on the reservation .
Federal officials trace the first big dump to 1989 , when tribal member Geraldine Ibanez , who has since died , made a deal with now - defunct Chino Corona Farms to compost sewage on her land .
But the company composted only a fraction of the sewage , which originated in San Diego , and left the rest in a giant , growing pile .
In 1994 , a federal court in Los Angeles barred further shipments to the site , though illegal dumping has persisted on a smaller scale .
Two years later , the two owners of Chino Corona Farms were convicted for illegal dumping in Imperial County and were sent to prison , according to state officials .

Mt. San Diego stands just a half - mile from three schools and directly beside an empty lot advertised as a future Pardee Home site .
According to state environmental documents , it still “ poses a significant threat not only to the ... reservation but also to the neighboring communities . ”
Cleanup efforts began last year and will continue at least through 2008 .
Three years after Ibanez opened her dump , fellow Torres Martinez member Kim Lawson started a “ recycling center ” on tribal land .
Little if any recycling went on , investigators say .
Semi -trucks dropped off loads of palm trees , treated wood , plastics , paint and oil , among other things .
“ Kim Lawson used to burn twice a month , and it would last for hours or days , ” said EPA attorney Letitia Moore .
“ You could see the smoke for 50 miles . ”

Citing a total lack of permits , the BIA issued Lawson a cease - and - desist order in 1994 .
Yet he continued to operate .
It took more than a decade to shut it down .
Lawson could not be reached for comment .
Unlike in some other states , the BIA in California has no police officers to enforce its will .
“ It would be a lot easier to have a law enforcement officer standing with you when handing out cease - and - desist letters , ” said Lisa Northrop , natural resources officer for the BIA ’s Southern California Agency .
“ If they ignore the letters , we hand them out again .
We need to create a record before taking someone to court . ”
Torres Martinez tribal leaders insist they have no power over members such as Lawson because they run businesses on private land allotted to their families by the government .

The BIA and legal experts dispute that .
“ The tribe does have jurisdiction over these allotments , but it ’s complicated for tribes to exercise coercive authority over them because of intertribal relationships , ” said UCLA law professor Carole Goldberg , an expert on Indian law who has written extensively about dumping on tribal lands .
“ It is very delicate . ”
James Fletcher , BIA superintendent for Southern California , said the Torres Martinez tribe , which has 400 members on the reservation , has largely cooperated in efforts to stop dumping but has n’t done all it can .
“ The tribe has ordinances , but they choose not to use them , ” he said .

One tool the tribe could use , Fletcher said , is cutting off gaming money to lawbreakers .
Tribal Chairman Ray Torres refused to comment , citing instructions from his tribal council .
Tribal Manager Maxine Resvaloso did not return repeated calls seeking comment .
The tribe ’s environmental director , Alberto Ramirez , also declined to comment .
Aside from internal politics , violence and intimidation also remain serious problems .
“ People who have objected to the running of an illegal dump have had their families threatened , ” said Lt. Mark Barfknecht of the Riverside County Sheriff ’s Department , whose deputies patrol the reservation .
“ As recently as 18 months ago there was a school project where kids living in and around the reservation filmed the burning in the illegal dumps and were chased off by armed men . ”

Cesar Rafael , 17 , of Thermal was one of those kids .
“ They shot a gun into the air , ” he said .
“ I was trying to film when it happened . ”
A virtual Wild West atmosphere prevailed at the AuClair dump .
Methamphetamine use was common , deputies said .
At least 13 people lived in makeshift shelters .
On a recent visit , a man pulled up and warned that two other men were shooting at each other around the corner .
Back in the brush , Tonetta Torro , 50 , tended the four wolves she keeps tied up for protection .
She has spent four years here in a tent but plans to leave soon .

“ I hear gunshots all the time , ” she said .
“ Still , I feel sad to go . ”
The arrival of trailer parks on the reservation in the 1990s heightened a sense of urgency about the dumps .
More than 12,000 people , mostly farmworkers , live in five ramshackle parks .
The biggest sits beside the Lawson dump site .
In 2003 , the EPA issued an internal memo reporting dioxin levels 20 times the national average at the dump .

Last year , a federal judge in Riverside shut it down and fined Kim Lawson $ 47 million .
He has declared bankruptcy .
As for AuClair , his dump may be closed , but his shame lingers .
“ We are destroying our environment , ” he said , picking up a piece of Indian grinding stone lying in the sand .
“ I do n’t have the money to pay for it , but I ’ll be damned if I wo n’t clean this up .
Look at this place .
My ancestors would roll over in their graves if they saw it . ”

' Stuff ' not made of particles could be seen soon , in theory .
What would the track of an ' unparticle ' look like ?
No one knows .
LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORY / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
The universe could be filled with stranger stuff than anything physicists have ever seen : stuff that , unlike all known matter , is n't made of particles .
Howard Georgi of Harvard University calls it ' unparticle stuff ' .
According to theory , such stuff could barely be felt by everyday matter , making it invisible to us and our instruments so far .
" It could be that at the energies we can probe today , we just do n't see the unparticle stuff at all , " says Georgi .
But the high energies about to be probed by machines such as the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) at CERN , the European centre for particle physics near Geneva , Swizerland , might show up the strange stuff , he says .
The story of fundamental physics has largely been a search for particles — atoms and their constituents , such as quarks and electrons .
The latest hunt is for the elusive Higgs boson , which is thought to be responsible for giving other particles the property of mass .
The Higgs is thought to be very heavy , meaning it will take a lot of energy to make one — such as the energy from crashing other particles together at awesome speeds in the LHC .
This is the way it is with particles : their mass corresponds to a particular energy , as Einstein famously formulated in E=mc2 .
At the energy levels that prevail in our everyday world , matter consists largely of the familiar particles that make up atoms : protons , neutrons and electrons .
If energies were a thousand times greater , a new suite of particles would predominate , as is thought to have been the case in the early instants of the Big Bang .
The Universe would then look very different .
Georgi 's unparticle stuff does n't behave like that , he argues in Physical Review Letters1 .
You can boost energy levels as much as you like , and the unparticles would look just the same .
This property is called ' scale invariance ' .
Light fantastic
There is already known stuff like this , Georgi points out : light , made of particles called photons .
Their scale invariance is possible because photons have no mass and so can have any level of energy .
Particles with non -zero mass can't show scale invariance .
But that prohibition does n't extend to ' stuff ' that is not made of particles , says Georgi ( he is careful not to call it ' matter ' , which implies particles ) .
He says that theories of scale - invariant stuff have been understood mathematically for a long time .
" But it 's hard to describe this stuff because it is so different from what we are used to , " he says .
In particular , he notes , it can't be particulate .
It would only be possible to see this unparticle stuff via the effect it has on regular matter , and presumably ( since we have n't seen it yet ) that effect is normally small .
" If all the stuff that is scale - invariant couples to all the stuff that is n't , in a way that gets weaker and weaker as the energy gets lower , there could be a scale - invariant world separate from our own that is hidden from us at low energies because its interactions with us are so weak , " says Georgi .
This is what the ghostly particles called neutrinos are like .
" Neutrinos have some properties in common with unparticle stuff .
They are nearly massless and therefore nearly scale - invariant .
They couple very weakly to ordinary matter at low energies , but the effect of the coupling increases as the energy increases , " he notes .
Half a neutrino
Georgi has considered how unparticles might start to make their presence felt at higher energies , by analogy with the way this happens for neutrinos .
The answer , he says , is weird : ordinary particles interacting with unparticles would behave as though they were interacting with a fractional number of massless particles — a bit like interacting with , say , five and a half photons .
" This is the first glimmer of an answer to the question of how unparticles begin to show up , " Georgi says .
The counterintuitive aspects of unparticles seem likely to leave some physicists scratching their heads .
Physicist William Unruh at the University of British Columbia in Canada wonders whether the fingerprint of an unparticle would really be distinct from one a particle would leave .
" If , say , the unparticle field were to interact with the atoms in a cloud chamber , would we not get definite tracks just as we do for photons ? " he asks .
" In other words , would this unparticle field not behave in many situations just like a particle ? "

Georgi thinks not .
" What one would ' see ' in a detector is way beyond what I understand , " he admits .
" But it would n't be particle tracks . "
" I and other researchers are now trying to push these ideas harder , and other weird properties of unparticles have already emerged .
It is great fun , " he says .
" Of course " , he adds , " it would be even greater fun if we actually saw stuff like this at the LHC . "
The LHC is expected to begin its first runs in early 2008 .

Australian government ’s “ terrorist ” case against Dr Haneef unravels
By Mike Head
20 July 2007
In a serious blow to the Howard government ’s scare - mongering campaign , Stephen Keim QC , the barrister for detained Indian Muslim doctor Mohamed Haneef , has leaked a revealing transcript of his client ’s initial police interview and called on the government to release any undisclosed information it has on the case .
Keim ’s action is another sign that the Howard government ’s efforts to whip up new fears of terrorism by connecting the young man to the recent failed bombings in London and Glasgow have begun to unravel in the face of growing public disquiet over the indefinite detention of the 27 - year - old doctor .
The released transcript directly contradicts several key police and government allegations that were broadcast throughout the media over the past three weeks in a bid to link Haneef to those arrested in Britain .
It exposes police claims that Haneef had lived with two of the arrested men , who are his second cousins , and had no explanation for seeking to fly to India on a one - way ticket .
Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio’s “ AM ” program this morning reported the collapse of the centrepiece of the police - government campaign , that Haneef ’s former mobile phone SIM card was found in the jeep that was rammed into the Glasgow Airport terminal .
British and Australian sources told an “ AM ” reporter that the card was found , eight hours after the Glasgow incident , hundreds of kilometres away in Liverpool .
The card was in one of two mobile phones seized in the apartment of one of Haneef ’s cousins , Sabeel Ahmed , who has not been accused of any direct involvement in the bombings .
Reflecting the mounting opposition , leading lawyers have strongly defended Keim ’s courageous stand in declaring that he was the source of the leaked transcript , potentially risking his career .
The barrister , a widely respected figure in the legal profession , challenged the government to arrest him after Prime Minister John Howard , Attorney - General Philip Ruddock and Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) Commissioner Mick Keelty made threats of legal action to punish whoever leaked the document .
Keim said his handing of the 142 - page transcript to a journalist was completely legal and ethical , and necessary to counter the government ’s own systematic leaking of prejudicial material calculated to skew public opinion against Haneef .
His statement exposed the methods of deceptive media leaks that the government and its security agencies have employed , not just against Haneef but every individual charged with terrorist offences over the past five years .
“ My client has been subject to a barrage of leaks , ” Keim told reporters .
In a media statement , he said “ an aggressive campaign of leaking , selectively and misleadingly , from the same document and other allegedly secret documentation held by law - enforcement agencies had been perpetrated in recent weeks .
These leaks could only have been motivated by a desire by those perpetrating them to suggest to the Australian public that the case against Dr Haneef was stronger than the Australian Federal Police , through their counsel , the commonwealth DPP , had been able to put before the court . ”
Ruddock has threatened to pursue charges of contempt of court or breaches of professional ethics against Keim , and declared that the transcript ’s release could delay Haneef ’s trial , extending his detention .
Keim responded : “ I challenge the Prime Minister , his ministers , Mr Keelty and the police to produce the legal basis which would make anything I ’ve done illegal .
They know where I am .
If they think I ’ve done anything wrong , they can come and take me away . ”
What the transcript shows
The released transcript of the July 3 AFP interview reveals at least three crucial false statements in the subsequent police court affidavit .
According to the affidavit , Haneef “ had no explanation as to why he did not have a return ticket ” from India to Australia .
In reality , Haneef told the police his father - in - law had booked and paid for a one - way ticket to India scheduled for July 2 “ because I did n’t have any money ” .
He explained that the sole purpose of his trip was to see his wife , Firtous Arshiya , and new - born daughter , after they were re-admitted to hospital following an urgent Caesarean birth on June 26 .
The doctor said his employer , the Gold Coast Hospital , could confirm that he had wanted to leave earlier but could not organise another doctor to cover his absence .
The affidavit also states that Haneef told police he lived in Britain with his two cousins , and that in an on - line conversation with his cousin Sabeel just before the bombing bids he had not mentioned the recent birth of his daughter .
Haneef actually told police he had not lived with his cousins , and that his conversation with Sabeel had been solely about the birth of his child .
The full transcript shows that despite a marathon six - hour questioning of Haneef — who willingly answered all questions and did not request legal advice — two senior AFP agents came up with nothing .
Most of the interview consisted of Haneef giving the police every conceivable piece of information about his life and his personal affairs , including the names of all his relatives , details of his email addresses , Internet account , computer , car , bank accounts , finances and places of worship .
Throughout the interview , Haneef repeatedly denied any knowledge of the London and Glasgow attacks , or any involvement in terrorism .
He told AFP agent Adam Simms he had never had firearms , explosives or terrorist training and denied he had ever been asked “ to take part in jihad or anything that could be considered similar to jihad ” .
Haneef volunteered the information that he had left his SIM card behind in Britain with Sabeel .
He explained that after being told that British police wished to ask him about the card , far from absconding he had tried four times to phone a British police officer , Tony Webster .
Haneef said he feared he was being “ framed ” .
When he gave the card to his cousin , more than a year earlier , it had only one month ’s worth of use left , on a pre-paid plan .
Lawyers and judges speak out
Last Monday , a magistrate granted bail to Haneef after he had been detained for police questioning without trial for nearly two weeks , then charged with “ recklessly ” providing support to a terrorist organisation .
The only police evidence cited was that , before he left Britain more than a year ago , the young doctor gave his nearly - used SIM card to Sabeel Ahmed , who has not even been charged with membership of a terrorist group .
Before Haneef could be released , the government effectively overturned the court ruling by ordering that he be kept indefinitely in immigration detention .
Without any notice or hearing , Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews revoked his visa on “ bad character ” grounds , declaring that he was “ reasonably suspected ” of “ association ” with a terrorist organisation .
Haneef ’s lawyers have filed an appeal against that decision in the Federal Court , but in the meantime the Queensland state Labor government has declared that the young doctor will be treated “ as a terrorist ” in jail , subjected to solitary confinement for 23 hours a day .
The Howard government ’s actions , followed by its threats against Keim , have clearly generated public suspicion , as well as outrage in the legal profession and sections of the judiciary .
Lawyers ’ groups have sprung to the barrister ’s defence .
Sean Reidy , chairman of the criminal law section of the Queensland Law Society , said Keim acted lawfully .
He added that the legal fraternity was “ monitoring the case closely , ” Keim was a lawyer of the “ highest integrity ” and the government attack appeared to be “ vicious and personal ” .
“ You have to have a great deal of concern for the administration of justice when in high - profile cases lawyers are being personally attacked .
This is exactly what happened in the Tampa case , ” Reidy said , referring to 2001 , when the government denounced lawyers for attempting to help refugees legally challenge their forced removal to the remote Pacific island of Nauru .
Australian Bar Association president Stephen Estcourt SC said thousands of lawyers were deeply concerned at the government ’s handling of the case .
“ The disquiet is pretty universal , ” he said .
“ The cancellation of Dr Haneef ’s visa following so closely on the granting of bail is a cynical exercise and constitutes an assault on the rule of law . ”
Estcourt said he was also concerned by Ruddock ’s comments about a possible tightening of the laws to make it harder for judges and magistrates to use their discretion in bail cases .
He said this indicated that Ruddock believed he could simply frame new laws to overcome independent - minded judicial officers .
The Australian Lawyers Alliance ( ALA ) , representing 1,500 lawyers , said the government ’s treatment of Haneef was “ deplorable ” .
ALA national director and Perth barrister , Tom Percy , said : “ When the government is able to usurp the decision of a magistrate , the rule of law no longer applies ” .
Prominent Melbourne barrister , Robert Richter QC , accused the government of “ terrorising ” the legal system .
Concern among judges became apparent on Wednesday during an urgent directions hearing in Brisbane of Haneef ’s appeal against the visa cancellation .
Federal Court judge Jeffrey Spender described as “ absolutely astounding ” the government ’s argument that an association of any kind with criminals — even “ a cup of coffee , a picnic with the kids ” — was enough for a non-citizen to fail the Migration Act ’s character test .
“ I have been associated with persons involved in criminal activity .
I have defended them , charged with murder .
Unfortunately I would n’t pass the character test on your statement , ” the judge said to Roger Derrington , SC , representing the immigration minister .
Justice Spender also said that the visa cancellation ’s timing was “ curious ” .
“ There is room for the view that this was an act of circumventing the inconvenience of having him on bail , ” he said .
One of the grounds for the appeal is that the minister ’s purpose in cancelling the visa was to allow Haneef to be detained when he had been granted bail , and that that was an “ improper purpose ” .
The previous day , Victorian Supreme Court justice Bernard Bongiorno warned about the dangers of sacrificing the presumption of innocence for “ political expediency ” .
He declared that “ the whole foundation of our criminal justice system ” could be at risk .
Bongiorno granted bail to two accused members of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
He expressed doubt that they would be convicted under the anti-terrorism laws for fund - raising for the LTTE , given that the organisation was not listed in Australia or Sri Lanka as a terrorist organisation .
The two leading members of the Tamil community in Melbourne had been denied bail since their arrests on May 1 .
Following Justice Bongiorno ’s ruling , a magistrate granted bail to another Tamil man who was extradited from Sydney on similar charges last month .
Broader concerns
Widespread public concern in India about Haneef ’s treatment has forced Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to intervene , making a statement expressing the hope that Australia would extend “ all the facilities ” to Haneef .
The Indian government had earlier summoned Australia ’s envoy to the foreign ministry in New Delhi to demand that Haneef be treated “ fairly and justly under Australian law ” .
In Brisbane , where Haneef is detained , Muslim leaders said Muslims were being targetted in the wake of his arrest .
Dr Mohamad Abdalla told the Murdoch - owned Courier - Mail many believed that if Haneef were not a Muslim , the anti-terrorism laws would not have applied to him .
“ Muslims are feeling now , many of them , particularly the vulnerable ones , who is going to be next ? ” he said .
“ Since the issue of Haneef started , people have been meeting every night until 10 , 11 o’clock , discussing what they can do .
How they can respond ? ”
Murdoch ’s outlets , which have vociferously fuelled all the allegations made by the government and its police agencies in the “ war on terror ” since 2001 , have intervened prominently in the Haneef case , including by obtaining and publishing the police interview transcript .
Behind these actions are concerns , spelt out in an Australian editorial on July 18 , that the handling of the case is seriously discrediting the entire framework of the anti-terrorist laws .
While defending the visa cancellation , the editorial said the government ’s problem was that growing numbers of people no longer trusted it .
“ Without a speedy explanation by the government of exactly why he must remain in custody , Dr Haneef will continue to be martyred by the same anti-Howard forces who managed to turn David Hicks from a confessed terror trainee into the focus of widespread , and politically costly , public sympathy ” .
In other words , Haneef ’s persecution is now compounding the damage to the government ’s credibility caused by its complicity in the five - year detention of Hicks in Guantánamo Bay , before he pled guilty to a dubious minor charge in order to get back to Australia .
Far from being concerned about legal rights and civil liberties , the Murdoch stable is alarmed that the government ’s ability to trample over these basic rights has become compromised .
The Australian ’s legal affairs writer , Chris Merritt , elaborated these concerns , writing : “ The great lesson from the fiasco in Guantánamo Bay was that the legal response to terrorism will fail utterly unless it wins public acceptance .
The only reason David Hicks is serving a trifling sentence in Adelaide — instead of rotting in Cuba — is because the Australian public lost faith in the US military commission process ...
Instead of speculating about what sort of punishment could be meted out to this lawyer [ Stephen Keim ] , those responsible for the war on terror should remember the great lesson from the Hicks case : the court of public opinion can sometimes be far more powerful than a court of law . ”
Letters to newspapers indicate that broad layers of people are now disgusted not only with the Howard government , but the Labor Party as well for its “ in- principle ” endorsement of every action taken against Haneef .
Labor leader Kevin Rudd ’s support for the government ’s conduct is entirely in line with Labor ’s six - year record of backing the so - called “ war on terror ” and voting for every piece of anti-terrorism legislation .
Occupying office in every state and territory , Labor ’s partnership has been crucial in handing constitutional powers to the federal government to impose its laws , and in passing legislation that has either matched or exceeded the federal measures .
The state Labor government in Queensland has had no qualms in consigning Haneef to solitary confinement “ as a terrorist ” .
Since 2001 , there has been complete bipartisan agreement between the Howard government and the Labor “ opposition ” on boosting the powers of the police , intelligence and military apparatus as public opposition deepens to militarism , worsening social inequality and the assault on basic legal and democratic rights .
Friedman urges pot be decriminalized Candidate says more room in prison is needed for ' the pedophiles and the politicians '
AUSTIN - Independent gubernatorial candidate Kinky Friedman called Wednesday for the decriminalization of marijuana to avoid further clogging state prisons with nonviolent offenders .
He also said he would favor a review of people already imprisoned on marijuana charges to " rehab them , try to get them back into society . "
" We 've got to clear some of the room out of the prisons so we can put the bad guys in there , like the pedophiles and the politicians , " said Friedman , a humorist and author .
Friedman said he does n't yet have specifics on how decriminalization would work , including what amount of marijuana a person could possess without being charged .
He did say that he does n't favor making marijuana legally available for purchase .
" I 'm not talking about like Amsterdam , " he said .
" I agree with ( U.S. Sen . )
John McCain that we 've lost the drug war , " Friedman said .
" Drugs are more available , they 're cheaper .
" It 's clear to me , if you 've lost the war on drugs then you 've got to go some other direction .
You can't keep banging your head against the wall . "
Crack 'a different deal '
Friedman 's comments on marijuana came one week after he created a controversy in Houston when he said the musicians and artists who fled Hurricane Katrina had returned to New Orleans , but the " crackheads and thugs " remained .
He later added that many evacuees who remain in Houston are good citizens .
The candidate said Wednesday that crack " is a different deal " from marijuana .
" Marijuana is a very different situation .
It 's not like crack and ( other ) drugs that create violence , " he said .
Friedman discussed his prior cocaine use last week in an interview with the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express - News .
He also has written extensively and talked freely about his cocaine use when he was a satirical musician during the 1970s and early 1980s .
He said the deaths of two close friends spurred him to change his lifestyle , and he has not used illegal drugs since 1985 , when he left New York to return to Texas and began writing detective novels .
Calls himself a ' realist '
Friedman added that though he knows most of the New Orleans evacuees are black , " crackheads come in all colors of the rainbow .
So do racists . "
" I 'm not a racist .
I 'm a realist , " said Friedman , adding that he is the only gubernatorial candidate addressing the issue of crime in Houston .
Political scientist Bruce Buchanan of the University of Texas at Austin said Friedman is " off the beaten path .
There 's no question about that .
That 's his whole schtick .
" By traditional standards , we would all dismiss this out of hand , " Buchanan said .
But he said that " given the fluidity ( of the governor 's race ) ... we have to wait awhile .
The die has not yet been cast . "
Spokesmen for three of his opponents — incumbent Republican Rick Perry , Democrat Chris Bell and independent Carole Keeton Strayhorn — said they do n't think marijuana should be legalized .
Libertarian candidate James Werner said he would " move toward the legalization of all drugs . "
Friedman also said he would like to put inmates to work outside the confines of prison .
" Let them paint poor people 's houses , fix up the state parks , things like that , " he said .
" It would be good for them and good for us . "

Zimbabwe 's inflation will rocket to 1.5 m % before the end of the year , the US ambassador to Harare predicted yesterday , forecasting massive disruption and instability that will drive President Robert Mugabe from office .
In a telephone interview with the Guardian , Christopher Dell said prices were going up twice a day , sapping popular confidence in a government which is now " committing regime change on itself " .
" I believe inflation will hit 1.5 m % by the end of 2007 , if not before , " Mr Dell said .
" I know that sounds stratospheric but , looking at the way things are going , I believe it is a modest forecast . "
Zimbabwe 's official inflation is 4,500 % but independent economists and retailers say it is really above 11,000 % and picking up speed .
The black market rate for the Zimbabwean dollar has slumped , from Z$ 160,000 to the pound last week to more than Z$ 400,000 .
It collapsed further yesterday , tumbling to more than Z$ 300,000 to the dollar .
The official rate is fixed at just Z$ 250 .
Mr Mugabe insists that the Zimbabwe currency must not be devalued .
" Prices are going up twice a day , in some cases doubling several times a week , " said Mr Dell , who is approaching the end of his posting to Zimbabwe .
" It destabilises everything .
People have completely lost faith in the currency and that means they have lost faith in the government that issues it .
" By carrying out disastrous economic policies , the Mugabe government is committing regime change upon itself , " he said .
" Things have reached a critical point .
I believe the excitement will come in a matter of months , if not weeks .
The Mugabe government is reaching end game , it is running out of options . "
Hyperinflation is spreading poverty , as even basic goods become unaffordable .
Supermarket trollies lie idle as few can afford to buy more than a handful of goods .
Government regulations only permit the withdrawals from banks of Z$ 1.5 m a day , which is not enough to buy a week 's worth of groceries .
Golfers pay for drinks before they set off on their round , because the price will have gone up by the time they have finished the 18th hole .
One Zimbabwean was recently told by a pension company that it would no longer send him statements as his fund was worth less than the price of a stamp .
" I can barely cope with inflation in the thousands , but millions ?
We will die , " said Iddah Mandaza , a Harare factory worker , who added that some workers were now saving on transport costs by " going to their jobs on Monday and sleeping at the workplace until Friday .
They all share their meals .
That 's what they do to get by . "
Many Zimbabweans are resorting to bartering .
" I traded some soap for two buckets of maize meal [ Zimbabwe 's staple food ] .
It was far much better than trying to buy it in the shops , " said worker Richard Mukondo .
" People in the rural areas are even worse off .
You can see they are hungry and their clothes are in tatters .
They trade in whatever they can produce : tomatoes , onions , chickens and eggs . "
Tony Hawkins , professor of economics at the University of Zimbabwe , said that no one held cash in the country any more .
" People spend it as soon as they get it .
Goods hold their value , not money .
The government has run out of solutions .
At this rate perhaps inflation could hit 1 m % , but one gets a sense that things will crack before then . "
Enterprising Zimbabweans abroad have set up internet trading schemes , such as Mukuru.com , in which Zimbabweans overseas pay for goods with foreign currency and then vouchers for fuel , food and medicines are sent to recipients in Zimbabwe via email or on their mobile phones .
This business has thrived because more than three million Zimbabweans - a quarter of the people - now live abroad .
Half of Zimbabwe 's families depend on remittances from overseas to pay basic monthly bills , according to a recent survey by the University of Zimbabwe .
Mr Dell , 51 , who has had a tumultuous three years as ambassador to Zimbabwe , said that Mr Mugabe faced further trouble from his army , which used to be considered solidly loyal to the president .
Last week six men , including an army private and a retired senior officer , were charged in court with plotting against the president .
He said the allegations of the coup plot show divisions within Mr Mugabe 's ruling party , Zanu - PF .
" I do n't believe it was a real coup plot .
I think it shows one side of Zanu - PF plotting against the other .
The bitter factional infighting is now dragging in the military .
That can not be good news for Mugabe , " said Mr Dell .
South African president Thabo Mbeki's efforts to mediate between Zanu - PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change are " the last great hope for a peaceful resolution to Zimbabwe 's crisis " , said Mr Dell .
The dash from cash
It is a shopper 's nightmare and an economist 's dream , often producing surreal economic behaviour .
When prices rise every day , people ditch cash in favour of assets ( precious metals , property or even pianos in Weimar Germany ) that retain value .
Foreign currency may become de facto tender , as in Russia ( dollars ) and the former Yugoslavia ( marks ) in the 1990s .
Workers spend salaries as soon as they are paid .
Savings fall as bank deposits and pensions become worthless ; bartering takes over and the state prints more zeroes on money .
Germany had a 100 trillion Reichsmark note in 1923 while a postwar Hungarian note had 20 noughts .
Hyperinflation has made victims of politicians too , from interwar Germany to Boris Yeltsin 's Russia and most recently Argentina , which got through four presidents in four months in 2001 - 02 .
Still , since the beginning of 2005 , Lilly has cut its United States work force by more than 8 percent , reducing it to 22,000 jobs by last January .
Lilly also noted that its overall reported worldwide tax rate for 2006 — which includes taxes paid to other countries and taxes that it has deferred but will theoretically pay at some future date — was about 20 percent in 2006 .
Pfizer , Merck and Amgen declined requests for comment .
Tax experts like Michael J. McIntyre , a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit , say the drug makers are taking advantage of antiquated rules that work better for manufactured products like steel and automobiles .
Under this system , when companies transfer products between divisions in different countries , they must account for the sales internally through “ transfer pricing . ”
But they have significant discretion in how they set prices for these transactions .
That turns out to be especially so for high - margin products like drugs , which in pill form cost only a few cents each to make once they have been invented , but can be sold for several dollars apiece .
The hefty profit margins result in part from patents that can protect the drugs from competition for years .
And by transferring those valuable patents overseas , companies can declare that their profits should follow the patents overseas as well .
Under the rules of transfer pricing , if a company moves patents or other so - called intangibles from its United States division to a foreign subsidiary , the foreign unit is supposed to pay the American division a fair - market price .
But outsiders have a difficult time determining if companies have properly assessed the value of patents , trademarks and other intangible properties .
To further complicate matters , some corporate subsidiaries in tax - haven countries , like Singapore and the Netherlands , now directly finance research in the United States .
So they own the patents without ever having to “ buy ” them from their American parents , Mr. McIntyre said .
The NPD Group has released its monthly console sales numbers for June .
These are important not only because the console war is a guerrilla activity with month - by - month sales being an important way to gauge consumer interest , but because with June 's numbers , we can now look at the first half of the year and see who is doing well in moving hardware and who is falling behind .
The good news is that people are spending money on gaming : spending on games for June from last year is up 31 percent .
If you look at year to date numbers , total spending in 2007 is $ 6.10 billion , up a staggering 43 percent from 2006's $ 4.25 billion .
Spending on hardware comes to $ 2.3 billion , which is a 71 percent gain from last year 's June total of $ 1.37 billion .
Software is likewise up 24 percent for consoles and 35 percent for portables from last year .
People are buying games , but more importantly , they 're buying systems .
Data source : NPD Group
Which systems are they buying ?
We 've put together the sales totals for the last four months , and while there is some variance , everyone seems to have settled into a nicely worn rut .
The DS and Wii are obvious stunners when it comes to units shifted , with the PS2 still a strong seller .
The PSP is also doing well and is the only system that has been moving upwards as times goes on .
The newly redesigned system will likely increase sales .
While Nintendo is clearly the king of portables , that should n't take away from the fact that Sony seems to have a nicely viable system that has cleared out its own corner of the portable market .
The PlayStation 3 is showing some truly dismal numbers , but we 'll hold off judgement of the system 's fate until next month , when we see the fruits of Sony 's supposed price drop .
Data source : NPD Group
The overall sales information for the first half of the year shows no one coming close to dethroning the DS 's 2.68 million consoles moved , an amazing achievement for a portable .
The second place winner is the Nintendo Wii , which handily defeats every other system being tracked .
Snarky commentators may note that we still do n't have a " next - generation " system that outsells the PS2 , but I 'll leave that argument alone .
The PS2 is going strong with 1.52 million units sold in the first six months of the year , but Sony needs to start converting those gamers to PlayStation 3 buyers .
The PS3 did n't even come close to selling a million units in the first half of the year ( it moved 763,000 units ) .
The 360 , true to form , is selling at a mediocre pace , and with a $ 1 billion + loss due to design flaws and red ring of death issues , sales could be in a more precarious place than Microsoft would like to admit .
The company will release a new Halo 3 edition in the coming months , but with consumers unsure of product quality , gamers may prove a little gun-shy when it comes to buying 360 hardware .
Looking at software sales , Nintendo is n't only selling gamers on hardware .
They 're also making sure people are feeding their Wiis and DS systems with Nintendo games .
Out of the top 20 games sold in June , Nintendo holds nine slots , including the top four positions .
Year to date ?
Nintendo has a staggering six of the 10 top slots , including the top three .
In other words , Nintendo 's domination of the field does n't end with systems : they are getting gamers to spend money on software as well , most of which are first - party games .
The PS2 has two slots in the top ten games for the first half of the year with Guitar Hero 2 and God of War 2 , and the 360 had one game on the year - to - date bestseller list : Crackdown .
The PS3 has no games in the top twenty list for June , nor the top ten for the first half of the year .
Clearly the only big winner for 2007 so far is Nintendo .
Sony has yet to sell the PlayStation 3 hardware in any numbers and is instead leaning on its successful PS2 and PSP business to see it through , a strategy with a relatively short half - life .
The 360 does n't look so hot with middling sales numbers , a very public black eye with the red ring of death issue , and the loss of one of the most public faces of the business , Peter Moore .
While overall sales are up , the market is at a very uneven place right now , and it 's unclear if consumers are spending these huge amounts on the gaming industry in general , or simply on Nintendo .
We look forward to seeing forward movement from the PlayStation in July .
Remember in March and early April , when everyone was cheering the strong sales of existing homes during the month of February ?
Perhaps we were finally turning the corner , right ?
The National Association of Realtors ’ index for pending sales of existing homes rose in February at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.7 percent .
The index is well below where it was a year ago but stronger than investors expected , reassuring them that the housing sector , while weak , is not being pummeled by the struggling subprime mortgage sector .
Some folks thought the market had done a 180 .
But it now appears to be little more than a stutter - step .
The market juked the perma-bulls right out of their cleats on this one !
Sales of existing homes plunged in March by the largest amount in nearly two decades , reflecting bad weather and increasing problems in the subprime mortgage market , a real estate trade group reported Tuesday .
The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell by 8.4 percent in March , compared to February .
It was the biggest one - month decline since a 12.6 percent drop in January 1989 , another period of recession conditions in housing .
The drop left sales in March at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.12 million units , the slowest pace since June 2003 .
The steep sales decline was accompanied by an eighth straight fall in median home prices , the longest such period of falling prices on record .
The median price fell to $ 217,000 , a drop of 0.3 percent from the price a year ago .
The fall in sales in March was bigger than had been expected and it dashed hopes that housing was beginning to mount a recovery after last yearâ€™s big slump .
That slowdown occurred after five years in which sales of both existing and new homes had set records .
Everyone said , as they always do in a major asset bubble market , that “ this one is different ” .
And it some senses , they ’re right , real estate is different .
But different does n’t preclude a crash .
If you hold $ 500 K in a technology stock , and you need to liquidate as it ’s dropping like a rock , you might sell for $ 300 K in a day just to get rid of it , because you know it will be worthless tomorrow .
If you own a $ 500 K home , though , you ca n’t get rid of it in a day , you ’re in debt to pay for it , and unlike the technology stock , it will never be completely worthless .
But that does n’t mean that the market ca n’t reprice it at $ 300 K and screw you .
Oh , and despite what they said last month , it now appears that they see the error of their ways :
Lereah said that the troubles in mortgage lending were also playing a significant part in depressing sales .
Lenders have tightened standards with the rising delinquencies in mortgages especially in the subprime market , where borrowers with weak credit histories obtained their loans .
This has been brewing for a long time , and it does n’t take a rocket surgeon to have seen it coming .
You flood the market with liquidity , loosen interest rates and lending standards , and you create an asset bubble .
It had to burst or deflate .
With housing , it ’s tough to burst , because there is inherent value , but it ’s starting to deflate quite rapidly now .
Hat Tip : Doug
Back around the early 1900s , the universe was a fairly simple place .
It was static , had always been there , and largely consisted of our own galaxy and a few neighboring bits of matter .
Over the course of the 20th century , that view collapsed .
Many sources of light were revealed not be stars , but rather galaxies like ( and , in many cases , unlike ) our own .
Distant galaxies were found to be rocketing away from us , propelled by the unfolding of the universe itself , which has accelerated since the big bang .
Modern cosmology has revealed a universe teeming with dark matter and unseen energy , entering a new stage of inflation .
According to a paper that will appear in October ( arXiv link ) , we 're lucky to be able to reach this understanding — literally .
The authors of the paper run the clock forward 100 billion years and reveal that it 's going back to the future , a conclusion clear in the paper 's title : The Return of a Static universe and the End of Cosmology .
The 100 - billion - year figure was chosen because that 's expected to be the lifespan of the longest - lived stars .
By that time , only clusters of galaxies will be bound together strongly enough to resist the Hubble expansion .
In our case , that means the Milky Way , Andromeda , and a number of smaller globular clusters in our neighborhood .
By that time , we 'll have collided and merged with Andromeda , making the local group one big galaxy .
By then , however , everything else we can see will have been pushed so far away by the universe 's expansion that all other sources of light will have been redshifted beyond our ability to detect them .
All matter other than that in our galaxy will be invisible , and our view of the universe will look suspiciously like it did in the pre-Hubble days .
The cosmic microwave background , which has provided our most detailed understanding of the Big Bang , will also be gone .
Its wavelength will have been shifted to a full meter , and its intensity will drop by 12 orders of magnitude .
Even before then , however , the frequency will reach that of the interstellar plasma and be buried in the noise — the stuff of the universe itself will mask the evidence of its origin .
Other evidence for the Big Bang comes from the amount of deuterium and helium isotopes in the universe .
By 100 billion years from now , however , much of the deuterium will have been burned in stars , with lots of helium produced in the process , erasing this evidence of our history .
Worse still , we currently measure early deuterium levels by checking its absorbence of light from distant quasars .
In the future , those quasars will have vanished .
Observers would still be able to piece together the age of our local cluster , based on a combination of knowledge about how elements are produced in stars and measuring their current abundance .
But , in the end , the rest of the universe will vanish , taking with it any evidence of the Big Bang and some of its fundamental properties , such as dark energy .
The authors go on to ponder what this means in terms of the anthropic principle : the idea that we exist in a universe that 's got conditions favorable to life largely because anything else would preclude any life arising that could ponder the universe .
They suggest that there 's another layer of complexity on top of that , namely that we only recognize that there is an anthropic principle because we came along at the right time .
Too much earlier , and we would n't be able to detect that the universe is in a new inflationary era , which tells us that it 's dominated by dark energy .
Too much later , and we would n't be able to know that there 's a universe at all .
As the authors put it , " we live in a very special time in the evolution of the universe : the time at which we can observationally verify that we live in a very special time in the evolution of the universe ! "
Herd Mentality ?
The Freakonomics of Boarding a Bus
A few days a week , I bring my daughter to nursery school on the East Side of Manhattan .
( On the other days , I bring my son to kindergarten ; next year , they will blessedly attend the same school . )
We live on the West Side , and usually take the bus across town .
It is a busy time of day .
At the bus stop closest to our apartment ( we ’ll call this Point A ) , there are often 40 or 50 people waiting for the bus .
This is largely because there is a subway stop right there ; a lot of people take the train from uptown or downtown , then go aboveground to catch the crosstown bus .
I do n’t like crowds much in general ( I know : what am I doing living in New York ? ) , and I especially do n’t like fighting a crowd when I ’m trying to cram onto a bus with my five - year - old daughter .
Because there are so many people waiting for a bus at Point A , we have perhaps a 30 % chance of getting aboard the first bus that stops there , and probably an 80 % chance of getting aboard one of the first two buses that stop at Point A .
( The first bus to come along after a very crowded bus is usually less crowded , but not always . )
As for getting a seat on the bus , I ’d say we have perhaps a 10 % chance of sitting down on either of the first two buses at Point A .
It ’s not such a long ride across town , maybe 15 minutes , but standing on a crowded bus in winter gear , my daughter ’s lunch getting smushed in her backpack , is n’t the ideal way to start the day .
Point A is so crowded that when eastbound passengers get off the bus at Point A , using the bus ’s back door , a surge of people rush onto the bus via the back door , which means that a ) they do n’t pay , since the paybox is up front and b ) they take room away from the people who are legitimately waiting at the head of the crowd to get on the bus .
So a while ago , we started walking a block west to catch the bus at what we ’ll call Point B. Point B is perhaps 250 yards west of — that is , further from our East Side destination — than Point A . But at Point B , the lines are considerably shorter , and the buses arrive less crowded .
At Point B , we have a 90 % chance of getting aboard the first bus that arrives , and perhaps a 40 % chance of getting a seat .
To me , this seems well worth the effort and time of walking 250 yards .
Once we hit upon this solution , we have n’t boarded a single bus at Point A .
We get to sit ; we get to listen to the iPod together ( we both love Lily Allen , and I do n’t worry so much about the fresh parts since Lily ’s British accent renders them nearly indecipherable for Anya ) ; we do n’t arrive with a smushed lunch .
But what I can’t figure out is why no other bus passengers at Point A do what we do .
To anyone standing at Point A morning after morning , the conditions there are plainly bad .
The conditions at Point B are clearly better since a ) Point B is close enough to see with the naked eye and b ) the buses that arrive at Point A from Point B often have room on them , although only for the first 10 or 20 passengers trying to board at Point A .
Personally , I am happy that more people at Point A do n’t go to Point B ( which would make me have to consider boarding at Point C ) , but I do n’t understand why this is so .
Here are a few possibilities :
1. Walking 250 yards does n’t seem like a worthwhile investment to improve a short , if miserable , experience .
2 . Having just gotten off the subway , the Point A passengers are already broken in spirit and can’t muster the energy to improve their commuting lot .
3. Perhaps some Point A passengers simply never think about the existence of a Point B , or at least the conditions thereof .
4 . There is a herd at Point A ; people may not like being part of a herd , but psychologically they are somehow comforted by it ; they succumb to “ herd mentality ” and unthinkingly tag along — because if everyone else is doing it , it must be the thing to do .
Personally , I am persuaded that all four points may be valid in varying measures , and there are undoubtedly additional points to be made .
But if I had to pick an outright winner , I ’d say No. 4 : the herd mentality .
What do you think ?
And what are some other examples of herd mentality that you have encountered ?
Iraq blames kidnap of Britons on Shiite militia ; Video : Kidnappings a challenge to troop ' surge ' RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 30 , 2007 Print This Email This Iraqi and British officials scrambled Wednesday to get to the bottom of the brazen daylight kidnapping of five British contractors snatched from a finance ministry building in Baghdad .
The Britons -- a consultant and his four armed bodyguards -- were taken on Tuesday by a large group on gunmen in Iraqi police uniforms .
" We are pursuing this case very vigorously , I would say , because the nature of this kidnapping is very strange , " Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told AFP .
" The location of this finance ministry computer centre and the nature of the operation and the number of people involved , I think all indicate more a militia than a terrorist group , let 's say , " he added .
In an earlier interview with BBC radio , Zebari noted the raid took place near Sadr City , a stronghold for radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army militia , but he told AFP it was too soon to blame a specific group .
Nevertheless , the nature of the kidnapping clearly points towards the involvement of one of the Shiite militant groups that has infiltrated Iraqi forces , rather than a Sunni insurgent outfit such as Al - Qaeda , he said .
Representatives of Sadr 's movement , which controls Sadr City and fields thousands of militia fighters , many of whom have infiltrated police units , categorically denied any involvement in the operation .
" Kidnapping operations conflict with the peaceful steps that Sadr advocates and are in direct contradiction with the course his office is adopting now , " spokesman Salah al - Ubaidi told AFP from the movement 's base in Najaf .
The Iraqi presidency , prime minister 's office and interior ministry refused to comment , while the US military said the kidnap was a matter for the British embassy .
Witnesses outside the downtown ministry building where the kidnapping took place , said the operation appeared well organised and was carried out by gunmen in official vehicles and uniforms .
" They went inside and escorted out the foreigners , but one managed to hide in the basement , " said one of ministry 's security guards who declined to reveal his name because of the extreme sensitivity of the situation .
US forces arrived on the scene an hour later , cordoned off the area and conducted a number of searches , witnesses said .
The American troops took the foreigner away , along with several more finance ministry guards .
" We have been doing some investigations , asking some questions in pursuit of our regular missions , " US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Garver said .
Separately , the military announced that it had raided a Sadr City kidnapping cell , but it was not clear whether this was linked to the missing Britons .
" Two suspected terrorists were detained and one was wounded during raids targeting individuals believed to be responsible for , and active participants in , a known kidnapping cell as well as attacks on coalition forces , " it said .
All told , US - led forces detained " 23 suspected terrorists " in raids around Iraq on Wednesday , the military statement said .
Britain 's top - secret " Cobra " crisis unit was expected to meet for a second straight day Wednesday to find a way to secure the release of the Britons .
" We 're working hard on the ground , we 're liaising with the Iraqi authorities , " said a British Foreign Office spokesman in London .
" We have to establish the facts and there will be all sorts of decisions taken . "
Four of the five Britons were members of a security detail working for Garda World , a Canadian firm , while the fifth was their client , a consultant under contract to the US government to train Iraqi civil servants .
Witnesses to the abduction said it unfolded without much violence after four blue and white pickup trucks with crude armour welded on them , like those used by the National Police , pulled up to the building .
" They were led by a major and a very official looking man wearing a suit , " said a shopkeeper who asked not to be named .
" They went in , stayed for only 15 minutes and then left -- I heard one shot but thought someone had made a mistake . "
A building guard said the gunmen were polite and explained they were with the Commission on Public Integrity , an anti-graft agency .
" They started taking photos of the building and said ' We have official orders ' , " he added .
Saad Mohammed , who works as a parking attendant near the building , said that at first everything seemed normal , even as the foreigners were brought out of the building and driven off .
" Then all the civil servants and people at the building came rushing out .
They were terrified and hysterical and yelling there had been a kidnapping , " he added .
Mass kidnappings by uniformed men were common last year and were believed to be the work of Shiite militias with close ties to the police .
In the video below , the BBC reports that the kidnappings are a " challenge " to U.S. " surge " :
Republican presidential candidate Congressman Ron Paul When Texas Congressman Ron Paul entered the race for next year 's Republican presidential nomination , few political analysts paid much notice .
Paul has no backing from political bigwigs or any campaign war chest to speak of .
As the Libertarian Party presidential nominee in 1988 he won less than one - half of 1 percent of the national vote .
Yet despite his status among the longest of the long shots , the 71 - year - old has become one of the internet 's most omnipresent –- and some say most irritating -– subjects .
According to Technorati , " Ron Paul " is one of the web 's most searched - for terms .
News about Paul has an outsize presence on Digg and reddit , two sites that allow users to highlight their preferred content .
Paul 's
YouTube channel has been viewed over one million times , dwarfing efforts from competitors like John McCain and Rudy Giuliani .
The Ron Paul internet boom has born everything from Belgians for Ron Paul to a reggae music video promoting Paul 's views on monetary policy and habeas corpus .
During the 2004 election , a web - savvy campaign staff helped turn Howard Dean 's anti-war candidacy into the first online political phenomenon .
But the Ron Paul frenzy seems to have sprung from the internet itself .
Paul 's libertarian message – he is against big government , the war , and pretty much anything that costs taxpayers money – has attracted a group of anti-establishment , tech - savvy supporters who have taken everyone by surprise .
" The people who are actually working for the campaign are a little overwhelmed with what 's happening , " says Alex Wallenwein , a supporter who organized two of the 362 Meetup.com groups dedicated to Paul .
To many immersed in the political blogosphere , Paul 's passionate supporters seem to be everywhere at once .
Editors of political websites are inundated with angry e-mails demanding they devote more coverage to Paul .
Blog posts that criticize Paul are often followed by hundreds of livid comments from his fans .
Most frustrating to those not on board the Ron Paul bandwagon , he routinely ranks first in online presidential polls on sites ranging from CNN.com to niche political blogs .
Conversely , Paul rates in the low single digits in scientific telephone polls and few political pundits afford him any chance of winning the nomination .
When the editors at National Journal 's The Hotline compiled their well - respected White House 2008 Rankings in May , they put Paul in last place among the 12 Republicans running , tacking on a fed - up message to his fans : " Just please stop e-mailing us . "
They are n't the only ones who see Paul supporters as a nuisance .
Many users of Digg and reddit are perplexed to see story after story about Paul topping lists of the most popular news .
Critics say Paul supporters disregard the spirit of these social content sites by posting messages on blogs that encourage readers to go to Digg or reddit and vote for every story about Paul .
One Digg user complained Paul supporters are violating the site 's terms of service , which prohibit any organized effort that artificially alters the most popular news list .
Many prominent bloggers complain Paul 's supporters have tainted informal , unscientific polls by organizing large - scale get - out - the - vote campaigns through blogs and social networking sites .
As a result , the polls are less a measure of which candidate has the most support than whose fans are putting the most time into their voting efforts .
Matt Margolis runs GOP Straw Polls , a popular series of monthly surveys that are posted on numerous blogs in an attempt to gauge how much support candidates have throughout the conservative blogosphere .
Margolis originally did n't include Paul in the polls but added his name when his fan base began to grow .
Paul now dominates the polls , winning nearly half of all ballots cast in the most recent survey .
Margolis says Paul 's success is the result of his supporters ' " coordinated efforts to show themselves and their power in these polls . "
While most readers will vote once or twice and then move on , Margolis says Paul fans are visiting numerous blogs hosting the polls and voting repeatedly , while encouraging others to do the same through messages on MySpace , Facebook and blogs .
" There is certainly a higher frequency of multiple voting among Paul supporters than others , " says Margolis .
" I was perfectly fine with giving them the opportunity to vote for him .
But they make the data of the poll almost useless by their methods . "
Many bloggers have expressed concern that Paul 's massive online vote totals could only be accomplished through the use of bots that automatically send hundreds of votes .
While no one has presented evidence to prove this , several blogs have removed Paul 's name from their polls .
Not surprisingly , Paul fans have responded with streams of angry e-mails .
Paul supporters say his success is just the results of the wild , wild web operating at its finest , giving voice to a movement that would otherwise find no traction in traditional media .
" If we have 20,000 passionate supporters who go and vote in an online poll and Rudy Giuliani can only get 1,000 , we 're not going to apologize for that , " says Jesse Benton , Paul 's campaign communication director .
Michael Nystrom , founder of the Daily Paul blog , says , " What I find interesting is that other candidates have more money , but Ron Paul has something money can't buy , and that 's this very active online community . "
Whether or not Paul 's online support translates into any real world success , it is clear this candidate has stumbled upon a new brand of internet activism that has the rest of the web scrambling to adapt .

For Jezebel ’s 10th anniversary , we ’re revisiting some classic posts from our archive .
Here ’s to the next ten .

It ’s time for the big reveal for our unretouched cover - image contest , and , well , our winner is the July cover of Redbook , on which country singer Faith Hill ( and , on a separate cover , her hubby Tim McGraw ) appeared as beautiful and accessible - seeming as usual .
What ’s uncanny about this cover is that when the image was passed our way , we had just been flipping through Redbook , reminding ourselves that we ’d stop hating women ’s magazines as soon as our lives became shitty enough to warrant reading Redbook and our husbands and immune systems suddenly replaced celebrities and consumerism on our personal Most Toxic lists , when we paused to think , “ Wow , Faith Hill is really hot . ”
We ’d had this thought before about Faith Hill , probably in the context of a Revlon display at the CVS or something , but reading this spread in the July Redbook we had one of those moments we often have with Katie Holmes wherein we were like , “ Wow .
She is just really really really pretty .
Although we do n’t much like her taste in men . ”
Anyway , after the jump , we present the before and after of Faith Hill , Redbook magazine , July 2007 .
We ’ll be posting more on this throughout the day , including a point - by - point annotation ( read : close - ups ! ) of just what Redbook editors / art directors found so abhorrent about an already - above - average 39 - year - old country music star and mom to three that they had to retouch her into something more befitting the cover of Cosmopolitan .

I recently had the opportunity to read through some of the , brand new , Learning jQuery book and I wanted to take this opportunity to write up some of my thoughts concerning the jQuery project and open source in general .
Learning jQuery was written by Karl Swedberg and Jonathan Chaffer and I feel lucky that they were the first to have been given the opportunity to write about jQuery .
Being part of the core jQuery team , I ’ve had the opportunity to come to know Karl quite well in the past months , and especially within the context of his book writing effort .
Looking at the end result , it ’s clear that his skills as both a developer , and a former English teacher , will suit the reader well .
What ’s most interesting for me , though , is the subject matter and context of the book .
jQuery has always meant something completely different to me , than to most people , so to see it described in such a frank and descriptive manner is quite an experience .
For example , whenever I talk about jQuery , I inevitably discuss the design decisions that surrounded picking the feature - set that I did , and why I chose to set the focus of the library on DOM interaction above all else .
Whereas , Learning jQuery immediately jumps into “ What You Can Do ” with the library , followed by many chapters of “ How You Can Do It ” .
In the context of the book it works quite well , but it provides a stark contrast , for myself , as to how the library relates to me , personally .
For example , the sum total of my work and design decisions that have gone into the library is relegated to a single line of a single paragraph at the start of the book :
Created by John Resig , jQuery is an open - source project with a dedicated core team of top - notch JavaScript developers .
It provides a wide range of features , an easy - to - learn syntax , and robust cross platform compatibility in a single file …
Seeing my work divorced from my personal experience is surreal and fantastic , for all that I know about jQuery is my personal experiences in creating , and sculpting , it over the past couple years .
Seeing the library progress to a point that transcends anything that I ’ve put into it is both exciting and daunting .
For me , jQuery is much more than a block of code .
It ’s the sum total of experiences that have transpired over the years in order to make the library happen .
The considerable ups - and - downs , the struggle of development together with the excitement of seeing it grow and succeed .
Growing close with its users and fellow team members , understanding them and trying to grow and adapt .
Seeing this long tome talking about jQuery and discussing it like a proper tool , as opposed to the experience that it ’s come to encapsulate for me is what makes this such a strange read for me .
I ’m not the only one who enjoys jQuery on a plane that is far different from a normal tool - user relationship .
I do n’t know if I can properly encapsulate why this is , but it ’s something that you ca n’t get from reading a book , nor produce simply through following tutorials .
It ’s almost cliche , at this point , to say that your open source project is community - oriented , or that you want to focus on helping new users get started .
But it ’s not just an orientation for jQuery , it ’s the liquid - oxygen fuel for the project .
I ’ll confess that I ’ve never truly participated in a large open source project before , nor have I really , truly , understood how they worked internally .
Taking nuggets of information that I could pan from projects like Drupal and Dojo , I began to better understand how an open source project could be structured and run .
Before that point , though , I made a couple ( and in retrospect , rather radical ) decisions that have helped to truly shape the project and make it what it is today .
The first decision that I made with the library was to sculpt a sort - of custom programming language around the concept of HTML - JavaScript interaction .
Instead of enhancing the normal DOM layer ( using simplified method names , for example ) , I instead decided to make selectors the absolute core of the library ( making it a sort - of CSS - JavaScript - HTML - DOM domain specific language ) .
An example of jQuery - as - a - language :
$ ( " div.section " ) . find ( " ul " ) .addClass ( " sectionlist " ) .hide ( ) .end ( ) . filter ( " . header " ) . find ( " h1 " ) .css ( " fontSize " , 20 ) .click ( function ( ) { $ ( " ul.sectionlist " ) .
show ( ) ; } ) .end ( ) .end ( ) ;
I love being able to see users who truly understand just how different the end result can be , especially in comparison to normal DOM scripting .
There ’s a specific moment where it just clicks for them , where they realize that , this tool that they had been using , was in fact much much more than that all along .
And suddenly their understanding of how to write dynamic web applications completely shifts .
It ’s an incredible thing , and absolutely my favorite part of the jQuery project .
The next decision was to form a jQuery Evangelism team , led by Rey Bango , to drive the jQuery community .
At first , I only really expected this team to focus on things like handling community participation on the mailing list and blog tracking / response , but it has since progressed rather drastically .
Blog tracking is a particularly interesting area of project evangelism .
A couple points had come up to make it necessary : First , that it was important to get a good response to user comments and questions ( and it had simply overwhelmed me , personally ) and secondly , that it was important to get a good , consistent , response to people , coming from the project itself .
( We had had a number of instances where misinformation was spread , and although it was done with best intentions , it was better that we get an accurate message out first , acting as a definitive voice of the project . )
Tracking is also quite controversial .
We ’ve been able to answer the questions and doubts of dozens of bloggers .
The end result being users who are n’t just interested in this new project , but almost fanatical .
This brings up the second interesting point about evangelism , and its logical next step : relation management .
While we do n’t , internally , yet have a proper CRM to keep track of all our users ( we ’re in the process of switching to Basecamp to try and make this possible ) we do keep very close ties with all of users , even giving special attention to high profile companies and open source projects ( at our discretion ) .
This is something that the evangelism team really takes to heart , and something that most users do n’t see .
We keep internal threads to track specific problems that a user might be having , trying to figure out ways that we can best help them ( either through bug fixes , pointers to specific resources , or simply affirmation that we ’re there and we care about their progress with jQuery ) .
We do n’t really have a specific means of picking which people we pay extra attention to ( if we were a business , it would be the customers that paid us the most , I would assume ) but it boils down to which people have the biggest opportunity to make the project look good .
( So open source projects , companies with public - facing web sites , and vocal / influential users and bloggers ; and roughly in the order too . )
This is something that we ’re still working on , and we ’re starting to get real good at it .
What ’s interesting about this , though , is that this is what helps us to turn a normal user into a devoted user – one whose interest in the project goes beyond that of the normal tool - user relationship .
All of this is related .
How we run the project , and how you use the code , is fundamentally very different from most open source projects , and most JavaScript libraries .

Google reported disappointing quarterly earnings Thursday prompting CNN to state that the " stock had tumbled " .
The Journal said more soberly that the stock merely " fell 5 % after hours , while the National Inquirer reported that the stock " had completely disappeared " .
This brings to our attention the complete lack of uniformity in describing the inevitable ebb and flow of company stock .
The twin pillars of stock volatility reporting are the verbs " soar " and " tumble " Closely followed by the verbs " impress " and " disappoint "
And occasionally accompanied by the terms " belly - flop " , " lurch " , " crater " and " implode "
But just how much a stock has to rise or fall to deserve one of these descriptors is highly uncertain .
Uncertainty can breed rumor , and rumor can breed innuendo ( perhaps with a little bit of contempt ) .
Creating a vicious circle sitting squarely around the shoulders of the company in question .
Sneaky Business believes a standard taxonomy is needed to deliver " apples to apples " comparisons across companies .
We provide just such a table below in the hope that some sanity can return to the hyperbole of quarterly earnings reports .
Stock Movement Acceptable Descriptive Verbs > 50 % Soar , explode , ejaculate + 10 % to 50 % Leap , rush , jump , bungee + 1 % to 10 % Float , rise , gain a leg up , swagger + / - 1 % Languish , meander , loiter , nap , snooze - 1 % to 10 % Stagger , slide , stumble , lurch - 10 % to 50 % Tumble , belly - flop , jack - knife , fall arse - over - tit < 50 % Implode , self - immolate , FUBAR

Many of you wrote last week to say that I was too harsh on my friend Gillian , the woman with the “ I can 't ” attitude .
Perhaps you 're right — I may have given up too early .
I used to live like she does , and if I can turn it around , anyone can .
For a decade I was a deficit spender .
I spent more than I earned .
I used credit cards to fund a lifestyle that was beyond my means .
Eventually I wised up — I destroyed my credit cards and cancelled my accounts , but my worries were n't over yet .
I was n't digging any deeper , but I was still stuck at the bottom of a hole : I was living paycheck - to - paycheck .
Twice a month I would deposit my paycheck , pay my bills , and then look to see how much was left .
Whether the surplus was $ 20 or $ 200 , I made plans for it : comic books , video games , clothes , whatever .
I used to joke that I was an expert at spending every penny I had .
Except that it was no joke .
Late at night , when I could n't sleep , I would wonder why I could never get ahead .
I lived like this for years .
You can maintain a paycheck - to - paycheck lifestyle for a long time if you 're not taking on new debt ( and if disaster does n't strike ) .
Here 's another way to look at it :
If you spend more than you earn , you are acquiring debt .
than you earn , you are acquiring debt .
If you spend about what you earn , you are living paycheck - to - paycheck .
If you spend less than you earn , you are acquiring wealth .
I do n't know about you , but my goal is the latter .
Escaping the paycheck - to - paycheck lifestyle means building positive cash flow , getting ahead of your expenses .
Instead of spending exactly what you earn , you need to save something every month ; even $ 25 or $ 50 can make a difference .
Once you start , this amount has a tendency to snowball .
For me , a $ 25 surplus grew into a $ 100 surplus , which grew into $ 300 per month and more !
But how do you start generating this surplus ?
How do you escape from the paycheck - to - paycheck pit ?
Here are some ideas that worked for me — one or more of them may work for Gillian .
Or for you .
Start a savings account .
For years I resisted the idea of opening a savings account .
“ Why should I ? ” I said .
“ I do n't have money to save .
I barely have anything in my checking account ! ”
But when I finally did open a savings account three years ago , a funny thing happened .
I started finding money to stash there .
It was n't much at first — $ 20 here , $ 75 there — but in time , it made a difference .
Before long I had developed the savings habit .

Pay yourself first .
The best way to begin your escape is to save first , before you do anything else with your paycheck .
I know this can be difficult .
You worry that you wo n't have enough for your bills , for gas , for food .
But the danger is that if you do n't set the money aside first , you 'll just spend it .
Have a small amount — $ 25 ? $ 50 ? — automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into savings .
Chances are you wo n't even miss the money .

Spend with purpose .
You may want to consider a budget .
Budgets are n't scary , and they 're not difficult .
Some people find them liberating .
There are a variety of computer budgeting tools available , including : PearBudget YNAB – You Need a Budget The ever - evolving Get Rich Slowly budget spreadsheet by Stephen Popick .

There are a variety of computer budgeting tools available , including : Draft a spending plan .
I do n't keep a budget , but I do create a financial plan every few months .
It 's nothing more than a quick financial snapshot showing my income and expenses .
I also list upcoming major outlays .
This helps me keep my financial goals in mind as I go about my daily life .
It 's easier for me to decide not to buy the latest Spider - Man comic when I remember that I 'm saving for a trip to Europe .

Attack your debt .
These methods are great , but if you really want to free up cash , pay off a debt .
I recommend using a debt snowball to tackle your obligations one after the other .
But if your goal is to ease financial pressure ASAP , you may want to try a slightly different approach .
Pay off your debt with the smallest balance , but instead of rolling the freed cash flow into the next debt , use it to establish a savings buffer .

Cut costs .
This one 's obvious , but can be difficult .
My friend Gillian views cutting costs as deprivation .
If you 're willing to look behind the immediate sacrifices to the long - term gains , cutting costs is an excellent , quick way to free up cash .
There are a million little things you can do to save money now .

Boost your income .
Many people have suggestions for how to cut costs , but few remember there 's a second side to the wealth equation .
Earning extra money helps just as much as practicing frugality , and sometimes hurts less .
But how do you get extra cash ?
Find a part - time job for a few months .
Sell some of the stuff you 've acquired over the years .
Ask your boss for a raise .
Find a way to make money from your hobbies .

Avoid lifestyle inflation .
A final way to escape the paycheck - to - paycheck purgatory is to opt out of lifestyle inflation .
When you get a raise , do n't adjust your standard of living to match .
Use part of this new money to pay off debt , and another part to accelerate your savings .
When your friends show you their new iPhones , ooh and aah , but resist the urge to get one yourself .
Learn to love what you already have .
When I became serious about my finances , I realized that living paycheck - to - paycheck was dangerous .
I was always one disaster away from returning to the credit bandwagon .
I made a resolution to stop living on the edge and to start saving .
It was difficult at first .
Old habits die hard .
But with time and persistence — and with the habits above — I made the switch .
Now , a couple years further on , I 'm just beginning to profit from my hard work .
I have a monthly cash surplus .
I have escaped from the paycheck - to - paycheck lifestyle .
Heaven
Fish ( fly - replete , in depth of June ,
Dawdling away their wat 'ry noon )
Ponder deep wisdom , dark or clear ,
Each secret fishy hope or fear .
Fish say , they have their Stream and Pond ;
But is there anything Beyond ?
This life cannot be All , they swear ,
For how unpleasant , if it were !
One may not doubt that , somehow , Good
Shall come of Water and of Mud ;
And , sure , the reverent eye must see
A Purpose in Liquidity .
We darkly know , by Faith we cry ,
The future is not Wholly Dry .
Mud unto mud !-- Death eddies near --
Not here the appointed End , not here !
But somewhere , beyond Space and Time ,
Is wetter water , slimier slime !
And there ( they trust ) there swimmeth One
Who swam ere rivers were begun ,
Immense , of fishy form and mind ,
Squamous , omnipotent , and kind ;
And under that Almighty Fin ,
The littlest fish may enter in .
Oh !
never fly conceals a hook ,
Fish say , in the Eternal Brook ,
But more than mundane weeds are there ,
And mud , celestially fair ;
Fat caterpillars drift around ,
And Paradisal grubs are found ;
Unfading moths , immortal flies ,
And the worm that never dies .
And in that Heaven of all their wish ,
There shall be no more land , say fish .

This talk was delivered on June 1 , 2007 , at the Future of Freedom Foundation ‘s Conference on " Restoring the Republic : Foreign Affairs and Civil Liberties . "
There are two clear and present dangers to liberty in America .
One is known as the left , and the other is known as the right .
They are dangerous because they seek to use government to mold society into a form they seek , rather than the form that liberty achieves if society is left on its own .
I ’m going to assume that the left and the right come to their views sincerely , that their passion for using government is driven by some fear that the absence of government would yield catastrophe .
So the burden of my talk today will be to identify and explain the common thread that connects the worldview of the left and the right , and suggest that they are both wrong about the capacity of society , whether it is defined locally or internationally , to manage itself .
Let us begin with the question : why should we have confidence in the notion that society can develop on its own , that it contains within itself the capacity for self - management ?
Another way to ask the question : why do the advocates of leviathan believe that the members of society are incapable of achieving cooperative engagement in the absence of the state ?
The discovery of this capacity for cooperation was the great intellectual contribution of the classical liberal school that gave rise to the American Revolution .
It grew out of a belief that whatever imperfections social self - organization had , there was nothing that centralized government could do to improve it .
They took the daring step of tossing off the rule of the state in favor of complete self - government .
They did n’t fear chaos .
They looked forward to liberty .
This event was the product of the liberal idea , as held by most all sectors of society .
Liberalism did not seek utopia .
It sought liberty under the conviction that society had a built - in mechanism that permitted individual members to achieve a harmony of interests .
They believed it to be true because they lived it .
The belief in this harmony of interests was the great passion of the old liberal intellectuals , of which Thomas Jefferson was a leading exponent .
After the revolution , when government began to regroup and reconsolidate , the liberal idea began to gain detractors .
John Adams , whom Jefferson beat in the great presidential election of 1800 , never stopped resenting Jefferson ’s suspicions toward power and opposition to practically everything the federal government wanted to do .
It was Jefferson ’s conviction that liberty yielded social cooperation ; it was Adams ’s view that liberty could only be established and sustained through government authority .
These two opposing views persist to this day .
Adams went so far as to level a familiar accusation against Jefferson ’s faith in pure liberty .
Adams wrote him in 1813 : “ You never felt the terrorism of Shays ’ Rebellion in Massachusetts , ….
You certainly never felt the terrorism excited by Genet in 1793 , when ten thousand people in the streets of Philadelphia , day by day , threatened to drag Washington out of his house and effect a revolution in the government … .
I have no doubt you were fast asleep in philosophical tranquility when …
Market Street was as full of men as could stand by one another , and even before my door when some of my domestics , in frenzy , determined to sacrifice their lives in my defence … .
What think you of terrorism , Mr. Jefferson ? ”
So we can see , then , how Shays ’ Rebellion served the government in the same way that 9 - 11 does now : it is held up as an example of the kind of terror that will befall us if we refuse to give government the power and money necessary to make the world peaceful and wonderful .
What Adams conveniently overlooked is that the rebellion of which he spoke was actually sparked by taxation and government - backed credit expansion .
There would have been no need for a revolt had government not created the conditions that led to it .
And so it is with 9 - 11 .
It was government that created the motives that led the hijackers to give up their lives , and it was government that had so regulated airline security that passengers and crew were defenseless in the face of criminals with box cutters .
The right response would have been to roll back the conditions that created the motives for 9 - 11 , and to unleash the power of private enterprise to prevent such attacks in the future .
Instead , the impulse of the state as backed by uninformed public ideology was to escalate the conditions that breed terrorism and put government ever more in charge of airline security .
From Shays ’ Rebellion to 9 - 11 , we see two worldviews of society at work .
One sees the government as a source of liberty and order , and fears society without the state more than any conceivable alternative .
The other sees government as a source of disorder that uses that disorder to enhance its power and material resources at the expense of society .
The left and the right in this country hold to the first view .
The successors to Jefferson hold to the second view , which in Jefferson ’s time was called the liberal view , and which today is called the libertarian view .
There are international parallels in each of these positions .
Conservatives are of the view that a world without a single superpower is chaos and darkness .
The left believes in internationalizing their version of the domestic welfare state under the management of a single supra-national institution .
Libertarians , on the other hand , believe that international society thrives best without either a superpower or a supranational manager .
I maintain that these two views of order constitute the decisive ideological conflict of our time , that which pits the libertarians against the two prevailing ideologies .
The old liberal view lives in the writings of such people as John Locke , Frdric Bastiat , Lord Acton , Alexis de Tocqueville , and , in the 20th century , in the work of Mises , Hayek , and Rothbard .
Hayek himself traced the liberal tradition from Cicero , through the Middle Ages , to John Locke , David Hume , and Immanuel Kant .
The thread that connects all their thought is the idea that society is more capable than government elites in shaping a prosperous order .
In the same way that Locke believed that the nation - state was a threat to human rights and social peace , so Kant envisioned an international order that was unmanaged from the top down but rather generated its own orderly peace .
What was critical for Hayek in the liberal tradition was the conviction that liberty and law could exist in harmony with each other .
Law itself emerged spontaneously from within society as its members sought better ways of managing their own affairs .
The law of which Hayek speaks is law adhered to as a matter of voluntary contract , or what we more commonly refer to as rules .
We have rules that govern the management of subdivisions , or civic organizations , or businesses , or churches .
Or think of merchant law that emerged over many centuries of international trade .
This law exists apart from the state , and reflects the desire of individuals to cooperate toward their own betterment , and the rightful conviction that their own betterment is consistent with the flourishing of society .
In contrast , writes Hayek , there is another tradition of law that sees all rules in society as rising from the state , and always and everywhere must amount to a restriction on the liberty of individuals .
The exponents of this view include the tyrants and despots of the ancient world , and , in modern times , Thomas Hobbes and Karl Marx .
The writings of the latter two are the preeminent influence over what we today call the right and the left .
It is impossible to understand this view of government without first understanding the illiberal view of society .
The illiberal view regards society as essentially unworkable on its own because it is riddled with conflicting interests .
Let us begin with the left .
They believe society has fundamental flaws and deep - rooted conflicts that keep it in some sort of structural imbalance .
All these conflicts and disequilibria cry out for government fixes , for leftists are certain that there is no social problem that a good dose of power ca n’t solve .
If the conflicts they want are not there , they make them up .
They look at what appears to be a happy suburban subdivision and see pathology .
They see an apparently happy marriage and imagine that it is a mask for abuse .
They see a thriving church and think the people inside are being manipulated by a cynical and corrupt pastor .
Their view of the economic system is the same .
They see poor peasants in the third world drinking a Coke or making Nikes , and they cry foul .
They figure that prices do n’t reflect reality but instead are set by large players .
There is a power imbalance at the heart of every exchange , domestically and internationally .
The labor contract is a mere veneer that covers exploitation .
To the brooding leftist , it is inconceivable that people can work out their own problems , that trade can be to people ’s mutual advantage , that society can be essentially self - managing , or that attempts to use government power to reshape and manage people might backfire .
Their faith in government knows few limits ; their faith in people is thin or nonexistent .
This is why they are a danger to liberty .
The remarkable fact about the conflict theory of society held by the left is that it ends up creating more of the very pathologies that they believe have been there from the beginning .
The surest way to drive a wedge between labor and capital is to regulate the labor markets to the point that people cannot make voluntary trades .
Both sides begin to fear each other .
It is the same with relations between races , sexes , the abled and disabled , and any other groups you can name .
It is the same with international relations .
A tariff or trade sanction is nothing but war by another means .
The best path to creating conflict where none need exist is to put a government bureaucracy in charge .
This view is the very heart of the old socialist vision .
They believed that the key conflict in history was between those who owned capital and those who worked for capital .
The gain of the capitalists always comes at the expense of labor ; similarly , the advance of labor can only come from the expropriation of the capitalist class through a revolution that is just because the laborers are only taking back what was expropriated from them .
Now , as time has passed , we ’ve come to see the error of this view .
Capital and labor do not exist in fundamental conflict .
Their relations are managed by contract in the same way that relations between laborers and capitalists are managed by contract .
Moreover , these two groups are not hermetically sealed off from each other .
Capitalists are workers , and workers can be capitalistic owners of their own property .
Only in the most primitive stages does it appear otherwise .
Once it became obvious that Marxism had mischaracterized the workings of capitalism , the left looked for other forms of conflict to confirm their worldview .
Most recently , they have begun to advance the idea that man ’s interests can only be pursued at the expense of nature .
The flourishing of one occurs at the expense of the other .
Thus it is that a seemingly happy and prosperous people could in reality be doing deadly damage to the earth , the interests of which can only be advanced at the expense of prosperous consumers and producers .
The left accepts the reality that this will make everyone poorer , as all forms of socialism do , but they tell us that this is good for us and good for the planet .
The traditional and correct answer to the conflict theory is that there is essentially nothing government can do to improve the workings of society .
During the Great Depression , for example , most everyone on the left thought that government was the only way out .
The hard left favored Communist revolution .
The soft left favored the New Deal .
The old liberals pointed out that it was government itself that brought about the crisis , and that more government intervention could only make matters worse .
This was a rational response , but it did not carry the day .
After the Second World War , we saw the emergence of a strange creature in American life , something that called itself conservatism .
It was opposed to the left in American life , particularly that branch that was sympathetic to Communism .
It counseled vagaries like prudence in public affairs .
But in a crucial way , it adopted one tenet of the leftist worldview : it rejected old liberalism as a vision for how society can work in absence of government .
It adopted a conflict view of society , a different brand rooted in the assertions of Hobbes rather than Marx .
The idea that conflict was at the very heart of society , absent government , was a key aspect of this .
This new thing called conservative adopted some of the rhetoric of the old right .
It defended property and enterprise in economic affairs .
But what was critical was the introduction of a notion that society , if left to its own devices , would collapse into chaos .
This was particularly true in international affairs .
So while the Cold War was originally an invention of the Democrat Harry Truman , it was tailor - made to appeal to conservatives who were looking for an ideological enemy to slay .
It is one thing to say that Communism is an evil ideological system ; it is another to say that we cannot rest until every communist is killed and every Communist government wiped off the face of the earth .
What happened to the non-interventionist views of the old right ?
They were predicated on the idea that there could be a leaderless world order , that nations could get along without one overarching authority and source of law .
But after the war , that too began to change .
A new conviction arose .
Russell Kirk wrote in 1954 that “ civilized society requires distinctions of order , wealth , and responsibility ; it cannot exist without true leadership … society longs for just leadership …. ”
He contrasted this view with what he considered the erroneous opinion of Ludwig von Mises , whom he attacks over the course of many pages .
Mises , wrote Kirk , had exaggerated faith in the rationality of individuals .
Kirk , in contrast , sees that all of history is governed by two great forces : love and hate .
Neither are rational impulses .
In order to achieve the triumph of love over hate , wrote Kirk , the conservative “ looks upon government as a great power for good . ”
And so conservatives threw themselves behind the force of government to achieve their aims , and no matter how many wicked things government did over the years under conservative control , they always told themselves that it was surely better than the much - feared alternative of an unmanaged society .
Kirk became more explicit as the years went on , and after the old liberalism was refashioned by Rothbard as libertarianism , conservatives began to define themselves in opposition to all forms of liberalism .
The government had many things to do in this world , they said .
The police were the thin blue line that separated chaos from order — and forget just how awful the police often are in reality .
The US military empire was all that stood between us and Soviet domination — and pay no attention to the fact that the Soviet economy was itself a basket case .
They became cheerleaders of government power of a different sort .
Frank Chodorov was so fed up with tendencies on the right that he once said : “ anyone who calls me a conservative gets a punch in the nose . ”
We have lived through six years of a Republican president who was backed by conservatives but who still escapes fundamental criticism by them .
After promises of a humble foreign policy , war and war spending define our era .
We ’re told that every problem with war can be solved through more force , there is nothing necessarily wrong with imprisoning people without cause and without legal representation , that torture can be a legitimate wartime tactic , that some countries have to be destroyed in order to be made free , and that we can have all the warfare and welfare we desire at virtually no cost , thanks to the miracle of central banking and debt - driven economic growth .
Some people say that the real problem with the Bush administration is that it is too far left , and that a genuine right - wing government would be better .
I ’m disinclined to believe that , for I detect in the Bush administration a philosophy of governance that departs from that of the left in many ways , except in its unlimited faith in government to keep order , that is , to exercise force and the threat of force .
Elsewhere , I ’ve referred to members of political groups that support the conservative right as “ red - state fascists , ” and I do n’t use that phrase merely for rhetorical purposes .
There was and is such a thing as fascism as a non-leftist form of social theory that puts unlimited faith in the state to correct what they see as flaws in society and the world .
Let ’s look more closely at the conservative view of police power .
While it is true that law itself is critical to freedom , and police can defend rights of life and property , it does not follow that any tax - paid fellow bearing official arms and sporting jackboots is on the side of the good .
Every government regulation and tax is ultimately backed by the police power , so free - market advocates have every reason to be as suspicious of socialist - style police power as anyone on the left .
Uncritical attitudes toward the police lead , in the end , to the support of the police state and , in turn , to the celebration of American imperialism as somehow filling a void in the world .
And to those who doubt that , I would invite a look at the U.S. - backed regime in Iraq , which has been enforcing martial law since the invasion even while most conservatives have been glad to believe that these methods constitute steps toward freedom .
I do n’t see this as a contradiction of conservative principles ; it appears as the fulfillment of their essentially Hobbesian view of how society must function .
The problem of police power is hitting Americans very close to home .
It is the police , much militarized and federalized , who are charged with enforcing the on - again - off - again states of emergency that have characterized American civilian life .
It is the police that confiscated guns from New Orleans residents during the flood , kept residents away from their homes , refused to let the kids go home in the Alabama tornado earlier this spring , and will be the enforcers of the curfews , checkpoints , and speech controls that the politicians want during the next national emergency .
If we want to see the way the police power could treat US citizens , look carefully at how the US troops in Iraq are treating the civilians there , or how prisoners in Guantnamo Bay are treated .
A leading contender for the Republican nomination received wild cheers when he proposed to double the capacity of Guantnamo .
This ideology of power that is inherent in postwar conservatism is particularly clear when it comes to war .
In the 1970s , there developed a myth on the right that the real problem with Vietnam was not the intervention itself , but the failure to carry it out to a more grim and ruthless end .
This seems to be the only lesson that the Bush administration garnered from the experience .
So the solution to every problem in Iraq — at least I ca n’t think of an exception to the rule — has been to apply more force through more troops , more bombs , more tanks , more guns , more curfews , more patrols , more checkpoints , and more controls of all sorts .
They believe that another surge will work wonders because they are out of ideas .
It ’s as if the administration were on an intellectual trajectory that it cannot escape .
Even after all the evidence that the war on terror has produced ever more terrorism — and this evidence is offered up by the government ’s own statistics — the champions of the war on terror cannot think their way out of the intellectual trap into which their ideology of force has locked them .
How is it that the war planners and their vast numbers of supporters do not question the underlying assumption that government is capable of achieving all its aims , provided that it is given enough time and firepower ?
Let ’s look more carefully at their crude form of Hobbesianism .
Thomas Hobbes ’s book Leviathan was published in 1651 during the English Civil War in order to justify a tyrannical central government as the price of peace .
The natural state of society , he said , was war of all against all .
In this world , life is “ solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short . ”
Conflict was the way of human engagement .
Society is rife with it , and it can not be otherwise .
What is striking here is the context of this book .
Conflict was indeed ubiquitous .
But what was the conflict over ?
It was over who would control the state and how that state would operate .
This was not a state of nature but a society under Leviathan ’s control .
It was precisely the Leviathan that bred that very conflict that Hobbes was addressing , and he proposed a cure that was essentially identical to the disease .
In fact , the result of the Civil War was the brutal and ghastly dictatorship of Oliver Cromwell , who ruled under democratic slogans .
This was a foreshadowing of some of the worst political violence of the 20th century .
It was Nazism , Fascism , and Communism that transformed formerly peaceful societies into violent communities in which life did indeed become " solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short . ”
Leviathan did n’t fix the problem ; it bred it , and fastened it on society .
What is striking about Hobbes is that he thought not at all about economic problems .
The problem of human material well - being was not part of his intellectual apparatus .
He could not have imagined what England would become a century to a century and a half later : a bastion of freedom and rising prosperity for everyone .
He wrote at the tail end of an epoch before the rise of old - style liberalism .
At the time that Hobbes was writing , the liberal idea had not yet become part of public consciousness in England .
In this respect , England was behind the Continent , where intellectuals in Spain and France had already come to understand the core insights of the liberal idea .
But in England , John Locke ’s Two Treatises on Government would not be written for another thirty years , a book that would supply the essential framework of the Declaration of Independence and lead to the formation of the freest and most prosperous society in the history of the world .
Because Hobbes did n’t think about economic issues , the essential liberal insight was not part of his thinking .
And what is that insight ?
It is summed up in Frdric Bastiat ’s claim that “ the great social tendencies are harmonious . ”
What he means by this is that society contains within itself the capacity to resolve conflicts and create and sustain institutions that further social cooperation .
By pursuing their individual self - interest , people can come to mutual agreement and engage in exchange to their mutual benefit .
A critical insight here , one that needs to be taught to every generation , relates to the law of association .
The law of association points out that people of radically different abilities , backgrounds , religions , races , and capacities can successfully cooperate to achieve ever - higher levels of social welfare through negotiation and trade .
The law of association is what explains the method by which humans were able to move out of caves , away from isolated production , beyond the hunter - gatherer stage , and into what we call civilization .
This law makes it possible for people not to steal from each other and kill each other but cooperate .
It is the basis of society .
It is also the basis of international order .
Note that the law of association does not suppose that everyone in society is smart , enlightened , talented , reasonable , or educated .
It presumes radical inequality and points to the paradox that the world ’s smartest , most talented person still has every reason to trade with his polar opposite because scarcity requires that the tasks of production be divided between people .
Under the division of labor , everyone plays an essential role .
It is the basis of families , communities , firms , and international trade .
Another fact that needs to be understood is this : the law of association is a fact of human existence whether or not there is a state .
Indeed , the foundation of civilization itself precedes the existence of the state .
What the law of association addresses is the core problem of freedom itself .
If all people were equal , if everyone had the same skill level , if there were racial , sexual , and religious homogeneity in society , if people did not have differences of opinion , there would be few if any problems in society to overcome because it would not be a human society .
It would be an ant heap , or a series of machine parts that had no volition .
The essential problem of social and economic organization , aside from scarcity , is precisely how to deal with the fact of inequality and free will .
It is here that freedom excels .
Let us be clear .
The old liberals were not saying that there are no such things as criminals .
They were saying that society can deal with malevolence through the exchange economy , and in precisely the way we see hinted at today : private security companies , private production of locks and guns , private arbitration , and private insurance .
The free market can organize protection better than the state .
Private enterprise can and does provide the police function better than the state .
As Hayek argued , the state is wildly overrated as a mechanism of order keeping .
The state is and has been in history a source of disorder and chaos .
This essential insight of liberalism is what led the founding fathers to take such a radical step as throwing off the rule of Great Britain .
They had to be firmly convinced that chaos would not ensue , that the American people could manage their own affairs without overarching Leviathan control .
They believed that the source of any conflict in their society was the central state , and that society itself could be self - regulating .
In place of control by the king , they put the Articles of Confederation , which was a type of government that more closely approximated anarchy than any system in the modern period .
The central government was barely in existence , and had essentially no power .
Why did anyone believe it could work ?
It was the new science of liberty that led to this conviction .
The American consensus was that Hobbes was wrong .
In the state of nature , life is not nasty and brutish , or , rather if it is , there is nothing that a nasty and brutish state can do to improve it .
The only way a society can advance out of barbarism is from within by means of the division of labor .
This logic has been forgotten by the American right .
Instead they have bought into the view that society is fundamentally unstable and rife with a conflict that only the state can solve .
That root conflict is between those who adhere to the law and those who are inclined to break it .
These they define as good guys and bad guys , but it is not always true , since " the law " these days is not that written by God on our hearts , but rather the orders handed down by our political masters .
This seemingly important point is completely lost on the Republican mind , since they believe that without the state as lawmaker , all of society and all the world would collapse into a muddle of chaos and darkness .
Society , they believe , is a wreck without Leviathan .
This is why they celebrate the police and the military far more than merchants and entrepreneurs , and why they think that war deserves more credit than trade for world prosperity .
The conviction that society , no matter how orderly it appears , is really nothing more than a gloss on deep - rooted conflict , expresses itself in the romantic attachment to the police power and war .
But it also affects the right ’s attitude toward religion .
Many people are convinced that , in the end , it is not possible that society can be religiously heterogeneous .
In particular , these days , most conservatives believe that the United States cannot abide the presence of Muslims and other religious minorities .
I ’m sure you have heard , as I have , conservatives telling us that there can be no peace in the world so long as the Muslim religion exists .
It is inherently bent on violence .
They have always been our enemy and always will be .
When I hear such claims , I ca n’t help but think of Orwell ’s 1984 , in which the enemies were always changing and the history always being rewritten .
For it was n’t too long ago that we were told that Islam , and its fundamentalist branch in particular , was a wonderful ally in the war against Communism , and , moreover , that they share with us the virtues of faith and family .
So with a sigh , we must point out that so long as Western troops are not invading their countries and starving their people , we tend to get along rather well .
Indeed , in conditions of freedom , there is no reason why all religions cannot peacefully coexist .
The current - day view of conservatives that we are in an intractable war against Islam also stems from the conflict - based view of society .
In absence of the state , people find ways to get along , all preserving their own identities .
Religious heterogeneity presents no problems that freedom cannot solve .
And yet , conservatives today are disinclined to accept this view .
They seem to have some intellectual need to identify huge struggles at work in history that give them a sense of meaning and purpose .
Whereas the founding generation of old liberals was thrilled by the existence of peace and the slow and meticulous development of bourgeois civilization , the right today is on the lookout for grand morality plays in which they can throw themselves as a means of making some mark in history .
And somehow they have come to believe that the state is the right means to use to fight this battle .
In short , their meta- understanding of politics bypassed the liberal revolution of the 18th century and embraced the anti-liberal elements of the Enlightenment .
Liberty is fine but order , order , is much more important , and order comes from the state .
They ca n’t even fathom the truth that liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order .
That thought is too complex for the mind that believes that " the law " alone , legislated or by executive fiat , is what separates barbarism from civilization .
Freedom , to them , is not a right but something conferred as a reward for good behavior .
The absence of good behavior justifies any level of crackdown .
At the end of the Cold War , many conservatives panicked that there would be no more great causes into which the state could enlist itself .
There were about 10 years of books that sought to demonize someone , somewhere , in the hope of creating a new enemy .
Maybe it would be China .
Maybe it would be the culture war .
Maybe it should be drugs .
At last , from their point of view , 9 - 11 presented the opportunity they needed , and thus began the newest unwinnable war : The Global War on Terror .
So must government rule every aspect of life until every last terrorist is wiped off the face of the earth ?
Must we surrender all our liberty and property to this cause , as the regime and its apologists suggest ?
This view of society is certainly not sustainable in these times and in the future .
Ever more of daily life consists in seceding from the state and its apparatus of edicts and regulations .
In the online world , billions of deals are made every day that require virtually no government law to enforce .
The technology that is pushing the world forward is not created by the state but by private enterprise .
The places we shop and the communities in which we live are being created by private developers .
Most businesses prefer to deal with private courts .
We depend on insurance companies , not police , to reduce the risks in life .
We secure our homes and workplaces through private firms .
What ’s more , these days we see all around us how liberty generates order and how this order is self - sustaining .
We benefit daily , hourly , minute - by - minute , from an order that is not imposed from without but rather generated from within , by that remarkable capacity we have for pursuing self - interest while benefiting the whole .
Here is the great mystery and majesty of social order , expressed so well in the act of economic exchange .
Many Republicans by contrast live intellectually in a world long past , a world of warring states and societies made up of fixed classes that fought over ever - dwindling resources , a world unleavened by enterprise and individual initiative .
They imagine themselves to be the class of rulers , the aristocrats , the philosopher kings , the high clerics , the landowners , and to keep that power , they gladly fuel the basest of human instincts : nationalism , jingoism , and hate .
Keeping them at bay means keeping the world of their imaginations at bay , and that is a very good and important thing for the sake of civilization .
I ’ve spoken about the problem of those who look at society and see nothing but conflict and no prospect for cooperation .
It is a view shared by the left and the right .
Truly there is an actual conflict at the root of history but it is not the one most people understand or see .
It is the great struggle between freedom and despotism , between the individual and the state , between the voluntary means and coercion .
But we know where we stand .
We stand with the future of freedom .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
Virginia is proposing to pay $ 1.9 million to Earl Washington , Jr. , who spent 17 years in prison , including time on death row , for a rape and murder that he did not commit :
Virginia officials have agreed to pay $ 1.9 million to a man who spent 17 years in prison — including more than nine on death row — for a rape and murder he did not commit , officials said yesterday .
If the settlement is approved by the court , it will bring an end to years of legal battles that arose from one of the nation ’s most troubling instances of a wrongful conviction .
Earl Washington Jr. , a farmworker who is mildly mentally retarded , once came within days of execution .
He was exonerated in 2000 by DNA tests . [
The story of how Washington ended up nearly being executed for a murder he did n’t commit is particularly outrageous :
Washington ’s conviction in the 1982 rape and murder of 19 - year - old Rebecca Williams , a young mother from Culpeper , was largely the result of a false confession in which he got several key details wrong .
Last year , a federal jury in Charlottesville ruled that a now - deceased Virginia State Police investigator fabricated parts of that confession .
The jury awarded Washington $ 2.5 million .
The proposed $ 1.9 million settlement calls for the court to dismiss the verdict against the estate of investigator Curtis Reese Wilmore , who died in 1994 , according to court papers .
It also would mean that all appeals in the case , including one by Wilmore ’s estate , would be dropped .
The state funded the defense against Washington ’s lawsuit because Wilmore was a state employee when he interrogated Washington .
It makes sense for Washington to settle the claim at this point .
The appeals would be costly , and there ’s always a risk that the jury verdict would be overturned .
The case does raise a question , though , what is appropriate compensation for being held in prison for 17 years and nearly being executed due to a falsified confession ?
The jury said it was $ 2.5 million dollars , but that seems paltry compared to the damage that was done to Washington over the years .
And , quite honestly , it ’s unfortunate the man responsible for all this never spent a day in jail for what he did .
Caveat : some historical details and aircraft specifications in this piece are based on a variety of sources - not all of which agree .
We 've done our best to provide what we believe are the right facts and figures , but some aspects of the ekranoplan story are still open to debate .
During the mid-1960s chilly height of the Cold War , US photo reconnaisance spotted a strange apparition on the shores of the Caspian Sea - a gigantic 100 m - long aircraft with inexplicably truncated square wings .
US Intelligence dubbed the beast the " Caspian Sea Monster " , unaware that the Russians were developing not , as they thought , an enormous conventional seaplane , but rather a 550 - ton water - hugging behemoth designed to use the ground effect to skim the ocean at high speed , undetected by radar .
The Russians had a rather more prosaic name for the Caspian Sea Monster : the KM or " korabl - maket " .
This " ship - prototype " was the first in a series of Soviet " ekranoplan " ( " screen plane " ) developments and was designed by Rostislav Evgenievich Alexeev of the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau .
The KM was intended as a test platform to examine the possibilities of the " Wing In Ground " ( WIG ) effect whereby ( in very simple terms ) a wing travelling close to the ground is provided with extra lift by the " cushion " of air compressed under it - thereby enabling a combination of greater aircraft weight for less power and / or enhanced fuel economy .
The KM , powered by eight Dobryin VD - 7 turbojets on the front of the fuselage , and two on the tail for extra thrust during take - off , first took to the air in October 1966 .
During its extensive test career , it was continually modified .
The wingspan was altered to between 32 m and 40 m , and the length varied from 92 m to 106m .
The KM crashed in 1980 , apparently due to the pilot ill - advisedly attempting to take off without giving it full throttle .
An attempt to recover the leviathan from the depths was thwarted by its vast weight .
While the KM programme was ongoing , Alexeev began work on a medium - sized ekranoplan suitable for military transportation duties .
Dubbed A - 90 " Orlyonok " ( " Eaglet " ) , the 140 tonne , 58 metre long aircraft had its maiden flight in 1972 .
The A - 90 boasted two turbojets and one turboprop engine which propelled it to a speed of 400 km/h for 1,500 km at an cruise altitude of 5 - 10 m .
Four flying examples were built , one of which crashed in the Caspian in 1975 and was subsequently rebuilt .
The aircraft entered military service in 1979 with three A -90s reportedly still operational in 1993 .
Thereafter , they were reportedly mothballed at the Kaspiysk naval base on the Caspian .
As indeed they were , or at least one of them .
A quick Google Earth jaunt down to Kaspiysk reveals this fine view of an Orlyonok parked up :
There 's more : sitting close by is this rather magnificent beast :
It is , as ekranoplan aficionados among you will know , the original military version of the " Lun " ( " Hen Harrier " ) , designed as a sea- launched anti-shipping missile platform .
The 280 tonne , 74 metre long M - 160 Lun was another ekranoplan developed from Alexeev designs .
One was built in 1987 , which entered service in 1989 .
A second example was under construction when the Soviet Union collapsed and , despite subsequent refitting as a search - and - rescue aircraft , remained unfinished when the authorities effectively pulled the plug on ekranoplan funding .
Russia was n't the only country to take an active interest in the possibilities of WIG aircraft , though .
In the early 1960s , German designer Alexander Lippisch threw his hat into the ring with a series of small - scale designs based on a reverse delta - wing configuration .
Lippisch was an expert in delta- wing aerondynamics , having played a large part in the design of the famous Me-163 .
His X - 112 and X - 113 designs were developed by Rhein Flugzeugbau ( RFB ) into the X - 114 ( seen here ) for the German military .
Neither the X - 114 nor any of its derivatives ever made it into military service , but there is some evidence that China may have taken a close interest in the design .
Specifically , readers are invited to speculate as to exactly what the Chinese are up to down at Qingdao naval base :
Well , the circumstantial evidence is there : a launch ramp down to the water 's edge ; hangar - type building ; and the proximity of a seaplane base ( click here .
For the record , those are Shuihong - 5 amphibious aircraft sunning themselves on the shore ) .
On the other hand , our Chinese Sea Monster is only 20 metres long , although a close - up examination adds weight to the theory that it may be the China Ship Scientific Research Centre 's XTW - 4 - based on the Lippisch X - 113 ( seen right ) or X - 114 , as proposed by members of the Google Earth community :
Shown here is a clearer view of the XTW - 4 .
It 's powered by two turboprop engines driving two five - blade propellors , and has a corrosion - resistant hull designed for salt - water operations .
It was built in 1999 and tested during 2000 .
Further information is scarce , and its current status is unknown , other than that it appears to be hanging around the Qingdao area .
We 'll leave it to you lot to fill in the blanks .
So , what of the future of the ekranoplan ?
In reality , the technical difficulties of developing a successful example often in the past outweighed the potential benefits of the technology .
There have been a few private outfits plugging away at their WIG aircraft , as evidenced by the Flightship FS - 8 ( seen here ) .
It 's another Lippisch - based design which - despite a lot of press back in 2000 - 2001 amid rumours that the company had sold seven examples to the Maldives - appears to have sunk without trace .
Enter stage right Boeing which , back in 2002 , announced that it was developing the mother of all ekranoplans : the monstrous " Pelican " which would stretch " more than the length of a US football field and have a wingspan of 500 feet " :
Designed primarily for " long - range , transoceanic transport " , Boeing claimed the Pelican would be able to haul " 1.5 m pounds ... 10,000 nautical miles over water and 6,500 nautical miles over land " .
Naturally , you 're going to need a few wheels to hold up an oversized Pelican , and this particular bird - capable of lifting " 17 M - 1 main battle tanks on a single sortie " - would require no less than 76 tyres on 38 fuselage - mounted landing gears to support its weight .
Impressive specs to be sure , although whether we 'll ever be able to do some Pelican - spotting on Google Earth remains to be seen . ®

There 's an intersting theory knocking around that the only reason Howard Hughes ' Spruce Goose ever got off the water was due to the ground effect , and that it could never have flown at altitude .
It 's an idea that has legs , as it were .
WASHINGTON , June 27 —
It ’s not every day that one Supreme Court justice , even one as rhetorically unrestrained as Justice Antonin Scalia , characterizes another justice , let alone the chief justice of the United States , as a wimp and a hypocrite .
Yet Justice Scalia did something very close to that , not once but twice , in separate opinions on Monday .
As a result , he has served to lift the curtain a bit on the differences within the powerful five - justice conservative bloc that has marched in lock step through much of the term , bent on reshaping the law and , in several important areas , well on the way toward doing so .
In the campaign finance case , he accused Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. of “ faux judicial modesty ” for writing an opinion that in Justice Scalia ’s view effectively overturned the court ’s 2003 campaign finance decision “ without saying so . ”
The clear implication was that the chief justice lacked the courage or honesty to overturn the precedent openly as Justice Scalia himself would have done .
“ This faux judicial restraint is judicial obfuscation , ” he said .
And Justice Scalia was scathing in his criticism of an opinion signed by Chief Justice Roberts that limited , but did not completely abolish , the right of taxpayers to go to court to challenge government expenditures that promote religion .
Justice Scalia would have gone on to shut the courthouse door completely , not simply limiting but overturning the precedent that the new ruling invoked .
White House runs conference call on executive privilege for right - wing bloggers Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 27 , 2007

At the urging of top conservative bloggers , the White House set up a Friday morning conference call to promote its message on the subject of executive privilege , RAW STORY has found .
" The White House hosted a blogger conference call to discuss the issues surrounding the Bush administration 's use of executive privilege in the probe of the firings of eight federal prosecutors , " wrote Ed Morrissey , who produces the blog Captains Quarters .
" The White House arranged the call based on a recommendation by this blog , in order to familiarize the blogosphere with the legal and political arguments on which the administration will rely to prevail in the upcoming fight regarding the contempt citations Congress seems likely to approve . "
The White House did not immediately respond to queries about the conference call from RAW STORY .
Morrisey did not name any other participants in the call or identify the administration official who spoke to the assembled bloggers .
But he showed that the message being delivered by the White House was short and to the point .
" The power to hire and fire federal prosecutors belongs exclusively to the executive branch , " Morrissey wrote .
" Congress has no particular oversight in these matters , and so the executive privilege claim is very compelling in this instance . "
At least one commenter was critical of Morrissey 's efforts .
" Thanks for reporting the administration 's talking points , Captain Steno , " wrote the posts only commenter .
" You have a reputation for being a rational thinker , so how 's about a little more in - depth analysis of the legal merit of the points ? "
While most of the questions relayed by Morrissey were informational , one appeared to challenge the terms of the White House 's privilege assertion .
When asked why Congress has oversight for federal agencies but not the White House , the official was forced to defend his position .
" The difference is that the President cannot be subpoenaed , and neither can his advisers , who do not require Congressional confirmation to serve , " the Bush official was reported to have said .
" The President has the power to order them to keep silent about their advisory activities . "
The White House official was also asked about the possibility of impeachment , and apparently dismissed any danger .
" The Speaker has ruled that out , and the senior official hopes they see the futility of that path , " Morrisey wrote .
Friday morning 's conference call was not the first time the White House has promoted its message to bloggers .
According to conservative blogger Robert Bluey , the Bush White House convened bloggers on the phone to speak about avian flu in 2006 , and on Iraq at the beginning of the 110th Congress in January .
RAW STORY was unable to locate any other accounts of the conference call .

Here are 8 simple cooking tips to save you time .
Enjoy
1. Plan meals at least a week in advance to incorporate the use of leftovers .
For example , have baked chicken , mashed potatoes , and gravy for dinner Sunday , and then use the leftover gravy as the base of beef stroganoff Monday .
2 . If you know you ’re not going to have time to cook one evening , prepare two dinners the night before and just reheat one the next night .
3 . When preparing a meal using grated cheese , chopped onions , etc. , prepare more than the recipe calls for and refrigerate the rest for another meal .
4. Clean your kitchen workspace as you go .
When you ’re done there will be little left to clean .
5 . On grocery shopping day , prepare for the rest of the week so snacks do n’t disappear before lunches are made .
6 . Do n’t hide your cookbooks away .
Organize them where you can get to them easily , and you will use them a lot more .
7 . Keep a notepad on the front of the refrigerator for your shopping list .
When you run out of something write it on the list right away .
Encourage family members to do the same .
8 . Prepare favorite beverages like lemonade , tea , in gallon - sized pitchers , and you wo n’t have to make them as often .

“ As much as we would like to think otherwise , I am afraid that with the number of soldiers we now have in harm ’s way , our losses will preclude us from continuing to do individual memorial ceremonies , ” Brig .
Gen. William Troy , who was the interim commander at Fort Lewis at the time , wrote in an e-mail message announcing the policy in May .
The Army also emphasizes that the ceremonies held on bases are in addition to those held by the soldier ’s unit overseas as well as private family services , which usually include military honor guards .
Those services would not be affected if Fort Lewis moved to a monthly schedule .
Fort Lewis , the third - largest Army base in the nation , has about 10,000 of its 28,000 soldiers deployed overseas , a majority of them in Stryker brigades trained specially for urban combat .
Several other major bases , including Fort Hood in Texas , the largest , already hold services monthly .
Some hold them even less frequently .
“ There is no Army - wide policy to have any memorial services , ” a spokeswoman for the Army , Maj.
Cheryl Phillips , said in an e-mail message .
“ Commanders make the call .
Several installations have conducted services for each individual soldier and now have begun to roll them into a quarterly service because , alas , the casualty numbers are rising . ”
At many bases , local elected officials attend the services .
At Fort Hood , whose First Cavalry Division has 19,000 soldiers overseas , many of these officials are veterans with ties to the base or the Army .
“ It really is important that we keep it scheduled and that these people all have it on their calendars , ” said Diane Battaglia , a spokeswoman for Fort Hood .

The world 's largest operating musical instrument —
It 's at Macy 's in Philadelphia
True .
Craig R. Whitney , in a June 9 , 2007 New York Times article , described how the massive pipe organ ( above and below ) , constructed for the 1904 St. Louis International Exposition where it was a smash hit ( though it bankrupted the Los Angeles Art Organ Company , which built it ) , subsequently made its way to Wanamaker 's in Philadelphia where President William Howard Taft dedicated it in front of 40,000 people on December 30 , 1911 , then occupied the vast , 149 - foot - high Grand Court center space specially designed for it by Daniel Hudson Burnham , resounding in glory before slowly deteriorating over the decades to the point that by 1995 only about 20 % of its pipes were playable , with just two of its six keyboards functioning .
When Macy 's took over the store last year , it decided to pull out all the stops in an attempt to restore the great instrument to its former power — and beyond .
Here 's the Times story .
Amid the Shirts and Socks , a Concert Can Break Out What do you do if you buy a famous downtown department store and find an organ with 28,482 pipes occupying thousands of square feet of perfectly good retail space ?
If you ’re Macy ’s , you let devotees of the instrument put in 61 more pipes and give them thousands more square feet to set up an organ repair shop .
Diapasons , it would seem , are as much music to Macy ’s as cash registers , coin counters and customers at its Center City store here , a Philadelphia institution that was originally a Wanamaker ’s .
So the company let the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ , a private group of aficionados who have been helping to maintain the instrument for years , install another stop and set up a repair shop after Macy ’s took over the store .
“ Every lunchtime , people hear the organ and feel good — and people are in a mind to shop when they ’re feeling good , ” explained James Kenny , the store manager .
“ It ’s the ultimate feel - good experience . ”
The organ , the world ’s largest operating musical instrument , has never sounded better , according to the store ’s staff organist , Peter Richard Conte , who has been here 20 years and fills the place with warm waves of sound at noon and in the evening , daily except Sunday .
“ In 1995 it was down to about 20 percent of the pipes being playable , maybe , ” and only two keyboards working instead of six , Mr. Conte said .
“ Now it sounds loved again . ”
With money from private donors and more than $ 100,000 from Macy ’s this year , the staff curator , L. Curt Mangel III , with his assistant , the Friends and numerous organ groupies , now have 95 percent of the organ playing again .
Next year they expect to have it all up and running for the first time in decades .
Today Mr. Conte and the Friends have the run of the store for the annual Wanamaker Organ Day , and Mr. Conte will play something new : his own transcription of Elgar ’s “ Enigma ” Variations ( Op. 36 ) , at 11:30 a.m.
Shoppers are welcome .
He has been working feverishly on the Elgar for weeks , with all - night practice sessions , alone in the store except for a guard .
“ It ’s probably the most difficult piece I ’ve ever done , ” he said before trying out several movements at a Wednesday evening concert , his fingers slinking from keyboard to keyboard and darting restlessly over the 729 stop - control tablets as phrase seamlessly followed phrase and crescendo climaxed and faded into descrescendo .
The Elgar sounds impressively orchestral on this organ , with its 462 sets of pipes , including stops named for orchestral violins , cellos , flutes , orchestral oboes , clarinets , French horns , tubas and trombones .
It has just about everything else imaginable — chimes and even a kitchen sink ( for the curators to wash their hands ) — in a forest of pipes ranging from 32 feet to less than an inch long , spread over both ends and multiple rooms and floors off the store ’s Grand Court .
Next year a long - muffled section of 2,000 more pipes , now being cleaned and restored , will rejoin the rest in a more audible spot , and Mr. Conte expects to luxuriate in its liberated sounds , including three more French horn stops made by the Kimball Organ Company of Chicago .
“ I love the sound of French horns and I will probably use them a lot , ” he said .
The instrument started life at the St. Louis International Exposition of 1904 , when the Los Angeles Art Organ Company built it along orchestral lines , rather than according to the baroque organ ideal , as Bach and Buxtehude knew it .
It was a smash hit at the fair , but bankrupted the company .
Then it languished in storage until 1909 , when John Wanamaker bought it for the Philadelphia store that he was planning to open two years later .
His son , Lewis Rodman Wanamaker , saw the vast , 149 - foot - high Grand Court center space in the building Daniel Hudson Burnham had designed for them as the ideal place for “ the finest organ in the world , ” and 40,000 people and President William Howard Taft came to the dedication ceremonies on Dec. 30 , 1911 .
Until his death in 1928 , Lewis Rodman Wanamaker oversaw successive expansions of the organ in the store ’s own organ shop on the building ’s roof .
The changes were so extensive that the instrument ’s “ string ” section finally had more pipes than most large organs do altogether .
Famous organists flocked to play it over the years , and both Marcel Dupré and Virgil Fox developed signature pieces on the organ , but when Lewis Rodman Wanamaker died , the organ ’s importance faded .
Wanamaker ’s itself was sold to Woodward & Lothrop in 1986 ; then it became a Hecht ’s ; and in 1997 a Lord & Taylor store .
Macy ’s took it over last year .
Each of the owners recognized the unique historical value of the organ , and Lord & Taylor hired Mr. Mangel as curator in 2002 .
The difference now , as Mr. Conte sees things , is that “ Macy ’s gets it — it understands how to use this instrument and market it to the public . ”
Martine Reardon , the Macy ’s national headquarters executive overseeing holiday events , including now the annual Christmas organ and light show in the Philadelphia store , said , “ The Wanamaker Organ ’s legacy is as legendary as the Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Fourth of July fireworks . ”
Next year , Macy ’s 150th anniversary , the store hopes to get the Philadelphia Orchestra to come and play Joseph Jongen ’s “ Symphonie Concertante , ” a work for organ and orchestra commissioned by Wanamaker ’s in 1928 but never performed at the store .
And the Friends , with a $ 150,000 donation from the Phoebe Haas Charitable Trust , have set up a spacious repair and organ - building training center on an unused floor of the store .
Early this year the additional 61 new pipes , a rank of singing vox humana stops , joined nine others in a chamber rebuilt especially for them and brought the total to 28,543 .
To many their vibrato tones call to mind a choir of angels .
Mr. Conte patted the huge console that controls the pipes and said , nodding at Mr. Mangel , “ Baby has n’t been given such care and tending since John Wanamaker . ”
But he still hopes Baby will throw no tantrums at today ’s performance .

Excellent link , Flautist , thanks .
Now if I can get my far younger and far more beautiful daughter so impassioned , I think she 'd make some strides with her violin !
The link and the links off of that page will be , I hope , inspiring for her in that a woman is doing that .

You 're welcome , NCE .
Can I recommend another ?
Look at me , I seem to be doing just that :

A very young ( and beautiful ) Jacqueline Du Pre playing 2nd mvmt Elgar Cello Concerto .
She 's absolutely possessed playing that thing .
It just knocks me out at the end when she flashes that killer smile ...

Thanks for the Shostakovich YouTube link , Flautist .
Beautiful !
Reply on the chicken management had me almost in tears I was laughing so hard , unfortunately no time to reply and could n't find the entry just now .

Wow - talk about synchronicity : yesterday I was at an organ recital in the Salt Lake City Conference Center .
It sounded pretty good , but not great - probably something to do with the Conference Center being utterly enormous .

I 'm sorry , really , just this one more and I really will quit -- but this is SO great .
( No singing , promise . )
I miss old Rostro .
( First mvmt .
Shostakovich cello concerto w / Rostropovich . )
Incredible .
Crank it up , too .

And , I tried to include this with my above comment , but I seem to be some kind of lunch meat .
Watch this , too , just cause I said so .
Do n't ask questions .
Stick with it : the actual tune kicks in around 4:10 .
What an amazing voice , even past his prime .

I 'm not much of a Virgil Fox fan , and the orchestra is not the best , but here is a YouTube vid of the fourth movement ( toccata ) of the Jongen " Symphonie Concertante " -- crank it up :

Any references to the movie ends up becoming extremely creepy , though anyone is welcome to argue , this personal observation of mine .
The point , I think of the post , is that perfection is or is equaled to the composition accompanied by the very best instrument available .

Hey that 's pretty cool .
I just watched a 2 - hour documentary on the 1904 St. Louis Exposition last night and they actually made reference to this organ .
It 's almost worth a trip to Philadelphia just to check it out .

Flautist et al ,
Yes , blaster volume : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd_oIFy1mxM
Not a huge fan of Bach , but this is his best , absolutely !
Being this link is You Tube , keep in mind there is no house pet on an exercise machine .
I have yet to get my cat and house - rabbit on the home elliptical for that purpose :P :) ) ) ( teasing )
Excellent reminder of Bach .
Thank you !

Wow !
Jongen 's Symphonie Concertante played on that thing , and with the Philly Orchestra .
I would love to be there for that .
I highly recommend what I guess is the latest recording of it -- Michael Murray and the San Francisco Symphony -- but there 's nothing like hearing it in person .
( You can , of course , hear excerpts on Amazon .
I hate the idea of listening to teaser chunks of ANY music , but it gives some idea .
The 4th movement " toccata " has to be listened to at blaster vol . )

PC World Editor - in - Chief Harry McCracken says that his talks with IDG ( PC World 's parent company ) unfolded over the last few days , following his surprise resignation , and that he returned to the magazine only because IDG founder and chairman Pat McGovern and IDG President Bob Carrigan both assured him that he would have editorial autonomy over the content .
" I made a bigger statement by leaving than I thought I was making , " McCracken told me , " and now I 'm making an even bigger statement in coming back because I 'm 100 percent confident that PC World will continue to be a place where editors decide how to serve the people who use their content .
I would never have come back unless I was completely confident of that . "
McCracken says that his talks with Carrigan and McGovern ( often referred to as " Uncle Pat " by employees because he flies out from Boston each Christmas to hand out holiday bonus checks in person ) were respectful .
" They never criticized me or told me I overreacted , " he said .
" They were tremendously supportive .
We talked for a while about ways I might come back and they were both great about it . "
We now know that one of those ways was to remove Colin Crawford from his position as CEO .
The company informed the staff of the news this afternoon while the magazine 's web site simultaneously posted a story about it .
" We put it up before we told you because we did n't want you to scoop us , " McCracken told me .
BTW , word started going around early this afternoon that something might be in the works after a message previously posted on Crawford 's personal web page about McCracken 's resignation suddenly disappeared .
Here 's an image of the removed post as it appeared on Crawford 's blog .

Reisetipps für Prag Lisa Adams
Lisa Adams aus Freiburg ist vor einiger Zeit nach Prag gezogen , um dort für den tschechischen Rundfunk zu arbeiten .
Inzwischen kennt sie die Stadt so gut , dass sie auf fudder eine Fülle von Insidertipps geben kann .
Nach dem Lesen möchte man gleich losfahren .
Bewegen
Innerhalb der Altstadt ( Stare Mesto ) lassen sich alle Strecken bequem zu Fuß zurücklegen .
Für längere Strecken sollte man unbedingt einen Fahrschein kaufen .
In der Prager Metro und in den quietschenden Straßenbahnen stehen oft Kontrolleure .
In allen U - Bahn - Stationen , aber an fast keiner Straßenbahnhaltestelle , gibt es zweisprachige Fahrscheinautomaten .
Ein Einzelticket kostet 20 Kronen , das ist knapp ein Bier ; daher lohnt sich das Schlangestehen für einen günstigeren Zeitcoupon .
An den Verkaufsschaltern ( zum Beispiel in den Stationen Andel und Muzeum ) verstehen die Menschen in der Regel ein Minimum an Englisch und Deutsch .
Stadtplan mitbringen !

Ein Einzelticket kostet , das ist knapp ein Bier ; daher lohnt sich das Schlangestehen für einen günstigeren Zeitcoupon .
An den Verkaufsschaltern ( zum Beispiel in den Stationen Andel und Muzeum ) verstehen die Menschen in der Regel ein Minimum an Englisch und Deutsch .
Stadtplan mitbringen !
Die 1974 eröffnete Metro , nach Moskauer Vorbild gebaut , ist schnell , und die Stationen sind übersichtlich .
Aber tief unter der Erde ist es auch zugig und dunkel .
Wer das Straßenbahnnetz kennt und nutzt , sieht mehr von der Stadt .
Surfen
Wer im Urlaub mit Laptop unterwegs ist , findet Wireless Lan in den meisten großen Einkaufszentren ( z.B. Palác Flora und in den Village Cinemas bei Andel ) .
Allerdings ist die Verbindung im Internetcafé am sichersten und schnellsten .
Gut sitzt es sich zum Beispiel im Kava Kava Kava , ebenfalls am Andel oder in der Innenstadt .
Hier gibt es frisch gerösteten Kaffee aus Süd- und Mittelamerika , Milkshakes sowie süßes Backwerk .
Seiten , die bei der Orientierung helfen :
Vermeiden
Großgruppenfahrten mit " Praha Drinking Team "- Shirts Taxi :
Für mittlere Strecken von zirka 15 Minuten sollte man im Allgemeinen nicht mehr als 200 Kronen zahlen , allerdings variieren die Preise .
Anrufen ist empfehlenswert , etwa bei AAA Taxi ( +420 233 113 311 ) Wertsachen in Hemd - oder Hosentaschen stecken .
Besonders in den Straßenbahnen der Innenstadt und in denen , die zur Burg und ins Botschaftsviertel fahren .
Alles in eine verschließbare Tasche und dann nah am Körper tragen .
Ist zwar lästig .
Noch lästiger aber ist es , in der Botschaft einen neuen Pass beantragen zu müssen .
Ist meiner Freundin gleich zweimal hintereinander passiert .
Am Kiosk essen .
Wurst und anderen Leckereien an den Kiosks entlang des Wenzelsplatzes oder am Bahnhof sollte man nur in besonderen Fällen trauen .
Essen und Trinken
Meine Lieblingskneipe mit böhmischer Küche und dem guten Gambrinus ( ein leichtes Pils ) ist das halber Liter Bier je nach Sorte 22 bis 30 Kronen , ein Schnitzel 125 Kronen .

Hier gibt es frisch gerösteten Kaffee aus Süd- und Mittelamerika , Milkshakes sowie süßes Backwerk .
Seiten , die bei der Orientierung helfen : mapy ist eine gute online - Karte für Tschechien .
Man kann direkt nach einer Adresse suchen und sich die nächsten Haltestellen anzeigen lassen .
Hier findet sich übrigens ein guter und übersichtlicher Übersetzungsdienst .
Man kann tschechische Wörter auf Deutsch ( cesko - nemecký ) , Englisch , Spanisch und umgekehrt suchen .
Meine Lieblingskneipe mit böhmischer Küche und dem guten Gambrinus ( ein leichtes Pils ) ist das U Milosrdnych ( Zu den Barmherzigen ) .
Hier kostet ein , ein Schnitzel 125 Kronen .
Die Jungs , die hier bedienen , haben dicke Bäuche , fast immer gute Laune und verstehen ein wenig Deutsch .
Auf der Deutsch - Englisch - Tschechischen Karte stehen zwar " Salate aus dem Garten von Ziegenbock Matthias " , allerdings habe ich bei den Barmherzigen noch nie jemanden Salat bestellen sehen .
Tschechische Küche bedeutet : Gulasch , Braten , Schnitzel , Knödel , Kartoffelpuffer , Kroketten .
Vor zehn Jahren gab es in Prag zu Truthahnkeule und Kartoffeln nicht einmal ein Salatblatt oder ein Viertel Tomate .
Inzwischen haben touristische Restaurants sogar Ceasars Salat , Sushi und fettarme Suppen .
Für Figurbewusste ist das U Milosrdnych also nichts .
Dafür sitzt man in der Bierstube zwischen Tschechen , die hier ihr Feierabendbier trinken .
Im Fernseher läuft Sport .
Die Toiletten sind sauber und abschließbar , was in Prager Kneipen eher ungewöhnlich ist .
Am leichtesten findet man die Barmherzigen , wenn man ab der Karlsbrücke an der Moldau entlanggeht und in die " Kozi " ( Ziege ) einbiegt .
Wer aus der Innenstadt kommt , kann auch vom Ziegenplatz zum Restaurant laufen , dass an der Ecke Kozi / U Milosrdnych liegt .
Montag bis Samstag ist bis offiziell elf
Uhr geöffnet , Sonntags ist der Laden zu .
Wer es noch ungewöhnlicher , billiger und weiter weg vom Schlag mag , für den lohnt sich der Weg zum " Ausgeschossenen Auge " .
( U Vystrelenýho Oka ) .
Das Lokal ist von der Deckenbemalung bis zu den Aschenbechern von dem tschechischen Künstler Martin Velišek gestaltet worden .
In der Bar ist ein Aquarium eingelassen .
Ein Bier ( Krušovice ) kostet 20 Kronen , ein Schnitzel mit Kartoffelsalat 70 Kronen .
Außerdem stehen Ei in Essig und eingelegter Hermelin ( Käse ) auf der Speisekarte , von vier bis elf wird gekocht .
Im Sommer sieht man vom Biergarten aus das Denkmal des Hussitenführers Jan Zizka , nach dessen Kriegsverletzung das Lokal benannt ist .
Wer im Ausgeschossenen Auge ein T - Shirt von Velišek erwirbt , kann ein originelleres Andenken mitnehmen als ein " Ich war in Prag aber erinnere mich nicht " T - Shirt .
Der Weg ist nicht ganz einfach :
Am besten fährt man bis zur Metrostation " Florenc " und geht dann links um die Ecke über die Straße .
Vor dem McDonalds ist die Bushaltestelle Florenc , von der man mit der Nummer 133 oder 207 eine Station bis " U Památniku " fährt .
Von da aus geht es links den Berg hoch , bis man in die Straße " U Bozich Bojovníku " einbiegt und nach ein paar Metern vorm Eingang steht .
Ein weiterer Kneipen - Tipp ist das Shadow bei der Straßenbahnhaltestelle " Ujezd " .
Hier gibt es zwar nichts zu essen , dafür aber ab 16 Uhr den halben Liter Gambrinus für 25 Kronen und einen Kickertisch .
Musik : Hip Hop , Reggae , Drum 'n ' Bass , Rock , alles gelegentlich viel zu laut .
Manchmal gibt es Liveauftritte halbprofessioneller Bands und DJs .
Die Wandbemalung ist originell , die Sofas gemütlich .
Publikum : hauptsächlich junge , kiffende Tschechen und internationale Studenten .
Geöffnet bis 1
Uhr nachts .
Meine Lieblingspizza gibt's an einer kleinen “ Pizza Factory ” Verkaufsbude am Masarýkovo nádrazi .
Der historische Masarykbahnhof ist einen Blick wert und ein großes Stück Pizza kostet hier nur etwa 35 Kronen .
Wer mal was Gesundes essen möchte , dem empfiehlt sich zum Beispiel die " Boulevard Bageterie " in der Vodickova .
Von der Straßenbahnhaltestelle der 9 , 3 , 14 und 24 am Wenzelsplatz sind es zur Bageterie nur ein paar Meter .
Hier gibt es außer Baguettes , Kaffee und Bagels auch Salat und Joghurt mit Früchten zu Supermarktpreisen .
Ein frisch gepresster Saft kostet 20 Kronen .
Grundsätzlich gibt es das beste Obst und Gemüse übrigens auf den kleinen Märkten .
Zum Beispiel bei der Metrostation Národní Trida .
Feiern
Kein echter Geheimtipp ist das
Die Dlouha 33 nennt sich " Experimentalgelände " , im Keller ist der Klub Roxy , im ersten Stock das NOD .
Ein Theater / Internetcafé / Ausstellungsraum , in dem man sehr nett sitzt .
Viele Ausstellungen sind kostenlos .
Wirklich geheim , weil nicht so einfach zu finden , ist der Bunkr .
Man fährt mit der Straßenbahn 5 , 9 oder 26 bis zum Olšanske Námesti , der zwischen Funkturm und o2 Tower liegt .
Alternativ kann man auch bis zur Metrostation " Flora " fahren und den Berg runterspazieren .
Hinterm Hotel Olšanka geht es die Propokova runter .
Vor der Brücke weist ein Schild ( Vorlicek - Plast ) , das gar nichts mit dem Bunkr zu tun hat , in die richtige Richtung .
Hier geht es die Treppen hoch bis man zu einer kleinen , bunt besprayten Tür kommt .
Wenn man die öffnet , hört man schon die Musik von weit unten .
Kein echter Geheimtipp ist das Roxy in der Dlouha 33 .
Dafür ist der Club in der Altstadt ( Nähe Námesti Republiky ) leicht zu finden .
Jeden Montag ist der Eintritt frei .
Sonst kostet er um die 130 Kronen .
Dafür gibt es internationales Publikum und Musikprogramm .

Immer im Kreis geht es die Treppen herunter in den Club zwischen Panzertüren , die ein wenig ans Crash erinnern .
Hier werden den Nachtschwärmern außer Bier in Plastikbechern auch belegte Baguettes angeboten .
Eine tolle Mischung aus Kneipe und Disco ist das " Château l'enfer rouge " in der Nähe des Altstädter Rings ( Staromestke námesti ) .
Man geht links von der Teynkirche durch die Týnská unter zwei Torbögen hindurch , bis man vorm Eingang steht .
Mich erinnert das Château mit seiner abstrusen Deko immer ein wenig ans Atlantik .
Hier trifft sich so ziemlich jeder , deshalb sollte man eher unter der Woche oder erst ab ein , zwei Uhr nachts vorbeischauen .
Sonst läuft man Gefahr , einer betrunkenen Junggesellenabschieds - oder Touristengruppe zu begegnen .
Unternehmen
Ein noch nicht von Touristen überfülltes Café an der Moldau ist das Sekt Ponton .
Genau genommen sitzt man hier auf einem Floß , mit Blick auf den Hradschin , die Karlsbrücke und die vorbeituckernden Boote .
Ein noch nicht von Touristen überfülltes Café an der Moldau ist das .
Genau genommen sitzt man hier auf einem Floß , mit Blick auf den Hradschin , die Karlsbrücke und die vorbeituckernden Boote .
Hier kann man lange und in Ruhe sitzen , der Sekt ist ausgezeichnet , allerdings gibt es kein Essen .
Ein Bier kostet etwa 45 Kronen , man zahlt eben für die Aussicht .
Mein Lieblingsort , um in der Sonne zu faulenzen , sind die Vojanovy - Gärten ( U Luzického Semináre 17 , Nähe Metrostation Malostranska .
Man kann aber auch vom Sekt Ponton aus über die Brücke spazieren ) .
Hier blühen die Wiesen , es brummt rund um die Bienenstöcke .
Die öffentlichen WCs sind mit 15 Kronen Benutzungsgebühr zwar die teuersten , aber auch die saubersten Toiletten , die ich in Prag gefunden habe .
Ein paar Häuser weiter ( U Luzického Semináre 24 ) befindet sich die engste Gasse Prags .
Das kann einen Freiburger zwar nicht beeindrucken , allerdings haben unsere Gässle keine Ampeln .
Hinter dem schmalen Durchgang verbirgt sich ein weiteres Restaurant .
Das Restaurace Certovka ist geringfügig teurer als das Sekt Ponton , aber dafür auch etwas exklusiver und noch näher an der Karlsbrücke .
Kein bisschen geheim ist die John - Lennon - Mauer am Velkoprevorské - Platz .
Mein
Tipp wäre , sich die wild bemalte Mauer nachts anzusehen .
Ein paar Kerzen brennen fast immer , vielleicht trifft man sogar ein paar Leute mit Gitarre und Rotwein .
Wer tagsüber vor den Touristen flüchten möchte , kann hier ins John & George gehen .
Sehr schön eingerichtetes Restaurant mit noch schönerem Biergarten .
Der Fernsehturm ist auf jeden Fall einen Blick wert , allerdings nur lohnend , wenn man auch hinauf will .
Das Gelände umher ist nämlich nicht gerade Prags schönste Gegend .
In Zizkov dient der Funkturm als Orientierungshilfe , nachts wird er rot / blau angestrahlt .
Am einfachsten zu erreichen ist das eigenwillige Gebäude von der Metrostation Jiriho z Podebrad .
Gaming by America 's youth has been accused of contributing to everything from school shootings to the obesity epidemic .
These accusations , however , lack a key piece of information : the actual role played by gaming in the typical young person 's life .
Results of a survey of American adolescents have appeared in the June edition of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , and they paint what is likely to be a reassuring picture for those willing to listen : less than half of adolescents are gamers , and they spent a small enough time gaming that it plays a minimal role in their lives .
But do n't expect the mainstream media to report this .
Instead , coverage so far is leading with the more sensational headline , " Video Games Cut Into Teens ' Reading , Studying . "
The truth is anything but .
The study obtained data by having about 1,500 representative adolescents in an existing survey population complete 24 - hour time - use diaries , which provided detailed descriptions of their activities on randomly chosen days .
The researchers found that 36 percent of adolescents played video games , and that there 's a stark split along gender lines : 80 percent of those gamers were boys .
Typical use was about an hour of gaming a day during the week and an hour and a half on weekends ( females played less than males ) .
The authors then compared the gaming population to the non-gamers on a set of five activities : interactions with parents and with friends , reading , homework , and sports .
They controlled for basic demographic issues , such as adjusting figures on the time spent with parents according to the hours the parents worked ; student times were adjusted based on the hours they worked or spent in school .
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the results was how little an effect gaming had on adolescents .
Hours at the console had no link to time spent in sports , with the exception of a minor drop for boys during weekends ( where each hour of gaming lead to 8 minutes less time on sports ) .
Even some potentially disturbing figures seem minor when examined in detail .
For each hour spent gaming during the week , the time that boys spent reading dropped by 30 percent .
This would be problematic except for the fact that boys only spent an average of eight minutes reading on a typical weekday .
Instead of turning kids into loners , gaming largely fell in line with general trends of social interactions .
Although there was some variability between the sexes , children who gamed with their friends generally spent more time with friends in every other activity .
A similar trend held with parents , in that children who had fewer interactions with their parents in general were less likely to game with their parents , as well .
The strongest effect seen in the study was related to homework .
In this case , homework and gaming were unrelated in boys ; the same trend held for girls during the week .
But , on weekends , each hour girls spent gaming was correlated to 13 fewer minutes spent on homework , a drop of 34 percent .
Still , the authors caution that this link does not indicate a drop in academic effort ; they note that it 's entirely possible that gamers organize their time better .
Again , this important observation has been ignored .
Overall , the survey suggests that , far from being endemic in youth culture , video games play a significant role in the lives of only a minority of US children , most of them male .
Although there were some figures that might suggest that gaming displaced academic activities , such as reading and homework , the total time spent on these pursuits was so small that minor effects were magnified .
If people are concerned about the lack of reading done by adolescents , the fact that non-gamers spend only eight minutes a day reading should be a far larger concern than the fact that gaming causes that figure to drop by a little more than two minutes .
Via the Gerontology Research Group mailing list , my attention was drawn today to a proposal from biologist João Pedro de Magalhães and others to sequence the genomes of certain exceptionally long - lived mammals .
Proposal to Sequence Genomes of Unique Interest for Research on Aging
The proposal focuses on three organisms ( in order of priority ) : the naked mole - rat ( Heterocephalus glaber ) whose record longevity of 28.3 years makes it the longest - lived rodent , the white - faced capuchin monkey ( Cebus capucinus ) which can live over 50 years , and the bowhead whale ( Balaena mysticetus ) , the longest - lived mammal with an estimated longevity of over 200 years .
If approved , these organisms will be added to the queue of target organisms to be sequenced , the sequencing will be carried out in one of the NHGRI - funded sequencing centers , and the entire genome sequences will be deposited in free public databases .
...
Aging is not only a major puzzle of biology but it has a profound impact on medicine with age - related diseases like heart diseases , type II diabetes , cancer , and neurodegenerative diseases among the leading causes of death in modern societies .
Recent research has revealed several gene systems that can regulate longevity , aging , and multiple age - related diseases in short - lived model organisms .
Nonetheless , the longevity effects of these genes are modest when compared to the lengthening of lifespans during evolution .
Among mammals alone there is at least a 40 - fold variation in maximum longevity .
We still do not know why different species of similar body plan , biochemistry , and physiology can age at such different rates , but these differences must be seated in the genome .
In this white paper , we champion the idea that longevity should also be taken into consideration when choosing target organisms for sequencing , and we propose the sequencing of three organisms of unique interest for aging research ( in order of priority ) ...
In particular Heterocephalus and Cebus have a much longer lifespan than expected for their body size .
The scientists backing the proposal are looking for letters of support from other engaged life scientists ; give it some thought if you fit that description and are supportive of government - funded work on genome science .
As for myself , I am neither of these things , but the basic idea seems more interesting in many ways than the search for longevity genes in humans .
I have mentioned whale longevity in the past ; it is one good example of the way in which mammalian biochemistry could be reconfigured to be far more efficient than human biochemistry .
Whales have many times as many cells as we do , and thus many times the risk of cancer , were they built the same way as humans - but they still make it through multiple centuries of life .
For all that , the naked mole - rats are in many ways even more impressive , living more than eight times longer than similarly - sized peers in the animal kingdom .
A couple of other items of interest from the past on animal longevity :
I do n't see the re-engineering of our biochemistry for longevity as a short - term proposition - it's a fearsomely complex undertaking .
This sort of endeavor sounds like something we 'll see much more of around the time that the first reseachers are designing entire human genomes with a good idea as to how to make things better .
This will likely prove to be decades past the time at which we could have learned how to repair age - related damage in our present biochemistry .
First things first , I say , for all that these prospects for the future are exciting ones .
Technorati tags : aging , biotechnology , longevity
The painful end to a passionate love affair can take months , even years , to recover from .
Sometimes you never really get over it .
Not entirely .
The death of a loved one can produce the same scars .
So can being the victim of a particularly vicious crime , one that constantly replays itself in your nightmares .
They 're horrible things to endure .
But they 're also the things that , searing as the pain may be , remind you that you 're a living , sentient being .
The pain and sorrow of life , and how you deal with their effects , is part of what fuels your humanity .
It 's part of what lets you continue growing throughout that life , part of what gives you wisdom in your old age .
Now science is on the verge of wiping that out .
A study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports that researchers at Harvard and Montreal 's McGill University are getting good results from propranolol , a drug used in the treatment of amnesia , that appears to block , if not completely remove , bad memories on a selective basis .
The drug was tested using 19 victims of various kinds of trauma , including accidents and rape .
Some subjects were given propranolol , others a placebo .
Researchers say that in those receiving the drug , the biochemical pathways that serve memory were disrupted sufficiently enough to dull , if not erase , the most painful recollections .
You can argue that if science is capable of doing this , then people should n't have to remember terrible things at all .
It 's a tempting notion , a siren song , no doubt about it .
But is it ultimately healthy ?
I 'm no shrink and I have no answer .
But I think it 's worth asking the question .
Did the postman ring twice while your wife was at home and now they 've fled to Capri , leaving you with the kids and the mortgage ?
Take one of these pills , man , and forget about it .
Hell , if that was me I 'd like to forget it .
But my gut tells me that there would be unintended , and probably undesirable , consequences .
It tells me that this might be one of those times , like Dr. Frankenstein 's attempt to reanimate life , when science is pushing around in dark corners where it should n't go .
It 's a view that I know many Wired News readers , besotted as they are with Vin de la technologie , do not share .
Is there an ethicist in the house ?
Or am I making too much out of this human - experience thing ?
Maybe erasing all unpleasantness is just what Dr. Feelgood ordered , the perfect metaphor for a new world that a surfeit of technology is helping to forge : one lacking in passion , empathy … just plain humanity .
Like anyone who has lived a life , I 've got my share of baggage , some of it better forgotten .
But if offered a pill tomorrow to make all the bad stuff miraculously disappear , I 'd turn it down .
I may not like the pain of remembering , but I know it 's a part of who I am .
Without it , I 'm just a Stepford wife with a chemical lobotomy .
Besides , if I really want to forget , well … as Bogie says in Casablanca , " It 's nothing that a little bourbon and soda could n't fix . "

Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz loves to splatter the media with the line that Windows , Red Hat Linux and Solaris stand as the only operating systems of significance in the server kingdom .
We 've spent the last few years struggling to appreciate the seriousness of that claim .
Sun 's declining system sales failed to inspire much optimism about the company conquering the data centers of tomorrow with a deflating “ venerable ” OS .
A number of recent items , however , coupled with a ' 06 spike in Sun 's sales have tweaked our view of Schwartz 's favored claim .
It could well be that Solaris – of all things – provides the “ iPod moment ” Sun seeks .
Schwartz 's justification for placing Solaris alongside Windows and Red Hat remains understandable enough .
Sun has a gigantic customer base , immense ISV support and emphasizes its version of Unix far more than rivals such as IBM and HP .
In addition , Sun spends a great deal of time courting developers and often includes Solaris angles in its various programs and applications aimed at coders .
For Solaris to “ matter ” in the sense that Schwartz uses the word , the OS must match Windows and Red Hat on forward looking terms – not a backward facing metric such as the installed base .
Regrettably for Sun , Solaris suffers when analysts and customers make such “ 2010 ” comparisons .
For one , the Unix server market continues to shrink by most measures , while the Windows and Linux server markets grow at healthy rates .
ISVs , customers and resellers all notice this trend and so divert their attention to the money making opportunities linked to Windows and Linux .
Linux enjoys an added bonus over both Solaris and Windows with its open reputation and backing from a wide variety of vendors .
The open source OS benefits from healthy developer interest and diverse investment .

Hat may dominate server - side Linux , but that does little to cramp the OS 's communal cachet .
Schwartz , in particular , has tried to counter these issues facing Solaris , during his rise through Sun 's ranks .
He helped revitalize the x86 version of Solaris and then open - sourced the OS .
Sun hoped that such maneuvers would break Solaris 's ties to SPARC processors and create a developer frenzy of sorts with coders of all shapes and sizes hoping to explore the glories of the freshly released Solaris 10 .
Where Sun bought into these hopes and dreams wholesale , we remained skeptical .
Old Solaris x86 backers such as HP ( Compaq , really ) turned their back on the OS 's Intel / AMD rebirth .
Meanwhile , developer interest in OpenSolaris looked decent enough but few would confuse such contained enthusiasm with the industry - wide Linux obsession .
SPARC SCHMARK
Through sheer persistence and substantial foresight , Sun may actually be eroding Solaris 's “ proprietary Unix ” baggage , giving critics a reason to believe that the company has another turnaround in store .
For one , Sun 's rivals have given up on knocking Solaris x86 in favor of , um , selling it .
HP executives have recently been caught bragging about selling more x86 boxes running Solaris than Sun.
HP also offers broad support for Solaris on x86 servers and even dishes out statements to customers celebrating this fact .
Add IBM 's tie - up with Sun around Solaris on x86 blades , and you have to give some credit to the Lazarus Edition of Sun's OS .
HP likes to bill the Solaris x86 push as a way of bringing disgruntled Solaris / SPARC types to its side .
We figure that 's just fine with Sun who would rather see a SPARC defector stay on Solaris than move to another OS running on x86 chips .
The OpenSolaris ploy appears to have gained momentum as well with activity on the project 's web site skyrocketing in recent months .
On both of these fronts , Solaris has gained that crucial freshness factor missing when Schwartz first started hammering away on the three OSes that matter campaign .
The Solaris revival becomes even more interesting as we look out to 2010 , if our sources are to be believed .
I spent the first part of my day at the Rally for Reason protest outside the Creation Museum .
The second half was spent inside the museum itself , which was created by the people who run Answers In Genesis ( AIG ) .
Here ’s the recap .
There are a lot of pages of notes , so I tried to condense wherever possible .
…
As soon as I got to the rally site , there was already a plane flying overhead with some welcoming words .
The protesters ( of which there were many more than you can see in the next picture ) were standing along the lone road that led to the entrance to the museum …
… which meant that everyone who visited the museum had to get past them .
This made for some interesting interactions .
Like the woman who drove past everyone screaming :
Y’all need so many prayers !
I do n’t know how prayers for us will lead to her understanding science , but maybe she knew something we did n’t .
Not all the hecklers were drivers .
Some came right up to us as we protested .
One lady and her ( relatively nicer ) husband came by itching to start a fight .
Besides provoking people through their proselytizing , they handed out Dum Dum lollipops which had a special message ( a weak version of Pascal ’s Wager ) attached to the stick :
If there is no God … …
A believer loses nothing at death .
If there is a God … …
An Atheist loses everything at death .
Who , then , is being a dum dum ?
Would anyone like to answer that last question …?
Since they were passing out Creationist propaganda , someone in our group felt it would be appropriate to hand the lady a science pamphlet .
As soon as it was in her hands , she quickly threw it to the ground like it had a disease on it .
That was sweet .
Let ’s get back to some more of the positive aspects of the day .
There was a lot of media coverage of the protest .
Reporters from local , national , and international news were there .
So were writers for Internet sites ( including Salon.com ) .
And there was one reporter who would n’t say where he was from …
That guy tried interviewing as many protesters as possible .
I decided to talk to him .
I do n’t know why .
I just wanted to see what he was trying to do .
But here ’s essentially how our conversation went :
Him :
Do you believe in Evolution ?
Me : Well , it ’s not a question of “ belief . ”
It ’s as much a fact as anything we know .
Him :
But it ’s called the Theory of Evolution .
Me : Yes , but a scientific “ theory ” is more than just some random idea …
Him :
Do you have faith in this theory ?
Me :
It ’s not a question of faith .
The evidence shows that Evolution is true .
Him :
So you ’re saying it ’s fact ?!
Even though you said it ’s just a theory ?
Me : You ’re twisting my words .
Stop that .
I ’m gonna go now .
Later on , standing in line for the museum with a group of my fellow college - aged protesters , that same guy walked right in front of us and called out to ( I presume ) his family , ahead in the line .
Somehow not noticing a bunch of young protesters wearing pro-atheist shirts , he started telling his family how he had “ talked to the protesters ” and got it all on tape !
But then , those evil protesters kicked him out !
So he was going to join the family in line !
Too bad he was lying .
Here ’s what actually happened :
Since we were rallying on the grass ( see above picture ) , the Man was interviewing people while standing on the road itself .
This was expressly forbidden by the cops .
The police actually escorted him out because he was violating the rules .
But he neglected to tell his family that part of the story …
He was n’t the only Creationist trying to cut in on the protesting publicity .
At one point , I was doing an interview , answering questions about my views on the museum .
In the middle of talking into the camera about why the material in the museum was not Science , a lady interrupted me and started responding to what I was saying .
Did I mention I was on camera at the time …?
Her name was Jeannine Vest and she was there with her friend Kaye Fish .
Both were mothers of young children ( none were older than eight ) and both had their Masters in Education degrees .
They simply wanted to be at the museum on opening day .
They came to our protesting area to hand us water .
While they did n’t go inside , they said they would come back for a full visit very soon .
When the cameras turned off , I asked them why they thought the museum was a good place .
They responded that there were so many museums … why not one with this point of view ?
They later added that there was no proof that radiometric dating or carbon dating were legitimate .
Oy .
It ’s so hard to engage in a dialogue with people who do n’t even understand the basis of the discussion …
Ok .
Back to the positivity .
Look !
A picture of me with Nicole Smalkowski !
Because she ’s just awesome .
There were many protesters who were veterans to the atheist cause .
And , to my delight , there were many people who had never participated in an event like this before .
The protesters were young and old .
There were even some religious people in the crowd ( though not as many as I would ’ve liked to see ) .
Tim O’Connor and his fiancé Connie Brockman were among the newcomers .
They were n’t affiliated with any atheist group but had heard about the rally via petitions against the non-scientific teachings of the Creation Museum circulating through some real museums in Cincinnati .
They came to the rally because they felt that they were seeing a lot of “ aggressive negativity from religion ” and wanted to curb it .
They were curious ( as was I ) why there were n’t more religious representatives at the protest .
Another newcomer was Michelle Duennes , an agnostic college student from the College of Mount St. Joseph .
She came because science is a passion of hers– she wants to be a college professor one day– and she wanted to protect her passion .
Michelle was surprised at the large turnout as she did n’t expect to see so many people at the rally .
She had wanted other students from her school to join her and started a Facebook group for that purpose .
But to her surprise , there was a backlash from some of her classmates .
Incredibly , one of them said that protesting the Creation Museum was just like standing outside the arena while a band you do n’t like plays inside .
If only it was as simple as not liking the material in the museum …
A girl named Robin , who at 14 called herself an agnostic ( “ or a Pastafarian ” ) , felt that the protest was a good idea .
She was frustrated , however , when people came up to her and asked where they could park …
Sophia Riehemann , on the other hand , was a veteran of the atheist movement .
She ’s only 16 , but she has gone to Camp Quest since she was 8 .
Not only that , but she was also present at the Godless Americans March on Washington back in 2002 .
I asked her if she thought the rally was effective .
She felt it was , adding she hoped children being driven past the protesters would see that there were other ways to view the world than the Biblical view they were being raised with .
The issue of whether the rally was effective or not was on the minds of several people .
Thomas and Raina , a couple from Pennsylvania , said the rally might be effective … but they were there because it was for a good cause .
Ben Myers , a student at The Ohio State University , felt the rally was absolutely effective .
He stated that we were there to show our dissent , which is the highest form of patriotism .
I asked him how he was dealing with the Creationists in our midst .
He said the way to handle them was through non-violent protest or dialogue , adding that dialogue was n’t really their language .
He was optimistic , though , that our mere presence there would reach a lot of people .
Carol Carlson was a theist in the protesting crowd .
While she ( obviously ) supported what the pro-Science people were doing , she did have some concerns .
She felt that there was an implication being made that anyone with a Southern accent was automatically ignorant .
She also did not appreciate the atheist speakers who mocked Jesus and Christianity – that ’s not what the event was for .
I did enjoy the fact that she learned to be a liberal while in the convent .
Yep , she used to be a nun .
But now , she was out protesting with the rest of us .
By the way … here were some of the protest signs that amused me :
Dumbing down children is child abuse

Ooh .
Last thing .
Here ’s a picture of a porta - potty at the rally site .
I think we need to insert the letter “ k ” somewhere …

Hugo Chavez , like most socialists , is starting to have paranoid delusions .
He seems to think that America , a nation stuck in two middle eastern nations , led by a President who considers Venezuela to be problem number 16 on a 10 - item list , is going to invade Venezuela .
And the man who cares so much about his nation ’s poor is spending billions on a Navy and air defense system :
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said his government may buy a fleet of Russian - made submarines when he visits Moscow next week , continuing an arms buildup that has cost his nation more than $ 4.3 billion since 2005 .
“ The only way Venezuela could totally discard the idea of not buying submarines is if we did n’t have a sea , ” Chavez told cabinet members at a televised ceremony tonight in Caracas .
“ We have to protect that sea . ”
Chavez said he also is looking to strengthen the nation ’s short - range air - defense system to counter supersonic and “ invisible ” radar - evading aircraft he claimed Venezuela would face in the event of a U.S. invasion .
Most U.S. analysts deem such an offensive unlikely .
Chavez , who is using his country ’s oil wealth to promote socialist policies across the region , often urges developing nations to unite against the U.S. “ empire , ” winning allies abroad and scoring political points at home by attacking the U.S. for draining Venezuela ’s natural resources , propping up a corrupt elite and funding groups that aim to destabilize his government .
…
Venezuela spent $ 4.3 billion on arms in 2005 and 2006 , more than China , Pakistan or Iran , according to a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report .
More than $ 3 billion of that was spent in Russia , where Venezuela has signed contracts to buy 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles , 50 military helicopters and 24 Su - 30 jet fighters , the report said .
You do n’t feed the poor with Kalashnikov’s .
The playbook Chavez is using is not a new one .
He ’s slowly cementing power , because like all socialist nations , eventually the money supply runs out .
He ’s already had a coup attempt on him , and he knows that his best bet to remain in power is to make sure his generals are fat and happy , and willing to carry out his rule with an iron fist .
That way , when the bottom drops out , and the poor who he ’s been feeding begin to tighten their belts , there wo n’t be enough loose power in society to take him on .
As Eric used to point out here while he was still blogging , the best way to cement power at home is to use an external threat .
That ’s true whether you ’re trying to convince Americans to give up essential liberties to fight a vague terrorist threat , or whether you ’re trying to convince Venezuelans to support giving you dictatorial powers to fight off an imagined American invasion .
A few billion military dollars spent , and Chavez is home free .
When the Venezuelan people finally realize what ’s going on , they wo n’t have the power to stop him .
I ’m updating NearbyGamers to Rails 1.2.1 .
Nothing broke except my use of assert_tag in my tests ; it ’s been long - regarded as squicky and has been replaced with assert_select .
As I ’m tidying up some deprecated code , it occurs to me that this makes for an interesting example of how I feel Rails is changing .
Rails is growing inwards and upwards , not just outwards .
They ’re finding better , terser , more Rails - ish ways to express things .
They ’re not piling on features , they ’re condensing .
I ’ve mentioned that this is what coding in Rails continually feels like : sometimes it just feels off even though it works and is nicer than other languages , and soon I realize a beautiful Right Way to do it .
Where Rails gained new features , the developers have redesigned functionality to make me think , “ Wow , of course , that ’s obviously much nicer ” and it does more because it ’s better - designed .
Let me give you an example using assert_tag .
I ’ve got tests that render pages and make sure they contain certain bits of HTML .
One test used to be :
assert_tag : tag => " div " ,
:attributes => { : id => ' notice ' } ,
: child => {
: tag => " div " ,
: content => text
}
And now it reads :
assert_select " div#notice > div " , text
They rebuilt the assertion to use CSS selectors ( with a few clever additions ) .
Suddently the code is simpler , more idiomatic , and more featureful .
And that ’s just what coding Rails feels like .
Donohue is a typical right wing bully .
I have to figure that many Catholics are offended as I am by this man and I wish they would come out and say it .
All he does is name call and spew hatred and violence as he searches for ways to silence people --- in this case telling Cosmo that he 's lucky he does n't cut off his head .
And his offense ?

DONAHUE : Oh , no , let me tell you something .
You 're -- you 're lucky I 'm not as mean , because you might lose more than your head .

Was that part of this ?
C. CAVALLARO : No .
Did you hear what this gentleman is saying , that I would lose my head ?
Digby : But until the Catholic Church steps up and says that this screaming nutcase Bill Donohue and his band of freaks do n't speak for them , I 'm going to have to assume that the Catholic Church agrees with his lunatic ravings .--- So it must be the medium .
The fact that it is sculpted in chocolate is so offensive to Donohue 's thugs that they are issuing death threats to those who display such alleged blasphemy .

The Mahablog says : Et tu , Michelle ?
( Full transcript below the fold )
COOPER : Well , I do n't think it 's our job here on 360 to tell you what to think about something .
We just ask the questions and help you decide .
A few minutes ago , I talked to artist Cosimo Cavallaro and the man who worked to shut down his exhibit , Bill Donahue , president of the Catholic League .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
COOPER : Cosimo , I want to start by asking you what your intention was with -- with this -- this piece of art .
C. CAVALLARO : My intention was to celebrate this body of Christ , and in a sweet , delicious , tasteful way .
COOPER : Why -- why use chocolate ?
C. CAVALLARO : Because it 's a substance that I like .
And it 's sweet .
And I felt that the body of Christ , the -- the meaning of Christ , is about the sweetness .
COOPER : Were you trying to shock , I mean , to -- to cause attention ?
Often -- usually , when Christ is shown , he 's wearing some form of clothing .
This is a naked Christ , which has also caused some concern .
C. CAVALLARO : No more than the religion , the way they use it .
I was just using it as an iconic figure .
I mean , that my intentions was to shock people , no .
I was -- my intention was to have them taste the -- and feel what they 're looking at in their mouth .
COOPER : Bill , you call this exhibit hate speech .
You said it 's -- quote -- " one of the worst assaults on Christian sensibilities ever . "
What specifically offends you about it ?
WILLIAM DONAHUE , PRESIDENT , CATHOLIC LEAGUE :
Well , of course , asking the public to come in and eat Jesus , with his genitals exposed , during Holy Week I think would be self - explanatory .
If we took an image of this artist 's mother , and made her out in chocolate , with her genitals exposed , of course , to be equal , and then asked the public to eat her on Mother 's Day , yes , he might have a problem .
Maybe he would n't .
But you know what bothers me ?
It 's not even the artist .
I mean , we have a lot of these loser artists down in SoHo and around the country .
What bothers me is that this guy Knowles , who is an artist in residence , the owner , the president and CEO of an establishmentarian site , the Roger Smith Hotel , 47th and Lexington , in the heart of Midtown Manhattan , that is what bothers me , because now we have the establishment kicking in .
And to put this out during Holy Week , on street level , when kids can walk in off the street , these people are morally bankrupt .
And my goal is to make them financially bankrupt .
COOPER : Cosimo , do you understand the outrage this has caused ?
I mean , do you think it 's overreaction ?
Do you get it ?
C. CAVALLARO : Yes , I get it .
I think it 's an overreaction .
You just heard the gentleman calling artists losers , or me a loser .
I think what he's -- his assault is on the public at large , artists , and freedom of speech , and every Catholic .
I'm a Catholic , and I 'm a Christian .
And I think this gentleman does n't even represent the people that are in his faith .
DONAHUE : That 's funny .
You said I put out a fatwa , right ?
Or the -- or the -- that was the -- the guy who ran the lab , says I put out a fatwa .
I put out a news release .
So , you 're accusing me of being like the Taliban ; is that right ?
C. CAVALLARO : Who , me ?
You 're not that intelligent .
( LAUGHTER )
DONAHUE : Oh , no , let me tell you something .
You 're -- you 're lucky I 'm not as mean , because you might lose more than your head .
COOPER : Cosimo , did you want people to eat this ?
Was that part of this ?
C. CAVALLARO : No .
Did you hear what this gentleman is saying , that I would lose my head ?
DONAHUE : No , I -- you heard what I said .
I said you 're -- you 're lucky I 'm not like the Taliban , because you would lose more than your head , which is why ...
C. CAVALLARO : Right .
So , therefore ...
( CROSSTALK )
DONAHUE : ... guys like you would n't do this against Mohammed during Ramadan .
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : No , because I 'm a Christian .
And I 'm not trying to ...
DONAHUE : Oh , you 're a Christian .
Please .
Do n't lie about it , all right ?
Do n't lie about it .
C. CAVALLARO : I 'm not lying .
No , I 'm not lying about it .
DONAHUE : Yes , you are .
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : I want to ask you a question , Mr. Donahue .
DONAHUE : Yes .
C. CAVALLARO : Where do you think I should exhibit this ?
Because you -- you have bamboozled an art gallery .
DONAHUE : Right .
C. CAVALLARO : And you have bamboozled an establishment .
You have put fear in people to listen to your rhetoric and to believe -- just because a man has got his arms extended and he 's made in chocolate -- it 's your Christ -- and it 's offensive .
DONAHUE : That 's right .
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : And , by the way -- excuse me .
I 'm going to talk to you for a minute .
You keep quiet .
DONAHUE : And you want the public to eat him .
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : Now , you go to the Catholic Church ...
( CROSSTALK )
COOPER : Let Cosimo finish his point .
C. CAVALLARO : You go to the Catholic Church , and you 're going to see statues from Michelangelo that are nude .
Are you going to clothe them for the Holy Week ?
DONAHUE : OK .
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : And are you telling me that , apart from the Holy Week , we could do anything we want to do with the genitalia ?
What are you talking about ?
DONAHUE : The ...
COOPER : OK .
Let Bill answer .
DONAHUE : All right .
All right , first of all , Leonardo , you 're not .
But , quite frankly , where should you have this displayed ?
In New Jersey is where New Yorkers put their garbage .
There 's a big sanitation dump .
That 's where you should put it .
COOPER : Bill , let me read you something that David Kuo , the former presidential assistant to President Bush , who worked in the Office of Faith - Based Community Initiatives , said in reference to your protest .
He said -- quote -- " Instead of getting all amped up over this art , Christians should be spending time facing the real and very challenging Jesus found in the Gospels , and encouraging others to do the same . "
( CROSSTALK )
COOPER : Are you making a bigger deal out of this than it deserves ?
DONAHUE : No , no , no , no .
COOPER : And does n't this , in fact , give this more attention than it ever would have received otherwise ?
DONAHUE : If , in fact , it was at some dump in SoHo , I probably would n't pay too much attention .
But the fact that the Roger Smith Hotel ...
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : ... dump in SoHo .
DONAHUE : ... right here in New York City is doing this thing , no .
If I do n't pay attention to it , then I -- my people should ask for me to be fired .
By the way , I am delighted with the response from Jews , Muslims , and others , not just Catholics and Protestants , with this .
People are basically saying , enough is enough .
This is absolutely revolting .
And what you 're saying , sir , is totally disingenuous .
No one believes it .
I do n't even think you believe it .
COOPER : But , Bill , does n't -- does n't --
I mean , do n't people have a right to express themselves ?
And is n't that what art is about ?
Are n't artists supposed to provoke thought ?
DONAHUE : That 's right .
And , if we -- and if we put a swastika out on a stamp in the United States , we could call that art .
It was an art exhibition .
I do n't think Jews would go for that .
Just because art is art does n't mean that it is a right that is absolute .
Art can be insulting and it can be offensive .
And when these people are whining , claiming victim status , as this guy is doing , because of my exercise of my First Amendment right of freedom of speech -- I did n't call the cops to come in and censor this .
I 'm simply saying I called up about 500 of my friends and -- running different Catholic , Protestant , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu and non- sectarian organizations to boycott the Roger Smith Hotel .
They 're morally bankrupt .
I want to see them financially bankrupt .
COOPER : Cosimo , I want to give you the final thought .
Do you plan to -- to display this elsewhere ?
C. CAVALLARO : Yes , I do , hopefully .
And I would like to add to the gentleman who referred to the swastika , he 's actually acting like a Nazi .
( LAUGHTER )
C. CAVALLARO : And I -- I would like to ask one question .
Where do you suggest that I exhibit this ?
Because you basically pulled it out of a gallery for me .
So , where do you think ...
DONAHUE : No . I -- I told you ...
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : Where -- no , excuse me .
Where do you suggest that an artist should exhibit his work that you do n't infringe on ?
DONAHUE : Well , you know , go to some dump down in SoHo , where ...
C. CAVALLARO : A dump ?
DONAHUE : ... nobody will pay attention .
C. CAVALLARO : Is there a church in SoHo that 's a dump , too , because ...
DONAHUE : Oh , you would like to ...
( CROSSTALK )
C. CAVALLARO : No , let me tell you something .
DONAHUE : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C. CAVALLARO : There 's two priests that have wanted to exhibit this in their church .
DONAHUE : Is that right ?
C. CAVALLARO : Yes , absolutely .
DONAHUE : Give me their names .
C. CAVALLARO : I will not , because you 're a bully .
( LAUGHTER )
C. CAVALLARO : And you know what ?
I believe that there 's people in your organization that would like you to resign .
DONAHUE : Is that right ?
C. CAVALLARO : Absolutely .
And you 're ...
DONAHUE : Well , how come -- I have n't heard from them .
C. CAVALLARO : I got to tell you something , there 's more filth that comes out of your mouth ...
DONAHUE : Is that right ?
C. CAVALLARO : Yes -- than I have seen ...
( CROSSTALK )
DONAHUE : Look , you lost .
You know what ?
You put your middle finger at the Catholic Church , and we just broke it , did n't we , pal ?
C. CAVALLARO : No .
You 're wrong .
You 're wrong .
DONAHUE : Yes , we did .
You lost .
C. CAVALLARO : I have a lot of believers .
DONAHUE : We -- we won .
You 're out of a job .
C. CAVALLARO : And I 'm a Christian .
And there 's a lot of people like me , who are opposed to what you 're doing , because you made a big ...
DONAHUE : Yes ?
But I got a job , and you do n't .
C. CAVALLARO : You made a -- " I got a job , and you do n't " ?
DONAHUE : Yes .
C. CAVALLARO : You 're acting like a 5 - year - old .
DONAHUE : I got a job , and you do n't .
C. CAVALLARO : You 're talking -- you 're acting like a 5 - year - old .
And I feel sorry for you .
COOPER : All right .
We 're going to -- we 're ...
DONAHUE : Well , I won on this , and you lost , did n't you ?
COOPER : Well , let 's -- let 's leave it there .
You both expressed your opinions .
Bill Donahue , appreciate you being with -- and , Cosimo Cavallaro , appreciate it as well .
Thank you , sir .
C. CAVALLARO : Thank you , Anderson .
Bruce Schneier does not leak information on the EM spectrum : he emits the theme to The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly .
See a computer - generated image of the new carrier
Enlarge Image
He said the £ 3.8 bn contract would lead to the construction of the largest vessels ever sailed by the Royal Navy .
The new 65,000 - tonne carriers - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales - will enter service in 2014 and 2016 .
Mr Browne said the work would support and create 10,000 jobs across the UK , including those at yards on the Clyde , Rosyth , Portsmouth and Barrow .
The contract was described as a " major project " for the shipbuilding industry by Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
The work will be shared among a number of companies , including BAE Systems ' Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow , which employ 3,000 people .
The ships will be built in sections and then assembled at the Rosyth dockyard in Fife .
Making the announcement , Mr Browne said the carriers would " provide our front - line forces with the modern , world class capabilities they will need over the coming decades " .
I am pleased that VT Group and BAE Systems intend to form a joint venture in naval shipbuilding and support
Des Browne
Defence Secretary
Carriers ' huge capacity Welcome for decision
" The carriers represent a step - change in our capabilities , enabling us to deliver increased strategic effect and influence around the world at a time and place of our choosing . "
However , he said the carriers could not be built without a change in the maritime sector .
" I am pleased that VT Group and BAE Systems intend to form a joint venture in naval shipbuilding and support , " said Mr Browne .
" The creation of such a joint venture will enable the Royal Navy to work with the industry to deliver the infrastructure the navy will need to support the fleet in the future while retaining all three of our existing naval bases at Portsmouth , Devonport and Faslane .
" This will be good news for the three communities . "
Thousands of people are employed by the Clyde yards
However , he warned there would be " some reductions " in the 17,800 personnel currently employed at the bases .
The Ministry of Defence said about 40 % of the carriers work would be carried out by the joint venture between BAE Systems and VT Group - 15 % in Portsmouth and 25 % in Glasgow .
Thales and Babcock will each have 16 % of the contract , while the remaining 28 % will be carried out by BAE Systems at Barrow and by its Integrated System Technologies ( Insyte ) division , based in Surrey .
Shadow Defence Secretary Liam
Fox welcomed the announcement but said it came at " a high price " for the navy .
" Since 1997 , the Royal Navy has faced significant cuts in force levels completely at odds with the government 's own strategic defence review which called for 32 surface combatants , " he said .
" We welcome the retention of three of our existing naval bases , but there will be a strong suspicion that we are not being told the full story today . "
This is an absolutely wonderful and brilliant day for the city
Gerald Vernon - Jackson
Portsmouth City Council leader
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Willie Rennie said : " I am sure the communities of the three navy bases will welcome the decision but will perhaps wait with trepidation about the potential losses in jobs . "
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said he was pleased that the announcement would safeguard thousands of Scottish jobs .
Councillor Gerald Vernon - Jackson , the leader of Portsmouth City Council , said it would have " ripped the soul out of the city " if the navy had pulled out .
He said : " This is an absolutely wonderful and brilliant day for the city and for the campaign we have waged to try to make sure we keep the navy base here in Portsmouth .
" The presumption last August when the review was launched was that Portsmouth would close but we have been able to turn that around completely so that Portsmouth remains the home of the navy . "

5. Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer are not speaking .
The majority of Americans believe Dick Cheney and George Bush should be impeached .
Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the House , says no .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , I am told by someone familiar with the inner workings of the House , favors proceeding with impeaching Cheney .
But Nancy says no .
Pelosi is being described by some as Tom Delay in a skirt , in terms of her refusal to pay attention to what the majority of Americans want .

( Original Article )
At the entrance to the Hanburger Bahnhof , a former train station that houses Berlin ’s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
Enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
Up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment :
In the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
More than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object -- full of bite marks -- is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
Indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " Schmerz " ( " Pain " ) :
How to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
Berlin 's museum for contemporary art
A twofold approach
For Hamburger Bahnhof curator Eugen Blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" The juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
This idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " Schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the Hamburger Bahnhof Museum of Contemporary Art and the Medical History Museum of Berlin 's Charité teaching hospital .
The Hamburger Bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
Divided into two distinct sections , " Perceptions of Pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " Allure of Pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain -- including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
Just across the street , the Charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" Time of Pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " Expression of Pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
Both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " :
About 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
Taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
By dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
The passion of Christ
The crucifixion of Christ : the ultimate symbol of pain
Religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
In what is perhaps the Western world ’s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of Jesus Christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
But always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of Frederick T. Zugibes , an American doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
There are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th - century " Medicinal Magnetic Cross of Saint Benedict " :
At a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
And in the Charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor - ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
Stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
Suited for all ages
" Schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion
But the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
Hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" Schmerz " is a G - rated exhibition , suitable for all ages -- a conscious decision , Charité museum co-curator Daniel Tyradellis told Spiegel Online .
The Hamburger Bahnhof and the Charité museum relied on their own Berlin - based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" Schmerz " showcases artists ranging from Marina Abramovic , Francis Bacon and Joseph Beuys to Louise Bourgeois , Bruce Nauman and Sam Taylor - Wood , among others .
" Schmerz " runs from April 5 through Aug. 5 in the Hamburger Bahnhof Museum of Contemporary Art and the Charité Medical Historical Museum .
Tickets cost 12 euros ( $ 16 ) or 6 euros at reduced price .
The catalog is available on site for 39.90 euros ( DuMont publishing house , Cologne ) .
James Lewis died at night , after a football game .
The Miami Northwestern Senior High Bulls had played the Booker T. Washington Tornadoes .
In the parking lot outside Traz Powell Stadium , Lewis stood among a small crowd .
A bullet fired from a pistol entered his body in what friends say was an assassination .
Lewis was popular in school .
He owned two cars .
He made other people jealous , his family says .
At age 17 his life looked good , too good for Liberty City , so he had to go .
The shooting occurred around midnight .
When Studio X opened the next day at 10:30 a.m. , Lewis ’ girlfriend was waiting .
In her fingers she clutched a photo of her boyfriend , also known as 3 - J .
She wanted to put him on a T - shirt .
Studio X is a booth at Flea Market usa , located on Northwest 79th Street , in Liberty City , the heart of black Miami .
Owner Chino Mizrachi has worked the flea market for the past 17 years .
Some simply refer to his booth by what they go there for , “ In Loving Memory Of ” T - shirts .
Mizrachi sells 500 In Loving Memory
Of T - shirts a week , on average .
More when someone popular dies , or if the week was particularly violent .
He occasionally makes shirts memorializing , say , a grandmother who died of old age .
But most shirts feature teenage boys , shot for various reasons , most often for no good reason at all .
Death is a stable business in Liberty City .
The murder rate across Miami - Dade County increased by nearly 40 percent last year , and more than twice as many kids under 18 were killed in 2006 than in the previous year .
In November , a Miami - Dade Police Department gun buyback event netted more than 1,100 revolvers , shotguns , rifles , and semiautomatic firearms , in four hours .
“ It ’s just deteriorating , ” Mizrachi explains .
“ It ’s just going from bad to worse .
I do n’t know where it ’s going to stop .
It used to be one guy a week and two guys a week , but nowadays you can find in one night , like , three or four guys can get killed and nobody cares . ”
The dead live on in two - inch - thick plastic binders shelved atop the main counter of Mizrachi ’s booth .
The binders , which he refers to as “ the most popular library in the city , ” contain pictures of almost every person he has memorialized .
The images are filed chronologically , by date of death .
Customers flip through the binders while they wait for their new shirts to be pressed , passing time as if walking through a cemetery appraising gravestones .
There ’s a young boy in cap and gown .
Another picture is labeled “ Baby . ”
There ’s a guy named Kick Daddy and an older woman posing with a parasol .
A young man squats with a pistol in his hand .
His picture is labeled , at the customer ’s request , “ Heaven for a G . ”
The newest arrivals wait in plastic bags , photos to be filed in the binders later .
“ In Memory Of a Hustler , Luciano Shuler a.k.a. Lucy . ”
“ Damn , I miss my DAWG !!! ” the words arcing slightly over a camouflage background .
“ In Loving Memory Of Stank . ”
The dead also live on the back wall of the booth , on what Mizrachi ’s friend Judas , a tattoo artist , calls “ The Spooky Wall . ”
Dozens of pictures hang in a gallery .
In a typical photo , a man in sunglasses squats , head cocked , holding guns in both hands .
“ We call that the prison pose , ” Mizrachi says .
“ That ’s the classic pose .
Holding , like , a submachine gun or something like that .
Then he ’s squatting down .
There ’s a brick wall behind him .
That ’s the pose .
He ’s got a mean look on his face ; he ’s a real big shot . ”
Throughout the booth hang samples of other products Mizrachi offers , such as buttons with people ’s faces on them .
And flags , with images on each side , that can be attached to cars like sports pennants .
One of the newest offerings is “ dog tags , ” which cost $ 30 for a small tag , and up to $ 70 for larger ones encircled in fake gemstones .
Mizrachi is always pushing the dog tags .
“ The shirts still sell more , but dog tags make more money , ” explains Leonard Brown , one of Mizrachi ’s three employees .
Brown is 19 , a kid from the neighborhood .
His father was killed when “ he was in the wrong place at the wrong time . ”
He ’s been working at the booth after school and on weekends for seven years , mostly designing T - shirts .
“ To me a shirt is like love , you know what I ’m saying ?
It symbolizes love , ” he says .
“ If you love that person , you ’re going to go out and get a shirt and just walk around in the streets to show people , I knew him , he was my homeboy and I got love for him and I miss him . ”
Customers can order pre-designed shirts , or they can create a design from scratch , using a picture they bring or a digital file .
On a form they write the name of the deceased , along with the birth date and date of death , sometimes described on the shirt as “ sunrise ” and “ sunset . ”
Mizrachi or one of his employees scans the picture , then Photoshops it into a number of templates :
“ In Loving Memory Of ” atop palm trees or a beach scene or clouds and angels .
“ In Thugin Memory Of ” atop a picture of the Miami skyline and a pair of Cadillacs .
“ In Loving Memory Of a Soldier ” over camouflage and crossed guns .
“ In Loving Memory Of a Player ” over a roulette wheel and a pair of dice .
3 - J’s girlfriend opted for white clouds in a blue sky .
In the picture 3 - J wears a baby - blue Atlanta Braves cap with a gold authenticity hologram stuck to its brim .
He crouches in the prison pose .
In Loving Memory OfJames LewisA.K.A. 3 - J Sunrise , sunset .
The whole process takes about five minutes .
With a popular kid like 3 - J , it ’s common for customers to have to wait in line for two hours or more .
They stand with friends or with family members or with people who just want a T - shirt to fit in with the fashion of the neighborhood .
“ They know the best place to be together to talk about the guy is the T - shirt place , ” Mizrachi says .
“ They have no place else right after .
Two , three days after , there ’s the wake , but when it happens , it ’s fresh , they all come to me here . ”
Chess champion Sherdavia Jenkins , 9 , was shot to death in front of her house last July .
In August , aspiring fashion designer Otissha Burnett , 17 , was killed by one of more than 20 bullets fired at a block party .
Last May 21 it was 17 - year - old Jeffrey Johnson who was shot and killed .
He ’d been a student in the law magnet program at Carol City Senior High .
He carried a 4.9 grade point average , interned at the Miami office of Rep. Kendrick Meek ( D - Fla. ) , and won a scholarship to St. Thomas University , where he planned to study law .
As a reward for his good grades , his father had bought him a burnt - orange Chevrolet Monte Carlo with wide tires , gleaming rims , and doors that opened up like wings .
The car played well in Liberty City .
At a block party just before graduation , Johnson parked nose - to - nose with a candy - apple red Pontiac Grand Prix .
With a DJ egging them on , the two owners vied for approval .
The Monte Carlo got applause for its interior , but the crowd preferred the chassis of the Grand Prix .
“ While they were having this battle of ‘ My car is better than your car , ’ the victim pulled on his graduation cap , ” Miami Police spokesman Delrish Moss later told the Miami Herald .
This was perceived as an insult , a sign that Johnson believed his future trumped any mere vehicle .
The insulted driver punched Johnson .
Soon dozens of shots rang out .
A bullet struck one boy in the right thigh ; another boy was shot in the foot .
Johnson was struck in the torso .
The police found his mortarboard — white cloth stretched over a sturdy square of cardboard–next to his body .
Johnson was the third Carol City High kid to be gunned down last school year .
One student died in a robbery attempt ; another went into a store to buy milk for her baby and was shot on the way out .
Police say at least 60 people witnessed that shooting , but no one stepped forward to identify her killer .
Rep .
Meek called Johnson ’s death “ a terrible tragedy for our community . ”
On a memorial poster to Johnson hung at his high school , someone scrawled , “ We ca n’t keep losing our brothers like this . ”
The morning after Johnson died , Mizrachi arrived at his booth , unrolled the metal door , turned on the cash register , and fired up the copier , computers , and steam presses .
“ When I heard about that guy on the news , I called my guys and told them to be ready , ” he says .
Outside there were people waiting , eager to put Jeffrey Johnson ’s face on a T - shirt .
A new study shows that diet may be a key culprit in asthma , a chronic swelling of the airways that affects some 20 million Americans , six million of them children .
Researchers report in the journal Chest that adolescents are more likely to experience respiratory problems if their diets are deficient in certain nutrients .
" Teens with the lowest intake of fruit , vitamins C and E , and omega - 3 fatty acids had lower lung function and higher reports of respiratory symptoms such as cough and wheeze , " says study author Jane Burns , an epidemiologist at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston .
Burns and her colleagues surveyed 2,115 U.S. and Canadian high school students from 16 to 19 years of age over the course of a school year about their eating habits — and , also , tested their lung function .
They discovered that teens who consumed less than 25 percent of one serving of fruit each day were more likely to have less efficient lung function than their compeers .
Burns and her colleagues speculate that fruit plays a role because it is rich in vitamin C— also associated with healthy lungs — as well as in flavonoids , antioxidants that hamper the production of free radicals .
Free radicals are compounds composed of unstable atoms generated both by the body and environmental sources such as smoking and pollution that damage cells , possibly leading to increased disease susceptibility and aging .
" The associations of fruit with pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms may be a result of a joint protective effect of flavonoids and vitamin C on airway and alveolar epithelium , " the researchers wrote .
Burns says that low levels of vitamin E and omega - 3 , meantime , were associated with a higher incidence of reported asthma .
It did not seem to matter if the vitamins came from natural sources or supplements .
Lewis Smith , a professor of medicine at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , says this research confirms many previous studies showing the benefits of a healthy diet on respiratory function .
The difficulty is determining which nutrients among the thousands in various foods are actually responsible for the health benefits , says Smith , who has conducted studies that link soy isoflavones ( also powerful antioxidants ) with a decrease in the severity of asthma symptoms .
" This is a very complicated disease [ and ] an awful lot of work needs to be done [ to understand ] the causes , " Burns says .
She is currently involved in two new studies — one probing the effects of air pollution and the other examining the synergistic effects of smog and diet on respiratory well - being .
The bottom line : " We really have a pervasive problem with teens not meeting the recommended allowances [ of foods and micronutrients ] " Burns says .
" A poor diet is definitely a factor affecting asthma symptoms . "
A gaggle of aging rockers have teamed up to demand an extension of copyright terms on recorded music , according to reports in the Independent and the Daily Telegraph today .
The backers of the proposal , which seeks to match the American copyright statute of 95 years , include current and former luminaries like Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull , Cliff Richard ( no word on whether the Young Ones support the initiative ) , clarinetist Acker Bilk , and Bono .
No , not Sonny Bono — his damage has been done here in the US — it 's that guy from U2 .
The artists are worried about losing their royalty checks from recordings made 50 years ago , which some of them claim to be a substantial part of their current income .
Journeymen like backing guitarist Joe Brown , for example , seem to be feeling the heat .
" It 's just not right , " says Brown .
" It is thieving .
They give me a heating allowance but they are going to take my royalties away .
It is a matter of right and wrong .
Why is this limit there in the first place ? "
And some of the more successful artists seem to feel solidarity with the plight of the lesser names .
" Of course , for Pink Floyd , Elton John , Rod Stewart - and I 'm not short of a few bob - this may not be a problem , " says Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson .
" But the unsung heroes of the 1950s depend on royalties to pay heating and nursing home bills . "
Well , silly me .
I thought copyright rules were in place to encourage creation of new works in the first place , and the term is limited to ensure a rich public domain that can serve as a platform for the imagination of the next generation .
These were the laws when Brown and his fellow early rockers recorded their first albums in the 50s ; nobody has shortened the term on them .
They just got old .
As it is , British composers enjoy lifetime plus 70 years of copyright protection on the material they compose , letting John Lennon 's great - grandchildren collect royalties for " Imagine " until the year 2050 .
And the songwriter collects some money every time his song is played on the radio or sold on a CD , wax roll , or iTMS , regardless of who performed the tune on that recording .
The copyright rule under fire here only covers sales of a particular performance ; radio play is worthless to Joe Brown unless it drives record sales .
But it 's not all about the money this time .
It 's about creative control as well .
Once the copyright on a recording expires , others can use it in whatever way they see fit .
That may or may not be a good thing .
For instance , look at " Ring of Fire , " one of the greatest hits in the Johnny Cash catalogue .
If his works had passed into the public domain at his death , that song would have been used to sell hemorrhoid cream the year after his passing .
I can see how his surviving family might have been offended by that idea .
Record companies seem to be quietly cheering the rockers on from the sidelines .
The works of the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , and the Monkees will start to phase out of copyright soon unless something is done .
We 've seen this phenomenon before , as copyright terms seem to retreat whenever Mickey Mouse approaches the end of protection , and it would be a surprise to see the rights of consumers and the next wave of creative talent win out this time .
There is just too much money in the entertainment business to risk fresh material replacing the tried and true classics .
" Government figures show creative industries provide 8 per cent of the ' gross value added ' to the UK economy , " says the Independent article , and the BPI — the British equivalent of the RIAA — worries that " just 50 years " of protection hampers British pop culture when American singers and accordion players enjoy nearly twice that protection .
And profits from the back catalog provide the funds for promoting the next New Kids On the Block Darin uh ... star talent .
The British will never walk alone , however .
As part of the EU , they live under European laws and must persuade the good folks in Brussels to go along with this scheme .
So thanks to a bunch of survivors from the British Invasion , all of Europe might soon be blanketed by the same excessive copyright laws as the United States .
Wonder how Disney would have fared if Snow White or Cinderella had remained © Jacob Ludwig Grimm and Philipp Wilhelm Grimm ?
Professor Eric Faden of Bucknell University created this humorous , yet informative , review of copyright principles delivered through the words of the very folks we can thank for nearly endless copyright terms .

Slackware switching to the MariaDB database From today 's Slackware - current ChangeLog :
The big news here is the removal of MySQL in favor of MariaDB .
This should n't really be a surprise on any level .
The poll on LQ showed a large majority of our users were in favor of the change .
It 's my belief that the MariaDB Foundation will do a better job with the code , be more responsive to security concerns , and be more willing to work with the open source community .
And while I do n't think there is currently any issue with MySQL 's licensing of the community edition for commercial uses , several threads on LQ showed that there is confusion about this , whereas with MariaDB the freedom to use the software is quite clear .
Thanks are due to Heinz Wiesinger for his work on transitioning the build script , testing , and getting us all behind this move .
He 's been working with MariaDB ( and their developers ) for several years now .
Vincent Batts also had a hand in the early discussions here -- he met Daniel Bartholomew of MariaDB on a train last year and got a copy of the source to play with to pass the time on the journey ( ah , the miracle of thumbdrives :) , and was impressed with not only MariaDB itself , but also with the welcome that Slackware was getting .
We expect they 'll be responsive to any concerns we have .
In the vast majority of situations , MariaDB is entirely compatible with existing MySQL databases and will drop right in with no changes required .
There 's an article available outlining the areas in which MariaDB differs from MySQL that I 'd recommend reading :
https://kb.askmonty.org/v/mariadb-versus-mysql-compatibility/
Thanks to the MariaDB Foundation !
We look forward to working with you .

The CSS working group is irrelevant
Back in March , Google hosted the CSS working group for a three day meeting .
At the time , we were just starting with the HTML working group , and the openness of the WHATWG over the past few years was just starting to be adopted by the HTML working group , after several months of pushing for it in the W3C ( mostly in secret , though my own posts on the matter were all public , as were a few others ) .
One of the things I brought up in the CSS face - to - face meeting was the problem of the CSS working group not being open .
Many of the members of the CSS working group have a mentality that view the Web community ( such as those who e-mail the www - style mailing list ) as a resource , not as potentially equal members of the community .
Of the forty or so members of the working group ( those subscribed to the secret internal mailing list ) , only a dozen subscribe to the public list .
This actually makes it harder for members of the group to try to be more open — when someone posts a proposal to the public list , there 's a good chance that the majority of the members of the working group will miss it .
During the meeting , I opined that if the group continued along in this direction , the group ran the risk of becoming irrelevant ; two of the other members suggested that the group was already irrelevant .
Sadly we were in the minority .
The CSS working group right now is chronically dysfunctional , as most close observers have noticed .
A great example of this is the difference in how the WHATWG got a blog and how the CSS working group set one up .
In the WHATWG , the idea was floated for a while , and then one day someone volunteered to run it , and the blog was up and running within hours .
Anyone ( literally anyone ) can post to the WHATWG blog ( there 's a moderation step that we added to deal with the spammers , but all it takes now is to get onto IRC and ask for the post you wrote to be published ) .
The CSS working group , on the other hand , has been discussing how to set up a blog , and what the first entry should say , and what tool to use , for over two months !
Nearly every phone call ( the group has weekly teleconferences ) for the past nine weeks has had the blog discussed at some point .
The blog was finally made available last week .
To post , you have to be a group member .
The first post can be summarised as follows : the CSS working group members do n't want to bother going out of their way to get feedback on their specs ; instead , people should post their comments on CSS to the public CSS mailing list ( despite the fact that most CSS working group members are n't subscribed to this list ) .
The blog post then goes on to apologise for the blog 's existence , and claims that the blog 's aim is to reach the people who wo n't subscribe to the public mailing list ( the working group itself , maybe ? ) .
The post does n't make it clear how the blog is expected to reach this wider audience , since the blog has no comment feature .
Another example of the problems of the CSS group is visible on the W3C's Technical Reports page .
The group 's primary deliverables are specifications .
The last candidate recommendation published by the group was published in 2004 .
That was the Basic UI module , which was Tantek 's baby ( he has since left the group ) .
Meanwhile , drafts like the Backgrounds and Borders draft , which has had big parts implemented by Safari for months , and small parts implemented by Mozilla for years , have iterated several times but make no public process ( the backgrounds and borders draft was published in 2005 , but the internal draft was last modified in February of this year ) .
Meanwhile , CSS2.1 , the working group 's most important deliverable , keeps getting tied up , with the group discussing irrelevant details and some members repeatedly reopening old resolved issues .
The W3C process does n't help much here either ; the group actually tried taking CSS 2.1 to Candidate Recommendation stage recently , but was blocked by the W3C management over an issue which was already present in CSS2 .
( In all fairness to Tim , the issue he raised is one which was already raised by several other people , but which the group had dismissed .
I actually agree with him that it should be resolved .
The group has since resolved to change the spec in a way that continues to leave the issue undefined , but at least it no longer contradicts what Web browsers do . )
The group is also supposed to work on test suites .
I had volunteered to work on the CSS 2.1 test suite , but due to lack of time , I bailed on that last year ( Google mainly employs me to work on HTML5 ; any test work that I do is done in my free time , which is mostly spent near aquariums now ) .
Since then basically nothing has happened .
Being public would expose a lot of these problems , forcing the working group to act more responsibly .
It would also allow people to contribute — as specification editors , as test suite editors , as reviewers , as community leaders , and in other roles .
But to be honest , the problems go even further than what I 've described above .
The CSS specs show their age ; they come from a time where specifications were much vaguer than those of the modern day .
Someone really needs to do to CSS what the WHATWG has been doing to HTML , defining everything in detail , explicitly , with strict and clear normative conformance criteria , taking implementations into account , defining things like quirks mode .
( The WHATWG community refers to such a hypothetical project as " CSS 5 " , as a reference to the way the current WHATWG specs define HTML5 , XHTML5 , and DOM5 HTML . )
The CSS working group also does n't really have the nimbleness needed to respond to threats to the Web platform like Silverlight .
We need things like flowing - to - shapes , automatic declarative transition animations , gradients , filters , styling of form controls , and so on .
( The WHATWG is already handling some related , non-presentational , things , like client - side SQL databases , video , and rich controls . )
We need these things this year , in enough detail that they can be implemented .
An open group can iterate much faster than a closed group .
With an open group we can get test implementations , feedback , tests , and discussion straight away , instead of waiting months and then pulling back the curtain and presenting a fait accompli , at which points comments are perceived more as a pain than a help .
One way to address this would be for the WHATWG to start a " subproject " to address CSS , while we wait for the W3C CSS group to learn from the W3C HTML group and become open .
The biggest problem would be finding editors who would be willing and capable of doing the incredible work of rewriting CSS from scratch .

I go a little further in your house and I find the mother 's chair .
It is very apt to be a rocking chair .
She had so many cares and troubles to soothe that it must have rockers .
I remember it well ; it was an old chair , and the rockers were almost worn out , for I was the youngest , and the chair had rocked the whole family .
It made a creaking noise as it moved ; but there was music in the sound .
It was just high enough to allow us children to put our heads into her lap .
That was the bank where we deposited all our hurts and worries .
Ah! what a chair that was ...
The chair knew all the old lullabies and all those wordless songs which mothers sing to their sick children — songs in which all pity and compassion and sympathetic influence are combined ...
That old chair has stopped rocking for a good many years .
It may be set up in the loft or the garret , but it holds a queenly power yet .
~ Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage

By most mortals of the earth ;

And so faithful to the end

That to us our Lord did send .

While details are still not clear , it seems that long time Cape Wind opponent William Delahunt ( along with town officials from Nantucket and Martha ’s Vineyard ) want to build their own wind farm just south of Tuckernuck Island .
This wind farm has nothing to do with Cape Wind and would be a completely separate proposal .
The idea already has approval from some interesting bodies including the Nantucket Planning and Economic Development Commission .
The Director of the development Commission Andrew Vorce said he wants to work with a developer ( other than Cape Wind ) , and that the project could benefit Nantucket island .
Really ?
You think a wind farm might benefit your island .
It ’s a shame no one has thought of building a wind farm any place near Nantucket .
Wait , now I remember , Cape Wind has been trying to put one up for the last 6 years .
Why the lock out of Cape Wind , arguably the one company best suited to be building wind farms in this area ?
Something smells fishy ( and its not low tide ) about the way this “ proposed project ” is moving forward .
Do n’t get me wrong , I think a wind farm off of Tuckernuck would make a nice addition to Cape Wind .
New England is hungry for renewable energy and we need all the well sighted wind farms we can get .
Currently the site is designated an alternative location for Cape Wind , as determined by the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) .
â€ œWeâ€™re not considering this as an alternative to Cape Wind .
Weâ€™re looking at this for the benefit of Nantucket , â€  Vorce said .
â€
œThe town of Nantucket isnâ€™t going to be building windmills , but what weâ€™d like to set up is a climate or environment to attract a private partner to do that and out of our participation , make sure our local needs are met.â€ ( via )
Wait I am confused again .
You want a private partner to come and make money off of public land ?
For the last six years I have heard a steady stream of arguments against this very idea .
Could it be that there are far fewer Kennedy Compound Residents err rich property owners view sheds err I mean Yaht Owners , umm birds south of Tuckernuck .
Tuckernuck shares the same bird and marine species as Nantucket Sound , and I imagine would have a similar impact on the environment ( see a comparison of the sites here pdf ) , so the arguments that Delahunt has been raising in relation to the “ appropriateness ” of the site seem to boiled down to the view , and only the view .
It seems simple , Ted Kennedy says “ not in my back yard ” and Delahunt said “ right away boss . ”
It ’s really a shame because on so many other issues Delahunt is really amazing .
Delahunt went so far as to co-sponsor a bill ( hr2036 pdf ) that would create a 30 square mile “ zone ” three miles south of Tuckernuck .
The Board of Selectmen in Edgartown on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard has also endorsed the concept of an offshore energy zone south of Tuckernuck , and recently stated that it is interested in expanding the energy zone so that it extends to waters off the south shore of Edgartown , according to the Marthaâ€™s Vineyard Times .
So far the details of the proposed project are non-existent .
For all we know they are planning on putting up one or two turbines and calling a it a day , or they might want to put up thousands .
It ’s too early to know exactly what Delahunt and friends are up to .
We can hope that this turns into a vibrant example of private / public partnership and results in lots and lots of clean renewable energy .
In no way however should this be touted as a “ replacement ” for Cape Wind .
The proposed project site for Cape Wind is the best possible site .
It has a wonderful combination of wind , protection from waves , and shallow waters .
The only drawback being that it is smack in the middle of a couple very rich peoples view sheds .
If Delahunt , and his buddies are really serious about offshore wind development I wish them all the luck in the world .
I hope they set up ten such wind farms up and down the coast .
I will reserve judgement till more facts come out , but deep in my gut I get the feeling that somehow this will end up being yet another way for them to try and kill Cape Wind .

With the launch of Google Maps Street View , curious users have found some relatively inappropriate images .
In a DigitalPoint Forums post , users discuss the impact of Google Maps Street View on privacy .
After all , for awhile , you were able to see a woman in her underwear in this Google Maps location
Well , not anymore , sadly .
Google has since removed the image .
Clicking on the link above will bring you to this page .
How To Remove Images from Google Maps Street View
It turns out that people who are concerned for their own privacy can report the particular image to Google for removal .
If you click on " Street View Help , " you will be brought to a window that allows you to report the inappropriate image ( bottom link ) .
You will be brought to a page that allows you to fill out some fields about the infringing or inappropriate nature of the photo and then Google will consider its removal .
It seemed to work out for that girl whose underwear is no longer searchable on Google Maps .
( For the record , it was n't me who reported it . )
Maybe this will appease the woman who called much attention to herself on Boing Boing .
And she said she wanted privacy .
After this article was published , I do n't really believe that .

A month ago I wrote a review on Ubuntu ’s 7.04 version and in it I promised a second look once the final version was to released .
Feisty Fawn was released last week and as it seems so far , it is one of the most ( if not the most ) successful Linux distro release ever .
This means that we ca n’t help it but compare it with XP and Mac OS X , after having tested it in 3 laptops and 2 desktops in my lab .
In this article I wo n’t go on and on about how Ubuntu gets installed or how well it performs , as things have n’t fundamentally changed since my previous review .
But I will expand in the afterglow of the release and the good and bad that came out of it .
First and foremost , this release feels like a cornerstone in the Linux battle for desktop market share .
It is the first time where I felt that a Linux distribution had the right kind of attention to detail and potential to truly stand up against OSX and Windows .
No grandchildren needed to fix your setup , no major googling before doing the big step .
Just popup the LiveCD in the drive , install the much - reputed OS and off you go .
This release brought new focus to non-free drivers / codecs by making it easier to install them .
Things are not perfect yet though , as there is no version of ffmpeg that ’s built with AAC in the repos , and Ubuntu ’s official version of Gstreamer ’s “ ugly ” codec collection has LAME support removed and so SoundJuicer still can’t encode to mp3 .
It ’s details like these these that must be worked out before offering an even better first - time experience to newcomers .
There is consistency in Ubuntu , and there is a feeling of well - thoughtness around every element .
Application installation is now easier than before , system upgrade is a piece of cake and stability was brought to new levels .
This is the best Linux desktop I have ever used in my 9 - year usage of a number of Linux distros .
Of course , things can always be better .
The Ubuntu developers seems to have fixed a bug that would prevent some laptops from reconnecting to ethernet after a wake - up , but in my opinion , there are at least 2 more ( reported and confirmed ) bugs that are still open and they should have been deemed “ show stoppers ” .
For example :
* On some hardware ( especially on some models of the popular IBM laptops ) , when waking up from sleep , the USB subsystem is totally dead and only a reboot fixes it .
* S3 3D support is broken , while the 2D driver is full of bugs & limitations ( and occasionally gets major visual artifacts after a wake - up ) .
Most of the annoying - type - of - bugs I encountered on the 5 systems I tried Feisty Fawn on ( including DELL , IBM and LinuxCertified.com hardware ) , have something to do with ACPI .
This is the Achilles heel of Ubuntu and Linux in general , the way I see it .
It is the last frontier for … world domination and this is where the main focus must be put for the next version .
Nvidia / Ati/ Intel / S3 / SiS graphics cards ’ bugs after a wake - up must be fixed .
All of them .
As I said in the beginning of this article , Ubuntu brought desktop Linux into new heights and millions of users will get a taste of Linux thanks to Canonical and their community .
But it ’s bugs like the two mentioned above that make me wonder if Canonical has all it takes to play ball in that new market stage against XP or OSX .
You see , under no circumstances I would expect Microsoft or Apple to ship an OS with these kinds of bugs in them .
It is time for Canonical to realize that when major bugs still exist , they must first fix them and then release .
While what is a “ major bug ” is a subjective issue , the point of measurement must always be Microsoft and Apple .
As an editor of OSNews.com where we report on all kinds of OSes , that ’s my measurement .
Not just SuSE .
Not just FreeBSD .
Not just Fedora .
But mostly XP / Vista and OSX as the market leaders that they are .
Another aspect of Ubuntu ’s fame explosion is the fact that their bug system gets about 4,000 new bugs per week these days .
I am not sure that they can deal with all those bugs in a timely manner .
Maybe they should put their bugzilla ’s “ karma ” feature into good use and only allow new bug reports from users with enough karma .
That ’s just an idea , not necessarily the best though .
I am just pointing to a potential problem .
Nevertheless , if you are one of the lucky Ubuntu users to have a compatible PC with full ACPI support , more power to you .
Hold on tight to it and help bring the Linux revolution to the masses .
It just started .
For real this time .
The only way is up from now on .

Plants can recognize when they are potted with their siblings or with strangers , new research shows .
When strangers share a pot , they develop a competitive streak , but siblings are more considerate of each other .
“ The ability to recognize and favor kin is common in animals , but this is the first time it has been shown in plants , ” said Susan Dudley of McMaster University in Canada .
After plants are potted , roots branch out to suck up water and nutrients .
But when several plants of the same species are potted together , things get a little nasty : Each plant flexes its muscles , so to speak , by extending its root growth to try and snatch up valuable resources .
Unless , that is , the plants are siblings — each having come from the same mother plant — in which case they become very accommodating , allowing each other ample root space .
Because the interactions between related and unrelated plants only happened when plants were in the same pot , where root space is limited , root interactions are likely what gives plants the cue that their neighbor is related .
Dudley observed this behavior in sea rocket ( Cakile edentula ) , a member of the mustard family that is native to beaches through North America .
The findings , detailed in the June 12 issue of Biology Letters , may not come as a surprise to seasoned gardeners .
“ Gardeners have known for a long time that some pairs of species get along better than others , and scientists are starting to catch up with why that happens , ” Dudley said .
“ The more we know about plants , the more complex their interactions seem to be . ”
WASHINGTON , May 10 —
An investigation by the Justice Department ethics office into the conduct of department lawyers who approved the National Security Agency 's domestic surveillance program has been closed because investigators were denied security clearances , according to a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday .
The head of the department 's Office of Professional Responsibility , H. Marshall Jarrett , wrote in the letter to Representative Maurice D. Hinchey , Democrat of New York , that " we have been unable to make meaningful progress in our investigation because O.P.R. has been denied security clearances for access to information about the N.S.A. program . "
Mr. Jarrett said his office had requested clearances since January , when it began an investigation , and was told on Tuesday that they had been denied .
" Without these clearances , we cannot investigate this matter and therefore have closed our investigation , " the letter said .
Mr. Hinchey said the denial of clearances was " hard to believe " and compounded what he called a violation of the law by the program itself , which eavesdrops without court warrants on people in the United States suspected of ties to Al Qaeda .
When Nancy Pelosi went to Syria earlier this year , she got reamed for it in the conservative mediasphere and blogs .
The Confederate Yankee labeled it " propaganda coup that will be used by Syria , the terrorists they sponsor , and Islamists worldwide . "
Michael Rubin writing in National Review Online wondered before the trip " if she will cede the Assad regime a propaganda victory , as did Sen. Arlen Specter ? "
You remember the whole spiel .
At the time , I think most liberals -- and , indeed , most Americans -- understood this to be both unfair and also reflective of a pretty weird and wrongheaded underlying worldview .
And yet , this is pretty similar to what Hillary Clinton 's saying in her criticism of Barack Obama .
There 's this similar notion that the US can be mortally wounded by perfidious leaders having their photos taken with important American politicians , or that engaging in high - level diplomacy with a country is a reward we offer for good behavior rather than a standard method of relating to the world .
UPDATE : John McCain agrees with Clinton .

Jeff Stein , Congressional Quarterly 's national security correspondent , filed a piece last Friday on a bizarre intelligence oversight hearing intended to review the U.S. government 's policy of snatching and grabbing suspected terrorists and sending them to secret overseas prisons or to countries that torture people .
What happened instead involved a former anti-Bin Laden CIA agent praising the death of his former rival in the FBI John O'Neill .
O'Neill , a flamboyant agent who spent years chasing Al Qaeda before 9 - 11 , took the job of head of security for the World Trade Center shortly before 9/11 , when he was killed going back into one of the towers ..
[ Republican Congressman Dana ] Rohrabacher tried another avenue .
The CIA had made “ maybe three ” mistaken arrests , he told the Europeans .
Were n’t they maybe obsessing over “ due process ” ?
he said .
Their concern for civil rights could have “ the unfortunate consequence ” of helping al Qaeda kill tens of thousands of people in London .
At that , the Code Pink ladies in orange Guantanamo - style jumpsuits who had sat quietly through the hearing began clucking in a “ can - you - believe that ? ” way .
The parliamentarians ’ jaws cracked open .
Now Rohrabacher was really annoyed .
“ Well then , ” he barked , “ I hope it ’s your families .
I hope it ’s your families that suffer the consequences . ”
A roar went up .
One of the orange jumpsuiters , a grandmotherly woman with a “ no torture ” sign , pushed toward the aisle as if a dog had vomited on her lap .
“ I do n’t have to listen to this , ” she said .
Outside , Ann Wright said she had spent “ 29 years in the military and 16 years as a diplomat , ” which included helping reopen the U.S. consulate in Kabul after the Taliban was ousted , before resigning over the Bush administration ’s invasion of Iraq .

Even if you think the only life in the universe is on Earth , we 're still not alone .
In addition to the other planets and moons in our solar system , there are countless tons of space dust , millions of meteors , asteroids , comets and various types and sizes of debris ( including the trash we 've left up there ourselves ) flying around at incredible speeds and in all sorts of orbits .
Earth gets hit by stuff every day -- it just does n't show up on the common man 's radar because the impact is n't newsworthy .
Space dust does n't hurt us .
Most large asteroids that hit Earth are the size of a basketball by the time they make it through the burning conditions of Earth 's atmosphere , and those hit about once a week .
It 's pretty much just the astronomers that notice .
It would take something massive -- space - terms massive -- to make the rest of us notice .
And the last time the rest of us really noticed was in 1908 , when an asteroid about the size of a football field exploded in Earth 's atmosphere with the force of a 15 - megaton bomb , leveling an 800 square - mile ( 2,000 - sq - km ) area of Siberia .
The nuclear bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima had a 15 - kiloton yield .

So imagine the furrowed brows when NASA announced that it was expanding its Near Earth Object Program , which identifies and tracks asteroids , and the European Space Agency is launching a mission to test a potential asteroid - deflection method .
As it turns out , statistically speaking , an asteroid the size of a football field should hit Earth about every hundred years .
So -- statistically speaking -- we 're due .
But the asteroid that has scientists huddled together , holding conferences and releasing carefully worded statements is at least twice the size of a football field , and " nuke it " is actually being whispered as a last resort .
It 's called Apophis , and it 's about 250 meters across .
The 45 - million - ton rock is orbiting the Sun at 28,000 miles per hour ( 45,000 kph ) .
If it hits Earth , it could easily level a large city .
According to all sources , the chances of it hitting are slim , about one in 45,000 , and getting slimmer .
In 2005 , scientists calculated that Apophis had a one in 5,500 chance of colliding with Earth , and they predict that the chance of a hit will continue to decrease .
Using calculations based on the relative positions of Earth and Apophis in 2007 , the asteroid will be within 24,000 miles ( 39,000 km ) of Earth in 2029 .
That 's very , very close , much closer to Earth than the moon is , and we 'll be able to see it with the naked eye in both day and night - time .
But that 's not the close call astronomers are worried about .
It could come even closer to Earth in 2036 , and there are some algorithms that predict a collision , but most experts say it wo n't hit us .
Still , preparations are underway .
The idea is to plan early for the best avoidance strategy .
With 20 years to go , we could probably make sure Apophis wo n't hit us even if it wants to .
Most scientists think that blowing it up with a nuclear bomb is a bad idea -- that we'd just end up with a bunch of large asteroids hitting Earth instead of one really large one .
Others says if we blow it up early enough , there would be enough time for the trajectory of the pieces to shift out of the danger zone .
At the moment , though , the method of choice for saving Earth from Apophis is deflection .
There are a few big ideas out there .
One has several spacecraft landing on Apophis , drilling through the surface and pumping out what 's inside .
NASA has actually done something like this successfully with its Deep Impact mission , which crashed an impactor into a comet with the purpose of revealing the comet 's composition .
With Apophis , the point would be to pump the material out into space with enough force to push Apophis in the opposite direction , throwing it off course .
Scientists are also talking about sending a spacecraft into the asteroid 's orbit to fly next to it .
This " gravity tractor " spaceship would essentially alter the gravity equation that keeps Apophis on its path , pulling on the asteroid until its position no longer threatens Earth .
But according to Donald Yeomans of NASA 's Near Earth Object Project , the simplest way to deflect Apophis is to send a spacecraft up there to just slam into it , knocking it out of the way .
Forty - five million tons of speeding asteroid aside , it could be that all the fuss about Apophis is about something at once both more and less threatening .
NASA estimates that there are 100,000 asteroids orbiting dangerously close to Earth right now that are big enough to cause a problem , and the agency is only tracking 4,000 of them .
We may need to solidify a plan of attack .
On the other hand , there are 100,000 asteroids orbiting dangerously close to Earth , right now .
And right now .
And ... right now .
Still here ?

Al Gore Finally Gets Green Light To Go Solar At Home
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Look out world !
Al Gore is about to pass go .
The former V.P. turned Oscar - winning movie star turned international rock star has been given the green light by city planners to install solar panels and other green additions at his mansion in Belle Meade , Tenn .
Previously , town zoning laws did not permit residents of the upscale neighborhood to install solar energy technology because they were considered generators , and therefore , unsightly .
Gore ’s camp had been quietly protesting the laws for some years , but were caught empty - handed when an audit of the former V.P. ’s energy use surfaced back in February .
Gore was raked over the coals , even though plans were underway to make his home more efficient and eco-friendly .
Now , he ’s in the clear and making green renovations in addition to the solar panels .
From the article ,
“ He is also upgrading the furnace , windows , and light switches , as well as installing new floor radiant heat and solar vents , to improve the home ’s energy standards , said Kalee Kreider , a Gore spokeswoman . ”
So , there ya have it .
Even with a 70 - year old home , Gore is doing his best to set an example for , well , the rest of the millionaires out there with mega - homes .
Until he downsizes things , it ’s the best we can ask for .
Expect 33 solar panels to go up shortly .

The children at the Kids on Fire summer camp are intent as they pray over a cardboard cutout of President George Bush .
They raise their hands in the air and sway , eyes closed , as they join the chant for " righteous judges " .
Tears stream down their faces as they are told that they are " phonies " and " hypocrites " and must wash their hands in bottled water to drive out the devil .
The documentary film Jesus Camp follows three children at the Kids on Fire Pentecostal summer camp in the small city of Devil 's Lake , North Dakota .
Tory , aged 10 , tells the camera why she likes " Christian , heavy metal rock and roll " , rather than Britney Spears .
" When I dance " , she says , as she cavorts around her bedroom , " I have to make sure that that 's God .
People will notice when I 'm just dancing for the flesh . "
Filmed over a year by two New York - based documentary makers , the film has caused a furore since it opened in the mid-west two weeks ago , setting evangelical Christians against non-believers , and separating Pentecostal from non-Pentecostal evangelicals .
Too scary
After a television news report about the film became a hit on YouTube.com , it attracted media attention across the country and opens in Los Angeles today .
Some critics say that the often raw approach used by the camp 's founder , Pastor Becky Fischer , as she prepares the children for " war " , is too " scary " .
Others accuse the documentary makers of distorting Pastor Fischer 's message .
Jesus Camp is " a sarcastic documentary that paints evangelical , fundamentalist , charismatic , and politically concerned Christians as very shrill , warlike and dangerous , " a critic wrote on the Christian website MovieGuide.org .
At one point Pastor Fischer equates the preparation she is giving children with the training of terrorists in the Middle East .
" I want to see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam , " she tells the camera .
" I want to see them radically laying down their lives for the gospel , as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine . "
Those comments caught the eye of Talking Heads singer David Byrne , who saw the film at a festival in Washington in June .
" I kept saying to myself , OK , these are the Christian version of the Madrasas , " he wrote on his blog .
" So both sides are pretty much equally sick . "
The film garnered more publicity when Michael Moore screened it , against the distributor 's wishes , at his Traverse City film festival .
One member of the audience there said after seeing it : " The people in the film were so bizarre , yet they were so sincere , they were like Leslie Neilsen in Airplane . "
The film won the festival 's Scariest Movie award .
" Extreme liberals who look at this should be quaking in their boots , " Pastor Fischer says at one point in the film .
She goes on to tell the children , mostly aged from seven to 12 : " This is a sick old world .
Kids , you got to change things .
This means war .
Are you part of it ? "
Not ashamed
Despite her sometimes unsympathetic portrayal in Jesus Camp , she helped the makers , Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady , to promote the film .
" They 're out to tell a story and they felt they found it with some of the political things , " she told the Los Angeles Times .
" And they 're out to show the most dramatic , exotic , extreme things they found in my ministry , and I 'm not ashamed of those things , but without context , it 's really difficult to defend what you 're seeing on the screen . "
The film - makers say that they set out to examine the two cultures in contemporary America .
" Clearly there are two parallel Americas , " they say on the film 's website .
" One is a conservative counterculture comprised of tens of millions of evangelical Christians who feel engaged in a culture war with what they perceive as immorality and godless liberalism . "
But they deny that they deliberately misrepresented their subjects , or even took sides in the debate .
" We intentionally made a film that was devoid of a point of view , " said the co-director , Rachel Grady .
" We did expect different reactions , but how stark those differences are has been fascinating .
One camp watches it and want to send their kids to the camp ; on the other end there are people who want to call the cops . "
But the reaction from some evangelical groups has already harmed the film , which opened two weeks ago in some midwestern states .
The Reverend Ted Haggard , who runs the 30 million - strong National Association of Evangelicals and appears in the film , called on his followers to shun the film .
The box - office in the midwest did not meet the distributor 's expectations .
The Rev Haggard said the film was too literal in its presentation of some of the opinions of Pastor Fischer .
" My concern is ... that those on the far left will use it to reinforce their most negative stereotypes of Christian believers , " he told Christianity Today .
The " war talk " , he said , was allegorical .
" It does n't mean we 're going to establish a theocracy and force people to obey what they think is God 's law . "
Very disappointed
Ms Grady said she was disappointed by his reaction .
" We 're very disappointed that someone with such clout has rejected the movie .
I think he does n't like how he comes across in the movie . "
The Rev Haggard does , however , articulate one of the film - makers ' key points : saying that when evangelicals vote they can determine the outcome of an election .
" I really did not know how intertwined the politics was with the theology , " said Ms Grady .
" We were surprised at how much they really dovetail . "
With the US mid-term elections just over a month away , she added , " It 's playing out before our eyes .
There are a lot of contested seats .
They vote .
They know the people who have the same position as they do . "
Profile : Becky Fischer
Pastor Becky Fischer seems to be enjoying her moment of celebrity .
" I 've gotten thousands of hits on my website , " she told the Los Angeles Times .
" I 'm wearing sunglasses in the airports .
It 's really making me nervous . "
According to the website Pastor Fischer worked in business for 23 years before taking up a full time ministry .
She managed two family enterprises , a motel and an FM radio station , for 10 years and then owned a custom sign shop and worked part - time as a children 's pastor at her local church in Bismark , North Dakota .
Her Kids Ministry International states on its website : " We believe that childhood is the time that God designed for people to receive the gospel . "
Amid all the controversy generated by the film , Pastor Fischer has defended herself .
" Excuse me , " she says in the film , " but we have the truth . "
NEW YORK — U.S. female soldiers in Iraq were assaulted or raped by male soldiers in the women ’s latrines , and an alarming number committed suicide , Col. Janis Karpinski reportedly testified before an international human rights commission of inquiry last month .
“ Because the women were in fear of getting up in the darkness [ to go to the latrine ] , they were not drinking liquids after 3 or 4 in the afternoon , ” Karpinski testified , according to a report on Truthout.org .
“ In the 100 - degree heat , they were dying of dehydration in their sleep . ”
Karpinski ’s testimony was reported by Marjorie Cohn , a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president - elect of the National Lawyers Guild who writes a weekly column for the website .
Cohn wrote that she presented Karpinski ’s testimony at the International Commission of Inquiry on Crimes Against Humanity Committed by the Bush Administration , which convened Jan. 20 - 22 at Riverside Church .
The latrine for female soldiers at Camp Victory was n’t located near their barracks , so they had to go outside if they needed to use the bathroom , Karpinski told retired U.S. Army Col .
David Hackworth in a September 2004 interview , Cohn reported .
“ There were no lights near any of their facilities , so women were doubly easy targets in the dark of the night . ”
It was there that male soldiers assaulted and raped women soldiers .
Karpinski testified that a surgeon for the coalition ’s joint task force said in a briefing that “ women in fear of getting up in the hours of darkness to go out to the port - a - lets or the latrines were not drinking liquids after 3 or 4 in the afternoon , and in 120 degree heat or warmer , because there was no air - conditioning at most of the facilities , they were dying from dehydration in their sleep . ”
“ And rather than make everybody aware of that — because that ’s shocking , and as a leader if that ’s not shocking to you then you ’re not much of a leader — what they told the surgeon to do is do n’t brief those details anymore .
And do n’t say specifically that they ’re women .
You can provide that in a written report but do n’t brief it in the open anymore . ”
Karpinski said Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski , the top deputy to Lt. Gen Ricardo Sanchez , the former senior U.S. military commander in Iraq , saw dehydration listed as the cause of death on the death certificate of a female master sergeant in September 2003 .
Under orders from Sanchez , Wojdakowski directed that the cause of death no longer be listed .
The official explanation for this was to protect the women ’s privacy rights , she said .
Sanchez ’s attitude was : “ The women asked to be here , so now let them take what comes with the territory , ” Karpinski quoted him as saying .
Karpinski told Cohn that Sanchez , who was her boss , was very sensitive to the political ramifications of everything he did , Cohn reported .
“ It was out of control , ” Karpinski told a group of students at Thomas Jefferson School of Law last October , according to the Truthout report .
Although there was a toll - free number women could use to report sexual assaults , no one had a phone , and no one answered the U.S. number when it was called .
Any woman who successfully connected to it would get a recording .
Even after more than 83 incidents were reported during a six - month period in Iraq and Kuwait , the 24 - hour rape hot line was still answered by a machine that told callers to leave a message , Karpinski told Cohn .
Karpinski , a brigadier general , was assigned to Iraq in July 2003 to oversee 17 prison facilities including Abu Ghraib .
She was demoted to colonel after news broke of the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib when the prison was under her command .
Karpinski subsequently resigned from the military , and in October she published a book , One Woman ’s Army , the Commanding General of Abu Ghraib Tells Her Story , in which she claims the prisoner abuses were carried out under orders from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
The commission in New York heard testimony from Karpinski and others about indefinite detention , rendition for torture , destruction of the environment , attacks on public health and reproductive rights , and actions and inactions leading up to and following Hurricane Katrina , Cohn wrote .
Harry Belafonte , a participant and keynote speaker , said , “ When a government fails to protect justice it is the responsibility of the people to rise up and change the guard , change the regime .
Those who fail to answer that call should be charged with patriotic treason . ”

RIAA , SoundExchange , and StationRipper - Recent news ( was n't expecting this to be digg ' able , but I 'll go with it )
Some of you have been asking me about what 's going to happen to StationRipper , in light of the recent news about the massive internet radio royalty increase , and about the " Compromise " that SoundExchange recently put forth ( forcing stations to come up with ways to prevent recording ) .
While there 's a lot of uncertainty about where this is all heading , I 'd like to try to at least make a stab at answer the most common questions :
No , I have not been contacted by the RIAA or anyone involved with that organization .
As far as I know , in the US StationRipper is still considered legal under fair use .
I doubt I will be contacted - internet radio ripping has been around for a long time now , and as far as I know , no legal issues have come about beyond some initial questions when the DMCA was being created .
I am guessing the music industry knows it 's legal , so is going to try to kill if off by killing off all internet radio that they do n't directly control .
All of this is US - based .
I do n't anticipate it will effect non-us stations for some time , if at all .
StationRipper will continue to be able to record Shoutcast stations that broadcast as they do today .
I do n't have any plans to change that .
I 'm personally guessing that if the insane royalty increases take place , most US stations will shut down - which should make it more profitable for non-us stations ... so I expect to see MORE of those .
And I 'd guess a higher % ( if any ) of those wo n't pay any fees to the RIAA , which should be lots of fun for the music industry ( always " smart " to do things to reduce profit !
Go RIAA !!! ) .
How does the latest compromise that SoundExchange put forward effect StationRipper ?
First off , they specifically said " work to stop users from engaging in ' streamripping ' " .
M any are interpreting this to mean DRM .
It MAY just mean that they want stations to make it harder to record their streams ( games with song name change , cross- fading , et al ) .
But this was already something that they have been pushing for some time now , and most stations ignore it ( which I personally thing they should - it lessens the experience of users that listen to their stations ) .
If they force DRM , then I 'm not sure what will happen - it seems like that would take away peoples fair - use of music .
I 'd think it also kill off a lot of ( freely available ) broadcasting technologies , and I would expect it would make it a bit tougher for people to start stations ( I 'm not a broadcaster so am not 100 % sure of this , but starting a Shoutcast stations is EASY ) .
StationRipper has been able to record Last .fm for some time now .
If Last . fm shuts down because of the massive fees , then StationRipper wo n't be able to record them any more ( obviously ) .
They 're one of the better " stations " out there , so I can only hope this does n't happen .
Or maybe they 'll just move off shore and it will be a non-issue .
If this should happen , and all you record is Last . fm , I 'll do a 30 day refund for those that ask for it .
I imagine that a lot of people do both Shoutcast and Last . fm , so I 'd ask that if you still use the software for Shoutcast , that you do n't ask for a refund - we make just enough to cover domain costs + the iPod prize + expenses most month , so I 'd appreciate not getting a flood of refunds :)
What happens if nothing can be recorded anymore ?
While I think this is very unlikely in the next few years as all of this is us - specific - same as # 4 , 30 day refund if we do n't figure out a way to fix it .
But if this happens , there will likely be a new version of StationRipper that records what the soundcard is playing .
Or that you can hook a mic up to your machine and StationRipper auto - breaks songs up based on that .
Or something .
Trying to prevent recording what eventually HAS to be analog is kinda pointless in the long run ...
As someone who loves music , buys a ton of it , and listens to internet radio most of the day , the direction the music industry has been taking the last few years is very disturbing .
I 'm with them on massive sharing via P2P , but they seem to be at the point where they want to charge us ( a lot ) for every time we hear a song .
From everything from killing internet radio by exorbitant fees to trying to stamp out the used CD market to suing 90 year old grandmothers that have never used a computer , they have been acting like a bunch of thugs the last few years ( The RIAA and recording companies - not the musicians ; most seem to hate the RIAA as much as the rest of us )
For legal internet radio stations , they are already making a LOT of money via the fees they already pay .
Increasing those fees to the point where stations can't make money , or even cover the fees , is crazy .
And trying to restrict people from being able to time - shit radio is also pointless .
Using software like StationRipper is a great way to FIND new music to BUY .
While you may get a ton of MP3's after using it , they already have cross- fading , DJ overlays , some are n't high bit stream , etc .
I personally think all of that actually helps drive new sales of music .
' Course a lot of it is unsigned stuff from places the RIAA does n't control ... which may be a lot of what 's going on here .
I wish the RIAA would focus more on trying to make money off the way people want to use their product , instead of trying to come up with new ways that restrict how people use those products .
Anyway , I encourage everyone to go over to SaveNetRadio.org and SaveOurInternetRadio.com and see what 's going on .
If enough people get upset about this ( sign the petition , call your congress members , etc ) then we might still be listening to US internet radio a year from now .
As always , if you have any questions , issues , or comments , feel free to ask !
And give the latest version of StationRipper a try - the Last . fm recording is working MUCH better !
Thanks

For the remaining songs in Famous Music ’s catalog — and the vast majority of the music publishing industry ’s collective catalog — there is insufficient demand to justify the costs of publishing tablature .
Image Credit ... Andy Manis for The New York Times
As a result , guitarists who want to know how to play less mainstream songs have gone to sites where amateurs post tablature .
Under this agreement , MusicNotes , publishers and artists will essentially earn money from an army of volunteers , who are creating content that the publishers are not creating on their own .
Tim Reiland , chairman and chief financial officer of MusicNotes , which is based in Madison , Wis. , said publishers would receive “ a very healthy split ” of the advertising dollars .
“ We ’ve got lots of work here to get the publishers signed up , but we think they should , ” Mr. Reiland said .
“ We think it ’s a good deal . ”
MusicNotes bought MxTabs.net , one of the most popular guitar tablature sites , last year as it came under legal attack by music publishers .
Publishers claimed that even incorrect versions of music notation violate copyright laws , since the postings represent “ derivative works ” related to the original compositions , to use the legal parlance .
The guitar tablature sites were typically small operations , running on little more than revenue gleaned from Google text ads .
Many shut down rather than challenge the publishers in court .
( Ultimate - Guitar.com , which has a New Jersey phone number but claims that it is based in Russia and that it complies with Russian copyright laws , still operates .
Its advertisers include AOL , T - Mobile and Dell , among others . )

You did n’t have to be a rocket scientist – or a senator , or a genetic researcher – to figure out that , since Gee Dubya used his first and at the time only veto on a stem - cell research bill that came out of a Republic Congress , he was going to veto any similar bill coming out of the Democratically controlled 110th Congress .
Not to mention the fact that he said he would veto it – there ’s that , too .
So – why , on a question of life - and - death importance to millions of Americans , is Congress willing to force George Bush to go on record as opposing stem cell research – and , consequently , every Republic senator who opposes overriding that veto to similarly go on record as opposing it – but is not willing to force George Bush and the Republics to go on record as opposing an end to the funding of the occupation of Iraq ?
I do n’t get it .
Look , I ’m pulling for the Dems in Congress as much as anybody .
But when your team insists upon pursuing a losing strategy while another , much more viable strategy is available to them – especially one that just so happens to be The Right Thing To Do – it becomes increasingly frustrating to sit by quietly and watch them set themselves up for failure .
And make no mistake : I am not just talking about short - term failure in Congress , getting any substantive part of the so - called " Democratic agenda " passed out of both houses .
I am talking about failure at the polls in November 2008 .
If the Democrats in Congress do not take clear , decisive actions to distinguish themselves from their Republic counterparts , they will lose in November 2008 .
This they can only do by repeatedly forcing Republics to veto , and uphold the veto of , significant Democratic measures passed by the Democratic majority in Congress .
Democrats must then use these vetoes and votes to uphold them as cudgels with which to mercilessly pummel Republics between now and November ’08 .
And the most important issue with which Democrats can pummel Republics ?
Well , duhhh -
It ’s the occupation , stupid !
Thomas conveniently lists the sum total of all laws successfully passed by our 110th Congress so far this year , bills that have been signed by the president .
As of this writing , that list consists of a whopping 37 bills .
Of those 37 bills , no fewer than 17 are along the lines of this :
A bill to redesignate the White Rocks National Recreation Area in the State of Vermont as the " Robert T. Stafford White Rocks National Recreation Area " .
To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1300 North Frontage Road West in Vail , Colorado , as the " Gerald R. Ford , Jr. Post Office Building " .
To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 152 North 5th Street in Laramie , Wyoming , as the " Gale W. McGee Post Office " .
To designate the United States courthouse located at 555 Independence Street in Cape Girardeau , Missouri , as the " Rush Hudson Limbaugh , Sr. United States Courthouse " .
A bill to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse and customhouse located at 515 West First Street in Duluth , Minnesota , as the " Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building and United States Courthouse and Customhouse " .
To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 5757 Tilton Avenue in Riverside , California , as the " Lieutenant Todd Jason Bryant Post Office " .
To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 60 Calle McKinley , West in Mayaguez , Puerto Rico , as the " Miguel Angel Garcia Mendez Post Office Building " .
- stellar accomplishments all , no doubt , but perhaps not quite what the American electorate had in mind for the First 150 Days Of The New Democratic Congress .
Let ’s see , there was some other stuff here , too . . .
To provide for the construction , operation , and maintenance of an arterial road in St. Louis County , Missouri .
Okaaay , yeah , there was that .
And , umm . . .
To amend title 18 , United States Code , to strengthen prohibitions against animal fighting , and for other purposes .
- a burning issue in the 2006 campaign , as I recall .
Let ’s see , what else , what else . . .
Oh , yeah !
There were these two !:
To amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to conform the District charter to revisions made by the Council of the District of Columbia relating to public education .
and ,
To suspend the requirements of the Department of Housing and Urban Development regarding electronic filing of previous participation certificates and regarding filing of such certificates with respect to certain low - income housing investors .
Riiiight , right - right - right .
Now I remember - that ’s why I spent all those hours on the phone during the weeks leading up to last November ’s election .
Uh-huh .
Well , to be fair , there was one thing that did get passed and signed , amazingly :
A bill to amend chapter 35 of title 28 , United States Code , to preserve the independence of United States attorneys .
Unfortunately , as important as that was – and thank god it passed - that was more than offset by - THE VETOES :
Making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30 , 2007 , and for other purposes .
Uhh , yeah .
And ,
A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell research .
Now – let ’s ask ourselves – and be honest here - just exactly how many substantive bills do you think will come out of this Congress and be signed into law by this President ?
How much of the " Democratic agenda " will survive this administration ?
What do you think the voters will be looking for in November 2008 ?
Since when is capitulation " pragmatic® " ?

A recent study by WebmasterWorld found that an estimated 77 % of all blogs on Google ’s Blogspot service were spam .
Similarly , AOL Hometown , had well over 80 % of its results turn out to be spam .
Even MSN Spaces , which as not mentioned in the report , is claimed to host an estimated ten percent of spammer Web site .
( Note : See updated information below about the Blogspot study )
It seems as if nearly every major free blog hosting service has been either overrun or nearly overrun with spam .
However , one services stands alone , a relative oasis of spam cleanliness , Automattic ’s WordPress.com .
Despite being just as free as its competitors and placing few restrictions on registration , WordPress.com has not endured the spam avalanche that other services have .
Though there have been spam attacks in the past , the spammers have been easily shut down and , overall , the service remains relatively free of the splogs that seem to choke up its competitors .
Though paid services such as Typepad also enjoy a relatively spam - free existance , what WordPress.com does is very rare for a free service .
To find out how WordPress.com achieved this , I emailed Automatic ’s founder , Matthew Mullenweg .
The answer was very surprising .
A Technological Edge
Automattic , in addition to creating WordPress.com , created the anti-comment spam plugin Akismet .
Akismet works by taking comments submitted to a site and forwarding them to Akismet ’s servers .
Akismet then , using a series of tests and filters , determines if the comment is legitimate , spam or something in between .
Spam comments are filtered out , gray comments are held for moderation and legitimate comments are posted .
Akismet is available for free for personal use on any WordPress blog with an API key , not just those hosted by WordPress.com .
To date , Akismet has stopped over one billion spam comments and is used on thousands of blogs , including this one .
Both the WordPress.com site and Mullenweg hint that Akismet is one of their tools for keeping spam blogs off of WordPress.com .
Though both are vague with their descriptions as to how it works , one likelihood is that any caught comment spam originating or pointing to a WordPress.com flags the site for inspection .
If true , this effectively turns comment spamming , one of the most popular means of promoting a spam blog , against the person doing it .
Comment spamming goes from being a tool to help search engines find a blog to a means for administrators to easily identify the blogs that are likely junk .
That would be an interesting reversal of fortune for spammers and a very intelligent use of a seemingly unrelated technology .
Goodbye , Adsense
In late 2005 , WordPress.com took what some considered an extreme step and banned Google Adsense as well as other advertising networks from its service .
As of this writing , there is no way to add any advertisements to a WordPress.com hosted blog , other than “ discreet ” links , without a paid VIP membership .
This is obviously a tremendous deterrent to spam blogs , many of which rely upon Google Adsense to make money .
This is in stark contrast to Blogspot , which makes it very easy to add Adsense ads to your blog and encourages members to do so .
Though Google ’s reasons for doing this are clear , it is how they make money from the service , the prevalence of Adsense has undoubdtedly been a major contributor to the deluge of spam that has befallen the service .
That is also why Mullenweg , in a comment on TechCrunch , said the following :
We ’re considering ad options for the future , but for now disallowing adsense has been a huge help in keeping splogs off the system and has n’t gotten much pushback from regular folks , only aspiring pro-bloggers .
( Who should probably be on WordPress.org anyway . )
While it is true that this has no impact on the spam bloggers that are solely interested in using the splogs to gain search engine ranking via outbound liks , this missing functionality does a great deal to deter many of the laziest and least sophisticated spam bloggers out there .
All in all , while the lack of simple monetization might be a hurdle for some would - be WordPress.com users , it has played a critical role in keeping the service free of spam blogs .
The Real Difference
But while Mullenweg was clearly pleased with the role that Akismet and other tools played in stopping spam , he put the greatest difference on the human element .
According to him , Automattic takes spam very seriously and always has and that , in his view , makes the greatest difference of all .
In his email to me he said the following :
If you ever come across something we host that ’s spam just drop the link there and someone will look at it within an hour or so .
Akismet and a few other internal tools help , but I think it ’s mostly that we take splogs pretty seriously and respond accordingly ..
Mullenweg encourages people to use the “ Report as Spam ” feature in the dashboard across the top of all WordPress.com blogs to report any instance of spam .
He says that all reports of spam are tracked and followed up on swiftly .
This is much simpler and more effective than Google ’s complicated and practically useless reporting procedure .
This , in Mullenweg ’s view , has kept spam from establishing a foothold on the service and kept WordPress.com relatively spam - free when compared to its competitors .
Hopefully , it will be enough to keep it that way .
Conclusions
The good news in all of this is that it is possible to run a large - scale , popular and free blogging service that is relatively free of spam .
The bad news is that there is no magic bullet in any of this .
Running such a service requires a great deal of commitment both from the people who run the service and from the community that uses it .
It requires investing both resources and manpower into combating spam while having a genuine dislike for it .
It even requires , in some cases , sacrificing features that legitimate users may want in order to make the service less appealing to the spam blogging community .
It also means that it may be far too late for Blogspot and similar services to turn the tide against spam .
Though WordPress.com seems to easily be able to keep up with new spam that comes in , it appears that , if over three quarters of your results are junk , that the reversing the tide is all - but - impossible .
However , if Google were to take the simple , but drastic , step of banning Adsense on Blogspot , the effect on spam blogs would be drastic .
However , the effect on their legitimate bloggers would be equally dramatic , causing many of them to turn away from the service .
This puts Google , and the other free blogging services , in a very tough bind .
In order to effectively combat spam , they need to make sacrifices that will , most likely , cause them to lose legitimate customers as well as spammers .
It almost comes down to a choice between being a spam haven and having their entire business model destroyed .
In that regard , spam blogs are like a cancer , often easily treated if caught and attacked early , but incurable if allowed to go on to long .
Sadly , Blogger , AOL Hometown and MSN Spaces may be beyond any hope of recovery .
This is an issue I will be revisiting some time later this week .
Update :
This article has really taken off .
An appearance on Techmeme as well as Matt Mullenweg ’s blog have really drawn a great deal of attention to this .
So welcome to everyone who is visiting this site for the first time .
Feel free to look around some and subscribe to the feed if you wish .
I did want to take a moment and respond to one very astute commenter who pointed out that all is not what it seems with the Blogspot study .
As it turns out , the methodology of the study is both buried and confusing .
It turns out that 77 % of Blogspot blogs are spam for spam - friendly keywords .
It is not a reference to the number of spam blogs on the service over all .
However , after thinking about it , I realized that a study of the blogs on Blogspot would be almost useless as Blogspot , in addition to splogs , is choked down with with inactive and abandoned blogs , the same as with any free blogging service or free Web service in general .
A better study would be to look at the percentage of active blogs on the service , something that can be determined , at least with some distinction , but the number of outgoing pings .
A study from February of this year looked at exactly that and found that 51 % of all pings from Blogspot were spam ( Note : According to Pete , this study was taken before Blogspot began pinging new entries by default , it may show bias to spammers as they might be more likely to switch on the pinging feature .
We will have to wait and see when a new study comes out . ) .
This means that over half of all new posts created and pinged out over Blogspot are junk .
Though not the 77 % mentioned earlier , that is still a tremendous problem .
The fact remains that Blogger is , quite clearly , overrun with spam blogs and is unlikely to recover any time soon , not without making drastic changes .
My thanks to Pete for pointing out the error .

Muslims Burn Assyrian Church in Baghdad
( AINA ) -- According to the Assyrian website ankawa.com , a group of armed Muslims set fire to St. George Assyrian Church in the Dora neighborhood of Baghdad .
The group of men poured gasoline on the church and set it on fire .
This is the same church that was bombed in the first of a wave of bombings of Assyrian churches ( AINA 10 - 16-2004 ) .
When St. George was bombed in 2004 , the church Cross was not damaged ; the bombers tore the cross down with their hands after the bombing .
In the past four weeks , the Assyrian ( also known as Chaldean and Syriac ) community in Baghdad 's Dora neighborhood has been systematically targetted by Islamists , who have demanded that the Christian Assyrians pay the jizya ( AINA 4-17-2007 , 3-18-2007 ) , a " protection " tax demanded by the Koran , or convert within 24 hours or be killed .
Assyrian families have sought refuge in Churches ( AINA 5 - 18-2007 ) .
Dora is located 10 kilometers southwest of Baghdad .
DIGG THIS
It is now clear that the proper name for the war going on in Mesopotamia is the " Republican War . "
Never before has a political party so decisively asserted ownership of a foreign war .
The Republicans refuse to share it with the Democrats , who , despite their many resolutions , have yet to call for a complete withdrawal of American forces .
Democrats have not come close to proposing to cut off the war funding , which is the only way the war can be ended .
Yet Republicans act like jealous suitors and seem to want to keep the war as their very own .
They have killed every single proposal to alter the strategy or the tactics .
They even killed a bill that would have done nothing more than guarantee that American soldiers would get a rest period at home equal to the time spent in the war .
Killing that bill , which had nothing to do with withdrawal or timetables for withdrawal , clearly proves that Republicans do not support the troops .
They support the war .
There is a huge difference .
Little Lindsey Graham , the Republican senator from South Carolina , has become so possessive of the war that he seems on the edge of hysteria .
He seems frightened to death of what will happen when Americans leave .
In fact , nothing much will happen except that Iraqis will concentrate on killing each other rather than killing Americans and each other .
Most normal people would consider that a positive development for us .
The Republicans and their shrinking number of warmonger supporters have long since forgotten that the Republican War is an illegal war , a war of aggression launched against a country that had not attacked us or ever threatened to attack us .
They have conveniently forgotten how the Republican War was sold to the American people with outright lies .
They ignore the fact that the war was bungled from Day One and that ordinary Americans have paid a terrible price for those blunders .
If ever there were a valid reason to shed the label " Republican , " the nutty administration and its war - loving allies in the House and Senate have provided it .
They seem to have lost their collective minds .
They know darn well what their general du jour , David Petraeus , is going to say in September : " Gosh , fellows , things are looking up , but give us another five years .
Or maybe 10 . "
That would be insanity to the third power .
The Iraqis are killing us on the cheap with secondhand AK - 47s , rifle grenades and homemade bombs created out of old artillery shells .
We are using the most expensive weapons in the world , wielded by the most expensive army in the world , to kill them by the small handful .
I do n’t know what the insurgency has cost , but the Republican War has cost us half a trillion dollars , and all we have to show for it are 3,600 graves , several thousand wounded , a civil war and a corrupt , ineffective civilian government .
The Iraqi supply line stretches around the corner ; ours stretches 7,000 miles .
The Iraqis know what their mission is ; our soldiers do n’t have the foggiest notion of why they are still there .
Even to put the best face on it , we replaced a dictatorship and allowed the Iraqis free elections and time to adopt a constitution .
At that point , the president should have said : " We ’ve done our part .
Now you ’re on your own .
Goodbye . "
But no , he did n’t do that , because his intention is for the Republican War to never end and for our troops to become a permanent part of the Iraqi landscape .
George W. Bush is by no means the first Westerner to make a fool of himself by overestimating his powers and underestimating the determination of the people of the Middle East to rid themselves of foreign conquerors .

The plane became a major attraction in Mumbai
Enlarge Image
The plane was taken overnight from the Chembur district where it had been left by a driver who was taking it by trailer to Delhi .
It is not clear who has moved it or where it has been taken .
The decommissioned Boeing had become the centre of attraction in the city .
But some people complained that it was disrupting business .
It appears that the plane was abandoned after the driver took a wrong turn and found himself facing a flyover that was too low for him to take the plane under .
The driver then disappeared and the plane and its trailer were marooned for several days while no - one assumed responsibility for moving it .
Sunday surprise
" I 'm thrilled to see that it is gone , " one woman , Shaila Kachare , told the BBC News website .
" Life 's back to normal . "
Now you see it - now you do n't
The Boeing used to belong to the private company Air Sahara .
Its engine , wings and tail were removed before it began its road journey to Delhi .
Restaurant owner Ramji Thapar woke up on Sunday morning to find the aircraft on its giant trailer abandoned on the road .
" Saturday night I shut shop and go home and everything is fine , " he told the BBC news website .
" Sunday morning when I get here , this aircraft is here near my restaurant ! "
Reports say it was supposed to be used at a flight training academy .
Pradeep Malhotra , who runs a catering service in the area , said the plane had become a huge problem because it was parked right in front of his shop , preventing him loading his lorries .
Some residents said they had not complained simply because they assumed that the authorities would be making it a priority to get the plane out of the city .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress today to reaffirm itself as an equal branch of government and vote to hold White House officials in contempt for refusing to cooperate with legitimate congressional subpoenas .
Calling this a constitutional crisis that threatens to destroy the separation of powers , the ACLU reminded Congress that its oversight and legislative role are vital .
" Presidents have tried in the past to overreach in claiming executive privilege , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" However , Congress has long served as a check to such abuses of power , slapping the president ’s hand when needed and pursuing contempt or enforcement actions that eventually resulted in the release of crucial information .
Today ’s Congress must do the same if it wishes to remain a meaningful and independent branch of government . "
The ACLU rejected claims that Congress ’ responsibility to conduct oversight or investigate executive misconduct was somehow less important than its legislative function and therefore not worthy of compulsory enforcement .
Fredrickson added , " It ’s do - or - die time for the separation of powers .
Congress is facing a historic moment when it can fight for its rightful place in our Constitution or accept the president ’s continued and sweeping claims of supremacy . "
U.S. courts have long supported Congress ’ authority not only to pass laws , but also to investigate their application .
The courts have asserted that claims of executive privilege are a potentially dangerous proposition that should only be applied , and can only be upheld , under narrow circumstances .
Such privilege cannot be used as a means to hide government wrongdoing , and cannot stand in the face of Congress ’ demonstrated need for the information .
A boob ; that ’s what I am , a boob .
— Barney Fife
When Officer Andrew Maddox of the state Parks and Recreation Department busted Middle Park High School for operating as a commercial river outfitter without a license , it was classic Barney Fife .
The sophomore class had been planning the trip for weeks .
Sixty - four kids had raised money to pay the costs for food and expenses ; the tents and rafts were packed ; 18 teachers had organized two days of hikes and activities ; and everybody was excited .
Then Maddox showed up at the Pumphouse access station along the Upper Colorado River on May 24 and threw the book at them .
“ It was just absurd , ” said Jack Van Horn , parent of one of the students and a former river outfitter .
“ It ’s bureaucracy run amok . ”
Maddox , apparently abandoning all common sense , cited the teachers for violating state statute 33-32-102( 3.3 ) , which requires commercial river outfitters to obtain state licenses .
But last time anybody checked , Middle Park High School was still a school , and the team - building , outdoor education program that includes an afternoon of floating down the Colorado was still just a class field trip .
Or it was until Maddox showed up and nixed a tradition that has continued for 35 years .
In his written explanation for citing teacher Jack Dugwyler as a law - breaker , the state river ranger said the incriminating evidence included an “ advertisement ” for the trip contained on the calendar of the school ’s website and the notice sent to parents .
He also insisted that the $ 50 students paid for food , transportation and other expenses constituted profit for the school .
“ It ’s our contention that we were not advertising and not charging a fee , ” said Robb Rankin , superintendent of East Grand Schools , who has taken the trip himself .
As every parent knows , schools send notes home all the time , and they ’re always begging for money to cover the costs for everything from field trips to Kleenex for the classrooms .
Rankin said he thought for certain that the district could explain the circumstances and get the charge dismissed .
Van Horn even contacted Gov. Bill Ritter ’s office asking for help .
Ritter ’s chief of staff , Jim Carpenter , is an alumnus of the school and went on one of the raft trips back in the 1970s .
“ It was a long time ago , ” he said , “ but I remember that it was a great trip . ”
Carpenter said he called Parks and Rec and asked officials there to look into the situation .
They are hanging tough .
“ The way they want to resolve it is to have the teacher plead guilty and accept the consequences , ” Rankin explained .
“ That ’s simply unacceptable . ”
Rankin said the teacher was only doing his job , after all , and the school was operating under the assumption that it was n’t a commercial enterprise this year , last year — or ever .
So Rankin is taking the case to Grand County Court .
The hearing will be at 8:45 Tuesday morning and Rankin suggested students and their parents “ come to see first - hand how the judicial system handles a case ( in ) which you are intimately involved . ”
Van Horn and his daughter , Kristin , plan to attend .
As a former outfitter and one who worked with state officials to write the licensing statute back in 1984 , he ’s convinced it is being misinterpreted .
“ You have a school district that has invested a lot of time , energy and money into something designed to be an educational experience and that ’s totally undermined by somebody way , way , way overstepping his boundaries , ” he said .
For her part , Kristin Van Horn is just hoping the issue is resolved so the week - long camping / rafting trip for juniors can be held as planned next spring .
This year , “ everyone was really disappointed , ” she said .
“ For some kids it was going to be their first time rafting . ”
Instead they ended up paddling around Shadow Mountain Reservoir for a while .
“ It was really boring , ” she said .
No one from the Parks and Recreation Department was available for comment .
They were busy .

Last summer , I took my girlfriend , I 'll call her Beulah , and her son , I 'll call him Eugene , to a water amusement park , attempting to nurture the bond that was forming between us .
After a busy morning of paddleboats and bumper cars , we took a moment to refresh ourselves with a hardy lunch of chili dogs , cheese fries , and lemonade .
Relaxing under shade trees , Eugene smiled a chili - smeared grin , as the sun cast its languid glow over the park .
With the leisurely picnic ending , we hastily dispersed to the changing rooms , in anticipation of our next adventure — the giant water slide .
During our first run , I noticed a gnawing , internal discomfort , although the first sure signs of brown - capping were n’t apparent until Eugene and I climbed the half - mile of stairs to the summit , for our second run .
Unfortunately , I had taken the opportunity , to wear a most - revealing , blue Speedo , in the hope of further enamoring myself to the beautiful Beulah .
Lord knows , I have the body to accommodate such a blatant , public display of manhood .
However , I soon began to regret my decision , for the sharp , cut of the elastic dug into my swelling , gaseous abdomen .
My intestines were bubbling like a whirlpool .
By the time we reached the loading platform at the summit , I was squirming in wretched misery .
Considering my options , I surmised that taking the slide was far more promising than fighting my way back down the stairs , through the crowd .
Thank God I was next in line .
My trouble would soon be over .
The only obstacle before me was an elderly German tourist , staring pensively at the wild rapids .
With obvious reservation , he shuffled slowly toward the mouth of the blue tunnel .
Beyond the point of pleasantries , I bellowed , “ Come on , Pops !
Shake a leg !
” Turning toward the acne- pocked boy who was managing the ride that day , he made a feeble attempt in his native tongue to communicate his apprehension .
I had no other choice !
The brown star pulsated — nearing supernova .
The manager boy recoiled in shock as I pushed the old man down the slide , headfirst .
Cursing me with hostile foreign jibberish , he disappeared around the first turn .
In an instant , I followed , hurling myself down the slick , plastic vortex .
The fury of the slide was incredible .
Rolling and spinning , I gathered speed quickly .
The angle of the chute dipped to nearly seventy degrees , increasing my velocity as I careened from side to side , the water turning to white , angry foam .
Ricocheting from a high , banking wall , the impact smashed me like some fecal - laden pinata .
I lost control , discharging a foul , liquid trail .
A child screamed somewhere behind me , as I slid toward certain humiliation below .
Frantically , I grabbed at the back of my Speedo , in a desperate attempt to flush myself clean .
To my dismay , a fetid school of dung - guppies spilled into the churning maelstrom .
Nearing the final turn , the old man was standing upright in the tunnel in front of me , I ’m sure , to exact some sort of revenge .
His sinewy muscles were tensed , rage filled his dilated eyes .
But with youth , and gravity , on my side , I swiftly took him out at the ankles .
A palsied hand grabbed me as we tumbled out of the chute , and into the pool .
Moments later , a wailing boy fell behind us , riding the crest of a polluted wave .
Thinking fast , I collared the old man , and dragged him onto the concrete deck .
A lifeguard confronted us as people ran screaming from the pool in pale - faced terror .
I explained to the guard how the old man had soiled the waters , how obviously the speed and excitement had proven too much for a man of his age and condition .
Unable to comprehend my story , or explain himself , the old man could only respond with a flurry of incomprehensible shrieks , vective , and obscene gestures .
I suggested that he was hysterical from embarassment and that in the best interests of everyone that he be removed from the park — immediately .
The guard eyed me with suspicion , but had no alternative but to believe my story .
Fortunately , the force of the waters had washed me thoroughly of any incriminating evidence .
I gathered Beulah and Eugene , and made a dash for the parking lot .
I ’m sure the truth eventually surfaced , but not until we were safely on the interstate , heading back home .

LeBron James wants to beat the Miami Heat .
The Miami Heat want to beat LeBron James .
The NBA Finals start Wednesday night and the James vs. Miami story line is shaping up as little more than a meeting of the mutual admiration society , albeit with a championship at stake .
" This report indicates that contracts were given to companies that were unable to deliver vital equipment to our soldiers in the field , unnecessarily putting their lives at risk .
These sole - source contracts were handed out even though serious questions were being raised at the time about the wisdom of such decisions .
" The Inspector General found that Armored Holdings sent cracked equipment that had been painted over , and even two left doors for the same vehicle , instead of one right and one left .
Furthermore , FPI was unable to meet production deadlines even after the Pentagon paid $ 6.7 million to build up their capability .
It was completely unacceptable .
" Our troops were put in harm 's way by delayed and faulty equipment that was let into the system by questionable contracts .
For the sake of our troops in the field , now and in the future , we need to learn more about who knew what , and why military officials who were aware of other competitors were overruled . "
A study completed in late June by the Pentagon 's Inspector General concludes that the Department of Defense ( DoD ) has risked the lives of U.S. troops in Iraq due to malfeasance in awarding and monitoring contracts for badly - needed armored vehicles .
The study , which was requested by Democratic Congresswoman Louise Slaughter of New York , found that since 2000 the DoD has awarded " sole - source " contracts valued at $ 2.2 billion to just two companies , Force Protection , Inc. ( FPI ) and Armor Holdings , Inc ( AHI ) .
Inspector General auditors found that the Marine Corps Systems Command ( MCSC ) made these two companies the sole providers of armored vehicles and armor kits for troops , despite knowing that other suppliers may have produced the equipment so desperately needed in Iraq substantially faster .
Both manufacturers fell far behind delivery schedules , while AHI also produced inadequate and faulty equipment .
"
We determined the MCSC justification for awarding the sole - source contracts was questionable because MCSC officials knew that viable competition was available and were aware of significant concerns with FPI ’s delivery capability , " said the report about the MCSC 's rationale for looking at no suppliers other than FPI .
" In addition , Marine Corps officials did not pursue competition as contracts continued to be awarded , which raises concerns about the recurring justification for urgency .
"
" The Marine Corps Systems Command continued to award contracts for armored vehicles to Force Protection , Inc. , even though Force Protection , Inc. , did not perform as a responsible contractor and repeatedly failed to meet contractual delivery schedules for getting vehicles to the theater , " the report continued .
Representative Slaughter has long been active in pursuing explanations for why equipment shortages have dogged American forces in Iraq and she kicked off this lengthy study of military procurement with a letter to the Inspector General in April 2006 .
" I am concerned with the DoD 's procurement history for armored vehicles , " wrote Slaughter in the letter .
" As with body armor , the DoD failed at the outset of the Iraq war to equip our troops with the armored vehicles to protect them from improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) .
" And Slaughter responded on Wednesday to the report 's findings , which shine a bright spotlight on how no -bid defense contracts are one of the reasons the troops have fared so poorly under the Bush administration .
The report also noted significant problems with the up - armor kits manufactured by AHI subsidiary , Simula , and said that the DoD did not review and verify the company 's production capabilities and quality control processes before awarding the no-bid contract .
Military officials could not provide documentation of any market research or investigation of Simula ’s production to support sole - sourcing the contract to that company .
Simula failed to deliver approximately 34 percent of the kits in accordance with contract delivery schedule .
The DoD issued 64 corrective action requests to Simula documenting discrepancies found in the kits .
“ The increase kit installation time , the addition re-inspection of kits in theater , and the late deliveries increased risks to soldiers ’ lives , " wrote the Inspector General of the situation with faulty armor kits .
The Inspector General 's study also found that " survivability performance characteristics " so important to armored vehicles used in combat , were not known for the FPI products before that company was given an exclusive contract to produce the equipment for American troops .
" MCSC officials did not provide any documentation to support the survivability performance characteristics of the Cougar [ vehicle ] , " the report said .
" Given that this was the first contract with FPI for this vehicle , we do not believe such data existed , and it could not be provided by MCSC officials to justify a sole - source award .
" Slaughter says the whole mess is not surprising and raises far more questions than answers .
" I want to know if there is more influence - peddling involved " in awarding the contracts without competition , " said the New York Democrat .
" We have to make sure a lesson was learned here . " " It 's been business as usual .
The lives of our soldiers took a back seat to who got the contracts . "

British scientists are
developing a vaccine to
give lifelong protection
against all strains of flu .
It would deal with everything
from a winter virus to a bird flu
outbreak .
Current flu jabs are out of date
within a year because the virus
mutates so often .
The new FLU - v vaccine is also
easier to make than traditional
jabs , so it could be stockpiled
against a global pandemic .
Flu kills up to 12,000 Britons a
year , many of them elderly .
A
pandemic of the human form of
bird flu – which many experts
say is inevitable – could claim
700,000 lives in the UK alone .
It is hoped the first human
trials of FLU - v will start next year .
If
they go well , it could be on the
market in three to five years .
Dr Stuart Robinson of the
Buckinghamshire company PepTcell ,
which developed the vaccine ,
said : " We expect one course of
injections – probably of two a
week apart – to give life - long
immunity " .
Existing flu jabs focus on a pair
of proteins on the surface of the
virus .
These constantly mutate ,
however , making it impossible to
prepare in advance for each
new strain .
The new vaccine is based on
other proteins , common to all
strains of the virus , which have
not mutated for 60 years .
Rather than using antibodies
to kill the virus , the new jab
relies on the power of other
immune system cells called
cytotoxic T cells .
Lab tests have shown that FLUvcan save mice given a dose of
flu that would normally kill
them .
Results being presented
at a Toronto conference today
show that more than half the
treated mice survived .
Unvaccinated creatures died .
The mice
had been genetically altered to
give them human - like immune
systems – encouraging hopes
the jab will work on people .
FLU -v can also be produced
quickly and in bulk .
Conventional jabs are grown in hen's
eggs – a slow process that yields
only one shot per egg .
A universal flu jab is the ' holy
grail ' of researchers , potentially
worth a fortune .
At least two
other companies – British - based
Acambis and the Swiss firm Cytos
– are also working on vaccines .
Expert reaction was mixed last
night .
Professor Hugh
Pennington , emeritus professor at
Aberdeen University , said : " We
are in real need of new types of
vaccine .
Anything that gives a
more rapid response would be
of great interest . "
But virologist Professor Ian
Jones , of the University of
Reading , warned that an HIV vaccine
based on similar principles had
failed .
He said T cells mop up
virus - infected cells , but
questioned whether they could
guard against infection .
" We all have flu T cells from
previous infections , " said
Professor Jones , " yet we still get
seasonal flu . "
Professor Malcolm McCrae of
Warwick University said the
vaccine could wear off more quickly
than a normal jab , but might be
a useful short - term measure
against a totally new strain .
In London a man accused of hacking into the computer system of the Pentagon and Nasa is waiting to see if the House of Lords will hear his appeal against extradition to the US to face a trial in which one prosecutor has already indicated he should " fry " .
Blowing up an airliner is clearly regarded as less serious than causing major embarrassment to the defence establishment .
Luis Posada , a veteran anti-Castro militant and CIA operative under George Bush Sr , was told that he was free to go due to administrative errors in the case against him for entering the US illegally .
Posada is wanted in Venezuela and Cuba for allegedly plotting to blow up a Cuban airliner in which 73 people died in 1976 .
The US authorities have already indicated that they will not extradite him to either country , and all the other states to which they have sought to deport Posada have refused him entry .
No wonder his lawyer remarked , without apparent irony , that " he is very gratified that the system has worked " .
Gary McKinnon , the young Scotsman accused of hacking into the Pentagon and a variety of other US military and space - research sites from a room in a flat belonging to his ex-girlfriend 's aunt in Bounds Green , north London , is awaiting the decision on his appeal against extradition .
The home secretary , John Reid , has already given permission for McKinnon to be sent to Virginia for trial , and it is unclear what kind of penalty awaits him .
Since the magic phrase " 9/11 " has been mentioned in connection with the timing of his hacking activities , it seems unlikely that McKinnon will be told that there has been a technical error in his prosecution and he is free to go .
The Posada case has caused concern inside the United States and outside .
Last month a Boston Globe editorial noted that " the administration is treating this case with delicacy , perhaps because of the CIA connection .
Who knows what dirty dealings he [ Posada ] might reveal ? ...
Yet justice for the deaths of 73 people should outweigh any concerns about ancient CIA revelations . "
The editorial also suggested that Posada should face trial on the murder charges either in Venezuela or the US .
Under a 1971 international convention , a nation that refuses to extradite a suspect in an airliner attack is obliged to try the person in its own courts .
The Non-Aligned Movement , which represents some 118 countries - whose support one would have thought the US would value in the " war on terror " - has also expressed its concern .
Yesterday it issued a statement that called on America to fulfil its obligations under the United Nations charter that proscribes the harbouring of terrorists .
McKinnon is accused of causing $ 700,000 worth of damage to computer systems , but his greatest offence seems to be that of causing extreme embarrassment to the US defence establishment .
His alleged offence , which he has always said was prompted by a desire to know if information about the existence of UFOs was being suppressed , was committed in London .
As such , he should be tried in a British court .
Perhaps if he had concentrated his undoubted technical abilities on damaging Cuba or Castro , he would now be enjoying the freedom of the city of Miami and a trip north to Disney World , where he could , presumably , discuss the state of the US justice system with Mickey Mouse .

Guess what ?
They do .
From ABC
News , regarding the VA Tech shooter :
Some news accounts have suggested that Cho had a history of antidepressant use , but senior federal officials tell ABC News that they can find no record of such medication in the government 's files .
This does not completely rule out prescription drug use , including samples from a physician , drugs obtained through illegal Internet sources , or a gap in the federal database , but the sources say theirs is a reasonably complete search .
And in fact , the article suggests that this is n't just a database of patients who use anti-depressants , it 's a federal database of every prescription drug you 've ever bought .
We do n't even have a list of gun owners , and we have a list of everyone who has been prescribed anti-depressants ?
What exactly do the Bushies do with that list ?
And what other lists do they have of which medications you 've ever taken ?

The following revisions to The Illustrated Kama Sutra are solely intended for males who make a living by writing humor and video game articles on the internet .
These positions contain advanced concepts and techniques that could result in horrific injuries and significant mental anguish for normal men .
A woman that the man has never met before positions herself in the seat next to his in a movie theater .
His eyes caress her knees and thighs continuously for several hours .
In an advanced form of this technique , she crosses her legs and her ankle brushes against his calf .
Not to be confused with The Thirsty Siren , where the woman 's elbow brushes against the man 's arm when she reaches for her Dr. Pepper .
The man 's best friend embraces him in a horrifically platonic hug .
She has trapped him in the friend zone for years .
As the woman cries on the man 's shoulder over the death of a family member , he concentrates on the sensation of her breasts pressing against him .
The man focuses , diverting all of his mental power to the impossible task of granting his chest the same amount of tactile feedback as his fingertips .
As the woman 's sobbing intensifies , she holds him closer and their hips touch .
It is the closest his groin will ever be to hers .
The man plays Gears Of War on Xbox Live in his apartment , shouting at 14 - year - old children who place sticky grenades on him and then roll away .
As his screaming intensifies and carries through the cardboard - thin apartment walls , his female neighbor is driven to new heights of ecstasy by his manliness and maturity .
Each curse word is a passionate thrust , each homophobic slur an orgasm .
He unknowingly pleasures her until she collapses into a deep and satisfied slumber .
The man falls asleep himself while waiting for two surviving players to move from their hiding spots on Escalation .
The man sits facing the woman he has somehow tricked into coming home with him .
She wraps her hand around his remote control and turns on the television .
As the man kisses her neck and whispers of his unending love for her a mere three hours after they first met , the woman laughs at Late Night With Conan O'Brien .
When the show is over , the woman tells the man she should go because she has a migraine and she is having her period and she is pregnant and the three bookcases devoted to the mans ' comic books sort of freak her out .
When all normal methods of meeting women prove fruitless , the man crafts a bear suit and attends a furry convention .
He hopes to find a decent looking frog to make out with , but is willing to settle for anything that 's female at this point .
As the others point and laugh at his poorly constructed costume , the man hangs his head and weeps .
The man positions himself behind a row of shrubbery alongside an airport runway .
While watching the planes take off and land , he masturbates with a cold , detached resignation .
The man dies alone and uncared for , leaving nothing behind save for a legacy of Duke Nukem Forever jokes and a browser cache almost entirely comprised of vanity searches .
While performing the autopsy , a female doctor briefly touches the man 's junk while checking for needle marks or poisonous snake bites .
Score .
In an advanced form of this technique , the man inserts his thumb into the woman 's anus and simulates a thumb - wrestling match .

The political establishment has been doing its best to brush aside Mike Gravel , the 76 - year - old former senator from Alaska — and fairly successfully so , until Gravel ’s appearance at last month ’s sleepy Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina .
After challenging fellow Dems to end the war by legislative fiat — and make it a “ felony ” for the president to keep troops in Iraq — Gravel saw visits to his website zoom up , and YouTube clips of his debate remarks and even his campaign videos have been drawing tens of thousands of views .
If this keeps up , could Gravel ’s name begin to resonate with the ring of that ultimate Democratic dirty word — Ralph Nader ?
Of course Gravel , unlike Nader , has chosen to run in the Democratic primary , with no chance of tilting the general election — for now , at least .
Banish the thought , but what if Fred Thompson or Chuck Hagel were to head the Republican ticket against Hillary , with her high negatives , or Obama , whose equivocation could begin to wear away his charm ?
What would happen if old man Gravel bolted to run as an independent ( with Nader ’s backing , even ) and started pulling one or two or three points ?
Keep in mind that nobody paid any heed to Nader in 2000 until he started running the dread campaign rallies in city after city , culminating in a screaming frenzy at Madison Square Garden .
In a single night , Gravel managed to build a buzz among the mad - as - hell crowd .
It ’s not clear how far this could take him — but mainstream Dems are undoubtedly at least a tad concerned .
Gravel shook up the otherwise safe , polite , and predictable by confronting mealy - mouthed fellow Dems with a dreck - cutting matter - of - factness .
Commenting that his fellow candidates “ frightened ” him because they refused to take the nuclear option off the table with regard to Iran , he then confronted Obama with the question , “ Tell me , Barack , who do you want to nuke ? ”
Addressing Joe Biden on his plans for Iraq ’s future , he spoke of the “ arrogance ” of wanting to direct the government of another country — to which Biden replied that Gravel was living in “ happy land . ”
He might have been the first candidate to officially announce — way back in April 2006 — but until the debate , Gravel ’s low - budget campaign had been nearly invisible .
Yet to progressives of a certain vintage , myself included , Gravel is hardly an unknown .
During the 1960s , he was somewhat notorious for making public the Pentagon Papers , fighting nuclear testing and nuclear power as well as the Vietnam War , and cutting legislative deals that helped stop the draft .
Born into a working - class French Canadian family in central Massachusetts and educated in Catholic schools , Gravel moved to Alaska after serving a stint in the Army Counter Intelligence Corps in the 1950s .
He worked as a brakeman on the Alaska Railroad and made some money as a property developer on the Kenai Peninsula before winning a seat in the state legislature and then the U.S. Senate .
He lost that seat in 1980 — the election that would send Republican Frank Murkowski to Washington — and has been largely absent from the political stage for a quarter century .
When I met with him last week , he wasted no time before getting down to a few admittedly radical bits of business , chief among them his proposal to eliminate the income tax and the IRS and replacing them with a national sales tax .
Though appealing to libertarians — who have made Gravel an unlikely favorite on user - generated news sites like Digg — the proposal is bound to alienate people who might otherwise sympathize with the ex-senator : Sales taxes are considered “ regressive , ” meaning they take proportionately more from those with lower incomes than from the better - off .
But Gravel maintains that since the present tax system has become corrupted by “ wealthy people gaming the system , ” his fix would provide a solution ; to help the poor , he ’d provide a guaranteed minimum income , distributed through Social Security .
Along with getting rid of the income tax , Gravel wants to “ bring control of government into hands of the people , ” by which he means setting up a national initiative system allowing citizens to bring proposals to a popular vote .
He insists , somewhat optimistically , that the American people would back gay marriage , if given the chance in a national initiative vote .
Ditto on the war on drugs : “ I think the American people realize the war on drugs is a total failure — waste of time , waste of money .
What ’s wrong with marijuana ?
You can go out a buy a fifth of gin and do more damage to yourself . ”
Such proposals might be familiar fringe - candidate fare , but it is on the issue of the Iraq war that Gravel could prove embarrassing to the Democratic mainstream by relentlessly pointing out that Democrats could stop the war — if they choose to exercise their legislative power .
“ What we need to do is to create a constitutional confrontation between the Congress and the president , ” he says .
“ Most people have forgotten the Congress is more powerful than the president . ”
Never mind impeachment , Gravel says : “ That ’s a red herring right now .
It would take over a year to screw around with it . ”
Instead , he proposes a law commanding the president to bring the troops home .
In 60 days .
“ The Democrats have the votes in the House to pass it .
In the Senate , they will filibuster it .
Fine .
The Majority Leader starts a cloture vote the first day .
Fails to get cloture .
Fine .
The next day — another vote on cloture .
And the next day , and the next day , Saturdays and Sundays , no vacation — vote every single day .
The dynamic is that now you give people enough time to weigh in and put pressure on those voting against cloture . ”
( Here , Gravel knows whereof he speaks :
As a senator , he filibustered legislation to extend the draft ; eventually , a deal was cut to end it in two years . )
So , he goes on , “ I would guess in 15 to 20 days you would have cloture and the bill would pass and go to the president .
He would veto it .
Wonderful .
It comes back to the House and Senate .
Normal thing is to try to override and fail .
No guts .
No leadership .
So in the House and Senate every day at noon , you have a vote to override the veto .
The Democrats are the leaders — they control the calendar .
It only takes half an hour to have these votes .
The media will jump on it , you know , ` This guy changed his vote , ’ etc .
But then peace groups can go out into the hustings and get these guys where they live , at home , and I would say that in 30 to 45 days they will override the veto .
But it ’s got to be on a clean , simple issue , none of this “ go out and manage the war , deal with the funds ” stuff .
We never cut off the funds in Vietnam .
I was there .
I tried it .
I failed .
What you have to do is go to their immediate survival .
By Labor Day this could be all solved , and the troops be home by Christmas . ”
“ There ’s one thing about politicians , ” Gravel concludes .
“ They are like every other human being .
They are interested in their own personal survival .
And that ’s what ’s at stake — a dynamic that will ruin their political careers if they do n’t shape up . ”
A riddle :
Why has the Toyota Prius enjoyed such success , with sales of more than 400,000 in the United States , when most other hybrid models struggle to find buyers ?
One answer may be that buyers of the Prius want everyone to know they are driving a hybrid .
The Prius , after all , was built from the ground up as a hybrid , and is sold only as a hybrid .
By contrast , the main way to tell that a Honda Civic , Ford Escape or Saturn Vue is a hybrid version is a small badge on the trunk or side panel .
The Prius has become , in a sense , the four - wheel equivalent of those popular rubber “ issue bracelets ” in yellow and other colors — it shows the world that its owner cares .
In fact , more than half of the Prius buyers surveyed this spring by CNW Marketing Research of Bandon , Ore. , said the main reason they purchased their car was that “ it makes a statement about me . ”
For those of you who have never found The Dilbert Blog , I highly recommend it .
Scott Adams is one of of the few people in this world who looks around and asks “ why ? ” at just about everything .
He further has the talent ( unlike me ) to make the questions hilarious .
On Saturday , he asked “ Is Copyright Violation Stealing ” , with a hope to create fodder for his Sunday post .
Specifically , you take something that a lot of people do which is illegal , tell them they ’re doing something illegal ( and therefore bad ) , and then watch as they try to justify their position .
If youâ€™ve read anything about experiments to produce cognitive dissonance , you know this was the perfect setup .
You can produce dissonance by putting a person in a position of doing something that is clearly opposed to his self image .
Then wait for his explanation .
The explanation will seem absurd to anyone who doesnâ€™t share the dissonance .
In this case the model that produced it wasâ€ ¦
1 . Good people are not criminals .
2. Criminals break laws .
3 . I break copyright laws .
4 . But since I know I am a good person , my reason why itâ€™s okay to violate copyright laws is ( insert something absurd ) .
The fascinating thing about cognitive dissonance is that itâ€™s immune to intelligence .
No matter how smart you are , you canâ€™t think your way out of it .
Once your actions and your self image get out of sync , the result is an absurd rationalization .
You can see that in the comments .
The problem with his theory , and why I do n’t feel the cognitive dissonance he is trying to induce , is because I do n’t agree with premise 1 * .
There are plenty of good people who are criminals .
In fact , we ’re all criminals , as Ayn Rand said a long time ago :
The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals .
Well , when there are n’t enough criminals , one makes them .
One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws .
Simply put , there are so many things in this country that are illegal that I think anyone over the age of 2 is probably a criminal .
Thus , the premise that good people are n’t criminals is mistaken .
Likewise , it ’s converse , that criminals are bad people is also mistaken .
He is trying to force people into believing that because “ criminals are bad ” , violating a law makes you a bad person .
The problem with such an argument is that it ignores the enormous quantity of bad laws .
This is an argument that is often faced when illegal immigration is brought up .
The anti-immigrant folks use this premise to suggest that if someone came here illegally , they ’re bad people .
After all , good people do n’t break laws , and these people obviously did .
In order to bolster their argument , they ’ll point out the many illegal immigrants who have broken more serious laws in order to equate breaking immigration law with committing violent acts .
When you try to pin them down on this distinction , they get angry .
For example , you point out that speeding is a crime , and so anyone who speeds is a lawbreaker .
Then you can quickly point out the number of people who have committed violent crimes and also speed , as if the two are equivalent .
When you do this , you put the arguer in a quandary , because they ca n’t reconcile the fact that their own lawbreaking ( speeding ) does n’t mean they ’re a bad person , but that their argument asserts just such a thing with illegal immigrants .
Because I know how many bad laws are out there , I can be called a criminal by just about anyone , yet easily go to bed at night and rest easy .
It ’s not that I do n’t feel remorse for doing bad things , it ’s that I do n’t feel remorse for breaking the law .
In fact , I quite enjoy breaking stupid laws .
The key is understanding the difference between law and morality ; between what is legal / illegal and what is right / wrong .
I must often determine the right action in complex situations , and to the extent that this coincides with what is legal , I do what is legal .
But where they do n’t coincide , I do what I believe is right .
Now , this is a difficult idea to explain to most people , and when you do , you can get into some serious debates .
After all , right and wrong tend to be pretty subjective terms , because right and wrong are simply manifestations of values , and values are not consistent across people and cultures .
At best , you can come up with law that ’s pretty good ( i.e. laws against murder ) , and at worst , you can end up with all sorts of hell ( i.e. Jim Crow ) .
In both cases , the laws are a reflection of local values .
But it ’s plainly clear that the latter are bad laws , and thus breaking bad laws does n’t make you a bad person , even if it makes you a criminal .
I ’d say that in the United States , the regulatory state has made us stray far from law which acts as an arbiter of right from wrong , and as such , many laws can be quite morally ignored .
Thus , there are quite often times where the law restricts us from doing things that are n’t “ wrong ” in any sense of the word , and in fewer cases , in order to do what would be generally considered “ right ” requires that we break the law .
In the former case , a moral person will not feel any cognitive dissonance about his self image when breaking the law .
In the latter case , a moral person should do the right thing , and may even have a duty to break the law .
* FWIW , I ’m not saying that copyright laws are bad laws , nor am I saying that pirating music is n’t theft .
I ’m simply saying that the groups of “ actions which are illegal ” and “ actions which are wrong ” only partially intersect .
Guantánamo military tribunals exposed by military officer
By Mark Rainer
27 June 2007
In an affidavit submitted to the US Supreme Court last Friday , Army reserve officer Stephen Abraham sharply criticized the military tribunals held in Guantánamo .
Abraham is a 26 - year veteran of military intelligence and the first member of a Guantánamo tribunal panel to be identified and speak critically of the tribunal process .
Abraham served on active duty from September 2004 to March 2005 with the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants ( OARDEC ) , a Department of Defense agency in charge of the tribunal process .
He worked there as agency liaison and served as a panel member of a Combat Status Review Tribunal ( CSRT ) .
The CSRTs were established in July 2004 by an order of Donald Rumsfeld , then secretary of defense , to determine detainees ’ “ enemy combatant ” status .
This followed a Supreme Court ruling in June 2004 in Hamdi v Rumsfeld , which provided a limited rebuff to the Bush administration ’s indefinite detention of detainees .
Stephen Abraham ’s affidavit provides a first - hand account of the CSRT process , and confirms earlier reports that the tribunals held in Guantánamo have nothing to do with providing a democratic review of detainees ’ status and are in every sense a travesty of justice .
Abraham describes a process in which personnel are poorly trained , information is withheld , and weak cases are made that detainees are “ enemy combatants ” based on generic and misused evidence .
Panel members are pressured to make an “ enemy combatant ” determination for detainees .
Abraham explains that all CSRT panel members were assigned to the OARDEC and that a vast majority of OARDEC personnel are “ reserve officers from different branches of service ” and few have “ had any experience or training in the legal or intelligence fields . ”
Based on his observations , the assignments to CSRT panels were “ largely the product of ad hoc decisions by a relatively small group of individuals . ”
Abraham describes the tribunal Recorders as “ relatively junior officers with little training or experience in matters relating to the collection , processing , analyzing , and / or dissemination of intelligence material . ”
While Recorders are responsible for presenting factual evidence in the tribunals , Abraham says that they “ exercised little control over the process of accumulating information to be presented to the CSRT board members . ”
Instead , this job is given to “ individuals identified as case writers who , in most instances , had the same limited degree of knowledge and experience relating to the intelligence community and intelligence products . ”
According to Abraham , “ The information used to prepare the file to be used by the Recorders frequently consisted of finished intelligence products of a generalized nature — often ‘ generic , ’ rarely specifically relating to the individual subjects of the CSRTs or the circumstances related to those individuals ’ status . ”
Abraham also notes the information made available to case writers , Recorders and liaison officers “ was often left entirely to the discretion of the organizations providing information , ” most often with the exclusion of information deemed “ highly sensitive ” or “ highly classified . ”
As a liaison for the OARDEC , Abraham was responsible for gathering and validating information from various intelligence organizations related to a detainee .
He was asked to make a statement to be used by the CSRT panel that the organizations possessed no “ exculpatory information ” on a detainee , information that would excuse the detainee from guilt in a tribunal .
Abraham explains that different intelligence organizations deliberately withheld information , that he was “ allowed only limited access to information , typically prescreened and filtered . ”
He was told on a number of occasions that the information provided to him was all that would be shown .
Abraham ’s requests for a written statement that no exculpatory evidence existed were summarily denied .
One time , Abraham was asked to serve on a CSRT panel along with an Air Force colonel and an Air Force major .
All of them found the information presented lacked substance : “ What were purported to be specific statements of fact lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively credible evidence .
Statements allegedly made by percipient witnesses lacked detail .
Reports presented generalized statements in indirect and passive forms without stating the source of the information or providing a basis for establishing the reliability or credibility of the source . ”
Upon determining that the detainee should not be classified as an “ enemy combatant , ” Rear Admiral McGarrah , director of the OARDEC , and the deputy director immediately questioned the validity of the panel ’s findings .
They were directed to write out specific questions concerning the evidence to allow the Recorder an opportunity to respond .
Another hearing was ordered , and the panel came back with the same determination .
Since then , Abraham was not assigned to another CSRT panel .
Abraham ’s affidavit was submitted on behalf of a Kuwaiti detainee , Fawzi al - Odah , who is challenging his classification as an “ enemy combatant . ”
Al - Odah ’s lawyer , David Cynamon , said Abraham ’s affidavit “ proves what we all suspected , which is that the CSRTs were a complete sham . ”
Matthew J. MacLean , another attorney for al - Odah , commented on Abraham ’s affidavit : “ It would n’t be quite right to say this is the most important piece of evidence that has come out of the CSRT process , because this is the only piece of evidence ever to come out of the CSRT process ; it ’s our only view into the CSRT . ”
The military has held 558 CSRTs for detainees in 2004 and 2005 at the US Naval Base at Guantánamo .
All but 38 were determined to be “ enemy combatants . ”
On January 31 , 2005 , the CSRTs were ruled to be unconstitutional by US District Judge Joyce Hens Green .
The CSRTs are a flagrant violation of the Fifth Amendment , which guarantees those under control of the US the right to due process .
Green also found the CSRTs to violate Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention , which forbids the mistreatment of prisoners .
Abraham ’s affidavit provides further evidence of the flagrant violation of US and international law by the Bush administration .

A dangerous criminal .
Surveillance camera photo taken during bank robbery .
I ’m going to tell you how I entered the underworld , and became a money launderer , and international drug wallah , and remorseless criminal , just like Carlo Gambino or Bin Laden or Condoleezza Rice .
Yes .
I am now of one blood with Pablo Escobar .
It is a service of the Anglo - Irish Bank .
I imagine that my picture can be seen on wanted posters in European post offices .
How did I come to this frightful pass ?
I decided a while back to get such money as I have out of dollars .
In the White House the Maximum Ferret was playing promiscuously at being Sergeant Rock around the planet , which he seemed to regard as his private litter box , and would one day inflate the currency to pay for it .
He does n’t pay for my hobbies , I thought .
Why should I pay for his ?
Anyway , I did n’t want to kill Moslems .
Various other people , yes , but not Mohammedans .
Where to put my minute shriveled pittance , all that is left to me of a misspent life ?
( I live in a swell house in Mexico with a lovely wife , a splendid if occasionally insupportable stepdaughter , a disturbed dog , a rabbit , and lots of ribs and beer .
I do n’t have many excuses for feeling sorry for myself .

The Irish are a delightful race , mildly crazy , sometimes drunken , and literarily gifted , all of which recommended them to me .
Ireland , I was sure , had few Calvinist Texans with beady eyes like windows opening onto a wall , and impenetrable English you could armor a tank with .
I thought of broad green lands and leprechauns and bosomy barmaids with twinkling eyes and countless magnificent authors and Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner .
I duly , and foolishly , sent the bank a deposit , along with copies of my passport , Mexican residency papers , driver ’s license , dog ’s paw prints , grandmother ’s DNA , and all the other dry foliage of my life that the bank required .
This was enough , I thought , to identify several people .
But no .
The bank was darkly suspicious .
It suspected me of Laundering Money .
( I wish it suspected me of having money . )
The multitudinous requirements sprang , I presumed , from international law intended to discourage honest people from putting money in banks .
Crooks have ways around these requirements , and also have more money .
Now , any bank ’s protestations that it wants to avoid the laundering of money constitute pious fraud .
Such assertions would embarrass an electronic church promoting your grandaunt ’s social security check .
Criminal enterprise reaps immense sums , being unhampered by governmental regulation .
Do you think any bank whatever does n’t get weak - kneed at the thought of billions in poppy lucre ?
The drug trade is a valued part of the world ’s economy .
But all right .
I sent this stuff off to Dublin , FedEx and forty - five dollars .
I emphasized , please communicate with me by email , as the Mexican mails are casual about things like arrival .
Please , email .
Many weeks later , my check to AIB having cleared , I assumed that I had a properly constituted account .
Then Violeta discovered a sodden envelope in a muddy spot in the road near our house .
This missive turned out to be from AIB .
Perhaps the bank had an eccentric conception of email .
Usually I find it in my inbox and not in a hole in the street .
In it I discovered that the bank , in the person of a Mr. David Milne , was not happy with the documentation from my bank here , Lloyd .
He did n’t much like the bank .
From the peremptory nature of his eruptions ( I shall require ) I realized that Mr. Milne must be at least a duke , or maybe a dauphin , or perhaps a king .
No doubt his car was escorted by pikemen .
As a barefoot West Virginia boy I was awed by dealing with royalty but happy to be climbing in the world .
I can not lie .
His dark suspicions were not entirely without foundation .
I had links with the opium trade .
Violeta recently found a poppy growing in the back yard , next to the goldfish pond .
I do n’t know how it got there .
We were n’t even sure whether it was an opium poppy , though I fervently hoped so .
By this time I rather wanted to belong to the criminal element .
Out of sheer vengefulness I decided to sell that poppy and launder the money through AIB .
I would have , too , except that the rabbit ate it .
I thought she looked very calm for rest of the afternoon .
Since this column is read by expatriates around the world , suggesting that they have too much time on their hands , I explained to the earl that I was a journalist , and asked what would have happened had I not found his email in the mud hole in front of my house .
Would my money have been confiscated by some august governmental body given to thievery ?
What was AIB ’s objection to Mexican banks ?
Did his majesty know something I did n’t ?
He declined to answer .
I suppose that archbishops are quite busy .
The rub was that he wanted some document from my Mexican bank imprinted with the bank ’s stamp .
But Lloyd ’s does n’t have a stamp .
It is n’t how things are done here .
I guess that if you live in a castle surrounded by a moat , and spend your time calking drafty cracks , you do n’t have time to learn about banking practices .
Anyway Veronica , my patient account manager at Lloyd ’s , composed a letter testifying that I existed and so on , had it translated into English , and sent it to the his Excellency .
Forty - five bucks more for FedEx , which began setting up a branch office to handle my correspondence .
Rabbit .
It ate the evidence .
This did n’t work either .
Nothing does .
I have sent document after document .
I wondered why the good baron did n’t simply email Lloyd ’s , which would remove all doubt about whatever it was that he doubted .
I then realized that Lloyd ’s parking lot was paved , and that it did n’t have a muddy spot in which to receive email .
Technology arrives slowly in Latin America .
With this much trouble getting money into the bank , I assumed that there could be no earthly hope of getting it out .
In fact AIB seemed to regard depositors with resentment , as annoyances having nothing to do with its line of work .
Perhaps before the bank was born , its mother was frightened by a client , engendering lifelong gollywoggles whenever approached by one .
On and on it went , and goes .
I do n’t know whether I will live long enough to see my funds , orphaned and sorrowing in some cold account .
They probably wo n’t even recognize me .

lsof is the sysadmin / security über - tool .
I use it most for getting network connection related information from a system , but that ’s just the beginning for this powerful and too - little - known application .
The tool is aptly called lsof because it “ lists open files “ .
And remember , in UNIX just about everything ( including a network socket ) is a file .
Interestingly , lsof is also the Linux / Unix command with the most switches .
It has so many it has to use both minuses and pluses .
usage : [-?abhlnNoOPRstUvV ] [ +|-c c ] [ +|-d s ] [ +D D ] [ +| - f[cgG ] ] [ - F [ f ] ] [ - g [ s ] ] [ - i [ i ] ] [ + | - L [ l ] ] [ + | - M ] [ - o [ o ] ] [ - p s ] [ + | -r [ t ] ] [ - S [ t ] ] [ - T [ t ] ] [ -u s ] [ + | - w ] [ - x [ fl ] ] [--] [ names ]
As you can see , lsof has a truly staggering number of options .
You can use it to get information about devices on your system , what a given user is touching at any given point , or even what files or network connectivity a process is using .
For me , lsof replaces both netstat and ps entirely .
It has everything I get from those tools and much , much more .
So let ’s look at some of its primary capabilities :
It ’s important to understand a few key things about how lsof works .
Most importantly , when you ’re passing options to it , the default behavior is to OR the results .
So if you are pulling a list of ports with - i and also a process list with -p you ’re by default going to get both results .
Here are a few others like that to keep in mind :
default : without options , lsof lists all open files for active processes
: without options , lists all open files for active processes grouping : it ’s possible to group options , e.g. - abC , but you have to watch for which options take parameters
: it ’s possible to group options , e.g. , but you have to watch for which options take parameters - a : AND the results ( instead of OR )
: AND the results ( instead of OR ) -l : show the userID instead of the username in the output
: show the userID instead of the username in the output -h : get help
: get help -t : get process IDs only
: get process IDs only - U : get the UNIX socket address
: get the UNIX socket address - F : the output is ready for another command , which can be formatted in various ways , e.g. -F pcfn ( for process id , command name , file descriptor , and file name , with a null terminator )
As I said , one of my main usecases for lsof is getting information about how my system is interacting with the network .
Here are some staples for getting this info :
Show all connections with -i
Some like to use netstat to get network connections , but I much prefer using lsof for this .
The display shows things in a format that ’s intuitive to me , and I like knowing that from there I can simply change my syntax and get more information using the same command .
# lsof -i
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME dhcpcd 6061 root 4u IP v4 4510 UDP *: bootpc sshd 7703 root 3u IPv6 6499 TCP *: ssh ( LISTEN ) sshd 7892 root 3u IPv6 6757 TCP 10.10.1.5:ssh->192.168.1.5:49901 ( ESTABLISHED )
Get only IP v6 traffic with -i 6
# lsof -i 6
Show only TCP connections ( works the same for UDP )
You can also show only TCP or UDP connections by providing the protocol right after the - i .
# lsof -iTCP
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME sshd 7703 root 3u IPv6 6499 TCP *: ssh ( LISTEN ) sshd 7892 root 3u IPv6 6757 TCP 10.10.1.5:ssh->192.168.1.5:49901 ( ESTABLISHED )
Show networking related to a given port using - i : port
Or you can search by port instead , which is great for figuring out what ’s preventing another app from binding to a given port .
# lsof - i :22
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME sshd 7703 root 3u IPv6 6499 TCP *: ssh ( LISTEN ) sshd 7892 root 3u IPv6 6757 TCP 10.10.1.5:ssh->192.168.1.5:49901 ( ESTABLISHED )
Show connections to a specific host using @host
This is quite useful when you ’re looking into whether you have open connections with a given host on the network or on the internet .
# lsof -i@172.16.12.5
sshd 7892 root 3u IPv6 6757 TCP 10.10.1.5:ssh->172.16.12.5:49901 ( ESTABLISHED )
Show connections based on the host and the port using @host : port
You can also combine the display of host and port .
# lsof -i@172.16.12.5 :22
sshd 7892 root 3u IPv6 6757 TCP 10.10.1.5:ssh->192.168.1.5:49901 ( ESTABLISHED )
Find listening ports
Find ports that are awaiting connections .
# lsof -i -sTCP :LISTEN
You can also do this by grepping for “ LISTEN ” as well .
# lsof - i | grep -i LISTEN
iTunes 400 daniel 16u IPv4 0x4575228 0t0 TCP *: daap ( LISTEN )
Find established connections
You can also show any connections that are already pinned up .
# lsof -i -sTCP: ESTABLISHED
You can also do this just by searching for “ ESTABLISHED ” in the output via grep .
# lsof - i | grep -i ESTABLISHED
firefox - b 169 daniel 49u IPv4 0t0 TCP 1.2.3.3:1863->1.2.3.4:http ( ESTABLISHED )
You can also get information on various users and what they ’re doing on the system , including their activity on the network , their interactions with files , etc .
Show what a given user has open using -u
# lsof -u daniel
-- snipped -- Dock 155 daniel txt REG 14,2 2798436 823208 /usr/lib/libicucore.A.dylib

Kill everything a given user is doing
It ’s nice to be able to nuke everything being run by a given user .
# kill - 9 `lsof -t -u daniel`
It ’s often useful to be able to see what a given program or process is up to , and with lsof you can do this by name or by process ID .
Here are a few options :
See what files and network connections a named command is using with -c
# lsof -c syslog-ng
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME syslog - ng 7547 root cwd DIR 3,3 4096 2 / syslog - ng 7547 root rtd DIR 3,3 4096 2 / syslog - ng 7547 root txt REG 3,3 113524 1064970 /usr/sbin/syslog-ng -- snipped --
See what a given process ID has open using -p
# lsof -p 10075
-- snipped -- sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 34808 850407 /lib/libnss_files-2.4.so sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 34924 850409 /lib/libnss_nis-2.4.so sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 26596 850405 /lib/libnss_compat-2.4.so sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 200152 509940 /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.7 sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 46216 510014 /usr/lib/liblber-2.3 sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 59868 850413 /lib/libresolv-2.4.so sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 1197180 850396 /lib/libc-2.4.so sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 22168 850398 /lib/libcrypt-2.4.so sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 72784 850404 /lib/libnsl-2.4.so sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 70632 850417 /lib/libz.so.1.2.3 sshd 10068 root mem REG 3,3 9992 850416 /lib/libutil-2.4.so -- snipped --
The -t option returns just a PID
# lsof -t -c Mail
350
By looking at a given file or directory you can see what all on the system is interacting with it –including users , processes , etc .
Show everything interacting with a given directory
# lsof / var / log / messages /
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME syslog - ng 7547 root 4w REG 3,3 217309 834024 /var/log/messages
Show everything interacting with a given file
# lsof /home / daniel/firewall_whitelist.txt
Advanced Usage
Similar to tcpdump , the power really shows itself when you start combining queries .
Show me everything daniel is doing connected to 1.1.1.1
# lsof -u daniel - i @ 1.1.1.1
bkdr 1893 daniel 3u IPv6 3456 TCP 10.10.1.10:1234->1.1.1.1:31337 ( ESTABLISHED )
Using the -t and -c options together to HUP processes
# kill - HUP `lsof -t -c sshd`
Show open connections with a port range
# lsof -i @fw.google.com:2150-2180

Katahdin Chris Seaton , 2007
Katahdin is a programming language where the syntax and semantics are mutable at runtime .
It was the 2007 master ’s project of Chris Seaton at the University of Bristol Department of Computer Science , under the supervision of Dr Henk Muller .
Katahdin employs the theory of parsing expression grammars and packrat parsing .
Unlike other contemporary work , Katahdin applies these techniques at runtime to allow the grammar to be modified by a running program .
New constructs such as expressions and statements can be defined , or a new language can be implemented from scratch .
It is built as an interpreter on the Mono implementation of the .NET framework .
Introduction
In most programming languages you can define new functions and types .
In the same way , Katahdin allows you to define new expressions , statements and other language constructs .
For example , most programming languages have a modulo , or remainder operator .
If your language does not have one , and there is not one that you can overload , creating one would involve learning about the internals of the implementation , modifying the grammar and adding semantic actions throughout the code base .
You would then have to recompile and install your new implementation .
Anyone else wanting to use it would have to be given a set of patches for your changes against the official implementation .
In Katahdin , the complete syntax and semantics of the modulo operator can be defined from scratch in just a few lines :
class ModExpression : Expression { pattern { option leftRecursive ; a: Expression " % " b: Expression } method Get ( ) { a = this .a. Get ...( ) ; b = this .a. Get ...( ) ; return a - ( b * ( a / b ) ) ; } }
In Katahdin this is a runtime operation , so immediately after defining ModExpression the modulo operator becomes part of the language in line with all the other operators .
You can define a new construct on one line and use it on the next .
There are no special constructs in Katahdin that cannot be modified , including white - space and basic tokens .
If all of the constructs in a language are defined as above , Katahdin can be turned into an interpreter for that language .
In this way , Katahdin can be used as a generic interpreter for any language , or one language can be used from within another by composing the two or more definitions .
My implementation includes proof - of - concept language definitions for FORTRAN and Python , which can be composed to write a single program with a mix of the two languages .
import " fortran.kat " ; import " python.kat " ; fortran { SUBROUTINE RANDOM ( SEED , RANDX ) INTEGER SEED REAL RANDX SEED = 2045 * SEED + 1 SEED = SEED - ( SEED /1048576 ) *1048576 RANDX = REAL( SEED + 1)/1048577.0 RETURN END } python { seed = 128 randx = 0 for n in range ( 5 ) : RANDOM ( seed , randx ) print randx }
There are real world scenarios where one would want to use one language from within another .
People use SQL from within other languages all the time by writing the SQL in strings .
In Katahdin , the definition of SQL can be composed with the main language and used as if it were all part of one language .
There are also good examples of why one would want to define new constructs in a running program .
For example , Java 1.5 included a new for - each - statement .
Programmers wanting to use the statement had to wait for Sun ’s implementation to be drafted , implemented , tested and distributed .
In Katahdin programmers can create new statements on their own as they need them , without modifying the implementation .
If you want a new for - each - statement in your language you can add one in just a minute .

Using a new type of drug that targets a specific genetic defect , researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , along with colleagues at PTC Therapeutics Inc. and the University of Massachusetts Medical School , have for the first time demonstrated restoration of muscle function in a mouse model of Duchenne ’s muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) .
The research appears ahead of print in an advanced online publication of Nature .

Therapeutics .
“ This new class of treatment has the potential to help a large number of patients with different genetic diseases that have the same type of mutation , ” says senior author H. Lee Sweeney , PhD , chair of the Department of Physiology at Penn .
This genetic flaw causes from 5 to 15 percent ( and in a few instances up to 70 percent ) of individual cases of most inherited diseases , including DMD , cystic fibrosis , and hemophilia .
The new drug , developed by the South Plainfield , NJ - biotech firm and called PTC124 , binds to the ribosome , a cellular component where the genetic code is translated into proteins , one amino acid at a time .
The drug allows the ribosome to read through a mistake in the genetic code called a premature stop codon in order to properly make whole proteins .
In DMD , patients are missing dystrophin , a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact .
About 15 percent of DMD patients do not make dystrophin because of the mutation .
DMD eventually affects all voluntary muscles , as well as heart and breathing muscles .
PTC124 attaches to ribosomes in all cell types within the MD mouse model , overriding the mutation in the dystrophin gene that tells it to halt production of the protein .
Instead of stopping , the full - length dystrophin protein is made .
The drug enables enough protein to be made to correct defects in the muscle of the DMD mouse , and at the same time the drug does not prevent the ribosome from reading correct “ stop ” signals in the genetic code to make other necessary proteins .
“ Enough dystrophin accumulated in the muscles of the MD mice so that we could no longer find defects in the muscles when we examined them , ” says Sweeney .
“ For all intents and purposes the disease was corrected by treatment with PTC124 . ”
The drug allowed dystrophin to be made in cells in which it was previously absent , to be delivered to the proper location at the cell membrane , and to induce restoration of muscle function in rodent muscles .

Overturning Hitler 's Military Tribunals Germany Considers Rehabilitating Soldiers Executed for ' Treason '
Most of the 30,000 Germans sentenced to death by Nazi Germany 's military courts have been rehabilitated .
So far , however , soldiers found guilty of treason -- in many cases unjustly , have been excluded .
Now , though , Germany 's parliament may be prepared to do just that .
Eight years after Mystery Science Theater 3000 crashed to Earth , fans still mourn the demise of the series whose robot characters offered snarky running commentaries on some of the 20th century 's most mockable B movies .
Now fans can hear those caustic asides directed at a new crop of movies , with a pair of new ventures from the creators of MST3K .
For $ 3 , you can purchase an MST3K - style commentary for such recent disasters as Eragon or Terminator 3 from RiffTrax , a website run by MST3 K star and head writer Mike Nelson .
The commentary track comes as an MP3 download that you manually sync up with your DVD 's audio .
If you do n't have the doomed film on DVD , RiffTrax directs you to Netflix or various for - fee download sites .
According to Nelson , the time was right for RiffTrax , because audiences eye major releases with more caution now .
" People have been burned too many times in theaters , " Nelson said .
" So , I 'm feeling a little bit of optimism that movie fans are rejecting the same old films that Hollywood is telling them to like . "
He does n't hate Hollywood , Nelson insists .
" I have no problem with big blockbusters .
If they 're done well , I enjoy them .
But the formula is so tired that they 're rarely done well anymore . "
In the years since MST3K , Nelson has remained in demand as a writer , providing funny commentary tracks on classic cult DVDs like House on Haunted Hill and Plan 9 From Outer Space for Legend Films .
Though Nelson did the first few RiffTrax commentaries himself , MST3K buddies Kevin Murphy ( Tom Servo ) and Bill Corbett ( Crow T. Robot ) eventually co-starred on a few titles , although without the robot puppets they once used .
A complete reunion of the three - man crew followed soon after with the creation of a second venture , The Film Crew – a return to the trio 's classic cult film roots .
While RiffTrax takes aim at recent releases and provides just the commentary track , The Film Crew mines the last century 's clunkers for comedic material , re-releasing them on DVD with their usual smartass comments .
Over the next several months , Nelson , Murphy and Corbett will release special DVD editions of such forgettable fare as Killers From Space or Hollywood After Dark , complete with traditional MST3K dismantling .
Tom Servo and Crow , the wisecracking bots from MST3K , will not be returning to the screen .
But the two men behind their voices , wit and personalities are back at Nelson 's side .
I reckon there are 75,000 people living in nearly 25,000 off - grid homes in the UK .
These are homes not connected to mains gas and electricity , water and sewage or even the phone lines that bind the rest of us into a system that wastes energy transporting it around the country , and loses up to 30 % of water through leaks .
To get some idea of how many are living this way , I travelled round the UK for most of last year researching a book , How To Live Off - Grid .
I met some of the thousands of normal families living this way , in everything from brick houses to yurts .
Roy and June Fountain , in Kirkby Malzeard , north Yorkshire , live comfortably and conventionally in a normal looking house that gets its water from a borehole and its electricity from a wind turbine .
Roy Fountain is a retired farmer , not an environmentalist , who bought a derelict cottage and moved his family into it .
He battled for years for planning permission to live this way , and succeeded only by starting a sheep - milking business , which was not his original intention , but it was the only way he could persuade the local council that he had a legitimate reason for living off - grid .
He is in a minority among the off - gridders .
Most of the ingenious , self - reliant people who live this way have built their own wooden cabins in fields or parked their caravans behind hedgerows ; driven camper vans or converted lorries deep into woodlands ; live aboard boats , many of them moored on inner-city canals ; or , in the most extreme cases , inhabit tree houses and benders erected in woods and fields .
Benders are shelters made from saplings bent into a lattice frame , supporting a canvas roof and walls .
There were more than 10,000 recorded in the 1815 census , and now they are making something of a comeback .
The rest of us can learn from these ecological footsoldiers about how to live low - energy , low - impact , low - carbon lives .
Perhaps the nation 's off - grid housing stock can be classed as an investment in a carbon - free future .
Every off - gridder automatically reduces their energy and water consumption by up to 90 % compared with a typical household .
They live each day aware of the sun and the wind - dependent on the elements , and so closer to them .
The figure of 75,000 is only those living off - grid all year round .
It does not include part - time off - gridders - the winter renters who go out in their vans or take to their yurts and caravans .
This triples the winter numbers .
But why does any of this matter , other than to the people who live this way ?
Because off - grid living could help the government meet two of its key aims : more affordable homes , and lower domestic carbon consumption .
Despite all the government 's talk of affordable housing and eco-towns , it is well nigh impossible to get planning permission anywhere that is truly affordable .
The prime minister 's pledge to build five eco - towns is all very well , but to be truly sustainable , should n't they start as eco-villages and grow organically ?
They need to be populated by people who have the desire and knowhow to live sustainably .
Where is Gordon Brown planning to find these paragons other than from among the current off - grid population ?
On this crowded island , it is the building land that makes homes unaffordable , not the house itself .
Anyone can buy a few acres of woodland or meadow for perhaps £ 20,000 - compared with up to £ 150,000 for a conventional building plot - and build a low - impact wooden house with solar panels and a wind turbine for another £ 40,000 , including the obligatory composting loo and rainwater harvesting kit .
But getting residential planning permission to live there is always a battle .
What could be an eco-solution to Britain 's housing shortage is being stifled by intolerant regulations .
Right now , there is a window of opportunity for a flood of off - grid housing , low - density eco-dwellings hidden in woods or behind hedges , a few houses here and there .
But it would require a complete break with the planning laws as we have known them for the last 60 years .
Consultation is still in progress , until August 17 , on the recently published planning white paper , Planning for a Sustainable Future .
This is the proposed new regime that will push through large national infrastructure projects .
Its reforming scope could be expanded , allowing a large number of exceedingly small developments .
I would like to see a new category of off - grid planning permission that would allow low - density , low - impact off - grid homes to be built in the open countryside or even the green belt , as well as cities , on the strict condition that these homes remain off - grid for ever .
Unlike the current agriculture - tied planning permission , which can be lifted as more and more agricultural workers leave the land , it would be essential that an off - grid home could never be transferred to grid - connected .
Not only could this new category make it possible to create an extra 20,000 homes a year , on the 90 % of the country not currently developed , it would also be a major contribution to reducing our carbon footprint .
One group is in the process of testing the appetite of planners for recognising off - grid living .
The Landmatters collective in Devon is battling South Hams council to remain living off the land near the heart - achingly beautiful village of Allaleigh .
One day there was just a beautiful hilltop pasture .
The next morning there were a dozen benders in the field - and the Battle of the Benders had begun .
A public inquiry has just been held , the outcome of which could set the terms for future attempts to live off - grid in the countryside .
A slight tweak to the planning system would allow 30,000 new homes a year in open countryside without spoiling anyone 's view - just breathing life back into dying village communities and launching a social experiment that could be a major part of our solution to global warming .
The main obstacle , apart from national planning policy , is from neighbours who paid a fortune for their land and do not see why someone else should get land in the area for £ 5,000 an acre .
Huge numbers of affordable flats are being built in city centres , but if we accept that the countryside also needs affordable housing , then where else is it going to come from ?

Have you heard the big news ?
Of course you have , evidence of phosphine on Venus which could be a biosignature of life on our evil twin planet .
There have been a lot of surprising stories about Venus , so let ’s get you all caught up .
Quick note : Every Wedneday is Simplicity Day on Zen Habits , and for the next few weeks , these posts will be a series called Creating Simple Systems .
This is the second in the series .
The former series , “ Edit Your Life , ” will resume after a bit of a break .
If you ever feel like your life is a bit chaotic or unstructured , it ’s most likely because you have n’t given enough thought to the various systems in your life — how you go about handling the different things in your life — and you have n’t streamlined those systems as possible .
What are systems ?
Basically anything that happens regularly in your life — errands , laundry , email , kids lunches , etc .
And systems can be either simple or complicated — depending on whether you ’ve given them some thought and streamlined them .
Let ’s take a look at a few examples :
Laundry System
Complicated :
You take off your clothes and leave them in a pile on a chair .
Every now and then , you pick them up and toss them in a pile in the laundry room .
When you have time , you might pick through them and throw in a load , dry them , and then toss the clean clothes on your bed , where they sit and get wrinkled until you need to wear them .
Simple :
You take your clothes off and hang them ( if they ’re clean ) or put them in a basket according to color ( one for whites , one for colors , etc. ) .
When one basket gets full , you throw it in the washer , dry them , fold them or hang them , and put them away .
Alternatively , you could designate a laundry day .
Errands System
Complicated :
You need some groceries , so you go to the grocery store .
When you get home , you remember that you forgot the milk .
The next day , you go and pay one of your bills .
The next day , you remember you forgot to pay a second bill , and run out and do that during lunch .
Then after work , you go and pick up some dog food .
The next day , you criss cross all over town getting things ready for a party .
Lots of driving and wasted gas .
Simple :
You designate a single day as errands and grocery day .
You keep an errands list and a running grocery list .
The night before Errands Day , you plan your dinner menu for the next two weeks and complete your grocery list , then look at all the errands on your errands list and plan out the most efficient route .
On Errands Day , you spend a couple of hours doing all the errands on your list and then buying all your groceries .
One trip , planned efficiently , saves gas and multiple shopping trips .
Email System
Complicated :
You ’ve got your email notifier on all the time , and when new email comes in , you immediately stop what you ’re doing and check it .
But you do n’t have time to do the things requested in the email now , so you leave it in your inbox until later .
This process continues all day , and your inbox is overflowing with hundreds of emails , most of which require a response or action .
Now you ’re dreading going through all of that email , and you feel frantic because you ’re not sure what tasks need to be done and when .
Simple :
You designate certain times for email processing ( at the top of the hour , or 30 minutes 3 times a day , for example ) .
You turn off email notification , so that you ’re not interrupted during your non-email times .
When you process your email , you do them one at a time , from top to bottom , dispensing with each one immediately .
They ’re either replied to immediately , put on a to - do list , forwarded , or deleted .
In any case , they are archived or deleted , and none remain in your inbox .
Now you ’ve got a to - do list with all your tasks , you ’ve answered all your email , and your inbox is empty .
These are just a few examples , and the simple systems given are not the only way that a simple system could be designed for those types of tasks .
But you get the picture .
Give your systems some thought , and streamline them , and your life will be much simpler and saner .
Make a list of all the systems in your life that you could simplify .
Here are a few more examples :
Mail
Bills
Kids lunches
Kids soccer
Chores
Travel
Yardwork
Phone numbers
School work
Incoming stuff ( gifts , purchased items )
Bookmarks
Saved information from the web
I ’m sure you could come up with more .
Now here are some suggestions for streamlining and creating simple systems :
Give your system a name .
Formalizing the system will make you more likely to stick with it .
Also , write it down , step by step , and post it up somewhere .
Designate things .
It ’s best to have designated days for things , and designated areas .
That gives order to your week or day , as well as your working or living space .
It turns chaos into simplicity .
Group things .
Grouping all errands into one day , for example , saves time and money .
Stick to the system .
It will take a little while , but you ’ll need to focus on sticking with your system at first .
After awhile , it ’ll become second nature .
Re-evaluate the system .
Every now and then , it ’s good to step back and take a look at whether your system is working , and if it can be further streamlined or improved .
No system is perfect .

Though I knew Einstein for two or three decades , it was only in the last decade of his life that we were close colleagues and something of friends .
But I thought that it might be useful , because I am sure that it is not too soon — and for our generation perhaps almost too late — to start to dispel the clouds of myth and to see the great mountain peak that these clouds hide .
As always , the myth has its charms ; but the truth is far more beautiful .
Late in his life , in connection with his despair over weapons and wars , Einstein said that if he had to live it over again he would be a plumber .
This was a balance of seriousness and jest that no one should now attempt to disturb .
Believe me , he had no idea of what it was to be a plumber ; least of all in the United States , where we have a joke that the typical behavior of this specialist is that he never brings his tools to the scene of the crisis .
Einstein brought his tools to his crises ; Einstein was a physicist , a natural philosopher , the greatest of our time .
What we have heard , what you all know , what is the true part of the myth is his extraordinary originality .
The discovery of quanta would surely have come one way or another , but he discovered them .
Deep understanding of what it means that no signal could travel faster than light would surely have come ; the formal equations were already known ; but this simple , brilliant understanding of the physics could well have been slow in coming , and blurred , had he not done it for us .
The general theory of relativity which , even today , is not well proved experimentally , no one but he would have done for a long , long time .
It is in fact only in the last decade , the last years , that one has seen how a pedestrian and hard - working physicist , or many of them , might reach that theory and understand this singular union of geometry and gravitation ; and we can do even that today only because some of the a priori open possibilities are limited by the confirmation of Einstein ’s discovery that light would be deflected by gravity .
Yet there is another side besides the originality .
Einstein brought to the work of originality deep elements of tradition .
It is only possible to discover in part how he came by it , by following his reading , his friendships , the meager record that we have .
But of these deep - seated elements of tradition — I will not try to enumerate them all ; I do not know them all — at least three were indispensable and stayed with him .
THE FIRST IS from the rather beautiful but recondite part of physics that is the explanation of the laws of thermodynamics in terms of the mechanics of large numbers of particles , statistical mechanics .

The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court to impose tighter restrictions on the hundreds of lawyers who represent detainees at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and the request has become a central issue in a new legal battle over the administration ’s detention policies .
Saying that visits by civilian lawyers and attorney - client mail have caused “ intractable problems and threats to security at Guantánamo , ” a Justice Department filing proposes new limits on the lawyers ’ contact with their clients and access to evidence in their cases that would replace more expansive rules that have governed them since they began visiting Guantánamo detainees in large numbers in 2004 .
The filing says the lawyers have caused unrest among the detainees and have improperly served as a conduit to the news media , assertions that have drawn angry responses from some of the lawyers .
The dispute is the latest and perhaps the most significant clash over the role of lawyers for the detainees .
“ There is no right on the part of counsel to access to detained aliens on a secure military base in a foreign country , ” the Justice Department filing argued .

GoldenMars 1GB GeeDom GU - P05 USB
Flash Drive
Let 's start by reminding ourselves that unlike our usual stable of review samples , this particular flash drive is designed to provide a cheap yet fast flash storage solution for the masses .
GoldenMars certainly was n't aiming to break any speed records with their GeeDom GU - P05 flash drive .
Once you peel off the well - designed packaging , it 's obvious that GoldenMars is trying their best to minimize cost .
You get nothing but the absolute basics - the GeeDom drive and a lanyard .
If you are looking for what are truly quite unnecessary frills like a protective case or a USB extension cable , then you should look elsewhere .
Performance - wise , the GeeDom is no slouch , especially in reads .
Do n't let the comparison fool you .
When compared against high - performance drives from the likes of OCZ and Corsair , the GeeDom 's read performance appears lacklustre .
But it is really quite good read performance for a value - line drive .
When it comes to write performance , it did well in the large files test , beating both the Corsair Flash Voyager and the OCZ Mini -Kart .
However , its flash controller faltered in the small files test , forcing it to take almost 11X longer to finish the test .
This is probably its only major performance issue .
If you are looking for the fastest flash drive money can buy , then this is really not the drive for you .
But if you are looking for a cute little flash drive that is well - made and performs reasonably well , you will want to take a look at the GoldenMars GeeDom GU - P05 flash drive .

Keith did a great report tonight on what the recently passed Military Commissions Act of 2006 means to America and our Constitution .
Download - WMV Download - QT
This story has been buried by Foleygate , which is a crime in itself .
I had the honor of hearing Daniel Ellsberg and John Siegenthaler Sr. speak last night and the key subject was journalism in today 's political environment .
We are one of the only countries in the world without an official secrets act , due in a large part to the uniqueness of our first amendment .
Sadly this very bill puts us even closer to enacting such legislation and putting a muzzle on the media that would have prevented the extraordinary act of patriotism that Ellsberg exhibited , as well as those that followed in the entire Watergate scandal .
Transcript available below the fold .
Because the Mark Foley story began to break the night of September 28th , exploding the following day , many people may not have noticed a bill passed by the Senate that night .
Our third story on the Countdown tonight , the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 and what it does to something called " habeas corpus . "
And before we reduce the very term " habeas corpus " to something vaguely recalled as sounding kinda like the cornerstone of freedom , or maybe kinda like a character from " Harry Potter , " we thought a Countdown Special Investigation was in order .
Congress passed The Military Commissions
Act to give Mr. Bush the power to deal effectively with America 's enemies -- those who seek to harm this country .
And he has been very clear about who that is :
" ... for people to leak that program , and for a newspaper to publish it does great harm to the United States of America . "
So the president said it was urgent that Congress send him this bill as quickly as possible , not for the politics of next month 's elections , but for America .
" The fact that we 're discussing this program is helping the enemy . "
Because time was of the essence -- and to ensure that the 9/11 families would wait no longer -- as soon as he got the bill , President Bush whipped out his pen and immediately signed a statement saying he looks forward to signing the actual law ... eventually .
He has n't signed it yet , almost two weeks later , because he has been swamped by a series of campaign swings at which he has made up quotes from unnamed Democratic leaders , and because when he is actually at work , he 's been signing so many other important bills , such as :
The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act ;
the Third Higher Education Extension Act ;
ratification requests for extradition treaties with Malta , Estonia and Latvia ;
his proclamation of German - American Day ;
the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act ;
and his proclamation of Leif Erikson Day .
Still , getting the Military Commissions
Act to the President so he could immediately mull it over for two weeks was so important , some members of Congress did n't even read the bill before voting on it .
Thus , has some of its minutiae , escaped scrutiny .
One bit of trivia that caught our eye was the elimination of habeas corpus .
which apparently used to be the right of anyone who 's tossed in prison , to appear in court and say , " Hey , why am I in prison ? "
Why does habeas corpus hate America ... and how is it so bad for us ?
Mr. Bush says it gets in the way of him doing his job .
[ video clip ] Bush : " ... we can not be able to tell the American people we 're doing our full job unless we have the tools necessary to do so .
And this legislation passed in the House yesterday is a part of making sure that we do have the capacity to protect you .
Our most solemn job is the security of this country . "
It may be solemn ...
[ video clip ]
Bush : " I do solemnly swear ... "
But is that really his job ?
In this rarely seen footage , Mr. Bush is clearly heard describing a different job .
[ video clip ] ... to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States ..
Countdown has obtained a copy of this " Constitution of the United States . "
And sources tell us it was originally snuck through the Constitutional Convention and state ratification in order to establish America 's fundamental legal principles .
But this so - called Constitution is frustratingly vague about the right to trial .
In fact , there 's only one reference to habeas corpus at all .
Quote : " The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it . "
But even Democrats who voted against the Military Commissions
Act concede that it does n't actually suspend habeas corpus .
[ video clip ]
Leahy :
The bill before the Senate would not merely suspend the great writ , the great writ of habeas corpus , it would eliminate it permanently .
And there is considerable debate whether the conditions for suspending habeas corpus , rebellion or invasion , have been met .
[ video clip ]
Leahy : conditions for suspending habeas corpus have not been met .
[ video clip ]
Kerry :
We 're not in a rebellion , nor are we being invaded .
[ video clip ]
Specter :
We do not have a rebellion or an invasion .
[ video clip ]
Biden : The United States is neither in a state of rebellion nor invasion .
[ video clip ]
Byrd :
We are not in the midst of a rebellion , and there is no invasion .
Countdown has learned that habeas corpus actually predates the " Constitution , " meaning it 's not just pre-September 11th thinking , it 's also pre-July 4th thinking .
In those days , no one imagined that enemy combatants might one day attack Americans on native soil .
In fact , Countdown has obtained a partially redacted copy of a colonial " declaration " indicating that back then , " depriving us of Trial by Jury " was actually considered sufficient cause to start a War of Independence , based on the then - fashionable idea that " liberty " was an unalienable right .
Today , thanks to modern , post - 9/11 thinking , those rights are now fully alienable .
The reality is , without habeas corpus , a lot of other rights lose their meaning .
But if you look at the actual Bill of Rights -- the first ten amendments to that pesky Constitution -- you 'll see just how many remain .
Well , ok , Number One 's gone .
If you 're detained without trial , you lose your freedom of religion , speech , the press and assembly .
And you can't petition the government for anything .
Number Two ?
While you 're in prison , your right to keep and bear arms just may be infringed upon .
Even if you 're in the NRA .
Three ?
No forced sleepovers by soldiers at your house .
OK .
Three is unchanged .
Four ?
You 're definitely not secure against searches and seizures , with or without probable cause - and this is n't even limited to the guards .
Five ...
Grand juries and due process are obviously out .
Six .
So are trials , let alone the right to counsel .
Speedy trials ?
You want it when ?
Seven .
Hmmmm .
I thought we covered " trials " and " juries " earlier .
Eight --
So bail 's kind of a moot point ...
Nine : " Other " rights retained by the people .
Well , if you can name them during your water - boarding , we 'll consider them .
And Ten -- powers not delegated to the United States federal government seem to have ended up there , anyway .
So as you can see , even without habeas corpus , at least one tenth of the Bill of Rights , I guess that 's the Bill of " Right " now ... remains virtually intact .
And we can rest easy knowing we will never , ever have to quarter soldiers in our homes ... as long as the Third Amendment still stands strong .
The President can take care of that with a Signing Statement .
KDE 4.0 - alpha1 : A Visual Guide to New Features
The KDE Community is happy to announce the immediate availability of the first alpha release of the KDE Desktop Environment , version 4.0 .
The release is a basis for the integration of powerful new technologies that will be included in KDE 4 .
It has been given the codename " Knut " .
A new visual appearance through Oxygen
through Oxygen New frameworks to build applications with , providing vastly improved hardware and multimedia integration ( through Solid and Phonon , spelling and grammar checking , to name just a few )
with , providing vastly improved hardware and multimedia integration ( through Solid and Phonon , spelling and grammar checking , to name just a few )
New applications that focus on a smooth user experience , such as Dolphin , the file manager , and Okular , the document viewer
Highlights of KDE 4.0 Alpha1 are :
KDE 4.0 Alpha1 marks the end of the addition of large features to the KDE base libraries and shifts the focus onto integrating those new technologies into applications and the basic desktop .
The next few months will be spent on bringing the desktop into shape after two years of frenzied development leaving very little untouched .
The final release of KDE 4.0 is expected in late October 2007 .
The work on the framework makes application development easier and more satisfying .
This will result in a crop of new features and applications over the next few years , underlining the position KDE holds as the leading Free Desktop and bringing Free Software to new users world - wide .
A detailed release schedule can be found at techbase .
kde.org , the new technical resource accompanying the platform , that provides extensive and high - quality documentation about KDE .
Sightseeing
There are things like Marble , a digital globe and map application for KDE , changes in the file dialogs , configuration screens , color picker , font dialogs and dozens of smaller larger things that make KDE 4 fresh and vital .
KDE PIM 's development continues at an amazing pace , but due to the scope of the changes , including a shared storage layer for all PIM applications , Akonadi , there is not much to see yet and the major changes will first appear in KDE 4.1 .
Any help would be very appreciated , of course !
You could start with the Junior Jobs , or drop by in # kontact on freenode for more info .
kcmshell -- list
kcmshell fonts style
Additionally , configuration via KControl is not currently possible .
For now , you can use kcmshell to configure KDE instead :- gives a list of configuration modules , and - shows the config dialog with with fonts and style modules .
Eyecandy and Plasma
For those looking for eye candy , the new composite - enabled branch of KWin has been merged but the composite features are still disabled by default , and the Oxygen icons are in , but the new Oxygen widget style is still too immature to be included .
The basics of Plasma are there ( try Alt - F2 , and check out the new Run Command dialog as shown on the right ) , but most of the changes are still only in the libraries , so Kicker , the KDE 3 panel , is still present when you log in .
There is a lot too see in the games and educational applications , though , and of course many other things to explore .
The new file manager : Dolphin
At the time of this announcement one KDE 4 based LiveCD is available , appropriately called " KDE Four Live " .
It is an openSUSE based LiveCD , regularly updated complete with KDE 4 builds ( in this case Alpha1 ) .
Special thanks go to Stephan Binner for putting this one together .
If you would like a safe way to try KDE 4 without risking any of your system files , this is the way to go .
Other distributions ' LiveCDs are in preparation and will be released soon .
Additionally , distribution packages are becoming available .
Packages are ( or will be very shortly ) available for :
Others , like Debian expect packages to take a few weeks to be finished , and we expect more distributions to join this list .
The Fedora KDE team is still busy finishing Fedora 7 , and has only some basic KDE 4 library packages available .
These libraries are mainly intended for developers so they can easily work on KDE 4 applications .
But Fedora is highly committed to KDE and is expected to release the next major Fedora release ( Fedora 8 ) with KDE 4 , probably making them one of the first major distributions to include KDE 4 .
Meanwhile , thanks to the hard work of the Mandriva KDE hackers , led by Laurent Montel , Mandriva users have been able to test KDE 4 packages from Mandriva 's Cooker development tree for quite some time .
They are preparing a LiveCD with KDE 4.0 Alpha1 +
Nepomuk development for the end of May - watch dot.kde.org for details .
Mepis founder Warren is discussing a special KDE 4 LiveCD to show their support , information can be found here .
And do n't forget the people from Ark Linux , another KDE - minded distribution .
They , too are working on a KDE 4 LiveCD and packages .
Their development tree will switch to KDE 4 as soon as 2007.1 is ready , and they plan to release the 2007.2 version on the day of the KDE 4.0 release .
Michael Pyne has been working hard on the kdesvn - build script to get it into shape for Alpha1 .
It is available here .
This program is useful for building KDE from sources automatically , not just for the alpha release .
For those of you who would like to stay up to date with KDE 4 development , but do not want the hassle of manual compilation , this script comes highly recommended .
If you do n't like the scripted approach , you can snag the Alpha1 source tarballs from the KDE servers or use the techbase instructions to build and setup your environment .
This release of Alpha1 contains many new KDE technologies , including some very broken ones that will be vastly improved as the march towards 4.0 proceeds .
Most importantly though , the KDE libraries have largely stabilized , and will be entering a soft freeze later this week .
This means that the underlying core is mostly complete for 4.0 , and the focus can now shift towards the applications and workspace environment without their developers having to worry about shifting APIs .
Of course this is only a brief ( and nowhere near complete ) overview of the exciting new stuff in KDE .
We hope you enjoy the experience , like what you see , and will help us improve what you do n't like !

Story Highlights • NEW : North Korean media reportedly says nuclear suspension " temporary "
• NEW : Condoleezza Rice touts later " disablement " phase of North Korean deal
• North Korea agrees to shut down its main nuclear reactor within 60 days
• The country will receive an initial 50,000 tons of fuel oil or financial aid in return
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. officials on Tuesday defended the Bush administration 's policy shift on North Korea , which coincided with an agreement by Pyongyang to begin to close down its nuclear program .
North Korea now has 60 days to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear complex and readmit nuclear inspectors .
In return , it will get 50,000 tons of fuel oil or financial aid of an equal amount .
Once Pyongyang takes additional steps to disable its nuclear program , including taking inventory of its plutonium stockpile , it will qualify for another 950,000 tons of fuel oil or equivalent aid , according to the terms of the deal .
The aid package is worth $ 300 million .
( Watch how the deal was made )
North Korean state media reported that the agreement called only for a " temporary suspension " of Pyongyang 's nuclear program , according to wire reports .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice drew a distinction between the first 60 - day period , when she said nuclear activities will be suspended , and the later " disablement phase . "
" The disabling of these facilities is a sign that the North Koreans may , in fact , be ready to make a strategic choice , " she said at a briefing in Washington .
" I will not take it as a complete sign until we 've seen that disablement , but obviously disablement is an important step forward . "
" I am pleased with the agreements reached today at the Six Party Talks in Beijing , " President Bush said in a statement .
" These talks represent the best opportunity to use diplomacy to address North Korea 's nuclear programs .
They reflect the common commitment of the participants to a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons . "
The United States , China , South Korea , Japan and Russia have been holding talks with North Korean officials since 2002 in an effort to convince Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons program .
Not addressed in the agreement is what will happen to any nuclear weapons North Korea may have stockpiled .
Reports have suggested that Pyongyang already may have as many as a dozen nuclear bombs .
The omission marks a change from the previous statements -- including by Christopher Hill , the U.S. envoy to the six - party talks , in September 2005 -- that all elements , past and present , of North Korea 's nuclear program " will be comprehensively declared and completely , verifiably and irreversibly eliminated " for benefits to accrue .
The Bush administration halted fuel shipments agreed by the Clinton White House after North Korea said it was developing a nuclear weapons program in 2002 .
Earlier that year President Bush labeled Pyongyang part of the " axis of evil . "
Bolton : Agreement sends ' wrong signal '
John Bolton , former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , blasted the new deal Monday in an interview with CNN , saying it would only encourage other countries trying to secure nuclear weapons .
" It sends exactly the wrong signal to would - be proliferators around the world :
If you hold out long enough and wear down the State Department negotiators , eventually you get rewarded , " said Bolton , who was also involved with North Korea earlier as the State Department 's undersecretary for arms control .
" It makes the [ Bush ] administration look very weak at a time in Iraq and dealing with Iran it needs to look strong , " he said .
Hill on Tuesday defended the deal , saying it is different from the policy developed under the Clinton administration because it is a multilateral agreement .
" This is not a bilateral deal between the U.S. and North Korea , " Hill said .
" This involves six parties , with China in the share .
I think the deal here is that North Korea has made certain commitments not only to us , but to all of its neighbors . "
Bolton said the six - party deal " contradicts fundamental premises of the president 's policy he's been following for the past six years " and could have effects on U.S. relations in other hot spots .
" I 'm hoping that the president has not been fully briefed on it and still has time to reject it , " he said .
As U.N. ambassador , Bolton helped push through a U.N. resolution last year that led to economic sanctions against North Korea .
Responding to the criticism , Hill pointed out that Bolton is a private citizen and has the right to speak his mind .
Hill said he expects further criticism and emphasized that the deal is based on " initial actions " that will " begin a process aimed at complete denuclearization . "
In October 2002 , North Korea admitted it was developing a nuclear weapons program in violation of the 1994 Agreed Framework reached between the United States and North Korea .
The United States then halted fuel oil shipments to Pyongyang called for under the same agreement .
In September 2005 , North Korea committed to abandoning its nuclear program in exchange for aid and security guarantees .
Pyongyang walked away from the talks weeks later to protest a U.S. crackdown on banks suspected of helping North Korea with illegal financial activities .
This time , an administration official said : " The Koreans faced five other united members , and they realized they were standing alone . "
CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux , John Vause and Susie Xu contributed to this report .
" Each of these adversaries is capable of sparking a war in the summer , " Yadlin was quoted as saying .
[ On Monday , Al Qaida 's No. 2 Ayman Zawahiri endorsed the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip , Middle East Newsline reported .
The Al Qaida statement came after Zawahiri repeatedly criticized Hamas for tolerating Palestinian Authority cooperation with the United States . ]
Yadlin said Hamas could be planning a major attack to divert attention away from efforts by the Palestinian Authority to isolate the Gaza Strip .
He said Syria might be promoting such an attack .
Officials said Iran has direct influence over Syria , Hizbullah and Hamas .
He said Al Qaida has increasingly come under Iranian influence and was being used by Iran and Syria in such countries as Iraq , Jordan and Lebanon .
Already , military intelligence has assessed that Hamas acquired more than 50 missiles with a range of 22 kilometers .
Officials said this would allow Palestinian missile strikes on any part of Ashkelon , the largest city in southeastern Israel and which contains strategic sites .
Hamas has also deployed at least 20 SA - 7 anti-aircraft systems , officials said .
They said the missiles threaten Israeli combat helicopters and fixed - wing aircraft that conduct missions over the Gaza Strip .
On Monday , Palestinian gunners continued missile fire into Israel .
Hours earlier , the Israel Air Force struck an Islamic Jihad squad said to have been driving toward the northern Gaza Strip to launch missiles toward Israel .
One Jihad operative was killed and two others were injured .
Israeli military intelligence has assessed that Hamas was being quietly supported by neighboring Egypt .
Officials said that despite Egypt 's announced ban , Cairo has continued to allow Hamas leaders to enter the Sinai Peninsula from the Gaza Strip .
Over the weekend , officials said , a Hamas delegation led by former PA Interior Minister Said Siyyam entered Sinai .
They said the 15 - member delegation was escorted by Egyptian security forces to Cairo for a flight to Damascus , where they were scheduled to meet Hamas political bureau chief Khaled Masha'al .
On Monday , Egypt was scheduled to host a regional summit meant to support PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas .
Israel , Jordan and Abbas were expected to attend the meeting in the Sinai resort town of Sharm e-Sheik .
Photograph by Adam Levey __In April , a train built __by the French engineering firm Alstom screamed along the Ligne à Grande Vitesse , the Paris - to - Strasbourg high - speed rail system , at a record - breaking 357 miles per hour .
The whizzing run past Vendôme provided a glimpse of next - gen railway travel , and Alstom execs hope , set the company up for future contracts in emerging high - speed rail markets like China and India .
Conspicuously absent among those emerging markets : the US .
Of course , news of the achievement sparked yet another round of well - worn rants , often delivered by globe - trotters who return home after rides on slick Japanese or French trains wondering , " Where the hell is my high - speed rail ? "
It 's a question that betrays a certain naiveté about transit policy — but it 's still a good one .
If the country has a prayer of solving its traffic woes and creating a more efficient , environmentally sound infrastructure , we 'll need some first - rate , wicked - fast trains .
That the US lacks them is due neither to conspiracy nor accident .
Distances between major North American cities dwarf those in Europe .
( France 's north - south axis is barely longer than the trip from New York to Chicago . )
According to transportation geeks , high - speed rail competes with air travel only for trips under 500 miles or that take less than three hours by plane .
Chicago to St. Louis could work , but New York to Denver ?
Nope .
Gas is also cheaper here than in Europe and the Pacific Rim .
That 's an incentive to drive the short hops instead of taking the train .
And an even greater incentive :
Our roads are almost universally awesome .
" We 've chosen to sink our transportation investments into the automobile , " says planning guru Robert Cervero of UC Berkeley .
No news flash there .
But technology and economics may be shifting to a point where regional high - speed rail is plausible .
Public transit in general is looking better and better to local governments .
New York City approved a new subway line , San Francisco is considering an additional trolley route , and Los Angeles might extend its subway to the beach via parts of town people actually want to go .
The same holds for intercity travel .
Illinois and Wisconsin recently invested in improved rail service between Chicago and Milwaukee .
Ridership spiked .
" If you make this available , people will recognize how valuable it is for our urban environments , " says Dennis Minichello , president of the Midwest High - Speed Rail Association .
Put another way :
If you build it , they will ride .
New technology also helps .
Lighter materials , improved acceleration , and enhanced communications all translate to faster travel times and lower construction and operating costs .
Until recently , the signaling systems that keep trains on course and prevent collisions were installed in the ground along the entire route .
That equipment has now been replaced by cheaper satellite and wireless technologies .
And there 's the critical issue of tilting :
Most high - speed trains ride the same rails as standard passenger and freight lines .
These tracks tend to be curvy ; high speed demands long straightaways .
But if the trains are designed to lean inward against curves to counteract centrifugal force , they can travel faster on existing infrastructure — a major cost saver .
It works in Spain , and on Amtrak 's flawed but popular Acela line in the Northeast Corridor .
To really make a system work , the US needs to build dedicated high - speed tracks .
" But then that costs more , and you 're talking about expropriating land , " one industry insider says .
Eminent domain is an explosive topic in the property - rights - obsessed US .
On the other hand , we did it for the Interstate Highway System .
Back then , it was for the benefit of national security ; Eisenhower argued that the roads might be needed to move troops .
But today we know that pollution , global warming , and dependence on Middle East oil are issues of national security , too .
The big test for US high - speed rail is now under way in California , and the hurdle is political , not technical .
" Lassitude is our enemy , " says Quentin Kopp , chair of the California High - Speed Rail Authority .
He 's leading the campaign for a Sacramento - to - San Diego high - speed train ( San Francisco to Los Angeles in two and a half hours ! ) .
A $ 10 billion bond measure is slated for the 2008 ballot , but it 's hardly a sure bet .
Despite his iridescent - green glow , governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has not endorsed the bond .
But even if he comes around , rail riders should keep the champagne corked .
In the 1990s , Texas officials pushed for high - speed rail connecting Dallas , Houston , and San Antonio , only to be squashed by a lobbying push from Southwest Airlines .
This fast train thing could work , if enough people would just get on board .

Jon Stewart struggles to find ' experts ' in Bush administration
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 24 , 2007 Print This Email This
" President Bush has been adamant that on matters of Iraq , he will defer to the wisdom of his generals , " said Jon Stewart on Monday 's Daily Show , prior to playing a brief soundbite of Bush declaring that he 's " not an expert . "
" No .
No , he 's not , " commented Stewart , before serving up examples of Bush mentioning some of the many things he 's not an expert in .
" I 've got experts in my government , however , " said Bush in another clip , to which Stewart responded with clips of Secretary Rumsfeld saying , " I 'm not an expert , " and Secretary Gates saying , " I 'm no expert on Iraq , " plus a string of similar clips from other Bush appointees .
The following video is from Comedy Central 's Daily Show broadcast on July 23 .
The Battle of Britain The Battle of France is over .
The Battle of Britain is about to begin .
Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization …
The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us .
Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war …
Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty , and so bear ourselves that , if the British Empire and its Commonwealth lasts for a thousand years , men will still say , ' This was their finest hour ' .
Winston Churchill , speaking in the House of Common ( 11 June 1940 .
Links Map ( bitmap ) The ' HistoryLearning ' site - basic info The ' Battle of Britain ' site - very detailed This alternative history site argues that Operation Sealion was doomed to fail Powerpoint : • by Blake Harrison ppt. swf .
YouTube : Contemporary film footage Need to Know account Battle of Britain - 15 Sept 1940 ; clip from the 1969 movie And also : - Spitfire SpitCrazy - good collection Hurricane Could Britain have repulsed a Nazi invasion in September 1940 ?
Hitler wanted to invade Britain .
He called his plan ‘ Operation Sealion ’ .
He had detailed plans of who would rule Britain after it was conquered .
His propaganda machine had already made a newsreel of the ‘ victorious ’ German soldiers and the British they had ‘ captured ’ .
But Britain was defended by the Royal Navy , which was much stronger than the German Navy .
If Hitler was going to mount an invasion of Britain , he would have to find a way to defend his invasion barges from attack .
The German airforce – the Luftwaffe – could defend the invasion , but , to do that , Hitler would first have to knock out the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) .
That is how the Battle of Britain came about .
The Battle of Britain was really the first part of Hitler ’s invasion of Britain .
Four developments laid the foundations of Britain ’s survival : Firstly , Britain had built a series of radar stations ( July 1935 ) .
British radar was superior because , not only could it tell where the enemy planes were coming from , but it had a way to telling the fighters so that they could go and attack them .
Secondly , in July 1937 , Air Chief Marshall Dowding was appointed Commander - in - Chief of Fighter Command .
He was a brilliant commander who – on a small budget – was able to reorganise the RAF into four Groups , each divided into a number of sectors ( each with a main sector airfield with a number of supporting airfields ) .
Thirdly , the British developed two brilliant planes – the Hurricane ( Nov 1935 ) which was reliable and was used to shoot down the Luftwaffe bombers ; and the Spitfire ( March 1936 ) , the fastest plane in the world , which was used to destroy the Nazi fighters which protected the bombers .
Fourthly , in May 1940 , Churchill put Lord Beaverbrook ( owner of the Daily Express ) in charge of aircraft production .
He ran one appeal for aluminium – ‘ We will turn your pots and pans into Spitfires and Hurricanes ’ – and another scheme where towns , groups or individuals could ‘ buy ’ a Spitfire ( for £ 5000 ) and send it off the fight the Nazis .
He also set up a Civilian Repair Organisation , which made new planes from the left - over pieces of planes which had been shot down .
Beaverbrook cut through government red tape , and increased the production by 250 % ; in 1940 , British factories produced 4,283 fighters , compared to Germany ’s 3,000 .
The Battle of Britain The Battle of Britain started officially on 10 June 1940 , when the Luftwaffe attacked a convoy of ships off Dover .
But the real air war started on 12 August ( when the Luftwaffe attacked the RAF ) , and lasted until 31 October .
At first the Luftwaffe attacked radar stations and airfields .
Although the Luftwaffe lost more planes than the RAF , by the 31 August the RAF was at its last gasp – in the previous fortnight the RAF had lost 295 planes destroyed and 170 damaged , 103 pilots killed and 128 wounded .
Flying five or more ‘ sorties ’ a day , the young British fighter pilots ( nicknamed ‘ Dowding ’s chicks ’ ) were becoming exhausted ; more importantly , the RAF was not training new pilots as fast the pilots were being killed .
The weekend 30 - 31 August was the worst weekend of the battle for the RAF , with 65 fighters destroyed and 6 of the seven sector stations in the vital south - east Group out of action .
Just as Fighter Command was about to collapse , however , a miracle happened .
On 24 August , by accident , some Luftwaffe bombers had dropped their bombs on London .
The next few nights , the RAF replied by bombing Berlin .
Hitler was angry .
On 2 September he ordered his bombers to attack London .
On 7 September the Nazi bombing raid was so huge that a false alarm went round the south - east of England : code - word ‘ Cromwell ’ – invasion imminent .
Church bells rang and the Home Guard mobilised .
It was not known at the time but one section of coast identified by the Nazis as a landing ground was defended by a Home Guard platoon with just one machine - gun !
Hitler ’s decision to stop attacking the RAF gave it time to recover .
On 15 September , the Luftwaffe came by day in huge numbers .
It expected to sweep the RAF from the skies .
But the RAF fought them off .
At one point every British plane was in the sky – soon , some would have to come in to refuel and there were no reserves to protect them .
But the Luftwaffe , too , was at the limit and – just in time – it turned back .
15 September is celebrated as ‘ Battle of Britain day ’ .
Source B Headline from 16 Sept .
In fact , only about 69 enemy planes were destroyed .
Does this mean that this newspaper is a useless source to historians ?
In the meantime , the RAF had been bombing the Nazi invasion fleet .
On 17 September , Hitler ordered the postponement of Operation Sealion .
Instead , the Luftwaffe concentrated on night - bombing London ( the ‘ blitz ’ ) .
In all , the RAF lost 1,173 planes and 510 pilots and gunners killed in the Battle of Britain .
The Luftwaffe lost 1,733 planes and 3,368 airmen killed or captured .
If the Luftwaffe had succeeded , Britain would have been invaded and conquered .
But the RAF held out , and Britain survived .

I have been contacted by a student on the History Help forum who told me that ' the British pilots were joined by many pilots from Poland , the Czech republic , Canada or New Zealand .
12 % of all German planes destroyed in the Battle of Britain were destroyed by Polish pilots .
Also , foreign pilots helped modify the way that British pilots were flying ; the British were flying in tight formations which meant that they were spending more time on looking at themselves in order not to collide rather than searching the sky for enemies . '

世の中には、「強い人」から見れば何とも無能で頼りない「弱い人」が圧倒的に多いのではなかろうか。
それは教育のシステムが悪いとか本人の努力が足りないとかいった問題ではない。現代の過度な競争に適さぬ人や、高度なＩＴを苦手とする人が、もともと社会には多数存在しているということである。
そもそも「強者」といえども、その境遇は本人の努力だけでなったものではないだろう。激務に耐えられる強健な体や頭脳を持って生まれ、その後も家庭・教育・職場環境などに恵まれるという二重の幸運によりもたらされた境遇ではなかったか。
反面、そうした幸運を授からなかった人達は、問題の多い境遇の中で乏しい力をふりしぼり、この競争至上社会を生きていかねばならない。「弱者」とは、いまや児童・障害者・老人といった福祉法に記されている者だけではない。能力以上の労働を強いられ、疲弊している一般の人たちも何らかの支援を必要とする福祉対象者なのである。
多くの生徒達の意欲や根気は乏しく、学力も低い。
この若者たちを支え、育んでくれる「ゆとりある職場」をつくっていかないと、彼らが被社会的・反社会的な人間の層を形成し、それはどんどん広がっていくだろう。
高齢者が増えているのに、支えていくべき若者が支えられる側に回ってしまっているこの異常事態こそ国家の最大の危機なのだ。
「 私はもう疲れました。お金よりも、豊かな人間関係の楽しめる落ち着いた生活がしたいです。お金が欲しい人はどうぞ勝手に競争してください」
今朝の朝日新聞の 「私の視点」欄に、介護福祉士専門学校非常勤講師の仲田征夫さんという方が投稿されていたものを読んで、同感する部分が多かったので、一部転載しておきます。（「私の声」には、為になる投稿が多いのに、朝日コムに掲載されないのがとても残念です。）これは、生物学的にみてもまったくその通りで、人間に限らず、どんな動物や植物でもたくさんの子孫が生まれた時には、かならずいろいろな性質を持った多様な個体が生まれるようになっています。そうなっていない種は、遅かれ早かれ絶滅すると考えられていますので、今生きている生物の子孫は基本的に多様な子供を生むようになっているのだと思います。そうした多様な人間の存在を、ついつい忘れがちになってしまうのが、今の競争社会です。最近は、このあたりの議論をするとすぐに「なまけもの」だとか、「自己責任」だとかという声が出てきますが、そもそも「できない人間」を叱咤激励しても無理だということが、かなりのケースであるのではないでしょうか。最後に書いてある、生徒の悲鳴は、かなりの若者に共有されている感覚なのではないでしょうか。
﻿占いでテレビの情報番組でやっていたり、新聞や雑誌に掲載されたり、インターネットでもあるなど、本当に身近です。
本格的に占い師にみてもらうのも、今だと電話占いで、自宅にいてもできます。
そんな占い師にみてもらうなら、当たる人に頼みたいと思いませんか。
テレビに出る占い師たち
占い師もテレビやマスコミに出るようになりました。しかも人気が出ると、その占い師メインの番組も放送されたり、コメンテーターとしてよく見かけるようになります。
占い師もテレビに出る機会は昔よりもグッと増えています。
それだけだテレビに出るのですから、やはり当たる確率と言えば高いようです。占いもいろいろな人のデータを元にしているとも言われています。テレビに出るような占い師だと、たくさんの人を鑑定しています。経験に基づくことで適切なアドバイスも出せるのです。また、時には厳しい言葉では、相談者に寄り添う占いができるので、人も集まりやすいのです。
また、こうした占い師はたくさんのジャンルを扱うことができますが、やはり得意なジャンルも持っています。多くの人はそれを聞き付けて相談しますから、やはり当たりやすくなります。
電話占いサイトにも登場している
こうしたテレビやマスコミにでるような占い師ももともと店舗に出ていることが多かったです。
ところがここ最近では、店舗から電話占いへとシフトする占い師も増えてきました。サイトがスカウトするケースもありますし、自ら異動というようなケースもあります。
電話占いなんてと思うかもしれませんが、大手の電話占いサイトを見てみると、こうしたテレビやマスコミに出た占い師が結構います。店舗だと行列で並んだり、予約とれないとあっても、電話占いだと予約がとりやすかったり、その日にすぐに繋がるなんてケースもあります。
わざわざ遠くまで行かなくても、どこからでも、テレビに出るような占い師に相談できるのも大きなメリットと言えます。
霊感など変わった占いも多い
占いと聞くと、占星術や四柱推名、タロットや姓名判断というのを想像するでしょう。ところが電話占いだとさらに霊感やスピリチュアル、ヒーリング、守護霊、霊視といった不思議な占いも出てきます。これらにタロットなどを組み合わせるといった占い方法も出てきました。
こうした占いができる人は、もともとそうした経験や力を幼い頃から持っているとよくプロフィールにあります。
そうしたことと占いの知識などをいかして、人の運勢などを占うのですから、当たる確率は高くなってくるでしょう。
当たるためには相談者側も協力が
このように占い師自身は力を持っていても、当たらないケースもあります。その原因の１つに相談のやり方もあるかもしれません。
たとえば、恋愛相談だと相手がいますが、その相手の誕生日や性格をうまく伝えられないと、占いの結果も変わってきます。あと相談のポイント、何を知りたいか、どうしたいかも曖昧だとなかなかうまく結果が出てこない、伝えられないといったことにもなります。
特に電話占いだと、話しているので対面のような気もしますが、実際の対面ではないので表情もつかめず言葉でしかきちんと伝えられません。ニュアンスが伝わりにくいです。
なので当たるかどうかは、相談者にも掛かってきているのです。
自分にあった占い師を探そう
テレビに出るようだと、当たる確率はかなり高いですが、相談しやすい、優しい、アドバイスも分かりやすい、鑑定料金があっているなど、自分にあっている占い師かをチェックするといいです。
自分に合う占い師だと、自然と当たる確率も上がってくるものです。

Some things just get lost in translation .
That 's my best explanation for the following head - scratcher , used widely across Russia in 1968 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Army .
( Commenter Zarv from Englishrussia took a guess : " It 's an ancient Russian tradition to kiss respected people , best friends three times in lips in gratitude . "
I 'll have to side with Zarv. )
More wacky Russian stamps after the jump !
It 's a tank with its treads being blown off , obviously WWII era .
Where I come from , we have birds and trees on our stamps .
( Maybe stamps like this are just designed to accompany really exciting letters . )
A mortar being fired from a trench .
I think if more American stamps were like this , little boys would collect stamps instead of action figures .
L.L. Zamenhof , the inventor of Esperanto , " the most successful and widely - spoken constructed language in the world . "
That being said , the number of native Esperanto speakers in the world numbers at most in the thousands , and is as few as 200 .
Yet another poofy - haired Russian intellectual , probably Marx or Lenin or ... wait a minute ... nope , that 's Mark Twain , featured in a stamp dating from the height of the Cold War , no less .
Go figure .
The idea of offline web applications is getting an undue amount of attention .
Which is bizarre when you look at how availability of connectivity is ever increasing .
EVDO cards , city - wide wifis , iPhones , Blackberry ’s .
There are so many ways to get online these days that the excitement for offline is truly puzzling .
Until you consider the one place that is still largely an island of missing connectivity :
The plane !
But planes are not a very common hang - out spot for most people .
The two major groups of people who are on a plane often enough to care and have an interest in web applications are traveling salesmen and techies who go to too many conferences .
I used to somewhat belong to latter group .
And I too liked the idea of having access to my web applications at 30,000 feet .
Then it actually happened .
SAS offered connectivity on their transatlantic flights between Copenhagen and Chicago .
Nirvana , eh ?
Hell no .
Access to my web applications meant that the one time where I ’d actually have serenity to read a book or listen to a podcast or just chill out got sucked into looking just like any other day at the office .
Ironically , SAS killed the internet access on their transatlantic flights this January because nobody was using it .
( Well , except for me saying “ look , I ’m online at 30,000 feet !! ” in a chat room ) .
And I think that ’s a good indicator for offline web applications .
The idea is cool , but the reality is that it just does n’t matter .
You do n’t need access to all your stuff all the time .
We ’re already overloaded with connectivity .
Cherish the few remaining strongholds for offlineliness !
( Yes , yes , I ’m sure there exists other niches and pockets of dark holes where if only we had access to the GlobalMegaCorpSocialY application , the world would be a better place .
I ’m certainly not going to deny that .
Just that for most people , most of the time , it could n’t matter less . )

News About Ron Paul and His Presidential Campaign
At this time last year , the Pentagon was hinting that troop levels in Iraq would be reduced .
Then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that two combat brigades scheduled for combat tours would not be deployed to Iraq .
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Peter Pace , proclaimed , " If things go the way we expect them to , as more Iraqi units stand up , we ’ll be able to bring our troops down and turn over that territory to the Iraqis . "
But that was then and this is now .
Claiming that he is " not going to be rushed into making a difficult decision , " President Bush will not announce what his " new way forward " in Iraq will be until January .
More than likely that ’s because the White House knows that they do n’t have any holiday happy talk about bringing troops home to spread good cheer among soldiers and their families .
In fact , it ’s likely to be just the opposite : a surge in U.S. troops .
President Bush has announced that he intends to increase the size of the U.S. military to fight the war on terrorism , which is presumably a prelude to announcing a troop increase in Iraq .
Although President Bush insists that no decisions have yet been made , unnamed U.S. officials are saying that he will likely approve pouring 30,000 or more additional troops into Iraq , which is in line with the " go long " option recommended by a military study commissioned by Gen.
Pace .
One indication that the plan is to beef up the force is that  according to an unnamed Defense Department official  the 2nd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division , comprised of about 3,500 troops , will be deployed in Iraq early next year .
( For the record , nearly a year ago , I wrote :
" I hate to be a cynic and will gladly be proven wrong ( indeed , I actually hope to be ) , but do n’t be surprised if  in a feat of legerdemain ( or perhaps more appropriately , bait and switch )  there are 100,000 or more U.S. troops still in Iraq a year from now . "
Currently , there are something like 140,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq , and the odds are that the number will go even higher in the very near future .
The wonder is n’t that I was right , but that those who have been so disastrously wrong have been so richly rewarded .
Former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , who was the Pentagon ’s biggest cheerleader for taking the country to war in Iraq , is now the president of the World Bank .
Former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , who was a champion for Iraqi con artist Ahmed Chalabi , is visiting professor and " distinguished practitioner in national security policy " at Georgetown University .
Bill Kristol , the don of the neoconservative Weekly Standard , has been named a columnist for Time magazine .
And Thomas Friedman  who led the liberal hawk charge into Iraq , often alongside Bill Kristol  is still a fixture on the pages of the New York Times .
If any of these people were your stockbroker who told you to bet the ranch on Enron in late 2001 , would you still be letting them give you financial advice ? )
Piling onto the bad news that the administration is likely to throw more troops into the fray is the Pentagon ’s most recent " Measuring Security and Stability in Iraq " quarterly report to Congress .
According to the report , weekly attacks against U.S. and Iraqi forces and Iraqi civilians are averaging nearly 1,000 per week .
Civilian casualties are averaging more than 90 a day .
And Shi’ite militias are now deemed more dangerous than al - Qaeda in Iraq .
Despite the grim reality of increased violence and all the post - midterm elections talk of changing course in Iraq , the administration seems intent on staying the course ( which should be more than apparent when the president says he is " committed to a strategic goal of a free Iraq that is democratic , that can govern itself , defend itself , and sustain itself " ) .
And rather than providing a roadmap for the way out of Iraq , the Iraq Study Group Report is an enabler for doing more of the same .
The so - called " internal approach " recommended by the Iraq Study Group is for the Iraqis to
" accelerate assuming responsibility for Iraqi security by increasing the number and quality of Iraqi Army brigades .
While this process is under way , and to facilitate it , the United States should significantly increase the number of U.S. military personnel , including combat troops , imbedded in and supporting Iraqi Army units .
As these actions proceed , U.S. combat forces could begin to move out of Iraq . "
But this is essentially no different than the current policy of training the Iraqis ( which is clearly not working , so it ’s hard to see how accelerating the process will lead to success ) so that , as President Bush has said , " as the Iraqis stand up , we will stand down . "
And the Iraq Study Group ’s " external approach " recommendation 
" Given the ability of Iran and Syria to influence events within Iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in Iraq , the United States should try to engage them constructively "  is even more baffling .
Even if one were willing to suspend disbelief that the administration would be willing to talk to the Iranians and Syrians and that they would be willing to help , their version of helping would likely be quite different from how we would like them to help .
While the United States is interested in putting an end to the violence in Iraq , Syria and Iran may be more interested in ensuring that the violence does not spill over Iraq ’s borders into their respective countries ( which would be entirely consistent with how countries in the Middle East have tended to view and deal with instability ) .
The Iraq Study Group also echoed the Bush administration ’s concerns of Iran and Syria fueling the insurgency : " Iran should stem the flow of arms and training to Iraq , " and " Syria should control its border with Iraq to stem the flow of funding , insurgents , and terrorists in and out of Iraq . "
But even though the report acknowledged that the Saudis were also part of the problem  " funding for the Sunni insurgency comes from private individuals within Saudi Arabia "  there was no recommendation to pressure the ruling monarchy in Riyadh ( which vehemently denies that any money is being sent to fund the Iraqi insurgency ) as there was for the regimes in Tehran and Damascus .
Since it ’s likely that at least a few of the " private individuals " are some of the 6,000 members of the Saudi royal family , what ’s wrong with that picture ?
When are we going to understand that the primary Saudi interest is to preserve the royal family , even if it comes at the expense of U.S. interests ?
Ultimately , the real problem with the Iraq Study Group  and with much of the foreign policy and national security establishment  is that it was looking for a way to achieve success in Iraq : " There is no path that can guarantee success , but the prospects can be improved . "
However , the real issue is n’t success , but avoiding catastrophic failure .
So instead of 150 pages and 79 recommendations , just one would have done :
Get out , now .

The Paradox of Military Technology
Max Boot
While various setbacks in the war on terror underscore the limits of American power , it is important not to lose sight of the bigger picture : we live in the age of American supremacy .
Part of the explanation for U.S. dominance surely lies in America ’s economic strength .
But Europe and Japan are similarly wealthy , yet their global sway lags far behind .
What they lack is America ’s superior military capabilities .
In the words of Gregg Easterbrook : “ The American military is now the strongest the world has ever known , both in absolute terms and relative to other nations ; stronger than the Wehrmacht in 1940 , stronger than the legions at the height of Roman power . ”
Although the dominance of U.S. forces can still be challenged when they come into close contact with the enemy on his home turf , they are undisputed masters of the “ commons ” ( sea , air , and space ) , which allows them to project power anywhere in the world at short notice .
Information technology is central to American military dominance .
Not all of the changes wrought by the information age are obvious at first glance , because the basic military systems of the early twenty - first century look roughly similar to their predecessors of the second industrial age — tanks , planes , aircraft carriers , missiles .
Military analyst Michael O’Hanlon notes that “ basic propulsion systems and designs for aircraft , ships , and internal - combustion vehicles are changing much more gradually than in the early twentieth - century , when two of those three technologies had only recently been invented . ”
The average speed of a U.S. Navy destroyer has not increased in the past 100 years .
The U.S. Air Force continues to rely on B - 52H bombers last built in 1962 .
And the Marine Corps still uses helicopters that flew in the Vietnam War .
But since the mid-1970s , the communications , targeting , surveillance , and ordnance technologies that make such “ legacy ” systems considerably more potent have been changing with great rapidity — and to America ’s great advantage .
Yet in this period of American hegemony , Americans continue to feel vulnerable .
As we learned on September 11 , and continue learning on the battlefields of Iraq , the most advanced weapons systems and most sophisticated information technology are hardly a perfect shield against other kinds of destructive power .
The paradox of our age is that modern technology is both the great separator and the great equalizer in military affairs : Technological supremacy separates America from the rest of the world , and yet modern technology leaves America vulnerable to vicious groups and gangs armed with AK47s , car bombs , or portable WMDs .
To understand the future of warfare , we need to understand both sides of this paradox : specifically , how information technology has increased America ’s conventional military supremacy ( in land , sea , air , and space ) , and how this military edge may be subverted by determined radicals armed with new technologies of death .
Land Warfare
Advanced armies are still structured , as they have been since the 1940s , around armored forces complemented by light infantry troops who move by vehicle , truck , and aircraft .
The best tank in the world is probably the American Abrams ( of which the U.S. has 9,000 ) but the British Challenger II , the German Leopard II , the Israeli Merkava Mk. 4 , and the Russian T - 80 and T - 90 come within striking distance .
All modern tanks have stabilized turrets , night - vision capabilities , laser range - finders , and targeting computers that allow them to fight in conditions — on the move or in the dark — that would have stymied earlier models .
In addition , composite or reactive armor offers far more protection than in years past , and main guns firing depleted - uranium rounds have far more penetrating power .
While armored vehicles have improved over the years , so have anti-armor weapons .
These range from heavy missiles fired from vehicles or aircraft ( such as the U.S. Hellfire and Russian Ataka - V ) to hand - held versions ( such as the U.S. Javelin , the Franco - German Milan , and the Russian Kornet ) .
In addition , even the most advanced tanks can be disabled by other tanks , massive mines , aerial bombs , or artillery shells .
The full impact of advances in anti-armor technology has not yet become apparent because most of the forces that have fought modern tanks in recent years — Iraqis , Palestinians , Chechens — have not possessed the latest defensive weapons .
But the U.S. success in wiping out Iraqi tanks from stand - off ranges suggests that , in the constant struggle between offense and defense , the advantage may have shifted against heavy armor .
The Israelis got a taste of what the modern era has in store when , in August 2006 , their tanks and troops ran into a blizzard of advanced anti-tank rockets during their attacks on Hezbollah ’s strongholds in southern Lebanon .
The U.S. Army is responding to these changes by budgeting at least $ 124 billion — and possibly a great deal more — to develop a Future Combat System that will replace much of its current armored force with a family of lighter vehicles , manned and unmanned , with stealth designs that will make them harder to detect and hybrid- electric engines that will lessen their fuel requirements .
( One of the chief disadvantages of the gas - guzzling Abrams is its heavy dependence on vulnerable supply lines . )
Future vehicles will feature advanced composite armor designed to deliver more protection than current models for the same amount of weight , but they will rely for protection less on armor and more on locating and destroying the enemy before they are attacked .
Critics believe this places too much faith in “ perfect situational awareness , ” and that these vehicles will not be of much use against guerrillas who can strike with no warning .
As usual , the infantryman ’s tools have changed least of all .
A modern soldier has better protection than his forefathers if he wears Kevlar body armor , but his firepower — which comes primarily from a handheld assault rifle like the M - 16 or AK - 47 and from a variety of crew - served mortars and machine guns — does not vary significantly from that of a G.I. or Tommy in World War II .
Electronic guns that are capable of spitting out a million rounds a minute have been developed , and might permit a soldier to stop an incoming rocket - propelled grenade with a solid wall of lead .
But such weapons are years away from being fielded .
Unfortunately for Western soldiers , the proliferation of small arms can put even the most primitive foes on an almost equal footing with the representatives of the most advanced militaries .
There are 250 million military and police small arms knocking around the world , and more are being manufactured all the time by at least 1,249 suppliers in 90 countries .
The salvation of information age infantry , at least when they are conducting conventional operations , is their ability to use a wireless communications device to call in supporting fire on exact coordinates .
It is doubtful that any military force will again enjoy the preponderance of power of General H. H. Kitchener at Omdurman , but Americans dropping Joint Direct Attack Munitions ( JDAMs ) on Afghan tribesmen armed with Kalashnikovs — or even on Iraqi soldiers with outdated T - 72 tanks — came close .
The American edge decreases considerably , however , when its troops have to deploy for peacekeeping or counterinsurgency operations which leave them exposed to low - tech ambushes .
“ With the possible exceptions of night - vision devices , Global Positioning Systems , and shoulder - fired missiles , ” writes retired Major General Robert Scales , a former commander of the Army War College , “ there is no appreciable technological advantage for an American infantryman when fighting the close battle against even the poorest , most primitive enemy . ”
Naval Warfare
Navies remain divided , as they have been since the dawn of the second industrial age , into aircraft carriers , submarines , and surface ships .
The major difference is that blue - water naval competition has disappeared after more than 500 years .
No one even tries to challenge the U.S. Navy anymore on the high seas .
Virtually every other navy in the world is little more than a coastal patrol force .
The U.S. has 12 aircraft carriers , nine of them Nimitz - class , nuclear - powered supercarriers that can carry more than 70 high - performance aircraft such as the F / A - 18 Super Hornet .
A tenth supercarrier is in the works .
No one else has a single one .
France has the world ’s only other nuclear - powered aircraft carrier , the Charles de Gaulle , but it is half the size of the Nimitz .
Russia has one aircraft carrier , the Admiral Kuznetsov , that rarely leaves port , and it has sold another one , the Admiral Gorshkov , to India .
Britain has three small Invincible - class aircraft carriers that are used only for helicopters and vertical - takeoff Harrier jets .
France , Italy , Spain , Japan , and South Korea have similar helicopter carriers in the works .
These ships are comparable to the U.S. Navy ’s 12 amphibious assault ships , which transport helicopters , jump jets , and Marines .
Whenever they leave port , U.S. capital ships are surrounded by surface and submarine escorts .
Twenty - four Ticonderoga - class cruisers and 45 ( and counting ) Arleigh Burke - class destroyers come equipped with Aegis phased - array radar which can track up to 900 targets in a 300 - mile radius .
These surface combatants can also operate on their own or in conjunction with smaller vessels such as frigates and minesweepers .
In World War II , ships that did n’t carry aircraft were limited to firing torpedoes or heavy guns with a range of less than 30 miles .
Starting in the 1960s some submarines were equipped with intercontinental range ballistic missiles , but their targeting was so imprecise that it made no sense to equip them with conventional warheads .
Ballistic - missile subs became a mainstay of nuclear deterrence .
The development of accurate cruise missiles starting in the 1970s allowed submarines and surface combatants to hit land targets hundreds of miles away with conventional ordnance .
Improvements in torpedo design , including the development of rocket - propelled supercavitating torpedoes , also allow submarines to do more damage in their traditional anti-ship role .
The U.S. has the world ’s largest fleet of nuclear - powered attack submarines ( 54 ) and nuclear - powered ballistic - missile subs ( 16 ) .
Russia comes in second with 37 attack submarines and 14 ballistic missile subs .
Britain has 15 nuclear - powered submarines , followed by France with 10 , and China with six .
Not only are U.S. submarines more numerous , they are also more advanced .
The most sophisticated are three 1990s - vintage Seawolfs described by one defense analyst as “ the fastest , quietest , and most heavily armed undersea vessels ever built . ”
Because of the growing power of each of its vessels and the lack of competitors , the U.S. Navy has consolidated its high seas hegemony even while its fleet has shrunk from almost 500 ships in the 1980s to fewer than 300 in the early years of the twenty - first century .
The potency of U.S. naval vessels is increased by linking together sensors and weapons systems with a tactical computer network known as FORCEnet .
While the U.S. Navy probably will remain unchallenged in blue waters , it faces greater threats as it gets closer to shore .
Here water currents , thermal layers , and various obstacles can interfere with even the most advanced sensors , and a variety of defensive weapons systems lurk in wait .
More than 75,000 anti-ship missiles are owned by 70 countries .
A few are ballistic , but most are of the cruise - missile variety .
Their potency was proved in 1987 when French - made Exocets fired by an Iraqi aircraft crippled the frigate USS Stark , killing 37 sailors .
Earlier , Argentina used Exocets to sink two British ships during the 1982 Falklands War .
Newer anti-ship cruise missiles such as the Russian - made Yakhont , Sunburn , and Uran are even deadlier because they have faster speeds , greater stealth capabilities , and more accurate , GPS - enhanced targeting .
Russia is selling these missiles to customers abroad and some nations like China are developing their own versions .
Israel suffered the consequences during its recent Lebanon war when an Iranian - provided C- 802 cruise missile crippled one of its warships off the coast of Lebanon .
U.S. warships have sophisticated defensive systems to guard against air attack : Incoming missiles can be deflected by electronic countermeasures , flares , or chaff , or destroyed by naval aircraft , sea - to - air Standard missiles , or , as a last resort , by rapid - fire , radar - guided Phalanx guns .
But , like the Stark , a warship could be caught by surprise or overwhelmed by a flurry of missiles coming from different directions .
Even more worrisome from an American viewpoint is the fact that transport ships and fuel tankers which have to replenish a fleet at sea have no protection when they are outside the defensive range of a battle group .
They are as vulnerable as supply convoys on the roads of Iraq .
Because a supercarrier has only about a three - day stockpile of JP - 5 jet fuel ( 6,500 barrels a day are needed during combat operations ) , the most powerful warship in history could be rendered useless if its fuel tankers were sunk .
The threat to shipping , civil and military , is increased by diesel submarines .
The latest diesel submarines have ultra -quiet electric engines that make them hard to detect with sonar , and they are much cheaper to buy or produce than a nuclear - powered submarine .
Russia has exported Kilo- class diesel - electric subs to China , India , Iran , and Algeria , among others .
China is producing its own Song - class diesel submarines in a bid to challenge U.S. naval hegemony using the same strategy that Germany , with its U - boats , once used to challenge British dominion of the waves .
U.S. antisubmarine defenses are quite sophisticated , especially in open waters , but even American sensors can have trouble tracking quiet diesel subs in noisy coastal waters .
Mines , which can be scattered by submarines or other vessels , represent another major threat to shipping .
More than 300 different varieties are available on the world market .
They can be triggered by changes in magnetic fields , acoustic levels , seismic pressure , or other factors .
Some come equipped with microelectronics that allow them to distinguish between different types of ships , while others have small motors that allow them to move around .
This makes it difficult to certify that a shipping channel is free of mines — it may have been safe an hour ago , but not any more .
Demining technology has lagged behind ; the U.S. Navy , for one , has never placed much emphasis on lowly minesweepers .
It has paid a price for this neglect .
In 1987 , during operations to prevent Iran from closing the Persian Gulf , an Iranian mine of World War I design nearly sank the frigate USS Samuel Roberts .
Four years later , in the Gulf War , the cruiser USS Princeton and the amphibious landing ship USS Tripoli were nearly blasted apart by Iraqi mines .
And even a cheap motorboat packed with explosives can pose a significant threat to a modern warship .
The USS Cole , an Arleigh Burke - class destroyer , was badly damaged in such a terrorist attack in 2000 .
All of these threats could be largely negated if U.S. fleets were to stay far out at sea , but they have to approach fairly close to land to launch aircraft or missiles with operational ranges of only a few hundred miles .
Moreover , the places where the U.S. Navy is likely to fight in the future are dangerously narrow .
The Persian Gulf is only 30 miles wide at its narrowest point , the Taiwan Strait only 100 miles wide .
To maintain its dominance , the U.S. Navy regularly updates the electronics and weapons aboard its warships even as the hulls and propulsion systems remain unchanged .
It also plans to build a variety of unmanned vessels along with a CVN - 21 aircraft carrier to replace the Nimitz - class , a Zumwalt - class DD ( X ) destroyer to replace Oliver Hazard Perry - class frigates and Spruance - class destroyers , a CG ( X ) cruiser to replace the Ticonderoga - class cruisers , and a smaller and speedier Littoral Combat Ship with no direct parallel in today ’s fleet that would focus on clearing mines , hunting submarines , and fighting terrorists in coastal waters .
All of these new vessels will have improved defenses and information - processing tools as well as “ plug and play ” capacity that will allow them to be quickly reconfigured for different missions .
They will also incorporate composite materials , stealthier designs , and electric propulsion to make them harder to detect , though an aircraft carrier with a 4.5 - acre flight deck can never exactly hide .
Whether all of these warships are truly needed , given the U.S. Navy ’s already substantial lead over all competitors , remains an open question .
A program to develop giant sea bases — perhaps akin to offshore oil - platforms — that would allow American ground and air forces to operate overseas might be of greater use , given the growing difficulty the U.S. has had in gaining basing and overflight rights from other countries .
But what seems clear , on sea as on land , is that the development of new weapons systems will continue to augment American supremacy while leaving American military forces vulnerable to various “ low - tech ” attacks .
Aerial Warfare
Fighters such as the American F - 15 and the Russian MiG - 29 were designed in the 1970s for air - to - air combat , but this has become almost as rare as ship - to - ship actions .
Since the Israelis destroyed much of the Syrian air force in 1982 , and the U.S. and its allies made similarly quick work of the Iraqi air force in 1991 , few if any aircraft have been willing to challenge top - of - the - line Western militaries .
( The U.S. Air Force has n’t produced an ace — an airman with at least five aerial kills — since 1972 . )
That may change with the sale to China of the Russian - built Sukhoi Su-30 , whose performance characteristics are said to exceed those of the F - 15C , but the F / A - 22 Raptor , the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , and the Eurofighter should restore the Western edge .
The odds of future aerial dogfights , however , still remain slim .
Modern surface - to - air missiles pose a more immediate danger , because they are cheaper and easier to operate .
The U.S. and its allies have developed effective methods of neutralizing most existing air defenses .
In addition to jammers , radar - seeking missiles , and decoys , the U.S. employs stealth technology , first used on the F - 117 Nighthawk , then on the B - 2 Spirit , and now on the F / A - 22 and F - 35 .
Future aircraft may be designed with “ visual stealth ” technology to make them almost invisible even in daylight .
No other nation has deployed any stealth aircraft .
But advanced sensor networks may now be able to detect first - generation stealth planes .
The Serbs actually managed to shoot down an F - 117 in 1999 .
None of the most sophisticated surface - to - air missiles , such as Russia ’s double - digit SAMs ( SA - 10 , SA - 15 , SA - 20 ) , was available to Iraq , Serbia , Afghanistan , or other states that the U.S. has fought in recent years , but they are being sold to other customers , including China , Vietnam , Kazakhstan , South Korea , Greece , and Cyprus .
So are shoulder - fired anti-aircraft missiles such as the American FIM - 92 Stinger , British Starstreak , French Mistral , Chinese Qianwei - 2 , and the Russian SA - 7 Grail , SA - 14 Gremlin , SA - 16 Gimlet , and SA - 18 Grouse .
There are at least 100,000 such systems in the arsenals of over 100 states and at least 13 non-state groups such as Hezbollah , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , and the Tamil Tigers .
The best models have a range of 23,000 feet .
The potential of hand - carried missiles was demonstrated in the 1980s when Stingers took a significant toll on Soviet aircraft in Afghanistan .
The threat is sufficient for the U.S. to rely increasingly on unmanned drones for high - risk missions and to mandate that manned aircraft in war zones stay above 15,000 or 20,000 feet .
SAMs pose an especially great threat to helicopters , which do n’t have the option of flying that high , and for airplanes taking off or landing .
Three cargo aircraft leaving Baghdad International Airport have been seriously damaged by missiles , and , while all of them survived , several U.S. helicopters hit with SAMs in Iraq and Afghanistan did not .
An Israeli jetliner was almost shot down in Mombasa , Kenya , in 2002 by al Qaeda operatives firing an SA - 7 .
Only the terrorists ’ targeting error prevented the deaths of 271 passengers and crew .
Other civilian airliners are sure to be less lucky .
Assuming that warplanes can reach their destination , the growing precision of bombs and missiles has made it possible to take out targets with fewer and smaller munitions than ever before .
( The U.S. Air Force ’s latest bomb carries only 50 pounds of explosives . )
Weapons are getting smarter all the time .
The U.S. Sensor - Fuzed Weapon , first employed in the current Iraq War , disperses 40 “ skeet ” anti-armor warheads that use infrared and laser sensors to find and destroy armored vehicles within a 30 - acre area .
The Tactical Tomahawk , which entered production in 2004 , can loiter up to three hours while searching for targets and receiving in - flight retargeting instructions .
The U.S. preponderance in smart bombs and missiles helps to compensate for the relatively small size of its manned bomber force .
As of 2005 , the U.S. Air Force had only 157 long - range bombers ( B - 52s , B - 1s , B - 2s ) , a considerable fall not only from World War II ( when the U.S. had 34,780 ) but also from the end of the Cold War ( 360 ) .
While few in number , each B - 2 can perform the work of thousands of B - 29s by “ servicing ” 80 “ aim points ” per sortie .
Tankers such as the KC - 10 and KC - 135 vastly extend the range and effectiveness of combat aircraft .
Cargo - lifters like the U.S. C - 5 , C - 17 , and C - 130 and the Russian An - 70 and An-225 also perform an invaluable , if unglamorous , role in projecting military power around the world .
The U.S. owns 740 tanker aircraft and 1,200 cargo aircraft — far more than any other country .
A lack of such support aircraft makes it difficult for even the relatively sophisticated European militaries to move their forces very far .
A host of other aircraft , ranging from JSTARS and AWACS to Rivet Joint and Global Hawk , perform surveillance and electronic - warfare missions in support of combat forces .
Their numbers have been growing :
While there were only two JSTARS in the Gulf War , in the Iraq War there were 15 .
But commanders have become so reliant on these systems that there never seem to be enough to go around — the so - called LD / HD problem ( Low Density / High Demand ) .
These , too , are vital U.S. assets that few other nations have .
Space Warfare
A growing amount of surveillance , communications , and intelligence work is being performed by unmanned aircraft and satellites .
In 2001 the U.S. had an estimated 100 military satellites and 150 commercial satellites in orbit , as much as the rest of the world combined .
The U.S. spends more than $ 15 billion a year on military space , perhaps 90 percent of the global total .
The most advanced U.S. surveillance satellites can reportedly pick out a six - inch object from 150 miles above .
( This is an estimate for Keyhole imaging satellites which can work day or night but cannot penetrate cloud cover .
Lacrosse or Onyx systems that use radar imaging can work in all kinds of weather .
They can reportedly distinguish objects 3 to 9 feet across .
Satellite capabilities are strictly classified ; these are only informed guesses . )
A new generation of satellites uses stealth technology so that other countries will not be able to track the satellites ’ movement and thus know when to hide equipment from American eyes .
Yet the advantage the U.S. military derives from mastery of space is slowly eroding .
GPS , a system developed by the Defense Department , is now widely available for countless commercial applications that have spawned a $ 30 - billion - a - year industry .
A potential enemy could use GPS signals to locate targets in the U.S. the same way the U.S. military uses it to locate targets in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The U.S. could jam or degrade GPS signals in wartime , but it would have to do so very selectively for fear of imposing a severe toll on the economy , because GPS devices are now essential for civil aviation , shipping , and other functions .
In addition , the European Union in cooperation with China is launching its own GPS constellation , known as Galileo , that would be outside of direct U.S. control .
More and more countries — at least forty to date — are lofting their own satellites .
In addition , various multinational organizations such as the Asia Satellite Corp. , Arab Satellite Communications Organization , International Telecom Satellite Organization , and European Space Agency have launched their own satellites .
But getting access to space no longer requires having your own satellite .
A growing number of private firms such as Google , DigitalGlobe , and Space Imaging sell or give away high - resolution satellite photos via the Internet .
The best of these offer imagery of sufficient quality to identify objects one and a half feet wide .
The Israeli - owned ImageSat International offers customers the opportunity to redirect its EROS - A imaging satellite ( launched in 2000 aboard a Russian rocket ) and download its data in total secrecy with few if any restrictions .
Its CEO boasts : “ Our customers , in effect , acquire their own reconnaissance satellite ... at a fraction of the cost that it would take to build their own . ”
The private satellite industry is becoming so pervasive that the U.S. military now relies upon it to provide some of its own imaging ( typically low - resolution pictures used for mapping ) and much of its communications needs .
Targets identified from space could be attacked either with terrorist ( or commando ) missions or with the growing number of missiles spreading around the world .
More than two dozen nations have ballistic missiles and by 2015 at least a dozen will have land - attack cruise missiles .
Either type of projectile could be topped with chemical , biological , or nuclear warheads .
Eight or nine countries already have nuclear weapons and more are trying to get them , in part to offset the tremendous U.S. advantage in conventional weaponry .
In response , the U.S. is working on a variety of missile defenses .
The most advanced are the ground - based Patriot Advanced Capability 3 and the sea - based Standard Missile 3 , which have been deployed already to protect U.S. troops overseas .
The deployment of a long - heralded system designed to protect the U.S. homeland against long - range missiles began in 2004 with the installation of interceptors in Alaska .
Eventually , the U.S. plans to field a multi- layered defense using a variety of sensors and weapons on land , sea , air , and space .
Also in the works are systems designed to defeat low - flying cruise missiles , which are hard to distinguish from ground clutter .
But whether these systems will protect Americans against the most likely or most deadly types of attacks remains an open question .
Robotic Warfare
The falling size and cost of electronics has made it possible to decrease the number of people needed to operate major weapons systems or , in some instances , eliminated the need for human operators altogether .
Maintaining the engines aboard a ship used to require dozens of sailors to work for extended periods in noisy , grimy , cramped quarters .
The new DD ( X ) destroyer will have an engine room controlled entirely by remote sensors and cameras .
Or , to take another example , consider the evolution of the long - range bomber from the B - 29 , which had a crew of 11 , to the B - 2 which can hit many more targets but has a crew of just two , who spend much of their time supervising the autopilot functions .
The greatest advances in robotics have been made in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) , with the U.S. in the lead , Israel following close behind , and at least 40 other countries trying to catch up .
By the time of the Iraq War in 2003 , the U.S. had fielded six major UAVs : the Air Force ’s Predator and Global Hawk , the Army ’s Hunter and Shadow , and the Marines ’ Pioneer and Dragon Eye .
These ranged in size from the 27,000 - pound Global Hawk ( comparable to a Lear jet ) to the five - pound Dragon Eye ( more like a model airplane ) .
What they had in common was that they were all designed as surveillance systems .
But in a pattern that echoes the history of manned flight , UAVs such as the Predator were soon put to work attacking enemy positions .
Soon to be deployed are drones built especially for combat — Boeing ’s X - 45 and Northrop Grumman ’s X - 47 .
In Matthew Brzezinski ’s fanciful description , the former is “ flat as a pancake , with jagged 34 - foot batwings , no tail and a triangular , bulbous nose ” that give it the appearance of “ a set piece from the television program Battlestar Galactica , ” while the latter is a “ a sleek kite - shaped craft with internal weapons bays for stealth and curved air intakes like the gills of a stingray . ”
Both are designed to be almost invisible to radar and to perform especially dangerous missions like suppressing enemy air defenses .
The major difference is that the X - 45 is supposed to take off from land like the F - 15 , while the X - 47 is to operate off aircraft carriers like the F - 18 .
Also in development is the Unmanned Combat Armed Rotorcraft which is designed to perform the functions of an attack helicopter like the Apache .
An unmanned helicopter , known as Fire Scout , is already being bought by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps .
Unlike the Predator , most of these new UAVs do not require constant control by a human operator ; newer UAVs can be programmed to fly themselves and even drop munitions without direct human intervention .
Further into the future may be projects such as a nuclear - powered UAV that could fly at 70,000 feet and stay on station for months or even years at a time ; a UAV “ tender ” that could serve as a mother ship for launching and recovering smaller UAVs ; UAV tankers that could refuel other UAVs in flight ; and vertical - takeoff UAV cargo - carriers that could supply troops in a combat zone .
Many of these UAVs could use smart munitions with their own target - recognition systems , thus introducing another layer of robotics into the process .
An existing example is the Low - Cost Autonomous Attack System , a 100 - pound bomb with fins and a small turbojet engine that allow it to loiter over an area for up to 30 minutes , using a laser - radar sensor to search for high - priority targets based on programmed algorithms .
Once it picks out a target , it can configure its multi-mode warhead into the most appropriate form — fragmentation explosives for unprotected soldiers or an armor - piercing projectile for tanks — prior to impact .
The most revolutionary UAVs are the smallest .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) is working on aerial vehicles the size of an insect or a hummingbird that could hover undetected and perch on a telephone pole or a window ledge .
Some models have no wings at all ; others use flapping , bird - style wings .
They are designed to be cheap enough that they could saturate a battlefield with sensors .
Unmanned ground vehicles are not as advanced as UAVs , but they are starting to play a growing role as well .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have used robots with names like PackBot , Matilda , Andros , and Swords to search tunnels , caves , and buildings for enemy fighters and explosives .
“ Some are as big as a backhoe .
Others can be attached to a backpack frame and carried by a soldier , ” writes the trade industry publication Defense News .
“ They move on treads or wheels , climb over obstacles with the aid of flippers , mount stairs , peep through windows and peer into caves with cameras and infrared sensors , sniff for chemical agents , and even operate a small ground - penetrating radar . ”
As this description indicates , ground - based robots , like their aerial counterparts , are still used mainly for reconnaissance .
But weapons are beginning to be mounted on them , too .
The Talon , a two - foot - six - inch robot which looks like a miniature tank and was designed for bomb disposal , was sent to Iraq equipped with grenade and rocket launchers as well as a .50 - caliber machine gun .
It is controlled remotely by a soldier using a video screen and joystick .
Developing more sophisticated unmanned ground vehicles will be tougher than developing better UAVs because there are so many more obstacles that can impede movement on the ground .
But progress is rapidly being made .
In 2004 , DARPA sponsored a race in the Mojave Desert to see if an autonomous robotic vehicle could complete a 132 - mile course .
That year , the furthest any competitor got was 7.4 miles , but in 2005 four vehicles finished the entire course , with the winner ( a souped - up Volkswagen Touareg ) claiming the $ 2 million prize .
Buoyed by these results , the Pentagon is pushing ahead with plans for new ground robots such as the MULE ( Multifunction Logistics and Equipment Vehicle ) , a two - and - a - half - ton truck that could carry supplies into battle or wounded soldiers out of it ; the Armed Robotic Vehicle , a five - ton mini - tank that could be equipped with missiles or a .30 mm chain gun ; and the Soldier Unmanned Ground Vehicle , a 30 - pound , man-portable scout that comes equipped with weapons and sensors .
These are all integral elements of the Army ’s Future Combat System .
Scientists are also trying to create a self - powered robotic suit — an exoskeleton — that could enable soldiers to carry far heavier loads , move much faster , and conceivably even leap short buildings in a single bound .
A prototype developed at the University of California , Berkeley , allows a soldier to carry 180 pounds as if it were less than five pounds .
The U.S. Navy is exploring robotic technology for a variety of its own missions .
In addition to carrier - based UAVs ( both fixed - wing and rotary ) , the navy is developing Unmanned Surface Vehicles and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles .
Most of these drones would swim but some might crawl along the ocean floor like crabs .
They could perform such difficult missions as antisubmarine warfare , mine clearance , undersea mapping , and surveillance in coastal waters .
All drones , whether operating on soil , sea , or sky , offer major advantages over traditional manned vehicles .
They can be deployed for longer periods because robots do n’t need to eat or sleep ; they can undertake maneuvers that might put too much stress on the human frame ; they can be made much smaller and cheaper because they do n’t need all sorts of expensive redundancies and life - support systems ( no oxygen tanks ! no ejection seats ! ) ; and they can be much more readily sent on high - risk missions because , should anything go wrong , nobody has to worry about notifying the next of kin .
These advantages have persuaded Congress to ratchet up spending on unmanned programs .
Lawmakers have mandated that one - third of all U.S. deep - strike aircraft be unmanned by 2010 and that one - third of all ground combat vehicles be unmanned by 2015 .
There are two chief limitations on the use of robots at the moment .
First , computers and sensors are not yet smart enough to deliver anything close to the “ situational awareness ” of a human being .
Second , a shortage of bandwidth limits the number of drones that can be remotely controlled at any one time .
Both problems will become less acute with improvements in computer and communications technology , but there is still little reason to think that robots will be alone on the battlefield of the future .
It is doubtful that machines will ever be smart enough to do all of the fighting , even if they can perform some of the dullest , dirtiest , or most dangerous work .
The Limits of Technological Supremacy
Taken together , the changes in military power wrought by the information revolution are still in their early stages , and they still have serious limitations .
Even the best surveillance systems can be stymied by simple countermeasures like camouflage , smoke , and decoys , by bad weather , or by terrain like the deep sea , mountains , or jungles .
Sensors have limited ability to penetrate solid objects , so that they cannot tell what is happening in underground bunkers such as those that North Korea and Iran likely use to hide their nuclear weapons programs .
Urban areas present a particularly difficult challenge :
There are far more things to track ( individuals ) and far more obstructions ( buildings , vehicles , trees , signs ) than at sea or in the sky .
Figuring out whether a person is a civilian or an insurgent is a lot harder than figuring out whether an unidentified aircraft is a civilian airliner or an enemy fighter .
It is harder still to figure out how many enemy soldiers will resist or what stratagems they will employ .
No machine has yet been invented that can penetrate human thought processes .
Even with the best equipment in the world , U.S. forces frequently have been surprised by their adversaries .
Some strategists expect that advances in information technology will greatly diminish if not altogether obliterate some of these difficulties .
The Pentagon is creating a Global Information Grid that will pool data from all U.S. assets , whether an infantryman on the ground or a satellite in space .
The ultimate goal : to provide a perfect operational picture — a “ God ’s - eye view ” of the battlespace .
This ambitious objective could be furthered by the development of better microwave radars that could see through walls , foliage , or soil ; cheaper , more pervasive sensors that could provide 24/7 coverage of the battlefield ; better data compression and transmission techniques that could allow more bytes to be sent much faster ; and more powerful computers that might make it possible to create , for example , a real - time , three - dimensional model of a city showing all the people who reside in it .
Yet no matter how far information technology advances , it is doubtful that the Pentagon will ever succeed , as some utopians dream , in “ lifting the fog of war . ”
The fallibility of American soldiers and the cunning of their enemies will surely continue to frustrate the best - laid plans .
Moreover , America ’s growing reliance on high - tech systems creates new vulnerabilities of its own : Future enemies have strong incentives to attack U.S. computer and communication nodes .
Strikes on military information networks could blind or paralyze the armed forces , while strikes on civilian infrastructure , such as banking or air control systems , could cause chaos on the home front .
Adversaries will almost certainly figure out ways to blunt the U.S. informational advantage .
From Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan to numerous misadventures in Iraq , they already have .
Whether fighting in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan or in the alleys of Ramadi and Fallujah , U.S. soldiers have been ambushed by insurgents who managed to elude their sensor networks through such simple expedients as communicating via messengers , not cell phones .
Asymmetric Warfare
Given the size and scope of America ’s military advantage , it is doubtful that any country will mount a full - spectrum challenge to U.S. military capabilities in the foreseeable future .
The entry barriers are simply too high , especially for air , sea , and space systems .
Virginia - class nuclear submarines cost $ 2.4 billion , Nimitz - class aircraft carriers go for $ 6 billion , and the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter program will cost at least $ 245 billion .
The U.S. spends around $ 500 billion a year on its military , almost as much as the rest of the world combined .
In fact , the U.S. spends more simply on the research , development , testing , and evaluation of new weapons — $ 71 billion in 2006 — than any other country spends on its entire armed forces .
( By way of comparison , the top three spenders after the U.S. are Russia , whose defense budget in 2003 was estimated at $ 65 billion ; China , at $ 56 billion ; France , at $ 45 billion ; and Japan and the United Kingdom , at $ 42 billion .
These are only estimates ; the figures for Russia and China may be considerably higher . )
It is not only U.S. hardware that ’s hard to replicate ; so is the all - volunteer force that makes it work .
Operating high - tech military equipment requires long - service professionals , not short - term conscripts .
Countries as diverse as Vietnam , China , Germany , and Russia are emulating the Anglo - American model by downsizing their forces and relying less on draftees ; many other nations have abolished the draft altogether .
The U.S. military ’s edge lies not simply in recruiting high - quality personnel but in its methods for training and organizing them .
Initiatives undertaken in earlier decades , such as setting up realistic training centers to simulate combat conditions and forcing the services to work more closely together ( the Goldwater - Nichols Act ) , continue to bear fruit .
Few other armed forces have made comparable reforms .
But a potential adversary does not need to duplicate the U.S. force structure in order to challenge it .
The United States faces a growing “ asymmetric ” threat both from other states and from sub -state groups .
As the National Intelligence Council concluded in its recent report “ Mapping the Global Future ” : “ While no single country looks within striking distance of rivaling U.S. military power by 2020 , more countries will be in a position to make the United States pay a heavy price for any military action they oppose . ”
As we have seen , a variety of off - the - shelf missiles can threaten U.S. tanks , surface ships , and aircraft , especially when they get close to hostile territory .
The power of smart munitions is outstripping the protection afforded by speed or armor .
After 2010 , write defense analysts Michael Vickers and Robert Martinage , “ the survivability of aircraft carriers , high - structure surface combatants [ e.g. , tanks ] , and non-stealthy aircraft of all types could increasingly be called into question as maritime , over - the - horizon ‘ area denial ’ capabilities and extended - range air defense systems continue to mature . ”
In a similar vein , George and Meredith Friedman contend that “ the ability of conventional weapons platforms — tanks and aircraft carriers — to survive in a world of precision - guided munitions is dubious . ”
Also vulnerable are the ports , airfields , and bases which the U.S. uses to project its power overseas .
Imagine how much damage Saddam Hussein could have done in 2003 if he had been able to annihilate the one port in Kuwait that was being used to disembark coalition troops or the large desert bases in Kuwait where over 100,000 British and American troops gathered prior to the invasion of Iraq .
The Pentagon ’s 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review warned that “ future adversaries could have the means to render ineffective much of our current ability to project military power overseas . ”
If the U.S. armed forces could not count on safe , assured access to overseas bases they would need to change radically the way they do business .
It would no longer be practical to rely on large land armies or lots of short - range combat aircraft operating out of vulnerable forward bases supplied by equally vulnerable cargo ships , trucks , and aircraft .
The U.S. Army might be forced to rely on small numbers of commandos supported by long - range aircraft and missiles — as it did in Afghanistan .
The Navy might have to depend more on submarines and the Air Force on stealth aircraft .
All the services might have to make greater use of unmanned vehicles .
The battlefield , which has been becoming less crowded for centuries , might empty out even further as small units try to conceal themselves from ubiquitous sensor networks , emerging only briefly to launch lightning strikes before they go back into hiding .
This has become known as the “ swarming ” scenario , and it has attracted support from the likes of military historian Alexander Bevin .
“ Large concentrations of troops and weapons are targets for destruction , not marks of power , ” he writes , “ and [ in the future ] they no longer will exist ....
Military units , to survive , must not only be small , but highly mobile , self - contained , and autonomous . ”
Even if these predictions are accurate , however , it is n’t clear when they would become reality , and timing matters tremendously .
The key to winning future wars is knowing when to move from one form of military to another :
A premature decision to change ( such as the U.S. Army ’s flawed Pentomic design in the 1950s ) can leave one unprepared to fight and win the wars that actually occur , Vietnam being the classic example .
In any case , it is doubtful that a complete switchover to “ swarming ” will ever occur .
Winning wars , as opposed to winning battles , will continue to require controlling territory , which in turn will require a substantial presence of ground troops , as the U.S. has learned in Afghanistan and Iraq .
No wonder - weapon will alter this fundamental reality , which means even the most high - tech military force will always remain vulnerable to the less sophisticated but still deadly technology of its adversaries on the ground .
American Hiroshima ?
Even as strategists look to the future , armed forces must not lose sight of the threats of the moment , and they do not come for the most part from traditional militaries .
They come largely from terrorist groups — some with state sponsorship , others without — that use the fruits of modern military technology to their perverse advantage .
“ Irregular ” attacks carried out by tribes , clans , or other non-state actors are as old as warfare itself ; they long predate the development of modern armed forces and the nation - state .
The religious fanaticism which animates so many of today ’s terrorists and guerrillas is equally ancient .
But technological advances have made such attacks far more potent than in the distant past .
The progeny of the second industrial revolution — assault rifles , machine guns , mortars , rocket launchers , landmines , explosives — long ago spread to the remotest corners of the globe .
Fighters who a century ago might have made do with swords and muskets now have access to cheap and reliable weapons such as the AK - 47 capable of spewing out 100 bullets a minute .
More advanced technologies , from handheld missiles to chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons , give even a small group of insurgents the ability or potential ability to mete out far more destruction than entire armies could unleash just a century ago .
And thanks to modern transportation and communications infrastructure — such as jumbo jets , the Internet , and cell phones — insurgents have the capability to carry out their attacks virtually anywhere in the world .
September 11 showed the terrifying possibilities of such unconventional warfare .
It is easy to imagine that in the future super - terrorists will be able to kill hundreds of thousands , even millions , with effective weapons of mass destruction .
All of the materials , as well as the know - how needed to craft such devices , are all too readily available .
The proliferation of nuclear weapons has the greatest ability to trump U.S. military hegemony .
The atomic bomb is more than sixty years old .
It belongs to an age of rotary - dial telephones and fin-winged cars .
It is a miracle that it has not been used by maniac dictators or political radicals since 1945 , but that streak wo n’t last forever .
And while information age technology offers a reasonable chance of stopping a nuclear - tipped missile , there is much less probability of stopping a terrorist with a nuclear suitcase .
There is little in theory to prevent al Qaeda from carrying out its oft - expressed desire to create an “ American Hiroshima . ”
In the words of Eugene Habiger , a retired four - star general who once ran antinuclear terror programs for the Department of Energy , “ it is not a matter of if ; it ’s a matter of when . ”
The most important challenge for the U.S. armed forces and their allies in the post - 9/11 world is to “ leverage ” their advantage in conventional weaponry to deal with today ’s unconventional threats .
Information technology can be an important part of this task .
Embedded microchips can track the 18 million cargo containers moving around the world and help prevent terrorists from using them to smuggle weapons .
Computerized cameras scanning a crowd may be able to pick out a terrorist based on facial recognition patterns .
Dog - like sniffing machines may be able to recognize suspects by their body odor .
Powerful computers utilizing artificial intelligence programs can sift vast reams of Internet data to pick out information about terrorist plots — if concerns about violating the privacy of innocent people do not get in the way .
A variety of unobtrusive sensors can detect the presence of explosives or chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons .
Handheld computer translating devices such as the Phraselator , already in use by U.S. troops , can bridge some of the language gap between Western operatives and the regions where they operate .
But in the final analysis , having the best technology is not enough to defeat the most committed terrorists armed with the deadliest weapons .
Some of the most expensive weapons systems being purchased by the United States and its allies are irrelevant to fighting and winning the war against terrorism .
And the combination of moral restraint and bureaucratic sluggishness that defines America ’s military culture may leave the U.S. at a comparative disadvantage against nimble , networked , nihilistic enemies like al Qaeda , who will deploy whatever weapons they have with urgent brutality .
To deal with the essential paradox of the information age — that the march of advanced technology may decrease our security in some areas while increasing it in others — we need not just better machines but also the right organizations , training , and leadership to take advantage of them .
That ’s where the U.S. has lagged badly behind ; its industrial - age military bureaucracy remains configured primarily for fighting other conventional militaries , rather than the terrorist foes we increasingly confront .
Changing the culture and structure of our armed forces — to say nothing of the CIA or State Department — is a far more daunting task than simply figuring out which weapons systems to buy .
Yet even if we rise to that bureaucratic and political challenge , there will likely be times , tragically , when our military supremacy is no match for the technology - enhanced savagery of our inferior enemies .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
One out of every eight U.S. federal health care dollars is spent treating people with diabetes , a study found , and advocates are calling for the creation of a government post to oversee coordination of spending on treatment and prevention among federal agencies .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The study , based on federal spending data from 2005 , looked at various government health programs to determine how much was spent on diabetics versus non diabetics .
It found it cost the U.S. government $ 79.7 billion more to treat people with the disease , or some 12 percent of the $ 645 billion in total federal health care spending projected that year .
The National Changing Diabetes Program ( NCDP ) study was being released at a briefing with the Congressional Diabetes Caucus on Tuesday .
The study , conducted by Mathematica Policy Research for NCDP -- a coalition of diabetes thought leaders , including physician organizations and disease advocacy groups -- included all federally - funded programs that have an impact on diabetes prevention and treatment .
“ Often we think about diabetes only residing with the Department of Health and Human Services , ” said Dana Haza , senior director of NCDP , which is funded by Denmark ’s Novo Nordisk , one of world ’s largest sellers of insulin and diabetes products .
“ But when you look at the findings of this study , actually 18 of 21 federal agencies have a budgetary influence impact on diabetes , ” she said , noting agencies that deal with veterans , prisoners , school lunch programs and food stamps as examples .
“ The staggering cost of treating diabetes and the number of diabetes - related programs highlight a need for a national diabetes coordinator to ensure results , ” Haza said .
“ We are spending as much on diabetes as we are on the entire Department of Education , but no one is leading the effort . ”
A report by Medco Health Solutions Inc. issued last month found that the growing diabetes epidemic and more aggressive treatment could result in soaring costs to treat the disease over the next three years .
An analysis of Medco ’s 2007 Drug Trend Report found that , by 2009 , spending just on medicines to treat diabetes could soar 60 percent to 68 percent from 2006 levels .
The sales of diabetes drugs in the United States reached $ 9.88 billion in 2005 , according to data from IMS Health Inc .
“ Coordinating America ’s response to diabetes should be mandatory , ” said Lana Vukovljak , CEO of American Association of Diabetes Educators .
“ Over the next 30 years , diabetes is expected to claim the lives of 62 million Americans .
Surely this health crisis warrants the appointment of a manager charged with aligning budgets and programs for diabetes at the federal level , ” Vukovljak said in a statement .
Uncontrolled diabetes can result in a wide variety of serious health complications , including heart disease , stroke , vision loss , amputation of extremities and kidney disease .
“ Our findings suggest that there are many missed opportunities for the federal government to enhance its impact on diabetes prevention , detection , treatment and management of complications , ” Marsha Gold , who led Mathematica ’s research team , said in a statement .
It was a relaxed Sunday morning in summer when a black Audi estate pulled up outside the Munch Museum in an Oslo park .
Within seconds , armed robbers were waving a .357 Magnum pistol at visitors and guards .
Then they faltered .
They had to ask to be shown the two most famous paintings in the museum .
No one put up an argument .
They emerged with two framed pictures , got in their car , and were gone .
It was 11.20 am on August 22 2004 .
Oslo's police headquarters , just five minutes ' drive from the museum , is a modernist block on a wooded hill above the kebab shops of a district called Greenland .
Normally it would have been packed with detectives , but this was a Sunday in late August .
As news reached the station , urgent calls were made to senior detectives at home .
But this was n't just a weekend ruined ; it was the beginning of an inquiry that would keep them in the world spotlight for months on end .
It would n't let up until the most famous painting of modern times was found .
It 's always dangerous to describe a work of art as " visionary " .
But Edvard Munch 's 1893 painting The Scream - Skrik in Norwegian - is a document of visionary experience .
Just as the British Romantic artist and poet William Blake saw spirits and portrayed them , the late 19th - century symbolist Munch , abetted by loneliness , absinthe , magical experiments and by the spiritualist Christianity of his childhood , could slip into hallucinations .
Munch said he felt a great scream piercing the world .
He described the vision several times , in written accounts published and unpublished in his lifetime .
He was walking by the Oslofjord with two friends , looking at Oslo from the south - east , on a path his painting makes appear more like a bridge or a pier that rushes away from the beholder in a drastic perspective emphasised by the lines of the railings and what resemble planks .
In the distance , behind the solitary screamer , are two featureless , top - hatted men .
It was sunset .
The sky turned " red like blood " .
Tired and ill , he leaned on the railing , " looking out across flaming clouds that hung like blood and a sword over the deep blue fjord and city " .
His friends walked on .
As he stood there , trembling with anxiety , " I felt a great , infinite scream pass through nature . "
Pain has robbed the screamer of features .
Simplified to a yellow skull on a shrouded body curved in an S shape , thin , serpentine hands against the emaciated cheeks and covering its ears , the personification of unhappiness stretches its mouth open in a vertical oval , and screams .
This is the icon of agony armed robbers carried off in August 2004 .
They broke the frames off
The Scream and the other stolen painting - Munch 's darkly sensual Madonna - within moments of leaving the museum , afraid there might be tracking devices hidden in the gilded wood .
The getaway car was found abandoned 10 minutes ' drive from the museum , sprayed inside and out with thick white fire extinguisher foam to erase DNA traces and fingerprints .
On the museum 's CCTV recordings , grainy , ambiguous images failed to give a clear view of the armed robbers ' faces .
There are still mysteries in this case , still trials and appeals pending , but what happened next is clearly established .
The thieves had a hiding place in mind for the paintings , and according to the testimony of racing driver Thomas Nataas , they were n't taking no for an answer .
Nataas drives a " Batmobile " - it 's painted like Batman 's car , complete with bat logo .
He and his car are icons among fans of drag racing - Nataas , a Norwegian , is currently one of the leading drag racers in Europe .
Most fans are probably unaware that their champion was acquitted last year of a criminal role in the theft of The Scream .
The court accepted Nataas 's defence that he was involved against his will .
Nataas drives to race meetings in a bus , and lives in it on tour around the continent .
Before the robbery , an acquaintance asked if he could " put something " on the bus .
Nataas refused , but it was no use : the two stolen paintings were stored on his bus soon after the robbery .
Nataas has said he acquiesced , and failed to contact police , out of fear for his life .
On September 25 2004 , just over a month after the robbery , a meeting of the conspirators was arranged in the countryside outside Oslo .
In most of Europe this would still be an almost summery time of year but in Scandinavia , by late September , the weather is damp and cold and misty .
In the gloomy landscape , Nataas 's bus was parked at a prearranged place .
The two paintings were transferred to a car .
Where they were taken next is still not known .
In Oslo 's police headquarters , Iver Stensrud , a veteran detective , was leading the investigation by the organised crime division .
They had a tip - off about the meeting in the countryside , but it was not specific ; they knew something was happening , but not that it concerned The Scream .
Only later did they realise they had come very close to seizing it , if only they 'd known that was the moment to pounce .
The investigation preoccupied news outlets all over the world and intrigued every art crime expert .
Like most Norwegians , Stensrud had visited the Munch Museum , but he had n't quite grasped the scale of The Scream 's global fame before he took on this case .
Edvard Munch was born in 1863 .
Norway in the 19th century was a poor and almost unknown place , just starting to rediscover a cultural heritage that goes back to the Vikings ' sagas and carvings .
He grew up in Christiania ( as Oslo was then called ) when it was more like a provincial town than a capital .
Even today , it is small and quiet compared with more southerly European cities .
Walk its streets in dwindling winter light and you are in the world that inspired The Scream .
The centre looks much as it does in Munch 's 1892 painting Evening On Karl Johann , which shows the ghostly faces of workers walking home , the parliament building behind them .
You can stand on the same pavement , watching today 's tired commuters progress the same route .
Munch came from a distinguished family - his uncle was a famous nationalist intellectual - but his father was an unsuccessful doctor and their meagre flat was haunted by death .
First his mother died when he was small , then a favourite sister .
He defied his religious father by becoming an artist , won scholarships to study in Paris and spent the 1890s in fevered movement around Europe , coming back , always , to Oslo and its fjord , a long , winding , tree - lined inlet .
As soon as he had some income from his work , Munch bought a country house - really just a fisherman 's shack - next to the fjord , and the fjord 's distinctive light gives his art its unique personality .
Munch 's great images were all created when he was a young man , from the late 1880s to the early 1900s .
In 1908 , years of abuse - drinking , not eating enough , isolating himself - led to a complete breakdown .
After he recovered in a Danish sanatorium , he was a much milder painter .
When you look at his classic works in Oslo 's National Gallery and the Munch Museum , you can follow them , not as a narrative exactly , but as a spiritual autobiography he called the Frieze of Life .
The Scream stands alone in our imaginations , but when you relate it to other scenes in the Frieze of Life , its meaning becomes clearer .
His painting Anxiety depicts exactly the same view of the Oslofjord , but this time an entire crowd of ghoulish creatures walk bleakly towards us : their faces have the same dehumanised , spectral futility as those of the people he painted on Karl Johann street .
In other words , the face in The Scream is that of a modern city dweller cut off from the life - giving forces of nature , cut off from belief or hope or love , cut off from other people , and able to perceive the life force only as a terrifying , destructive storm .
The figure in the scream covers its ears against that sound even as it opens its mouth wide to add to the world 's screech .
The painting struck people as extraordinary from the moment it was first exhibited in 1893 .
When the Nazis came to power and banned " degenerate " modern art , Munch was one of their hate figures ; this helped popularise him abroad .
None of this explains why The Scream 's fame so far exceeds that of its creator .
When Munch died in 1944 , among the works he left to the city of Oslo were not one but two oil paintings of The Scream .
The two differ slightly in palette ; the National Gallery 's version ( which was also once stolen ) is yellower , as if stained by the nicotine smoke of some fin - de - siècle cellar bar .
The version stolen from the Munch Museum is brighter and more lurid in hue .
Yet no one really distinguishes them , and few know there are two .
At a cultural level there is only one , and it is an idea , not an object .
Munch published a lithograph of The Scream in 1895 ; the boldness of it translates perfectly to black and white .
The Scream is not an icon by accident but because he imagined it as just that .
Iver Stensrud sits at a table in his office on which I 've laid out a modern poster of The Scream .
As a Norwegian , he has become very proud of Munch , he says , through realising how much this masterpiece is loved around the world .
But when the investigation was dragging on , this fame made his job harder .
Experts interviewed by newspapers suggested the painting had almost certainly been spirited into eastern Europe by the Russian mafia .
Then a rumour reached the press that it had " definitely " been destroyed .
All these notions were distractions from what he saw as a very traditional police operation - systematically " turning over every stone " .
Within days of the robbery , leads from contacts in the Oslo underworld gave the crime squad several suspects ' names .
Norway may be a small , rich country , but the high quality of life , and high prices , produce a crime problem of their own .
Drugs , like everything else , cost a lot .
Importing them is highly profitable .
Precisely because it is a small country , the same gangs involved in the drugs trade operate in other fields and all tend to know each other .
Stensrud says he believed from the start that the thieves of The Scream were locals who would prove " known to us " .
Speculations about a commissioned theft or mafia involvement just did n't ring true .
" It was not very professional ; they had n't done their homework very well .
There was confusion about where the painting was ...
This gave us something to think about . "
There was one very odd feature of the crime : its timing .
When the raid at the Munch Museum happened , police resources were focused on what was , for Norway , a horrific crime .
In April 2004 , there was an armed robbery at the Norwegian Cash Service ( Nokas ) offices in the western port of Stavanger .
A senior police officer , Arne Sigve Klungland , was machine - gunned and died on the spot .
All the country 's top detectives , including Stensrud 's division , were working on the murder of one of their own .
It seemed more than a coincidence .
Stensrud floated the theory that perhaps the Munch Museum robbery was actually an attempt to divert police resources from their armed - robbery - and - murder hunt in Stavanger .
The Scream is , after all , more famous around the world than the late Arne Sigve Klungland .
The pressure to find it might distract from his death ...
When one David Toska was arrested in April 2005 and charged with leading the Stavanger robbery , Stensrud told Norwegian papers he believed this would lead to the discovery of the Munch paintings - that 's how convinced he already was of the link between the two crimes .
By that time he already had six people in custody in the Munch case , and in spring 2006 they came to trial .
Three were convicted and three - including racing driver Thomas Nataas - were acquitted .
But the paintings had still not been recovered and none of the men was revealing their whereabouts .
In the hopes of concentrating their minds , two of the convicted men were ordered by a judge to pay back the estimated value of the two paintings - in reality a gross underestimate but more than enough to give anyone pause : about £ 62.5 m .
In reality , it 's hard to calculate what The Scream might fetch , except to say that it would break all records for modern art .
David Toska got 19 years for leading the Stavanger armed robbery .
Norwegian papers have reported that it was Toska 's lawyer , Oystein Storrvik , who told police where they might find The Scream and Madonna .
So it looks as if Iver Stensrud knows his Norwegian underworld , and that the most famous modern painting was indeed stolen to distract attention from a police officer 's death .
From whatever source - and they are still cagey - the police did get a crucial tip - off last summer .
Ingebørg Ydstie , chief curator of the Munch Museum , got the call she had been longing for in early August 2006 , the second anniversary of the theft .
The police , speaking to her on conditions of strict secrecy , summoned her to a meeting to advise on what precautions they needed to take , " going out there " to collect the pictures .
She was taken one afternoon to police headquarters , where detectives were gathered by a parked van .
" There were 20 to 30 policemen standing in a row ; it was quite emotional .
Then they opened the back of the van and there the paintings were .
Tears filled my eyes . "
The recovery of The Scream and Madonna by Stensrud and his department on August 31 last year made as many headlines around the world as did the original theft .
What did n't get much publicity was the discovery , when museum technical staff looked at the paintings , that early reports of their condition had been optimistic .
The paintings wo n't go back on view until later this year because there is damage to be repaired , and sadly , in the case of The Scream , some that can not be repaired .
This damage tells a brutal story .
The Scream , painted on cardboard , " has been wet .
The lower part of the left of the figure has got damp .
This water or something else has come from the outside ; maybe they were wrapped in something wet ? "
There are some tears in the Madonna - these are " reparable " .
As Ydstie says , " It has not been a sophisticated crime . "
Looking at The Scream now , it is shockingly clear that the damage was caused by carelessness and neglect .
A huge watery stain , like a watermark on a tea bag , seeps over its bottom left - hand corner , on the walkway and even on the lower part of the figure .
Pigment has dissolved or been washed away .
Why would anyone let that happen ?
It had to be because the painting did n't interest them at all .
Neither in the drag racer 's bus nor wherever it went after that did anyone even bother to look at The Scream .
It was wrapped in a damp blanket and forgotten about .
The Stavanger gang needed what Sicilians call an " illustrious corpse " to distract attention from the one in Stavanger .
What could be more spectacular than stealing The Scream ?
After all , it caused a sensation when the other version of Munch 's picture was stolen from Oslo 's National Gallery in 1994 and recovered in a sting operation .
Stealing the Munch Museum version proved an even bigger story .
And that was the point .
The solution to this crime lay in the Munch Museum all along .
Ydstie takes me behind the scenes , along a cool glassed corridor to the museum 's research library .
She shows me their collection of Scream artefacts from around the world : cartoons of George W Bush making the screamer scream , political badges featuring The Scream on behalf of various causes , T - shirts and inflatables , and a Scream boxing doll .
The star exhibit is a howling , white - faced Halloween mask as featured in the Scream horror films .
What the criminals stole was not even a work of art in their eyes , but simply , with its big eyes and open mouth , and hands like paws over its skull cheeks , the most famous face in Norway .
Watchdog group calls for probe of Domenici / Dems to summon 2 more fired U.S. attorneys
2007-03-06 04:00:00 PDT
Washington --
Democrats plan to subpoena two more U.S. attorneys who were recently dismissed from their posts as congressional leaders prepare for House and Senate hearings today to determine whether the Bush administration played politics in the firing of federal prosecutors .
On Monday , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a congressional watchdog group , filed a formal complaint against Sen. Pete Domenici , R - N.M. , asking the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to investigate his conduct for allegedly interfering with the work of his state 's U.S. attorney , which would be a violation of Senate rules .
The Department of Justice revealed Monday that Domenici made as many as four phone calls over the past two years to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and his deputy to complain about the U.S. attorney in New Mexico , David Iglesias , and question whether he was " up for the job . "
A total of six former federal prosecutors are being summoned to the hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee and a subcommittee of the House Judiciary panel , just as the issue is taking on new importance in Congress .
Democrats contend the prosecutors were fired for political reasons .
But the Republican administration has said it has the authority to make personnel changes it deems appropriate -- without congressional interference .
The administration has said none of the six prosecutors was let go because of politics .
The use of subpoenas marks the first time the new Democratic - controlled Congress has seized that extraordinary power in its attempt to oversee the Bush administration .
The issue is all the more volatile because it involves a senior Republican senator , Domenici , and could pull in a senior Republican member of the House , Heather Wilson of New Mexico .
Four former prosecutors already have been subpoenaed for the House hearing : Iglesias , Carol Lam of San Diego , John McKay of Seattle , and H.E. " Bud " Cummins of Little Rock , Ark .
All four are to appear at both hearings .
In addition , the House subcommittee plans to issue subpoenas today for two more recently dismissed prosecutors : Daniel Bogden of Nevada and Paul Charlton of Arizona .
House officials said Bogden and Charlton agreed to appear at today 's hearing .
Eight federal prosecutors -- including Kevin Ryan in San Francisco -- have been dismissed by the Department of Justice , but Iglesias ' case has raised the greatest concern .
He has said he cannot understand why he was removed .
He said he was troubled by a phone call from Domenici just before last year 's midterm election inquiring about a continuing criminal investigation of New Mexico Democrats .
At the time , Domenici's Republican colleague in the House , Wilson , was locked in a tight campaign for re-election , and some Democrats speculate that Domenici and Wilson believed last - minute indictments against New Mexico Democrats would boost her chances .
She won in a squeaker .
Sunday , Domenici acknowledged that he had made a call to Iglesias before the election but said it was only to ask how long the investigation would last .
" It was a very brief conversation , " the senator said .
Wilson acknowledged Monday that she contacted Iglesias to complain about the pace of his corruption investigations .
But she denied allegations from Iglesias that she was pressuring him to speed them up .
" I did not ask about the timing of any indictments , and I did not tell Mr. Iglesias what course of action I thought he should take or pressure him in any way , " Wilson said in a statement .
" The conversation was brief and professional . "
When we meet , you and I , you will see for yourself one of my most humiliating traits .
No it 's not my acromegaly , my plaid pants , nor my atrocious hairpiece .
No , friend , you will be deeply annoyed to hear me ask you to repeat your name at least twice , and possibly five times , during our inaugural conversation .
And , in subsequent meetings , even though your face will be forever etched upon my brain ( a skill at which I absolutely excel ) , I will probably call you " Champ , " " Chief , " or possibly " Tex . "
Because , yes , I will have completely forgotten your name .
And it 's not just a bad memory that 's to blame here ( although , of course , my memory sucks , too ) --
I 'm convinced it 's because I am a terrible listener , and because I suffer intermittent encoding errors at the time data is written to disk , so to speak .
In working to improve this socially - crippling liability , in general -- to hear what people are really saying rather than just using the down time to formulate a pseudo - clever response -- I 've begun skimming the web for advice .
I have these sites and tips to share with you so far , so listen up !
From Becoming a Better Listener :
Genuinely interested :
A successful listener is genuinely interested in what the other person has to say .

Nonverbal messages :
Be sure your nonverbal messages are congruent with your verbal ones .
Unless cultural differences dictate otherwise , offer direct eye contact while the individual is talking .
It helps establish trust and communicates interest .
Leaning forward is also interpreted as an expression of concern and interest .
From The Top 10 Tips for Becoming a Better Listener :
Tune out distractions .
Poor listeners are distracted by interruptions ; good listeners tune them out and focus on the speaker and the message .
It 's a discipline that lends itself to specific techniques for maintaining one 's focus .

How can you listen better ?
- workopolis.com :
Do you listen for their intent ?
New York Yankees manager Joe Torre once observed that he never just looks at what his players say when they 're quoted in the newspaper .
He tries to sort out why they 're saying it .
What is their emotional state as they 're talking to you ?
Are they trusting and forthcoming -- or guarded and defensive ?
Sure , the words that they use are important , but they 're often only a small part of what is being communicated to you .
Do you listen to learn ?
The best ideas have a funny way of coming from the most unlikely sources .
That 's why it 's so important to be open to learning from anyone that you talk to ...
How'd you become a good listener ?

ImpeachforPeace.org lobbyist Jodin Morey just called in from Washington DC and informed our offices that our contingent met with Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , the author of H. Res. 333 .
Rep. Kucincich has “ agreed to submit all the names of everyone who has filled out ( DIY memorial petitions ) to put into the Congressional Record calling upon the impeachment of Richard B. Cheney ” .
That is the good news .
The hard part is that a list of each and every name must be compiled and the list submitted rather than the thousands of petitions .
IFP members will be straining to get this monumental task accomplished .
Data entry anyone ?

Common sense has it that a crummy job can lead to poor mental health .
Insecure and low - quality jobs are least likely to offer accommodations and benefits , have more drawbacks , and are linked with more depression and anxiety .
Mental health problems are also worsened by psychologically unhealthy workplace conditions , atypical ( impermanent , unpredictable ) employment , and underemployment ( part - time or very low pay ) .
Depression and anxiety disorders led the list of illnesses reported by atypical workers , reports a thorough review in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry .
Workers in Australia , Canada , the UK and USA differed in which type of illnesses had more impact on either absenteeism or presenteeism , but were all affected by growing workplace disability .
Atypical casual workers ( casual workers get work when the employers has schedule openings , not when they ’d prefer to work , and have a hard time planning their life and bill payments around a work schedule that changes one week to the next ) reported depression and anxiety more often than those with permanent jobs , or fixed term contracts .
Quality of work matters .
In four studies comprising over 30,000 employees , researchers identified key areas .
High - demand ( workload , time pressure , and role conflict ) / low - autonomy factors , poor organizational justice ( is the work and management fair ? ) , and / or effort - reward imbalances ( “ effort includes responsibility , workload , and time pressures , whereas reward includes money , esteem , and career opportunities such as promotion and job security ” ) increased the risk of mental illness by 24 % to 63 % .
“ … a suboptimal job may contribute to depression ( the social causation hypothesis ) . ”
In another study , professionals and craftspeople were less depressed and anxiety - prone than labourers , clerks and sales workers .
In the editorial Half a Loaf :
Here we have summarized the findings of these studies and discussed their limitations and implications and conclude that treatment for mood disorders might hold promise for improving work performance , but more than treatment is required .
These two studies cast important light on the prevalence of mood disorders among workers and the associated disruption of work performance .
Many days of work productivity are lost , but time and treatment seem to reduce these losses .
Unfortunately , symptom remission associated with natural recovery and treatment is not sufficient to return depressed workers to full productivity .
If full recovery and productive work are the objective , additional workplace interventions and specific rehabilitation efforts must be added to effective treatment for mood disorders .
In psychologically unhealthy work environments that contributed to someone ’s mental decline , if they received treatment and then returned to an unchanged toxic work environment it set a relapse .
More workplace data here :
And nearly a quarter of Canadians work paid or unpaid overtime , according to Statistics Canada — an average of 8.5 extra hours per week .
According to Ipsos Canada , an average of two vacation days per employee go unused — and 10 % do n’t take any vacation days at all .
As a result , disability claims for stress and depression are skyrocketing .
According to Watson Wyatt , a firm that audits disability claims , psychological conditions like stress , anxiety , and depression are the leading causes of both short term and long term disability costs .
A report from the Global Business and Economic Roundtable on Addictions and Mental Health notes that up to 12 % of a typical company ’s payroll is lost to disability .
Some solutions proposed :
… encouraging employee control over timing of work tasks , redesigning jobs to reduce time pressures , and clarifying expected duties and outcomes .
Regarding the effort–reward model , restoring a balance between efforts and rewards may have positive mental health consequences .
Possible interventions are additional reward schemes , supervisor training in transmitting praise for good work , clear pathways to promotion , and access to training for career development .

The following Op - Ed article by Lee Spector appeared in The Boston Globe on August 29 , 2005 .

And now , digital evolution
By Lee Spector | August 29 , 2005
RECENT developments in computer science provide new perspective on '' intelligent design , " the view that life 's complexity could only have arisen through the hand of an intelligent designer .
These developments show that complex and useful designs can indeed emerge from random Darwinian processes .
Most scientists agree that the argument for intelligent design , which is over 200 years old , was put to rest by Darwin in 1859 and by the subsequent triumphs of 20th century biology .
Nonetheless , President Bush recently advocated teaching intelligent design in schools along with evolutionary theory .
School boards around the country , most notably in Kansas , are staking out similar positions .
What can account for the persistence of this long - discredited idea ?
Scientific illiteracy is certainly part of the explanation , but other factors are also at play .
Prominent among them is the fact that discussions about evolution are usually discussions about the origins of the discussants themselves .
We tend to hold our own species in high regard and to look down on random and mechanical processes .
Our appreciation for the magnificence of humanity , and of all life , is well grounded but it may also blind us in ways that we are not blinded when studying rocks or electricity .
Thanks to technology , however , we can now explore evolution without discussing ourselves and without even discussing life .
We can do this by building evolutionary processes into computer programs .
When we do this we do not find that our appreciation for the magnificence of life is in any way diminished .
Rather , we find that our appreciation for the power of evolution is amplified .
A growing sub -field of computer science is devoted to '' evolutionary computation . "
The user of such a system specifies the ingredients that can be used and how the ' ' goodness " of any particular design can be measured .
The system then creates and tests thousands or millions of random combinations of the ingredients .
The better combinations are allowed to produce '' children " by mutation ( random changes ) and recombination ( random part - swapping ) .
This often produces , after many generations , genuinely novel and useful designs and inventions .
Evolutionary computation has proven to be useful for solving practical problems .
It has been adopted by researchers and engineers , and it is the focus of scholarly journals and international conferences .
One of the major conferences offers cash prizes for '' human- competitive " results ; that is , for cases in which evolution has out - designed human beings .
To win the prize contestants must show that their systems equaled or improved upon the performance of humans as measured by such criteria as patents and peer - reviewed publications .
In 2004 I shared the ' ' gold medal " with a team from NASA that evolved an antenna for the Space Technology 5 mission .
My entry involved the evolution of quantum computing circuits , which are difficult for humans to understand or design .
More to the point , they are extremely difficult for ME to understand or design , and I could never have produced the results on my own .
I am not a designer equal to that task , but evolution is .
I created the ' ' primordial ooze " out of which quantum circuits could grow , and I wrote the programs for random variation and selection .
But evolution did the heavy lifting .
Of course biological evolution and evolutionary computation differ .
Engineers using evolutionary computation specify explicit measures of '' goodness " that govern selection , while biological selection is governed only by survival and the ability to reproduce .
In addition , biologists now understand that processes other than natural selection , for example symbiosis and influences during development , also contribute to evolution .
But evolutionary computation and biological evolution are both fundamentally driven by random variation and selection , and the successes of one hint at the power of the other .
It is easy to appreciate the power of selection operating on random variation when it is stripped of its emotion - laden connections to human origins and is shown to be capable of designing complex solutions to difficult problems .
If one extrapolates this power to a system the size of the Earth , then it may not be such a stretch to imagine that evolution could produce the stunning complexity and beauty of our biosphere .
Viewed in this light , Darwinian evolution is itself a designer worthy of significant respect , if not religious devotion .

The impeachment train is starting to roll .
Last week , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , started things off by filing a
three - article bill of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney .
Initially largely ignored by the mainstream media , and even ridiculed by
some leading Democrats in Congress , that bill , HR 333 , on Wednesday garnered
two co-sponsors , Rep. William Lacy Clay ( D - MO ) and Rep. Jan Schakowsky
( D - IL ) .
Schakowsky is deputy whip of the House , and is a member of the Democrats '
congressional leadership .
Her and Rep. Clay 's co-sponsorship of Kucinich's
bill give it a much stronger chance of being taken seriously in the House
Judiciary Committee headed by Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , and follow a week of
intense impeachment activities across the country .
The impeachment train is starting to roll .
Last week , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , started things off by filing a three - article bill of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney .
Initially largely ignored by the mainstream media , and even ridiculed by some leading Democrats in Congress , that bill , HR 333 , today garnered two co-sponsors , Rep. William Lacy Clay ( D - MO ) and Rep. Jan Shakowsky ( D - IL ) .
The two co-sponsors signing on to the bill give it a much stronger chance of being taken seriously in the House Judiciary Committee headed by Rep.
John Conyers ( D - MI ) , and follow a week of intense impeachment activities across the country .
A week ago , dozens of impeachment activists gathered on the steps of the main entrance to the Cannon House Office Building in a group press conference calling on Congress to back Kucinich 's impeachment bill , and to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Bush .
That same week , delegates to the annual convention of the California Democratic Party , the largest state chapter of the Democratic Party , overwhelmingly passed a detailed resolution calling for the impeachment of the president and vice president .
The resolution received the highest vote total of all the resolutions offered at that convention , and was a powerful message to California 's top Democrat , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who represents a district in San Francisco , that her own party wants action on impeachment , not a political dodge .
A few days later , on Saturday , Aug. 28 , impeachment groups across the nation held demonstrations , many of which featured protesters assembling to form giant letters spelling out the word " Impeach . "
While the mainstream media largely ignored those protests , the message was not lost on House Democrats .
The following day , Rep. John Murtha , a leader of the Democrats ' campaign to end the Iraq War , speaking on the CBS News program " Face the Nation , " declared that impeachment was one of the tools Congress has to influence the president .
Lest his statement be misconstrued as a slip of the tongue , Murtha , who is known to be a close political ally of Pelosi , repeated the statement on NPR the following day , this time saying pointedly that impeachment was " on the table " in Congress .
His choice of words was particularly significant , since Pelosi has been insisting for almost a year that under a Democratic Congress , impeachment of the president would be " off the table . "
It remains to be seen whether more members of the House will sign on to Kucinich 's bill , or whether other representatives will add new bills of impeachment of their own against the vice president .
Kucinich 's bill is narrow in scope , only citing three impeachable offenses : lying about Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction , lying about an alleged link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda , and illegally threatening war against Iran , a country that poses no imminent threat to the U.S. Certainly there are plenty of other grounds for impeaching Cheney , ranging from conspiracy to commit kidnapping and illegal torture of prisoner of war detainees and war profiteering to lying to Congress and orchestrating the theft of national elections .
Thirty - nine members of the House in the last Congress were co-sponsors of a bill submitted in late 2005 by Rep .
Conyers that called for an investigation into impeachable crimes by the president and vice president , and impeachment activists are now lobbying those members -- nearly all of whom were returned to office last November - - to join as co-sponsors of HR 333 .
Both Reps. Clay and Shakowsky had been co-sponsors of the earlier Conyers bill , signing on in January 2006 .
With frustration with President Bush 's insistence on endless war in Iraq , and with grassroots pressure for impeachment building , it is going to be harder and harder for the mainstream media to keep ignoring the impeachment story .
It is also going to be harder and harder for Democratic Party leaders to hold deter their more progressive members in the House from filing impeachment bills .

I was doing my best to ignore Tim O’Reilly ’s misguided effort to play hall monitor to the blogosphere , wishing it would just go away .
But unfortunately the New York Times did not ignore it .
How could it pass up a juicy opportunity to make us all look like the louts they all too often think we are ?
An above - the - fold , page - one headline in today ’s paper labeled his crusade “ A Call for Manners in the World of Nasty Blogs . ”
So O’Reilly only set us up to be called nasty , unmannered , and thus uncivilized hooligans .
Except for Tim , of course .
He ’s the nice one .
Me , I feel like the goth kid with premature tattoos skulking down the hall .
But the problems are far more fundamental and dangerous than that .
And just gratingly twinkie , too .
This effort misses the point of the internet , blogs , and even of civilized behavior .
They treat the blogosphere as if it were a school library where someone — they ’ll do us the favor — can maintain order and control .
They treat it as a medium for media .
But as Doc Searls has taught me , it ’s not .
It ’s a place .
And when I moved into the place that is my town , I did n’t put up a badge on my fence saying that I ’d be a good neighbor ( and thus anyone without that badge is , de facto , a bad neighbor ) .
I did n’t have to pledge to act civilized .
I just do .
And if I do n’t , you can judge me accordingly .
Are there rules and laws ?
Yes , the same ones that exist in worlds physical or virtual :
If I libel or defame you on the streetcorner or in a paper or on a screen , the recourse is the same .
But I do n’t put up another badge on my fence saying I wo n’t libel you .
I just do n’t .
That ’s how the world works .
Why should this new world work any differently ?
Why should it operate with more controls and more controllers ?
Go to Jimmy Wales ’ wiki where he and O’Reilly set up their code of conduct .
The earliest version was short and , thankfully , not terribly sweet .
But they did n’t know what they were starting .
They only opened the door for more people to come in and embroider the code with saccharine insipidness and their fondest wishes for laws that would take effect if only they ruled the world ( cue theme music ) .
The current version as of this writing ( which reflects O’Reilly ’s own post , where he adds his sheriff ’s badge ) begins :
We celebrate the blogosphere because it embraces frank and open conversation .
But frankness does not have to mean lack of civility .
We present this Blogger Code of Conduct in hopes that it helps create a culture that encourages both personal expression and constructive conversation .
One can disagree without being disagreeable .
I do n’t need anyone lecturing me and telling me not to be disagreeable .
I wo n’t take it from Continental clerks when flights are canceled .
I wo n’t take it from you .
I ’ll be disagreeable if I want to be .
And I am right now .
But it gets worse .
They argue for taking the public , transparent nature of this world and putting up opaque walls , saying that we should deal with people privately :
We wo n’t say anything online that we would n’t say in person .
If tensions escalate , we will connect privately before we respond publicly .
When we encounter conflicts and misrepresentation in the blogosphere , we make every effort to talk privately and directly to the person (s ) involved–or find an intermediary who can do so . . .
Oh , goodie , that ’s just what I want : trolls at the doorstep .
This is a public space .
That is its greatest strength .
That is the key to its credibility .
Tear down your walls .
I argue that newspapers should be dealing in public , transparently .
So should bloggers .
They also want to eliminate anonymous comments .
The latest code — an escalation of the earlier version , I should add — decrees : “ We do not allow anonymous comments . ”
My own stand on anonymity , stated frequently in this space , is that I will not give full respect and credence to things said by people who do not have the balls to stand behind their words .
When people complain that I ’m trying to get rid of the anonymous nature of the web , I say no , I would n’t do that .
I ’m simply telling you the way I judge your words when you ’re too chicken to put your name on them .
What ’s worse is the ignorance displayed by the latest code authors who define verification of identity this way :
“ We require commenters to supply a valid email address before they can post , though we allow commenters to identify themselves with an alias , rather than their real name . ”
Well , that gets us nowhere .
I can go to Yahoo and get an email account with a bogus name in 60 seconds .
That verifies nothing except that I have no life and have the time to do that .
I had a good discussion about this with Clay Shirky ’s NYU class last week .
I said that at first blush , I would like the option of using a system of verified identity .
I could read blog and forum comment only from people who had aforementioned balls and stood beside their words .
But with the students , we raised a number of problems .
If sufficient sites require verified identity then anonymity and the benefits that come from it — see bloggers in China , Iran , and Iraq — fade away .
And what is deemed to be verification of identity ?
My credit card , Social Security number , passport number ?
Who verifies that ?
What third party now has the power to certify or decertify me ?
What of my privacy and the ability to tie back to , say , my financial records ?
Identity is tricky .
I am real .
You know that .
I put my name and face on this blog .
People have met me .
They will verify my identity .
I stand behind my words and my mistakes and changes of heart are visible for all to see .
I leave most comments here untouched but I reserve the right and exercise the right to kill comments that are abusive , off - topic , or irritating .
I do that rarely but all know that I will do that .
You either trust me and respect me based on what I say here or you do not , and there are plenty in the latter camp .
Transparency and publicness are what drive that .
Not some silly code and badge .
But here ’s the real danger in this :
This code threatens to give back the incredible gift of freedom given us in Section 230 .
Go read about that .
Section 230 says that we are not responsible for content created by someone else on our sites .
It was created because before that , if a site said it would police content and missed something , it was held more liable than if it had not tried at all .
That came out of what was known as the Prodigy case .
The result was the site owners did n’t touch anything and so nastiness could only fester and grow .
So Section 230 holds that we cannot be held responsible for what others create and we have the right to kill what they do create on our sites .
That is vital — vital — to free speech because without that protection site owners would clamp down on all speech and try to control anything and everything that could possibly get them in trouble .
No open forums .
No real - time discussion .
No YouTube .
No MySpace .
No internet .
The Times describes the codes this way ( my emphasis ) :
A subtext of both sets of rules is that bloggers are responsible for everything that appears on their own pages , including comments left by visitors .
They say that bloggers should also have the right to delete such comments if they find them profane or abusive .
So imagine the challenge to Section 230 . . . .
A lawyer says to a blogger in the witness box : ‘ You put that badge on your site saying that you are responsible for everything on that site and you do kill comments that violate your code , which assures that no one will be libeled or defamed , and yet you left up this comment ( wave printout menacingly ) that defamed my good client . ’
If I were that attorney , I would say that you waived the protection of Section 230 .
That would be dumb .
And dangerous .
I just spoke with a public radio reporter about another case of something bad happening on YouTube .
As all reporters do , this started with an effort to look for standards and rules and lines crossed .
I said that the lines are the same as in real life .
But reporters make the mistake of judging the internet in their own image : as a medium that can be , should be , and is controlled , sanitized for our protection .
The internet is not that ; it ’s not a magazine or newspaper or radio show or library .
It ’s a place .
It ’s our place .
And we will behave in it as we do on our other place .
Most of us are good and adhere to the rules of civilization .
Some do n’t .
The difference is that our place called the internet and the blogosphere is judged according to the worst of us :
It is , to quote the Times , “ a World of Nasty Blogs . ”
Note that it was only at the end of the Times story that we heard any dissent or caution about this code .
Robert Scoble , a popular technology blogger who stopped blogging for a week in solidarity with Kathy Sierra after her ordeal became public , says the proposed rules “ make me feel uncomfortable . ”
He adds , “ As a writer , it makes me feel like I live in Iran . ”
Amen , brother blogger .
: See also these people I know and trust and for whom I need no badges to recognize their authority and civility ( especially since they agree with me on this ) : Rex Hammock
However , when it comes to my personal blog , a “ code of conduct ” is something I practice on a personal level , not something someone drafts for me .
That said , I do think having model guidelines for those who create community - space projects or forums is a good thing .
I do n’t like “ seals of approval , ” however I do like good suggestions , recommendations and idea - exchanges on issues like this .
Dave Winer :
Of course the NY Times could n’t resist putting it on page one since it confirms their assertion that the blogosphere is a bad place .
Maybe next time well - intentioned people will avoid the rush to perform for the big publications .
Michael Arrington :
I ’m not turning off anonymous comments , I ’m not going to always try to talk privately with someone before i write , and I ’m also not going to allow a mob to decide what types of words constitute “ unacceptable content . ”
And I ’m certainly not putting a badge on my site that says whether I comply or not .
The code of conduct and the mass of bloggers lining up behind it scares me a lot more than the hate comments and death threats I ’ve received in the past .
I wo n’t support it .
Juan Antonio Giner in the comments :
Let me add that as someone that holds a Journalism degree but also a PhD in Law , that “ the best law is no law . ” Period .
Matthew Ingram ’s headline says it all : “ You are your code of conduct . ”
Robert Scoble :
I do find disquieting the social pressure to get on board with this program .
Tim O’Reilly is a guy who really can affect one ’s career online ( and off , too ) .
I do have to admit that I feel some pressure just to get on board here and that makes me feel very uneasy .
Kent Newsome :
Here ’s an Idea : Just Be Nice
Rather than try to recreate the world , how about just apply the real world rules of common sense and courtesy to the blogosphere .
Everyone interacts with other people all day every day in the real world , and we do n’t need Tim O’Reilly to rewrite the Golden Rule for us .
Seth Finkelstein :
You can proclaim peace - and - love all you want , the people who gain by advocating war - and - hate , or are personally nasty as a character trait , wo n’t care , except to the extent that they can posture over it .
And then there ’s Anil Dash , whom I also know , like and trust , disagreeing with me in the comments :
I agree that a blog is a place .
Are you saying you want to live in a place where anonymous threats of violence are acceptable , commonplace , and unpunished ?
Is n’t that contradictory with the whole war - on - terror thing ?
And how does a few people signing a pledge change that ?
Do the miscreants sign it ?
It ’s a feel - good thing that is not only meaningless but , again dangerous — for all the reasons I list above and one more :
It makes you think that you ’ve solved a problem just because you signed a pledge and posted a badge .
I worked for many years in magazines and newspapers , where they sign all kinds of pledges from all sorts of industry organizations .
But they were empty .
I saw people who ’d signed them do plenty of things that I found unethical and I quit one job — the most visible job of my career , at Entertainment Weekly — over this .
I saw workers in those industries get to ridiculous detail about some fine point of the pledge and miss the big picture .
Those magazine editors would never put a Ford ad next to a story that mentioned Ford because the pledge said they should n’t .
But I saw those same people ( all of them gone now ) sell their company ’s soul when they tried to make us nicer to entertainment at the same time the company was merging with an entertainment empire .
Years before , another editor I respect greatly , Pat Ryan , protected me from such pressure when I wrote reviews critical of the company new division , HBO .
No pledge covered these cases .
Judgment and ethics did .
By the way , when I left that job , as I believe I ’ve mentioned here before , I did not receive the standard three years ’ salary , bonus , and benefits magazine editors got because I refused to sign the company ’s shutup clause ( which I found doubly abhorrent coming from a journalistic organization ) .
Then , as now , I believe in transparency .
I retained the right to tell you the story I just told you .
I would n’t sign this pledge , either .
These pledges are all the more dangerous because big-media people think they are ethical and we ’re not because they have pledges and we do n’t .
Let ’s not fall in that trap .
You have to make ethical judgments every day with every thing you do and no pledge is going to help you do that .
Your mother either did that job — or did n’t .
: One more thing ( that ’s a lie ; I ’ll probably have more things later ) :
Making a pledge for somebody else often does n’t work .
My town passed a silly law and wasted money making silly signs declaring it a “ frown - free zone . ”
Everytime I see that sign , I frown .
And growl .
That ’s what happens if you try to tell me what you think I should do .
: LATER : I got a call from a reporter doing a story on all this .
His angle : Bloggers do n’t want a code because we want to , in his words , spout off .
I spouted off at him .

今号の問 題 図 1 に示す( 1) から( 3)までの麻雀（マージャン）の手牌があります。「あがり牌」はすべて山からツモったものとし，リーチはかけていません。またドラやハイテイ＊1なども関係ないものとします。これらの役を判定して，親の場合の点数を計算するプログラムを作ってください。
図 1●(1) ～( 3)の役を判定して得点を計算してください
「 ややこしや～ややこしや～」というのは野村萬斎ですが，思わずそううなってしまうことがプログラミングをしているとよくあります。今回の麻雀の役判定は，考えれば考えていくほどややこしく，そうしたものの代表と言えるでしょう。排他処理や優先順位が複雑にからんでいて一筋縄ではいきません。
今回はややこしい組み合わせを解決する方法を考えてみます。麻雀になじみのない方も，ちょっとしたパズル気分で試してみてください。
麻雀の役を考え る
麻雀を知らない方のためにルールをおおざっぱに説明しておきましょう＊2。麻雀の牌には，大きく分けて「萬子（マンズ） 」「索子（ソウズ） 」 「筒子（ピンズ）」と，文字通り字が書いてある「字牌」があります。萬子，索子，筒子はそれぞれ1～9まであり，ここでは「一萬」「二萬 」
「三索」のように記述します＊3。字牌は「東 」 「南 」 「西 」 「北 」 「白 」 「発 」 「中」の7種類です。これら34種類の牌がそれぞれ4枚ずつあるので，牌の総数は136枚になります。
ゲーム開始時には，これらを4人のプレーヤに13枚ずつ配って手牌とします。ゲームは各プレーヤが山（配った残りの牌）から一つ牌を取り（「ツモる」と言います），手牌からいらない牌を一つ捨てることで進行します。このほか，自分の手牌中の2枚とほかのプレーヤが捨てた1枚を組み合わせて後述する刻子/順子ができる場合は，ツモる代わりにその牌をもらうことができます。これを「なく」といいます。
これを繰り返し，手牌＋ツモった牌または別のプレーヤの捨て牌の計14枚が特定の組み合わせ（「役」と言います）になればあがることができます。ツモった場合は残り3人のプレーヤから，捨て牌であがった場合は捨てたプレーヤから役の種類と手配に応じた点数をもらえます。これらをそれぞれ「ツモ 」「ロン」と言います。
標準的なあがり役の場合 ，「3個ずつの組み合わせ」×4組＋「2個同じ牌（「頭」と言います）」という組み合わせ（面子と言います）になります（図2）。「3個ずつの組み合わせ」には，3個とも同じ牌の「刻子（コーツ）」，123，789のように番号が連続している「順子（シュンツ）」があります。また同じ牌が2個ある場合は「対子（トイツ）」と言います。こうした組み合わせに当てはまらない牌を「浮き牌」といいます。
図2●一般的なあがりの形。3枚組の「刻子」または「順子」を4個と2枚組の「頭」で構成される
ゲームでは，この三つの組み合わせ方を目指していくので，「あと1枚であがる」という場面では，だいたい形が決まってきます。対子の片割れを1枚待つ「単騎（タンキ）待ち」，順子のうち両側のいずれかに牌がくればあがる「両面（リャンメン）待ち」などがあります。これをまとめて「待ち」といいます。
役は表1に示したものがあります。一気通貫など牌の組み合わせで決まる役もあれば，天和など偶然性の強いものもあります。それぞれの役には，得点に関係する「飜数（ハンスウ）」が決められており，難しい役ほど飜数が高くなっています。複数の役が付く場合は，それぞれの飜数の合計がその手の飜数になります。加えて，1回のゲームごとに「ドラ」と呼ばれる牌がランダムに決まり，それが手牌にあるとそのぶん飜数が増えます。たまにドラ13という手をあがってひんしゅくを買う私です＊4。
あがり役の組み合わせで例外的なのは「 七対子 」 「 国士無双 」 「十三不塔」です。この三つは先ほどの4組×頭一つの組み合わせにはなりません。
得点を求めるには，まず手牌から「符」というものを計算します。符は基本となる20点（符）に，面子の状態と待ちの形から決まる「追加点」を加えたものになります。詳しい説明は麻雀の入門書などに譲りますが，おおざっぱに言えば作りにくい面子やあがりにくい待ちの場合に追加点が付くと考えていいでしょう。例えば順子には点が付かないのに対し，字牌の刻子をないて作った場合には1組について4点，なかずに作った場合には8点が追加されます。同様に，待ち牌が2種類ある両面待ちは0点，1種類しかない単騎待ちは2点が加算されます。
こうして計算した符の1の位を切り上げてから，それに2の（役の飜数の合計＋2）乗を掛け合わせ，さらに10の位を切り上げた値がプレーヤがもらえる得点になります＊5。プレーヤが親の場合は得点がこの1.5倍になります。ただし，役の飜数の合計が5以上のときなど，子の得点が8000（親の場合は12000）を超える場合は8000が上限になり，これを満貫と呼びます。これより上は飜数だけで得点が決まり，6飜，8飜，11飜以上の場合の子の得点は12000，16000，24000になります（それぞれハネ満，倍満，3倍満と言います）。
処理を区間ごとに分けて役判定を行う
役の判断は，単純そうに見えて意外と問題になるところが数多くあります。そのなかで最もパズルっぽい要素を持つのが頭/刻子/順子の見分け方です。手軽な方法としては「2個あったら頭」「3個あったら刻子」
「いまの地点から三つ数が連続していたら順子」といった判定を先頭から繰り返していくことが考えられます。でもこの方法では，図1(1)の「223334445」を正しく判断できません。「頭かどうか 」「刻子かどうか 」 「 順子かどうか」という順序で先頭から判定を行うと，2を頭，3と4を刻子と判断して5が余ってしまうからです。このように，その牌だけ見ても頭/刻子/順子のどれであるかがすぐに決まらない場合は，浮き牌がなくなるような組み合わせを探すという，一種の探索処理が必要になります。
加えて，役によって同時に成立したりしなかったりする点にも注意が必要です。例えば七対子と二盃口は同時に成立しません。どちらとも判定できるなら，二盃口と判断した方が飜数やほかの役との組み合わせで七対子よりも得点が高くなる可能性が高そうです。こんなときはトータルで高い方の役を採用するというルールがあるので，最終的な判断は得点を出してからになります。このほか，混老頭はトイトイとも判定できてしまいますが，混老頭だけとして判断させるといった処理が必要です。
今回のプログラムでは，これらの問題をどう解決するかがカギになります。得点計算は，「面子を調べる」「役を調べる 」
「得点を得る」という流れになるでしょう。このとき，各段階で一つだけ最適なものを得るよりも，面子や役の構成がデータとして複数あってもいいようにまとめたいところです。そうすると得点を得るところで，最終的な判断ができるようになります。また例外的なケースは早めに調べてほかの処理を行わないようにするのが普通ですが，こうした例外処理をあまり増やしてしまうと各段階をまたぐようになり，処理がややこしくなる原因になってしまいます。
こうしてみると， 「処理を区間ごとに分けて考える」ことにするとよさそうです。まず全体の流れを「あがりの形を得る」「役を得る 」「得点を計算する 」 「最も高い手を採用する」という四つの区間に分けることにします。各区間では次の区間に必要なデータを作ることに専念して，区間ごとの処理での移動やスキップをしないようにします。例えば「あがりの形を得る」ところでは，考えられる面子の組み合わせをすべて作成し，「役を得る」区間に渡します。
各区間は次の区間の処理で使えるように「 面子の状態 」「役の構成 」 「得点」などといったデータを作れるだけ作ります。ベルト・コンベア式に各区間でこれらの値を埋めた後，「最も高い手を採用する」ところでふるいにかけて最終的な結果を得ます。こうしておけば，それほどややこしくなりません。この方針に基づいてアルゴリズムを作ってみましょう。

Unless you want to be monitoring the backside of a display , this is a prime example of where not to install a security camera .
“ We ’re not saying we ’ve built a quantum computer , ” Andreas Fuhrer tells PhysOrg.com , “ but this is an important first step towards spin manipulation via the spin- orbit interaction . ”
Fuhrer , a scientist with the Department of Solid State Physics / Nanometer Consortium at Lund University in Sweden , points out that one way quantum information processing might come about is through the manipulation of spin states .
Fuhrer and his colleagues have directly measured spin - orbit interaction strength in a two - electron molecule along a nanowire made of indium arsenide ( InAs ) .
With the first example of tunable few - electron quantum dots in a material with strong spin - orbit interaction , they believe that spin - orbit based spin manipulation is a step closer to becoming reality .
Fuhrer worked with Fasth and Samuelson , also associated with the Solid State Physics / Nanometer Consortium , and with Golovach and Loss from the University of Basel in Switzerland to understand the spin - orbit interaction of electrons in quantum dots along a nanowire .
Their findings are published in a piece in Physical Review Letters titled , “ Direct Measurement of the Spin- Orbit Interaction in a Two - Electron InAs Nanowire Quantum Dot . ”
“ This is the first time tunable quantum dots with a single electron have been realized in indium arsenide nanowires , ” Fuhrer explains via email .
“ While other material systems often require complex gate arrangements to confine the electrons in artificial atoms , the nanowire basically has the confinement in two directions built in due to its nanoscale crosssection . ”
The scheme set up by Fuhrer and his colleagues works fairly simply .
Indium arsenide nanowires self - assemble during crystal growth into rods .
“ It ’s not a bulk semiconductor like some other materials used for this purpose , ” Fuhrer points out over the phone .
“ It is a really thin wire that is an ideal starting point for making quantum dots .
You can induce as many of these artificial atoms along the nanowire as you like and couple them to each other . ”
In addition , the spin - orbit interaction might allow the spin states of quantum dots to be manipulated merely by applying pulses to the gates that confine the electrons .
“ Usually six gates , or sometimes more , need to be used . ”
In the paper , Fuhrer and his coauthors use four gates , but they have data to show that it would work with two gates per quantum dot .
Additionally , most efforts to manipulate spin make use of conventional electron spin resonance , a technique that can be difficult to bring close to each individual quantum dot .
“ We expect that with our scheme it will be enough to pulse the gate . ”
Fuhrer then goes on to expound in greater detail through email : “ When the gate is pulsed , you jerk the electron to one side along the nanowire , and by the movement of the orbital part of the electron wavefunction , also rotate the spin because of the spin - orbit coupling .
This promises to be faster and easier than existing spin-manipulation techniques if we can demonstrate that spin states live long enough for computations to be feasible . ”
The main problem with this setup , Fuhrer admits , is that quantum information can be lost through decoherence .
Typically , the idea is to decouple the spin from everything , including orbital motion , in order to avoid destroying the quantum calculations .
“ We ’re hoping , though , that by strongly confining the electrons and by keeping track of the orbital energy levels , we can get around this . ”
Fuhrer says that realizing few - electron quantum dots in InAs is an important first step .
“ The next step is to measure the spin lifetimes and manipulate the spins . ”
He points out that within the next five to ten years efforts will be made to use such a setup for quantum information processing .
“ We still need to study this alternate option of spin state control .
It could offer the possibility of manipulating qubits more easily . ”

An Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning is an extraordinary piece on Bayes ' theorem that starts with this simple puzzle :
1 % of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer .
80 % of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies .
9.6 % of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies .
A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening .
What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer ?
This simple puzzle is not all that simple in practice .
Only 15 % of doctors , when presented with this situation , come up with the correct answer .
Can you come up with the correct answer -- without resorting to Google , the comments to this post , or reading the answer provided in the article ?
If so , congratulations .
You 're a natural initiate of the Bayesian Conspiracy .
For the rest of us , Bayes '
Theorem is a bit more difficult to grasp :
While there are a few existing online explanations of Bayes '
Theorem , my experience with trying to introduce people to Bayesian reasoning is that the existing online explanations are too abstract .
Bayesian reasoning is very counterintuitive .
People do not employ Bayesian reasoning intuitively , find it very difficult to learn Bayesian reasoning when tutored , and rapidly forget Bayesian methods once the tutoring is over .
This holds equally true for novice students and highly trained professionals in a field .
Bayesian reasoning is apparently one of those things which , like quantum mechanics or the Wason Selection Test , is inherently difficult for humans to grasp with our built - in mental faculties .
In computer science , it 's easy to demonstrate the immense power of Bayes ' theorem : it 's the basis for almost all spam filters in use today .
Bayesian email filtering was first publicized by Paul Graham 's A Plan for Spam in mid-2002 .
Most programmers know about Bayesian filtering now ; it 's the primary weapon in any modern Spam fighting toolkit .
What you may not know , however , is that there 's something even more effective than Bayesian spam filtering .
It 's eloquently described in William Yerazunis ' presentation The Spam Filtering Plateau at 99.9 % Accuracy and How to Get Past It ( also available in pdf paper form ) .
And it 's been implemented as the CRM114 Discriminator for years .
That technique is Markovian spam filtering :
How to change a Bayesian spam filter to a Markovian spam filter :
Change the feature generator from single words to spanning multiple words
Change the weighting so that longer features have more weight ( ie , longer features generate local probabilities closer to 0.0 and 1.0 )
The 2^2n weighting means that the weights are 1 , 4 , 16 , 64 , 256 , ... for span lengths of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ... words
In other words , where Bayesian filters examine the relationship between individual words , Markovian filters expand the scope to examine the relationship between words and phrases .
It 's a tweak , but a significant one that amplifies the accuracy of the already uncannily accurate Bayes ' theorem .
But the true power of Bayes ' theorem extends far beyond merely discriminating between spam and non-spam .
As the CR114 documentation notes , you can use these powerful statistical models to discriminate between .. well , just about anything :
Spam is the big target with CRM114 , but it 's not a specialized Email - only tool .
CRM114 has been used to sort web pages , resumes , blog entries , log files , and lots of other things .
Accuracy can be as high as 99.9 % .
In other words , CRM114 learns , and it learns fast .
Now perhaps you can understand why some people are so excited about Bayes ' theorem .
Maybe you see Bayes ' theorem , and you understand the theorem , and you can use the theorem , but you can't understand why your friends and / or research colleagues seem to think it 's the secret of the universe .
Maybe your friends are all wearing Bayes ' theorem T - shirts , and you 're feeling left out .
Maybe you 're a girl looking for a boyfriend , but the boy you 're interested in refuses to date anyone who " is n't Bayesian " .
What matters is that Bayes is cool , and if you do n't know Bayes , you are n't cool .
Why does a mathematical concept generate this strange enthusiasm in its students ?
What is the so - called Bayesian Revolution now sweeping through the sciences , which claims to subsume even the experimental method itself as a special case ?
What is the secret that the adherents of Bayes know ?
What is the light that they have seen ?
It 's not intuitive for most people , but look a little more closely , and I think you , too , will become an initiate of the Bayesian conspiracy .
Who 's that knocking ?
Jehovah 's Witnesses flock to the Bay Area
Eugene Lovelace leaves a pamphlet in the door where no one answered as members of the Oakland West Jehovah 's Witnesses fanned out across the neighborhood in Oakland , Calif . on Saturday , June 30 , 2007 to invite residents to the congregation 's annual " Follow the Christ " convention .
The three - day event , which includes sermons , songs and prayers , begins Friday , July 6 at the Cow Palace and is one of 287 conventions held across the country .

Who 's that knocking ?
Jehovah 's Witnesses flock to the Bay Area 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Roughly 70,000 Jehovah 's Witnesses are converging at the Cow Palace in Daly City for a series of conventions this summer , and they 'll be knocking on tens of thousands of doors along the way .
By the end of the summer , each believer will have attended a three - day convention that consists of intensive Bible study , prayer , song , mass baptisms and a biblical drama .
They also will have invited thousands of perfect strangers .
Those gathering at the Cow Palace will have tried to knock on every door from the Oregon border to Reno to the Central Coast .
It 's a process that will be repeated for 287 conventions in 75 cities around the nation this summer in the largest mobilization of the year for the nation 's 1 million Jehovah 's Witnesses .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are strict biblical literalists who say the Bible does not call for a celebration of Easter , Christmas or individual birthdays .
Save for the commemoration of Jesus ' Last Supper , the regional conventions are the most important events of the year for the faithful .
It all begins at front doors with people like Sybil Lovelace .
She will attend a Cow Palace convention beginning today .
For the past three weeks , Lovelace 's 105 - member congregation has canvassed 4,400 homes and 2,200 apartment units in West Oakland .
They customarily visit those same homes every three months , but the convention is a reason for one more trip .
Lovelace has been out knocking for all but three of the past 21 days .
She 's heard stories from front doors about a mother addicted to crack , a father returning from prison , and teenage girls suffering from low self - esteem .
It reminded Lovelace of her duty : to tell people about Jesus and his father , Jehovah .
There is urgency to her work .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that we are living in the " end times , " the final period before Armageddon , when wickedness and evil will be wiped off the Earth .
" It 's like a hurricane warning , " Lovelace said .
" You want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to understand what 's happening . "
Those who ignore the warnings , Jehovah 's Witnesses believe , will perish .
Jehovah 's Witnesses ' socializing with nonbelievers is often limited to their door - to - door work .
Their theology emphasizes life after Armageddon , often illuminated through paintings of Paradise in their worship halls .
The door - to - door proselytizing is a practice for which Witnesses have become both renowned and ridiculed .
Yet , despite the ubiquity of their door - to - door " witnessing , " their beliefs are largely unknown to others .
And in spite of their singularly religious mission and relatively separatist ethos , their imprint on constitutional law is pronounced .
Legal experts say Jehovah's Witnesses ' lawsuits to protect their beliefs have done more over the past century to protect First Amendment freedoms than any other organization .
The right to refuse to say the Pledge of Allegiance , the ability to pamphleteer without government monitoring and the expansion of the Bill of Rights into state law are among the many precedents established or strengthened by litigation by Jehovah 's Witnesses , said Professor Jesse Choper , a constitutional law expert at the UC Berkeley School of Law .
But for the average Jehovah 's Witness , it 's about saving souls .
Lovelace calls it her job .
The 53 - year - old mother of two daughters knocks on doors more than 70 hours a month , making her a " regular pioneer , " one of her church 's most active proselytizers .
She notes in a datebook which homes she 's visited .
She returns to homes where no one answers or where someone expresses interest .
The obstacles are small and large .
There are pit bulls and locked gates .
Last year , Lovelace walked onto a front porch just as a car drove up and a passenger began shooting at people standing on a nearby sidewalk .
She fled , but it only strengthened her resolve .
" That 's why we 're out with God 's word , " Lovelace said .
" If people come to know what Jehovah 's standards are and apply them and use them , they would n't have these shootings . "
Unlike many other faiths , Jehovah 's Witnesses do n't operate soup kitchens , social service organizations or hospitals .
Those institutions do good works , said Ray Vaden Jr. , 56 , the convention overseer for the events at the Cow Palace .
But that 's not the point .
" The best thing we can do is to share what we think is the best way of life , " said Vaden , a manager at a Silicon Valley computer hardware company .
Others , Vaden noted , believe social service work can temper society 's inequalities , but those efforts have not ended the need .
" Man has never been able to eradicate those injustices , " Vaden said .
Edith McDonald volunteers in a food pantry three days a week but said she does so primarily to get another venue to talk about the Bible .
She sees many social services as enablers of vice .
" The majority of them take the money and buy alcohol and drugs , " said McDonald , a West Oakland resident who also belongs to Lovelace 's congregation .
McDonald , 62 , said true salvation will come after Armageddon , when 144,000 people will be raised into heaven and others who are saved will live in an eternal paradise on Earth .
" In the long term , Jehovah is going to make sure there 's plenty of food , " she said .
On a recent morning , Lovelace rang the doorbell at the home of Leslie Bowling - Dyer , 38 .
They had a polite exchange .
Bowling - Dyer later told a reporter that she objects to how Jehovah 's Witnesses imply that " they alone have come upon some true revelation . "
" I find that kind of exclusivity kind of suspect , " said Bowling - Dyer , who has spent the last 13 years doing campus ministry around the Bay Area and is getting her master 's in divinity at the American Baptist Seminary of the West in Berkeley .
Bowling - Dyer said Christian social obligation was dictated by Jesus , who said followers would be judged based on how they treated prisoners , the hungry and the sick .
Jehovah 's Witnesses , she said , focus too much on the individual and the afterlife , forgetting that real needs exist around them that they may be able to alleviate .
" It 's our responsibility as Christians to try and be involved in addressing those things and to take them into consideration , " she said .
Lovelace sees it differently .
" Jesus healed the sick and fed the hungry , but the main thrust of his teaching was God 's kingdom and what God 's kingdom will do on a permanent basis , " she said .
She measures success carefully .
If she can share one Bible verse with one person , Lovelace believes she 's been successful .
After 33 years of door - to - door proselytizing , Lovelace can count five people she 's led to Bible study , which led to baptism .
She said biblical knowledge helped one person stop having sex outside of marriage , become a more responsible parent , and put down the bottle .
" You ca n't put a price tag on a life , " she said .

FreeBSD Setting up Firewall using IPFW
Q. I ’m new to FreeBSD and am trying to configure the firewall using IPFW , but I ’m having a hard time understanding it as compare to Linux .
Can you provide a small example on how to go about setting up the rules for a typical FreeBSD based Apache Web server ?
A. Ipfirewall ( ipfw ) is a FreeBSD IP packet filter and traffic accounting facility .
ADVERTISEMENTS
IPFW is included in the basic FreeBSD install as a separate run time loadable module .
The system will dynamically load the kernel module when the rc.conf statement firewall_enable = ” YES ” is used .
FreeBSD compile kernel for IPFW
This step is optional .
You do not need to compile IPFW into the FreeBSD kernel unless you want NAT function enabled .
However some old version may not have IPFW compiled .
Here is a quick guide to compile kernel with IPFW .
Make sure IPFW support not compiled into the kernel :
#ipfw list
If you get an error that read as follows , you must now compile the source code for the kernel .
ipfw : getsockopt( IP_FW_GET ) : Protocol not available
Another option is open default kernel config file / usr / src / sys / i386 / conf and look for IPFIREWALL option :
# grep IPFIREWALL /usr / src/sys/i386/conf
Building and Installing a Custom Kernel with IPFW
Copy default kernel file :
# cd /usr/ src/sys/i386/conf
# cp GENERIC IPFWKERNEL
Add IPFW support :
# vi IPFWKERNEL
Append following directives :
options IPFIREWALL # required for IPFW
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE
# optional ; logging
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=10 # optional ; do n't get too many log entries
options IPDIVERT
# needed for natd
Save and close the file .
Building a Kernel , type following commnds :
# cd /usr / src
# make buildkernel KERNCONF=IPFWKERNEL
Install the new kernel :
# make installkernel KERNCONF=IPFWKERNEL
Now reboot the system :
# reboot
Step # 1 : Enabling IPFW
Open /etc/rc.conf file
# vi /etc/rc.conf
Append following settings :
firewall_enable = " YES "
firewall_script="/usr/local/etc/ipfw.rules "
Save and close the file ..
Step # 2 Write a Firewall Rule Script
You need to place a firewall rules in a script called /usr / local /etc/ipfw.rule :
# vi /usr / local/etc/ipfw.rules
Append following code :
IPF =" ipfw - q add " ipfw -q -f flush #loopback $ IPF 10 allow all from any to any via lo0 $ IPF 20 deny all from any to 127.0.0.0/8 $ IPF 30 deny all from 127.0.0.0 / 8 to any $ IPF 40 deny tcp from any to any frag # statefull $ IPF 50 check - state $ IPF 60 allow tcp from any to any established $ IPF 70 allow all from any to any out keep - state $ IPF 80 allow icmp from any to any # open port ftp ( 20,21 ) , ssh ( 22 ) , mail ( 25 ) # http ( 80 ) , dns ( 53 ) etc $ IPF 110 allow tcp from any to any 21 in $ IPF 120 allow tcp from any to any 21 out $ IPF 130 allow tcp from any to any 22 in $ IPF 140 allow tcp from any to any 22 out $ IPF 150 allow tcp from any to any 25 in $ IPF 160 allow tcp from any to any 25 out $ IPF 170 allow udp from any to any 53 in $ IPF 175 allow tcp from any to any 53 in $ IPF 180 allow udp from any to any 53 out $ IPF 185 allow tcp from any to any 53 out $ IPF 200 allow tcp from any to any 80 in $ IPF 210 allow tcp from any to any 80 out # deny and log everything $ IPF 500 deny log all from any to any
Save and close the file .
Step # 3 : Start a firewall
You can reboot the box or you could reload these rules by entering on the command line .
# sh /usr / local/etc/ipfw.rules
Task :
List all the rules in sequence
Type the following command :
# ipfw list

Forget the cursor flaw , last night 's news from Microsoft is a nasty exploit in its Domain Name System ( DNS ) Server Service that would allow a malicious user to obtain SYSTEM rights .
At first look this may not look like much of an issue — after all , most users do not run the DNS server component on their home machines — but for those of us in corporate IT , this is a nightmare .
As you may know , Active Directory relies on DNS .
It relies on DNS to the point that if you do n't have a DNS server when you first create AD it prompts you to make your first Domain Controller a DNS server .
Since a lot of folks set up their network with defaults , that means there are a heck of a lot of Domain Controllers out there vulnerable to this , which means not only would an evil net gremlin have access to your server , but they'd have access to some of the most sensitive information on your network , including the ( highly encrypted ) database that holds all your user information .
Microsoft does add some tips for preventing the exploit , but unfortunately they all have to do with locking down the RPC service on the server , which means you 'd have no way to do remote administration .
Since the problem is on DNS servers , they are very likely to be scattered geographically which means you'd be shooting yourself in the foot to protect your servers from the exploit .
Microsoft also recommends use of a firewall to block " All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports between 1024 to 5000 . "
That 's not a very good idea on a Domain Controller since it would kill all RPC , not to mention Remote Desktop and a host of other applications .

KENNER , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
A man who pulled a hoax on Louisiana officials and 1,000 contractors by presenting himself as a federal housing official said Monday he intended to focus attention on a lack of affordable housing .
" We basically go around impersonating bad institutes or institutes doing very bad things , " said the man , who identified himself as Andy Bichlbaum , a 42 - year - old former college teacher of video and media arts who lives in New York and Paris .
" That would be HUD .
At this moment , they 're doing some really bad things . "
Masquerading as Rene Oswin , an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development , Bichlbaum followed Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to the lectern Monday morning at the Pontchartrain Center in Kenner .
In a speech to attendees of the Gulf Coast Reconstruction and Hurricane Preparedness Summit , he laid out grandiose plans for HUD to reverse course .
After the speaker read from a text he said had been prepared by his boss , HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson , a HUD spokeswoman said the department knew nothing about the man .
" Everything is going to change about the way we work , and the change is going to start here today in New Orleans , " the man said during his speech .
Jackson , he said , had had to cancel his appearance at the meeting of 1,000 builders and contractors at the Pontchartrain Center in Kenner because he had to stay in Washington to meet with President Bush .
William Loiry , president of meeting sponsor Equity International , said he was duped .
" We were contacted about a week ago or so by someone who we believed to be [ public relations firm ]
Hill & Knowlton [ saying ] that they were representing the HUD secretary and that he wanted to make a major announcement at this summit . "
Loiry said he was told a few minutes before he had planned to introduce Jackson that the secretary would be replaced by Oswin .
" We 've done 75 national conferences , 25,000 people participated , and we certainly never encountered anything like this before , " he said .
The man left a flier bearing a HUD emblem that said attendees could go to a ribbon - cutting ceremony at a public housing project .
A free lunch and transportation aboard buses were promised .
" They never materialized , " Loiry said .
Loiry was not impressed with the stunt .
" There are many people still in need , " he said in a written statement .
" To perpetuate a hoax on them is cruel and disgusting . "
Impostor : ' We have failed '
In his speech , Bichlbaum said the department 's mission was to ensure affordable housing is available for those who need it .
" This year , in New Orleans , I 'm ashamed to say we have failed , " he said .
To change that , HUD would reverse its plans to demolish 5,000 units " of perfectly good public housing , " with housing in the city in tight supply , he said .
Former occupants have been " begging to move back in , " he said .
" We 're going to help them to do that . "
The government 's practice had been to tear down public housing where it could , because such projects were thought to cause crime and unemployment , he said .
But crime rates in the city are at a record high and there is no evidence that people in the projects are more likely to be unemployed , he said .
The man added that it also would be essential to create conditions for prosperity .
Toward that end , he said , Wal - Mart would withdraw its stores from near low - income housing and " help nurture local businesses to replace them . "
Wal - Mart was unmoved .
" As evidenced by the fact that we recently reopened two stores in the New Orleans metropolitan area , there is absolutely no truth to these statements , " said spokeswoman Marisa Bluestone .
In a comment that elicited applause from the contractors and builders , Bichlbaum said , " With your help , the prospects of New Orleanians will no longer depend on their birthplace , and the cycle of poverty will come to an end . "
Finally , to ensure another hurricane does not inundate the city , Exxon and Shell have promised to spend $ 8.6 billion " to finance wetlands rebuilding from $ 60 billion in profits this year , " he said .
HUD : ' Who the heck is that ?'
Late Monday afternoon , in a telephone call with CNN , Bichlbaum said the gist of his comments about housing was truthful , even if he had to use subterfuge to deliver it .
" The only not - true part is , unfortunately , the part about them changing their minds .
They are still going to tear down 5,000 units of affordable housing , " he said .
The New Orleans projects are sturdily constructed brick buildings that , nevertheless , are slated for demolition , he said .
" Basically , the real reason , of course , is they want to develop New Orleans into something pleasing to tourists -- even more pleasing . "
Bichlbaum said Monday 's prank was the latest in a series pulled off by The Yes Men , whose members have recently masqueraded as representatives of McDonald 's , Halliburton and Dow Chemical .
" Fortunately , the law protects freedom of speech , " he said .
" What we 're doing is not actually lying .
It 's actually exposing the lies .
There 's nothing morally wrong with what we 're doing . "
Bichlbaum said The Yes Men plan to release a movie about their exploits next year , but that commercial gain is not their goal .
" The real reason we do it is what we 're doing right now , " he told a reporter .
" You 're paying attention to this issue of affordable housing and the absurd policies of HUD . "
In Washington , HUD spokeswoman Donna
White called the hoax " sick . "
" This announcement is totally false ; it 's totally bogus , " said Donna White in Washington .
No one named Rene Oswin works for the department , she said .
" I 'm like , who the heck is that ? "
Jackson ,
White said , had never planned to address the meeting .
" I do n't even want to refer to it as a joke , " White said .
" At this point , it 's not funny . "
Annie Chen , media coordinator for Survivors Village , a tent - city protest for the reopening of public housing in New Orleans , applauded Bichlbaum 's theatrics .
" Right now , a lie is better than the truth , " she said .

Steven Spielberg 's 1977 Close Encounters of the Third Kind is regarded by some ufologists as part of a U.S. - government project to get the public used to the idea of friendly aliens .
" Flying saucer " – the term – was coined 60 years ago , when salesman and pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine objects flying in a " V " formation over Mount Rainier , Washington .
Arnold told a reporter on June 24 , 1947 , that the UFOs flew erratically , fluttering and tipping their wings , like " a saucer if you skip it across water " – and a worldwide subculture was born .
In the six decades since , flying saucers have inspired scores of movies , TV shows and a mini publishing industry .
They 're supposedly the source of crop circles and cattle mutilations , and they 've spawned several cults and a minor religion .
Fodder for government commissions , both real and imagined , the mysterious vehicles have also fed government conspiracy theorists , who believe we 're being lied to .
" The evidence is overwhelming that some UFOs are intelligently controlled ET spacecraft , " says Stanton Friedman , a leading ufologist , who argues further " that the subject represents a cosmic Watergate , that there are no good arguments against these conclusions and that flying saucers and the worldwide government cover - up are the biggest story of the millennium .
" I do n't worry much about convincing skeptics , " Friedman says .
" Those who are willing to look at the scientific evidence will be convinced . "
Of course , aliens and UFOs were around long before " flying saucer " was coined .
UFOs have been seen for centuries , regarded as spirits , angels , dragons , phantom airships and ghost aircraft .
In 1938 , Orson Welles ' radio dramatization of The War of the Worlds created mass hysteria .
During World War II , allied pilots often reported seeing balls of light following their aircraft .
They were nicknamed " foo fighters " and were regarded as German secret weapons .
Shortly after the war , ghost rockets were seen throughout Europe .
In 1946 , at least 1,000 ghost - rocket sightings were reported in Sweden alone .
But never have flying saucers been a bigger part of the zeitgeist than they are now .
In 2002 , a Roper poll found that one in seven U.S. citizens claim to have seen a UFO or know someone who 's had an alien encounter .
A recent survey estimated half the U.S. population believes the media is conditioning the public for our first alien encounter .
Every year , thousands of UFO sightings are made worldwide .
The numbers reported to the authorities or media are difficult to gauge – and even the most die - hard ufologists admit that the majority of sightings can be explained as aircraft , mirages balloons , snow showers or orographic clouds .
Author Jenny Randles has written 50 books on UFOs and the paranormal , but found no evidence of alien visitors or government cover - up .
One reliable source , the U.S. Air Force 's Project Blue Book , a massive 20 - year study of flying saucers , received 15,000 UFO reports between 1952 and 1970 .
In 1997 , members of the Heaven 's Gate cult , led by Marshall Herff Applewhite , committed mass suicide , believing they would be spirited away on a flying saucer .
Longer - lived UFO cults include the Aetherius Society and the International Raelian Movement , founded in 1974 by Rael , aka Claude Vorilhon , a former French motor - racing writer .
Rael was told by an alien called Eloha that the human race was the product of DNA experimentation and that the Bible and other religious texts actually refer to contact with aliens rather than with God and his messengers .
Rael , who thinks he is related to Jesus and Muhammad , has managed to attract several thousand followers , who are planning to make their headquarters in Las Vegas .
The writings of Erich von Däniken , much like Rael , claim that alien astronauts who visited Earth were mistaken for gods and included in legends , folklore and religious texts and rituals .
Days after Arnold 's sighting , in July 1947 , the Roswell Daily Record claimed that the Roswell Army Air Field had recovered a crashed flying saucer .
The Army explained the crash as the wreckage of a weather balloon .
The incident was largely forgotten until the late 1970s , when eyewitnesses began to come forward claiming the balloon was an alien craft .
The Roswell case has become the foundation stone for belief that the U.S. government secretly recovered alien technology and collaborated with extraterrestrials .
The Air Force has always denied this , and it published The Roswell Report : Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert to detail its side of the argument .
In 1948 and 1949 , strange green fireballs were seen exploding over the skies of New Mexico .
Many feared they were guided missiles sent by the Soviet Union .
However , a conference organized by the Air Force concluded that they were unusual meteors .
The '50s saw a rash of " contactees , " who claimed they had meetings with aliens and rode in their spaceships .
The most famous contactee was George Adamski , who allegedly met an alien called Orthon in the California desert Nov. 20 , 1952 .
These " friendly " space people warned of the dangers of scientific progress and gave spiritual messages for humanity .
The themes were reflected in many flying saucer movies of the time , such as The Day the Earth Stood Still ( Robert Wise , 1951 ) .
In Brazil , farmer Antonio Villas Boas claimed a space woman captured and raped him in 1957.11
Sex with aliens is a recurring theme in abduction stories going back to the '50s .
Amateur UFO groups and clubs began cropping up .
In the United States , the two most important groups were the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization , or APRO , founded by Jim and Coral Lorenzen in 1952 , and the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena , or NICAP , which began in 1956 .
NICAP , under the leadership of UFO author Donald E. Keyhoe , supported the idea that UFOs were extraterrestrial craft .
Many also allege that the Air Force has tried to cover up evidence of UFOs .
Ironically , many CIA operatives were NICAP members , including Vice Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter , who sat on the board of directors until 1962 .
The contactees were largely ignored by scientific UFO investigators until the case of Betty and Barney Hill , who reported seeing a UFO following their car the night of Sept. 19 , 1961 .
When they returned home , they found they could n't remember a long section of their journey .
Under hypnosis , the couple recalled being abducted and subjected to intimate medical examinations .
Their situation came to worldwide attention when John G. Fuller published The Interrupted Journey in 1966 .
In 1969 , the Colorado University UFO Project , headed by Dr. Edward Uher Condon , published the results of a two - year study of UFO files collected by the Air Force 's Project Blue Book .
The Condon Report concluded that the study of UFOs was not scientifically valuable and the Air Force closed down the project .
Ufologists have always regarded Condon 's report as a whitewash .
Astronomer J. Allen Hynek , an adviser to the project , was so dissatisfied with its findings that he created the Center for UFO Studies in 1974 to continue the scientific study of UFOs .
Despite Condon 's findings , UFOs still fascinated the public , and reported sightings continued .
In the '70s , abduction reports escalated sharply .
Steven Spielberg 's Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1977 is regarded by some ufologists as part of a U.S. - government - backed project to get the public used to the idea of friendly aliens .
The film had such an impact on the British House of Lords that it held a three - hour debate on alien abductions in 1979 .
Her Majesty 's government , however , decided UFOs were not alien spacecraft and were not a threat to the nation .
The '80s started with a bang .
The Roswell Incident , by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore , portrayed the Roswell crash as part of a much larger cover - up , and opened the floodgates for increasingly bizarre stories featuring the recovery of flying saucers and alien bodies .
This autographed sketch of the first " flying saucer " was made by Kenneth Arnold , the pilot whose UFO encounter in 1947 inspired the term .
Whitley Strieber 's reported abduction experiences , including an examination by anal probe , became the basis for the best - selling Communion : A True Story in 1987 .
The writings of Budd Hopkins , David Jacobs and John E. Mack reinforced the idea that millions of people are being regularly abducted .
Government conspiracy , alien abduction and Roswell fueled the highly successful TV series The X - Files ( 1993 - 2002 ) and films like Independence Day ( Roland Emmerich , 1996 ) and Men in Black ( Barry Sonnenfeld , 1997 ) .
During this period , ex- government whistle - blowers came forward .
In 1995 , Alien Autopsy , a film by Ray Santilli , was released .
The London filmmaker said he obtained it from an old U.S. cameraman .
It is supposed to be genuine footage of the autopsy of an alien corpse recovered from the Roswell crash of 1947 .
Most regard it as a hoax .
In 2000 , Alfred Webre 's book Exopolitics : Towards a Decade of Contact spawned Exopolitics , which has gained a lot of supporters who feel the existence of UFOs does not have to be scientifically proven .
They say there is enough evidence to accept that UFOs are spaceships piloted by extraterrestrials .
Their goal is to put pressure on the United States and other governments to disclose the truth that they have been secretly working with the aliens since the 1940s .
In 2005 , a large document allegedly written in the late 1970s came to light that claimed that six aliens were recovered from the Roswell crash .
An alien called EBE 1 was said to have survived and organized a team of specially trained humans to visit his home planet , Serpo .
The story goes that 12 humans stayed there from 1965 to 1978 , two remained and the others either died on the planet or when they returned to Earth .
The tale represents the flavor of contemporary UFO rumor .
" The vast majority of UFO sightings can be explained in mundane terms , writes UFO expert and author Jenny Randles .
" I have found almost no sustainable evidence that any UFO encounter is caused by alien visitors or spacecraft and no support for the idea that the powers that be are covering up anything much beyond their own ignorance as to the cause of the residue of unsolved cases . "

It 's Official : UFOs Are Just UAPs

Every act has moral and immoral potential .
The girl scout who helps an unsteady old man across the street could also have pushed him aside .
The aftermath of each action engenders a new range of moral possibilities .
Having pushed him aside , she might then regret her act and return to help him .
Even when we 've made bad choices , acted out of indifference or greed rather than compassion and generosity , another choice awaits us : how to compound or rectify the immoral act , stay the course or imagine how to salvage some measure of moral standing .
Since even a racist like George Wallace can have a Road to Damascus experience , anything is possible .
The immense immorality of the choice to attack Iraq , and base that choice in lies , propaganda , and fear is hardly news now .
But the fact that , above all else , it was a moral choice means that another moral choice is possible .
And only one choice would atone for the original .
This war will not end until the funding is cut off .
Anyone who would continue the funding to " support the troops , " should also tell you that once you make a moral mistake , keep making it , and that those who pay with their blood for your mistake are grateful for the support .
The logic of this position would also maintain that policy is made by soldiers and officers , not by the people , the Congress and the President .
None of the offered plans now before us to de-escalate the war disavow what we all know to be its original goals --- control of Iraq 's oil and the building of large , permanent US military bases in Iraq .
Nor do any of these bills address the central issue of accountability , the fact that this war is a war crime , a crime against our democracy , our Constitution , the Iraqi people , international law , and our own soldiers .
Without accountability , our democracy is meaningless .
Without moral action , our claim to integrity and respect are meaningless .
Our obligation as citizens is not to play political games with the Democrats or Republicans to help them position themselves for the next election .
Our obligation is to demand that the laws and ideals of this country be upheld .
The problem with the Iraq War is not that we are losing it and that we need a better strategy .
The problem is that we have no moral right to win it .
As bad as the colossal mismanagement , greed and corruption are , they are not the true issue .
Betrayal of the public trust is the issue .
Pre-meditated murder is the issue .
It is my deepest belief that the only good that may come from this disgraceful time in our history , will be the honest acknowledgement of how and why the country was mislead , followed by punishment for those responsible .
Without that justice , we will learn nothing and be easy prey for the next abuse of power .

It is horrible to think that our soldiers have died and been injured in vain .
However , if we demand accountability , demand impeachment , something honest will have been redeemed .
All that blood and those blasted bodies of beloved people may form the bulwark against future abuse .
In a sense freedom will have been won , democracy will be affirmed , justice will be established --- here .
No one can tell you what will happen when the US withdraws the troops .
Although , many did predict the chaos of insurgency and sectarianism that resulted from the attack .
But whatever happens after our withdrawal , it will be made easier if we involve international peacekeepers , remove our bases , forego any claim to the oil , and pay reparations .
The war is a moral and legal catastrophe and will continue to be .
But since we precipitated it , we can't pretend also to want to protect the Iraqis from it .
We can't .
We 're the cause of it .
This administration has acted from a position that denigrates human rights , legal rights , moral rights , the rights of decency , inalienable rights , privacy rights , civil rights , women 's rights , environmental rights , worker 's rights , and children 's rights .
The only right they have respected is the right of entitlement .
Their own .
Our only hope is to demand our rights , our rights as citizens , our rights to our ideals , our rights to a sense of morality .
The destruction of a small village in Vietnam was once explained away by our military as a village that had to be destroyed in order to save it .
That perversity became symbolic of the entire war .
Accurately .
The War on Iraq should now be described as a war that must be lost in order to save America .
That is our moral obligation .

It 's easy enough to find out how long copyrights last , but much harder to decide how long they should last — but that did n't stop Cambridge University PhD candidate Rufus Pollock from using economics formulas to answer the question .
In a newly - released paper , Pollock pegs the " optimal level for copyright " at only 14 years .
Pollock 's work is based on the promise that the optimal level of copyright drops as the costs of producing creative work go down .
As it has grown simpler to print books , record music , and edit films using new digital tools , the production and reproduction costs for creative work in have dropped substantially , but actual copyright law has only increased .
According to Pollock 's calculations ( and his paper [ PDF ] is full of calculations ) , this is exactly the opposite result that one would expect from a rational copyright system .
Of course , there 's no guarantee that copyright law has anything to do with rationality ; as Pollock puts it , " the level of protection is not usually determined by a benevolent and rational policy - maker but rather by lobbying . "
The predictable result has been a steady increase in the period of copyright protection during the twentieth century .
Because Pollock 's " optimal level for copyright " falls over time ( as production and reproduction costs fall ) , policy makers need to be especially careful when contemplating increased copyright terms .
It 's difficult to scale back rights that have once been granted , so " it is prudent for policy - makers to err on the low side rather than the high side when setting the strength of copyright . "
Neither the US nor the UK are in any danger of rethinking copyright law from scratch , but if they were looking for guidance in how to set up their systems , Pollock has it .
He develops a set of equations focused specifically on the length of copyright and uses as much empirical data as possible to crunch the numbers .
The result ?
An optimal copyright term of 14 years , which is designed to encourage the best balance of incentive to create new work and social welfare that comes from having work enter the public domain ( where it often inspires new creative acts ) .
Pollock has been an advocate for restricted copyright terms and stronger public domain for years ; we earlier spotlighted a brief essay of his on the " Value of the Public Domain " that is well worth a read .
His new work is getting some publicity too : it has already been highlighted by Boing Boing and will be presented at a conference in Berlin this week .
There had indeed been much hype about the film beforehand .
The trailers were looking stunning and the stills amazing .
Style was at the fore of the posters and pictures and the trailers and clips we 'd seen were suggesting much passion and posturing .
It looked epic .
Then came the news of the Berlin Film Festival .
There was a single report of booing and people leaving the cinema during the film .
It seemed it might have been a misleading campaign .
Then the next day the Warner Brothers release comes out and we find the film received a standing ovation at the end and applause during the film .
Who was right ?
The studio , or the slightly highbrow reviewer ?
I found out when I got to see the film early followed by an interesting Q&A with Zack Snyder himself .
Snyder introduced the film , and he really did n't have that much to say about it , apart from one clear message .
" I hope it 's loud , it 's much better when it 's loud , it 's distracting ! "
I laughed , and at the same time wondered if there was some truth in that statement .
The film rolled and there was no sound .
Suddenly , during the studio titles , the sound kicked in and Snyder 's concerns were cleared .
It was loud .
300 is based on Frank Miller 's graphic novel which tells the story of the battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC , where the King of Sparta led three hundred of his soldiers against the might of the Persian armies .
Vastly outnumbered they try to hold the wave upon wave of Persian attackers back and prevent from invading and enslaving their homeland , all the while the politics of their country keep the full army at home .
As soon as the film begins you can see the superb style , the colours , the effects of the skies , everything makes it look like a stylised comic , and it looks glorious .
What I thought was more amazing was how little it intruded on the film .
Perhaps that was because there was so much to see and , as Snyder had said , distract you from it , or perhaps you just become used to it early on , I 'm not sure .
Whatever the cause , you do feel that the style is an integral part of the film , it does n't detract or overbear at all , and that had been one of my earlier concerns .
It is fair to say the film looks superb , the visuals are amazing , not just the style but the framing of the shots , the choreography of the fights and set pieces , and the superb effect of speeding the film down and up during key moments .
Throughout the action sequences the camera will alter the speed of the film , so that one moment the enemy are tearing towards the Spartan in hordes at full speed , then it drops to slow motion as the Spartan engages an enemy and strikes his first blow .
This continues through the fighting and is used to great effect .
Never does it feel overused or out of place , and it's fair to say that for the audience the speed changes are spot on and perfectly used .
Combining these effects and styles together does give you the look of a comic book on screen .
If there was a process to bring a comic to life , this is the right way to do it .
Perhaps even the perfect way .
The action scenes are wild , amazingly conceived and choreographed .
The battle sequences are stunning to watch and you do feel yourself pulled into the moment .
A few times I would clench a fist and grit my teeth saying " yes ! " or " get him " just at a key moment , and I knew I was into the film .
However it does n't rest on the power of the action .
Back in Sparta there are battles of power and politics , and a good performance from the stunning Lena Headey .
The style is built through the scenes of the Spartan 's Oracle and the scenes of hedonism in Xerxes ' camp .
In both beauty and ugliness entwine , and in the Oracle scenes the slow motion style is applied in equal measure as the battle to great effect .
This is another aspect of the film , its sexiness .
Of course the pumped men in next to nothing will get the pulses racing , but it 's much smoother than that and far less in your face .
The scene of Leonidas making love to the Queen is superbly filmed and is far more real and touching than a lot of romantic Hollywood films , and yet it retains bags of sexuality .
The Oracle scene is another where the sexiness of the film comes through and it looks almost art like in its depiction .
These were beautiful moments .
It is a very well visualised , choreographed and scripted , but there are definitely a few moments where the script seems to slip away from the film .
There are moments when the characters leap into modern phrases or slang after a strong build up and it seems to just take the pay off away from the scene .
This happens a couple of times , most notably is the moment which is in the trailer where Leonidas says " we 're in for one hell of a night " and we just went through a big build up with the stacking of the bodies of the enemy .
In those moments the scene just falls flat .
However there are times when it works , and works well .
It has the effect of lightening the moments before another onslaught of stylised action , one of the best examples of this is the apple scene where levity is mixed with the brutal actions of the Spartan men .
It is funny , but it has the perfect tone and lends well to the pause in the action without killing the moment .
The acting throughout is superb and Gerard Butler really does pull out an excellent performance .
Vincent Regan is another actor who provides a storming performance equal of Butler , but it is Butler who commands the screen whenever he appears .
I 've heard a lot of comments that there 's nothing more than shouting attack lines to the camera , and I have to wholeheartedly disagree , there are a lot of these moments , after all these are soldiers trained to kill and die a hero 's death in battle .
Yet there 's a lot more to the performances than that .
Butler and Regan pour passion onto the screen ( and I do n't just mean the six packs and leather pouches ) , but manage to do so in measure .
There are scenes where you can see the fire inside them held back , waiting to burst out in the next battle , and it's these that are the most powerful moments .
Butler manages to capture some of the classic hero qualities and gives a performance that makes you feel like Kirk Douglas in Spartacus , or a classic Richard Burton role , he commands power and passion throughout the film .
There 's a lot of heart in the Spartan characters and nowhere is it shown better than in these two actor 's performances .
It actually feels like the actors are having fun during the film , especially during the more campy moments .
Finally I feel that the sound needs a mention on its own .
Not only does the soundtrack itself compliment the film superbly well , but the audio during the battle sequences is stirring and incredibly well created .
It lends so much reality to the scenes and makes everything feel so much bigger and more epic .
It 's very clear that Snyder has an amazing eye for directing , and this comes through with 300 .
It also shows that he can do more than put together a visually exciting scene , he can build a powerful narrative and pull together a compelling story .
However a few times I did find his desire for levity a little too distracting from the story itself .
You do find yourself being caught up in the power and passion of the tale , and in the end I found myself feeling quite moved and impassioned by it all , the ending is particularly powerful and the whole film manages easily to convey the passion and belief of the Spartan 's without making them dislikeable or too over the top .
So in conclusion , the reported Berlin booed screening seems like total fabrication to me and it could n't have come from this film , ovations sound much more plausible , and yet there were a few missed moments in this film for me .
The power and struggle of the Queen back in Sparta seemed a bit too brief and the film could really have done without some of the modernised dialogue and camp moments .
That said , the film is so exciting , and not just visually , that you can't help being taken in by it .
Add the style and the powerful performances , and it is a great film .
I wish I had half marks on my scale .
I was going to give this four out of five , but after writing the review and thinking of the film , it definitely deserves a five out of five , as I say if I had half marks it would be a four and a half .
Update : I 'd just like to thank Gerard Butler Dot Net , Gerard Butler GALS , and Gerard Butler en espanol for being so gracious towards Filmstalker and my review .
Ladies , you know who you are and thanks very much for the help today .
If you want a Gerard Butler fan site or three , you can't go wrong with these ladies .

The hoariest jest in conservatism 's repertoire is that the three least credible assertions in the English language are " The check is in the mail , "
" Of course I 'll respect you as much in the morning " and " I 'm from the government and I 'm here to help you . "
Which brings us to the exquisitely named Help America Vote Act .
Having fixed Iraq and New Orleans , the federal government 's healing touch is now being applied to voting .
As a result , days -- perhaps weeks -- might pass after Election Day without the nation knowing which party controls the House or Senate .
If that happens , one reason might be HAVA , that 2002 bit of federal helpfulness .
For more than two centuries before Congress passed HAVA , Americans voted .
Really .
Unlike today , those who were elected -- Clay , Webster , Lincoln and lesser lights -- often were more complex and sophisticated than the voting machinery .
Using pencils to make marks on paper , and later using machines to punch holes in paper ballots , voters -- without federal help ; imagine -- caused congresses and presidents to come and go .
States ran elections ; some ran them better than others .
Some ballots have been better designed than others , as have some voting machines .
Most have been adequate .
The gross defects of American voting practices were laws that established or permitted discrimination and other abuses .
Tardily , but emphatically , those laws were changed and other abuses were halted .
Then came 2000 and Florida and the 36 - day lawyers ' scrum about George W. Bush 's 537 - vote margin of victory .
In response to which , Congress passed HAVA , which in 2006 may produce fresh confirmation of the prudential axiom that the pursuit of the perfect is the enemy of the good .
The lesson that should have been learned from Florida was :
In Florida , as in life generally , one should pursue as much precision as is reasonable -- but not more .
When , as very rarely happens , a large electorate , such as that state 's 6.1 million voters in 2000 , is evenly divided , the many errors and ambiguities that inevitably will occur during the marking of millions of ballots will be much more numerous than the margin of victory .
That is unfortunate , but no great injustice will be done , no matter who is declared the winner in a contest that is essentially tied .
Unfortunately , the lesson the nation chose to learn from Florida was that American technological wizardry could prevent such highly unusual events , and no expense should be spared to do so .
Hence HAVA , which made $ 3.8 billion available for states to purchase the most modern voting equipment .
On Nov. 7 , 38 percent of the nation 's voters will use touch - screens to record their choices , according to Election Data Services .
Unlike optical scanners that read markings put on paper ballots , most touch - screen machines -- including those which The New York Times reports will be used in about half of the 45 districts with the most closely contested House races -- produce no paper that can be consulted for verification of the results , if a recount is required .
Maryland 's new $ 106 million touch - screen system melted into a chaos of mechanical and human errors in last month 's primary election .
Lawsuits have been filed in five states seeking to block use of touch - screen machines .
Today 's political climate -- hyperpartisanship leavened by paranoia and exploited by a national surplus of lawyers -- makes this an unpropitious moment for introducing new voting technologies that will be administered by poll workers who often are retirees for whom the task of working a DVD player is a severe challenge .
Furthermore , an election is , after all , a government program , and readers of Genesis know that new knowledge often brings trouble .
So we should not be surprised if , on Nov. 7 , new voting machinery does what new technologies -- dams , bridges , steamships , airplanes -- have done through history : malfunction .
Football , in its disproportionate pursuit of error - free officiating , now relies on instant replays because ... well , because it can .
This technology does indeed reduce human error .
But it also reduces games to coagulation as players stand around waiting for officials to study video in the hope of achieving a degree of precision and certainty more appropriate to delicate surgery than to the violent thrashing of huge padded men in what is -- lest we forget , as the judicial solemnities of instant replay cause us to forget -- a game .
Democracy is not a mere game .
But -- write this on a piece of paper , using a No. 2 pencil -- neither is it an activity from which it is sensible to demand more precision than can reasonably be expected when , on a November Tuesday , 100 million people record billions of political choices .
Back in 2004 , John Edwards wanted to fight in Ohio .
He apparently wanted to contest the counting of the Ohio vote .
In a sidebar on the book - review " Edwards emerges from cancer with grace " , The News & Observer 's Rob Christensen quotes Elizabeth Edwards describing her husband John 's side of a conversation with " unidentified individuals " ...
I listened to John in the other room , arguing into a speakerphone that we could not concede until the votes [ in Ohio ] were counted .
" We promised , " he said .
" We told these people that if they stood in line and fought for their right to vote , we would fight to have them counted .
We promised . "
Elizabeth Edwards Says John Argued To Count Ohio 2004 Vote : ' We Promised ' He Said
The Presidential candidate chose not to .
John Edwards was right .
There can be no doubt now that these machines are not secure :
STATE VOTE MACHINES LOSE TEST TO HACKERS John Wildermuth , Chronicle Staff Writer Saturday , July 28 , 2007 snip
The researchers " were able to bypass physical and software security in every machine they tested , '' said Secretary of State Debra Bowen , who authorized the " top to bottom review " of every voting system certified by the state .
snip
During her election campaign last year , Bowen made it clear she had little confidence in the security of electronic voting machines and vowed to review their use in the state .
" Voting systems are tools of our democracy , '' she said Friday .
" We want to ensure that the voting systems used in the state are secure , accurate , reliable and accessible to all .
This ( study result ) is not a big deal to me .
It 's a big deal for everyone in the country . ''

Back in March of this year , John Edwards was asked about these machines , and his answer was unequivocal :
Kennedy , an activist and actress well known for her role as Dharma 's mother on ABC's Dharma and Greg , told The BRAD BLOG that during a Q & A period following his address last night , she asked Edwards whether he would join PDA in their campaign calling for " the complete removal of all Touch - Screen Direct Record Electronic voting machines from U.S. elections , with or without a paper trail . "
Drawing an " X " in the air as the question was being asked , Edwards --- who was reportedly upset at Sen .
John Kerry 's decision not to contest the 2004 Presidential Election count , or lack thereof , in Ohio --- answered with a definitive " Yes ! " " Yes ! " echoed Kennedy in response as the audience reportedly cheered and applauded .
Brad Blog
In a letter dated June 21st addressed to Alan Dechert .
President of the Open Voting Consortium , David Bonior stated that :
Senator Edwards belives that it is essential that all voting machines produce a verifiable paper ballot .
June 21 , 2007 Bonior Letter
Here is Elizabeth Edwards on Daily Kos :
Clean up and reinvigorate our election system ( 34 + / 0 -)
On two fronts : ( 1 ) Public financing of campaigns .
John has never taken Washington lobbyist money ( or allowed them to bundle for him ) but that is not enough .
He will fight for true public financing .
( 2 ) A reliable voting system nationwide .
That means from voter enrollment , voter eligibility determinations , and actual voting processes .
No black boxes and a paper trail for all voting .

Today 's reports of how easily these machines can be hacked means we have to support changes to ensure there are no more stolen elections .
John Edwards is right on this key issue for having a democracy in this nation .
No More Stolen Elections .
What do " void * " ( a la C ) , polymorphism ( a la C++ classes ) , interfaces ( a la Java ) , generics ( a la C++ templates ) , and duck typing ( a la Python ) all have to do with one another ?
They 're all ways in which you can write code that works with types that you did n't envision when writing the code .
A " void * " in C is a pointer to something of unspecified type .
You can't do very much with it unless you know what type the something is .
However , you can still pass it around .
You can store it in a list or tree .
You can take it and later pass it back to a callback function .
All of these things are useful , and , in fact , this functionality still exists in Java ( albeit , it 's a lot safer in Java ) .
However , instead of casting to " void * " , you cast to " Object " .
Polymorphism in languages like C++ and Java let you take an object and call methods on it without necessarily knowing exactly which subclass the object is a member of .
Let 's suppose there is a class named Fruit with a method named peel , and let 's suppose there are two subclasses named Apple and Orange .
If you have a list of apples and oranges , you can loop over that list and call peel on each fruit .
Even better , if someone later creates a Lemon class , and slips a few lemons into that list , your code will still know how to peel them .
However , what if you do n't want to subclass Fruit ?
What happens if you have an object that knows how to peel itself as well as a ton of other things ?
Do you need to subclass multiple classes ?
An interface in Java ( or a typeclass in Haskell ) lets you say that your object knows how to peel itself , without requiring any specific subclassing .
Instead , it can implement some Peelable interface , and that 's close enough .
Hence , instead of peeling a list of fruit , your code can now peel a list of objects that each implement the Peelable interface .
Those objects might not be related at all , and they 're free to implement all sorts of interfaces aside from just the Peelable interface .
Generics , which are called templates in Java and C++ , let you write code and leave blanks in it that can be filled in later .
Generics are an interesting subject , and the question really comes down to what kind of stuff can you leave blank ?
Generics in Java are actually pretty weak .
It use to be that if you wanted a list , you had to have a list of Objects ( remember the " void * " trick ? ) .
You did n't know exactly what was in the list .
These days , with Java templates , you can tell the compiler that you 're creating a list , and that the list can only contain Apples .
The list is a template , and you 're " filling in the blank " with the type Apple .
However , templates in Java are limited .
For instance , you can't create a template that says " Create a new [ blank ] " .
( If I 'm wrong , please leave a comment ! )
C++ templates are more powerful .
You can do all the same things that you can do in Java , but you can also do things like create a template that says " Create a new [ blank ] " .
The differences have to do with how the compiler implements templates .
When you tell the compiler that you want to " fill in the blank " with an Apple , i.e. " Create a new Apple " , that 's called instantiating the template .
By the way , this is something that happens at compile time .
Now , let 's suppose you have a template for lists , and you want a " list of Apple " and a " list of Orange " .
One way the compiler can implement this is to take the code for list and fill in all the blanks with Apple , then take the code for list and fill in all the blanks with Orange .
You 'd end up with two slightly different versions of the same code in the compiled binary .
I do n't know how modern C++ compilers do it , and feel free to call me ignorant , but it really makes me suspicious when I see how big C++ binaries are compared to C binaries ;)
Generics in functional programming languages like Haskell are even more impressive .
If a function takes a fruit and then peels it , Haskell can automatically figure out that the function will work with any object that can be peeled .
The impressive thing is that it can in many cases automatically infer this interface at compile time !
You do n't even have to tell the compiler that you 're trying to write generic code .
( Note , I 'm handwaiving a little about when you do and do n't need to use type classes . )
Duck typing ( also known as latent typing ) achieves the same goal , but does so using runtime checks .
Hence , if you write a function that takes an object and peels it , you do n't need to subclass anything or write an interface .
However , at runtime , the interpreter will figure out if the object actually knows how to peel itself .
On the one hand , you do n't get as many compile - time safety checks , but on the other hand , it 's really easy to understand .
You can accept whatever objects you want , and call any methods you want , and if it does n't actually work at runtime , you 'll get a nice exception that you can respond to in a controlled manner .
There 's an old joke that says that C++ is like juggling chainsaws in full body armor , whereas Python is like juggling rubber chickens .
Even better , you can do tricks like have the same object respond to any method .
For instance , you can call any method on a proxy object , and it will just proxy that method call to the object it is acting as a proxy for .
The same proxy object can proxy any object with any interface .
Ok , that was a pretty basic overview of a bunch of related language features .
As I said , they 're all ways in which you can write code that works with types that you did n't envision when writing the code .
Now , take a minute and think about that problem and the many different ways to solve it .
If you wrote a new language , how might you solve it differently ?

Just imagine this : you 've been working on that important paper for the past 2 weeks , and you are just about to finish it .
The deadline is in a few days .
You save your document , go for a coffee and when you get back , your screen is black .
Your computer rebooted itself automatically and is now stuck in the bootup process with a message similar to this :
No boot device , please insert a bootable media .
You try to restart your computer a few times , but it does not fix your problem .
At this point , it 's important do stay calm , do n't PANIC !
There may hope yet !
First , you 'll have to make sure that your problem is n't related to something else then the hard drive .
The failure of your hard disk controller may also be causing this .
You could always try to switch your hard drive from IDE1 to IDE2 and see if it fixes your problem .
If it 's not , remove the hard drive from your system , and bring it with you to a friend 's house .
If it still does n't work over there , then you know what the problem is .
The only solution to your problem now is to use a data recovery software , like PC Inspector File recovery .
This application is completely free , and it works beautifully .
It helped me once or twice in the past few years .
Do n't make yourself any illusion , it 's not perfect , and does n't work all the time ( Like any other hard drive recovery utility ) .
Sometimes , data cannot be recovered out of a broken hard drive , unless you are ready to take your disk to a specialized recovery shop and pay 1000's of dollars to have your data recovered .
While being at your friend 's house , install your HD as a secondary device and start the computer .
Be sure that the drive is seen in the startup process , because PCinspector will not work if you are having mechanical problems with the disk drive or If it is no longer recognized by the BIOS .
Head over to pcinspector .de and download

Data Recovery Myths
Edit :
After writing this article , several readers wrote to me about the knoppix Linux distribution CD .
This bootable CD has the ability to mount and read FAT , FAT32 and NTFS partitions , even damaged ones .
So after your HD crashed , you can always use this to recover your data and back it up on a USB key or second HD .
Knoppix can be downloaded via
This location .
This site has some VERY complete instructions about how to use Knoppix to recover your lost data , so I wo n't have to write about it .
Some people seem to think that if your hard drive has some mechanical problems , you can try putting it in the freezer for a few hours .
Check out the discussion here , I 'd like to know what you guys think about this .

IN APRIL this year , 92 females graced the Sunday Times Rich List , an annual round - up of Britain 's 1,000 wealthiest people .
Ten years ago there were 64 .
And rich women are getting richer , too : over the decade the average worth of female millionaires has grown by more than half .
Today Britain 's wealthiest woman has £ 4.9 billion ( $ 9.6 billion ) to her name , compared with the paltry £ 1.5 billion her counterpart had in 1997 .
The Centre for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) reckons female millionaires will outnumber male ones by 2020 , and by 2025 women will control 60 % of the nation 's private wealth .
They do better at school and in higher education , and they live longer .
Girl power , it seems , never had it so good .
Is this wave of affluence a chimera or does it have solid underpinnings ?
A report this week by the Economist Intelligence Unit , our sister company , for Barclays Wealth , a financial - management firm , claims that the historical sources of women 's wealth — marriage , inheritance and divorce — have been replaced by independent income , business ownership and investments .
More than 80 % of women now derive their riches from personal earnings , it says , particularly from their own businesses .
Divorce , long the engine that propelled women into prosperity , is cited by only 2.9 % of those questioned as the main source of their wealth .
But Philip Beresford , who compiles the Rich List , dismisses the idea that women are breaking into its ranks independently of men .
“ There is no evidence , yet , of seriously rich female entrepreneurs coming in huge numbers , ” he says .
The woman who tops the list is in fact Lady Green , whose husband made them both a fortune in retailing .
If the CEBR is correct , Mr Beresford thinks most British millionairesses will still be wives , daughters and divorcees .
A glance at the number of women in the top ranks of business suggests he is right .
Women make up only a tenth of the directors of FTSE - 100 firms .
They are also under - represented in the upper echelons of management .
In a report in March , PricewaterhouseCoopers , an accountancy firm , said that the number of female senior managers in FTSE - 350 firms had fallen by 40 % since 2002 .
This may be due to a prevailing macho culture at the top ; or it may reflect the costs of child care , which have risen by 27 % in the same period .
If things look sticky at the top , women at the bottom find the relative going far tougher .
Although the gap between men's and women 's earnings has shrunk for those at all income levels , it remains far bigger among the poorest tenth than in any other group ( see chart ) .
The latest annual report from the Equal Opportunities Commission shows why : men still dominate highly paid work , and the proportion of female graduates in low - level jobs has rocketed in the past decade , along with the number of people going to university .
It will take another 60 years before there is equality between the sexes in British business ( and 200 to achieve the same in Parliament ) , the commission calculates .
Progress , it moans , is “ painfully slow and at risk of going into reverse ” .
It 's still hard to be a woman .
Poppies grow in most Afghan provinces
In a letter to European mayors , the head of the UN's Office on Drugs said it was likely more users would die .
Antonio Maria Costa said that an increase in supply tends to make the drug purer and hence more dangerous .
Mr Costa urged Europe 's mayors to take precautionary measures ahead of the surge in the drug on their streets .
Serious threat
Europe has traditionally been the biggest market for Afghan opiates and opium cultivation in Afghanistan increased by 59 % this year .
" Some cities take the problem more seriously than others .
Illicit drugs are a serious threat to our young people and the very future of our societies , " Mr Costa said in a statement .
Mr Costa said he has strongly encouraged the mayors and Europe 's community drug centres to be on the alert and take every possible measure to deal with the threat .
Europe 's politicians , he said , should take responsibility for what is happening in their own backyards , rather than expecting their drug problem to be solved by others .
Many security guards are former special forces soldiers
Last year the figure was estimated at being as high as 20,000 , but it is thought the total has fallen significantly in the last 12 months .
Most private security guards are former soldiers - many of them ex-special forces - or former law enforcement personnel who have had experience of firearms .
The five Britons kidnapped from Iraq 's finance ministry in Baghdad on Tuesday included four bodyguards employed by Canadian security firm GardaWorld , along with a computer expert from US management consultancy BearingPoint .
GardaWorld has 50,000 employees around the world , with hundreds in Iraq , many of whom are ex-British forces .
' Nightmare scenario '
Witnesses have said the kidnapped Britons were taken by men wearing police uniforms who arrived in up to 40 police vehicles .
That is one of the nightmare scenarios for any security staff , the thought that you can't recognise who is your friend and who is your foe
Andy Bearpark
British Association of Private Security Companies
Andy Bearpark , director general of the British Association of Private Security Companies , said the security staff would have been highly - trained but faced a difficult situation .
" I think that one of the most frightening aspects for anybody is the apparent professionalism in terms of the way the attack was carried out , " he said .
" These are all allegations at this stage .
We do n't know , but apparently the people who committed the crime were wearing Iraqi police uniform .
" Of course that is one of the nightmare scenarios for any security staff , the thought that you can't recognise who is your friend and who is your foe . "
Capture training
British security consultancy Hart Group currently has up to 40 international staff and locals working in Iraq .
This is down from a peak of 200 and 2,000 respectively , as businesses have withdrawn their operations in the face of worsening security .
I know of serving soldiers who are returning , signing off and then taking the opportunity to go back to Iraq to provide security services out there
Robin Horsfall , ex-SAS trooper and security guard
" Nobody is coerced into going to Iraq . "
Private security guards are , however , lured by financial rewards , with payments of up to £ 1,000 - a - day not unheard of for the most dangerous roles .
As well as bodyguard - style security for individuals , private security companies protect transport and static sites including buildings and equipment .
The Foreign Office , for example , has contracts with companies in Iraq which guard its people and buildings .
' Little experience '
There have been complaints by some private security staff that they are doing an Army - style job , but with poorer equipment and training .
Others are concerned that some firms do not have strict enough vetting procedures for staff , or sufficient training to allow them to work safely .
Robin Horsfall , a former SAS trooper who has worked as a security guard in the Middle East , said money was the sole reason these jobs were taken up .
" I know of serving soldiers who are returning , signing off and then taking the opportunity to go back to Iraq to provide security services out there , " he said .
" If you think of the what a man earns in the UK , maybe £ 500 a week , we 're talking about £ 500 a day .
You could pay off your mortgage if you do that for a year . "
He said companies preferred private contractors to local guards , " as they are likely to be affiliated with local groups , you can't rely on them not to set up an ambush " .
However , he said , the job could be even more dangerous than serving in the armed forces .
" It 's much more high - risk than being a soldier , you do n't have the air support and the backup that the armed forces have .
You 're on your own .
" Soldiers are finding that they are working alongside people who are nightclub security guards with very limited experience ...
" It can be very dangerous . "
Bill Moyers : Begging his pardon RAW STORY

We have yet another remarkable revelation of the mindset of Washington 's ruling clique of neoconservative elites - the people who took us to war from the safety of their Beltway bunkers .
Even as Iraq grows bloodier by the day , their passion of the week is to keep one of their own from going to jail .
It is well known that I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby - once Vice President Cheney 's most trusted adviser - has been sentenced to 30 months in jail for perjury .
Lying .
Not a white lie , mind you .
A killer lie .
Scooter Libby deliberately poured poison into the drinking water of democracy by lying to federal investigators , for the purpose of obstructing justice .
Attempting to trash critics of the war , Libby and his pals in high places - including his boss Dick Cheney - outed a covert CIA agent .
Libby then lied to cover their tracks .
To throw investigators off the trail , he kicked sand in the eyes of truth .
" Libby lied about nearly everything that mattered , " wrote the chief prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald .
The jury agreed and found him guilty on four felony counts .
Judge Reggie B. Walton - a no-nonsense , lock - em - up - and - throw - away - the - key type , appointed to the bench by none other than George W. Bush - called the evidence " overwhelming " and threw the book at Libby .
You would have thought their man had been ordered to Guantanamo , so intense was the reaction from his cheerleaders .
They flooded the judge 's chambers with letters of support for their comrade and took to the airwaves in a campaign to " free Scooter . "
Vice President Cheney issued a statement praising Libby as " a man ... of personal integrity " - without even a hint of irony about their collusion to browbeat the CIA into mangling intelligence about Iraq in order to justify the invasion .
" A patriot , a dedicated public servant , a strong family man , and a tireless , honorable , selfless human being , " said Donald Rumsfeld - the very same Rumsfeld who had claimed to know the whereabouts of weapons of mass destruction and who boasted of " bulletproof " evidence linking Saddam to 9/11 .
" A good person " and " decent man , " said the one - time Pentagon adviser Kenneth Adelman , who had predicted the war in Iraq would be a " cakewalk . "
Paul Wolfowitz wrote a four - page letter to praise " the noblest spirit of selfless service " that he knew motivated his friend Scooter .
Yes , that Paul Wolfowitz , who had claimed Iraqis would " greet us as liberators " and that Iraq would " finance its own reconstruction . "
The same Paul Wolfowitz who had to resign recently as president of the World Bank for using his office to show favoritism to his girlfriend .
Paul Wolfowitz turned character witness .
The praise kept coming : from Douglas Feith , who ran the Pentagon factory of disinformation that Cheney and Libby used to brainwash the press ; from Richard Perle , as cocksure about Libby 's " honesty , integrity , fairness and balance " as he had been about the success of the war ; and from William Kristol , who had primed the pump of the propaganda machine at The Weekly Standard and has led the call for a Presidential pardon .
" The case was such a farce , in my view , " he said .
" I 'm for pardon on the merits . "
One Beltway insider reports that the entire community is grieving - " weighted down by the sheer , glaring unfairness " of Libby 's sentence .
And there 's the rub .
None seem the least weighted down by the sheer , glaring unfairness of sentencing soldiers to repeated and longer tours of duty in a war induced by deception .
It was left to the hawkish academic Fouad Ajami to state the matter baldly .
In a piece published on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal , Ajami pleaded with Bush to pardon Libby .
For believing " in the nobility of this war , " wrote Ajami , Scooter Libby had himself become a " casualty " - a fallen soldier the President dare not leave behind on the Beltway battlefield .
Not a word in the entire article about the real fallen soldiers .
The honest - to - God dead , and dying , and wounded .
Not a word about the chaos or the cost .
Even as the calamity they created worsens , all they can muster is a cry for leniency for one of their own who lied to cover their tracks .
There are contrarian voices : " This is an open and shut case of perjury and obstruction of justice , " said Pat Buchanan .
" The Republican Party stands for the idea that high officials should not be lying to special investigators . "
From the former Governor of Virginia , James Gilmore , a staunch conservative , comes this verdict : " If the public believes there 's one law for a certain group of people in high places and another law for regular people , then you will destroy the law and destroy the system . "
So it may well be , as The Hartford Courant said editorially , that Mr Libby is " a nice guy , a loyal and devoted patriot ... but none of that excuses perjury or obstruction of justice .
If it did , truth would n't matter much . "

This blog explores the dimensions of being a female and feminist gamer , especially in a MMORPG such as World of Warcraft .
Every once in a while , a device comes along whose stupidity is exceeded only by the individuals advocating its use ; a device so confusing and controversial , it creates twice as many problems as it solves .
Enter Highway Safety & Technology 's " Cellular Detection System " ( or as we like to call it , the " Automatic Civil Unrest Creation System " ) .
The idea is this : through some magical , thoroughly unexplained array of " electronic sensing equipment , " the system can somehow detect drivers talking on their phones and set the subsequent legal process in motion without any law enforcement involvement whatsoever .
Never mind that other people in the car might be using their phones and the fact that headsets are almost always legal when handsets are not , we guess .
The product is actually so ridiculous that we 're leaning toward it being an elaborate hoax -- or we 're hoping as much , anyway -- otherwise it'll allegedly be available to overzealous municipalities this fall .

最近わたしは、素朴なテキストベースの電子メールクライアントに回帰することを真剣に検討している。これまでメインに使用してきたのは安定性に優れたSylpheedであったが、以前行っていたxterm上での電子メール閲覧というスタイルに戻る可能性を確認する目的で、今回はテキストベースの電子メールクライアントの現状を調査してみることにした。候補に上げたのは、Pine、Cone、Mutt、nmhというアプリケーションである。今回は自分の用途に適したものという条件で選別したため、最終的にはMuttがトップにランクされたが、ライセンスの形態さえ気にならなければPineを使ってもいいだろう。
テスト候補を絞る段階では、なるべく多数を網羅すると同時に、現在もメンテナンスが継続中で、入手ないし運用時に過度の負担を必要としないソフトウェアのみを選ぶようにした。より具体的に言うと、依存関係が特異的であったり、コンパイル時の諸設定が煩雑すぎるメールユーザーエージェント（MUA）は今回の候補から除外してある。例えばElmoは評価の対象外としたが、その理由を述べると、2004年以降アップデートされていないこと、ホームページが最近更新された形跡がないこと、Elmoの開発者に今後の計画を電子メールで問い合わせても返事がもらえなかったこと、となる。往年のElmoには期待させられる点が多かっただけに、これは残念な事態であった。またElmについても、その開発状況は不透明だと判断した。実際、わたしが常用しているすべてのディストリビューションに関して対応パッケージが見つからず、また込み入った設定スクリプトが複雑すぎて、フラストレーションの元となりそうだったからだ。
Pine
最初にテストするの はPineにしたが、それは以前に使用経験があったため、現在どのレベルにまで発展したかを確認してみたかったためである。Pineは、University of Washington のComputing & Communicationsによって1989年に作成されたアプリケーションである。
Pineには、固有エディタ のPicoおよび、ファイルシステムブラウザのPilotが付属している。PicoとPilotはスタンドアローン型のアプリケーションであり、必要であればPineを起動しなくても使用できる。
テキストベースの電子メールアプリケーション群の中でも、Pineの操作性は頭抜けて優れている。いずれの操作画面も分かりやすいメニュー構成を取っており、ユーザーが必要とするであろう機能に簡単にアクセスできるよう配慮されているのだ。Pineの設定はメニュー経由で行える。その構成には改善の余地があるとは思うが、Pineの設定オプションを一覧できる点は便利だといえるだろう。ほかのテキストベースのメーラーの場合だと、用意されている設定オプションの種類を確認するだけでもmanページやオンラインマニュアルを探し回る必要があり、必要な変更を施すには別途テキストエディタを起動して設定ファイルを編集するといったケースが多い。
とは言うものの 、Pineの設定作業すべてがほかのメーラーより簡単という訳ではない。Pineの用途として適しているのはメッセージを送信するシステム上で使用する場合だが、そのためのSMTP設定にはかなり複雑な手順を経る必要があるのだ。
な おPineでの暗号化設定も一筋縄では行かないが、GnuPGをPineで使用するための解説やアドオンの紹介ページが存在している。
なおPine は “ フリー ” なライセンスで公開されておらず、現在多くのLinuxディストリビューションはPineパッケージの同梱を取りやめている。とは言うものの、Pineをソースからコンパイルする作業はそれほど複雑でもなく、またライセンスのフリー度についても、パッチやセキュリティアップデートの責任を負うベンダーやプロジェクトは神経質に成らざるを得ないかもしれないが、一般ユーザーの多くにとっては十分に許容できる範囲内だろう。
Pineをベースとした派生ソフトとして 、Alpineという現在開発中のメーラーが存在する。ただし現行のα版を入手したければ、Alpine-alphaメーリングリストに参加するしかない。わたしの知る限り、開発陣によるAlpine関連の情報はこのメーリングリストに上げられているだけであり、アーカイブすらも購読者のみ利用可という態勢だ。今回は11月29日に公開されたファーストリリース版を試用しようと思ったのだが、UbuntuおよびDebian環境でのコンパイルはできなかった。
Alpineに関する朗報として、このアプリケーションはApacheライセンスのバージョン2.0でリリースされている点を紹介しておこう。最も、そうした措置ができるのなら、Alpineが完成するまではPineについてもApacheライセンスでリリースするようにしておけば良さそうなものだが、何らかの理由があって開発元の大学がそのようなオプションを選んでいないのかは不明である。Pineの愛用者たちにとっても、Apacheライセンス下で公開されたバージョンがDebian、Ubuntu、Fedoraその他各種のディストリビューションに同梱されるようになれば、Alpineの安定化まで待たされる必要もなく、願ったりかなったりだと思うのだが。

Identity theft is the crime that keeps on giving .
Years after victims ' identities have been compromised they can still be managing the effects of a ruined credit history , which can cost them bank mortgages or jobs .
Victims can even face jail time for crimes committed in their name by doppelgangers .
An Arizona company called LifeLock promises to relieve those headaches by helping victims halt theft before it happens and clean up the mess after it does .
The company charges $ 10 a month for its services and offers an unusual guarantee – a $ 1 million reimbursement for any damages or losses its subscribers incur from identity theft .
" If your identity is compromised for any reason while you 're our client , we will fix the problem , period , " said CEO Todd Davis .
" If you lose money , we 'll reimburse you .
If you get thrown in jail , we 'll bail you out of jail .
If I have to hire a lawyer ( for you ) , I will . "
Davis says the company has n't had to make good on its $ 1 - million guarantee yet because it has been successful at halting identity theft losses of subscribers before they occur .
The company places 90 - day fraud alerts with credit - reporting agencies on the subscriber 's behalf , and automatically renews the alerts before they expire .
Subscribers receive copies of their credit reports four times a year to review for inaccuracies and fraudulent activity .
Credit alerts typically end after three months , but can last seven years for consumers who can prove that they 're already victims of identity theft .
If LifeLock subscribers face difficulty in obtaining credit because of the alert on their file , the company will contact a landlord or credit issuer on the subscriber 's behalf to clear up concerns about the alert .
LifeLock also monitors check systems to ensure thieves do n't open new bank accounts in a subscriber 's name , and it removes subscribers ' names from mailing lists for pre-approved credit applications .
The company launched early last year and has about 60,000 subscribers , according to Davis .
It lists a former vice chairman of Bank of America and a former chief technology officer of Visa International among its board members .
Beth Givens , director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , said individuals can do most of what LifeLock offers on their own at no cost .
And LifeLock 's money guarantee is a bit of false bravado because federal law protects victims of fraud from paying for financial losses incurred by impostors , she added .
But she acknowledged LifeLock 's services are unique in that the company will help victims obtain restitution after fraud occurs .
" What they offer is convenience , " Givens said .
" You can do the fraud alerts yourself , but the 90 - day renewal is certainly a feature that people will probably appreciate . "
She also said other companies provide real - time credit - monitoring services for $ 60 to $ 120 a year that will send an e-mail or text message alert to you within 48 hours after activity occurs on your account .
This can be more effective than waiting for a quarterly statement to review activity or relying on a creditor to adhere to an alert and contact you before granting credit to someone in your name .
" Studies show the sooner you detect identity theft the quicker you 'll recover and the less damage you 'll suffer , " Givens said .
Now that Microsoft has freed Windows Vista from the shackles of a five year development process , the company is attempting to the wow starts now us by revealing that it plans to have its next major operating system ready within the next two - and - a - half years , giving Vista 's successor an expected release date of late 2009 .
Speaking to PC World , Ben Fathi , the executive in charge of the OS 's core components , made it clear that he was referring to a whole new OS -- known to have the codename " Vienna " -- and not the upcoming Vista service pack , codenamed " Fiji . "
Other than this tentative release date , Ben did n't have much new information on the future for Windows : in response to the question of what Vienna 's killer feature will be , he said " I do n't know what it is " and then proceeded to suggest that full virtualization and a radical new user interface will be the aim .
Both of these suggestions lend credence to previous reports that a break in compatiblity with older applications and a new user interface would be Vienna 's flagship features .
Now all we 've got to do is wait ( and hope that the changes are n't too radical . )

Welcome .
No two moments in history are the same , but I have found myself increasingly thinking a lot about the Eighties lately .
It is because everyone is talking about money again , particularly other people 's money : their property , the lavishness of entertainment , the extent of their staffs , the fatiguing ingenuity it takes to make a dent on the enormous bonuses brought home by the big City earners
It was sometime between mid-1987 and 1988 that people became overwrought on the subject of money , and then again in the dotcom boom of the late Nineties , though the talk was not nearly so widespread nor so intense .
But today in London there is a atmosphere of gold rush , and the money made by the few who have seized the mining rights - that is to say hedge fund managers , private equity barons , the banking aristocracy , foreign billionaires - cascades to make lesser fortunes for estate agents , art dealers , wine dealers , restaurateurs , jewellers and anyone who offers a service or an item to sell that is in limited supply .
Last year 4,500 people took home a bonus of more than £ 1 m .
But there are those who make a great deal more than that - £ 10 m , £ 20 m and £ 50 m packages are not uncommon .
The total amount paid out in bonuses last year was £ 21bn , about one third of Britain 's education budget
Whatever you call it - silly money or serious money - it is undeniably big money , and the world has never seen fortunes made so quickly by so many and so mysteriously .
In New York - it could just have easily been London - there was recently a party for the top hedge fund earners held by a publication called the Institutional Investor 's Alpha Magazine ( which carries a league table each year of the 25 best earners ) .
Coming top was James Simmons , a 69 - year - old former mathematics professor who is shy of the press and peered out of the party pictures like a man being honoured for long service in a book store .
Using complicated mathematics models , he made $ 1.7 bn last year .
The rest of the list consisted of people who had made more than $ 240 m .
These figures used to be confined to America , but now London , by all accounts a less regulated , more tax - efficient and civilised place to do business in , has its own super - earners .
They are compressed into a few square miles where the competition to display new wealth is intense , if mostly hidden from you and me .
Houses are knocked through , reinforced , secured against all disaster and hollowed out to accommodate gyms , music studios , swimming pools , dens , movie theatres and technology - rich kitchens , the inside of which the owners do not see from beginning to end of day .
The walls are covered in high - value art .
This week the big auction houses expect to sell a record £ 450 m of modern masterpieces , including a portrait by Lucian Freud of his late friend Bruce Bernard , which is estimated at £ 5.5 m .
Bruce had slightly more money than his more famous brother Jeffrey , but the idea of this amount being paid for his gently despondent countenance would have made him hoot with laughter .
The property market is hectic because of the vast weight of money at the top .
Demand outstrips supply so houses can earn more per annum than their owners and estate agents are buying Porsches again .
At Savills a pool of £ 125 m is to be shared in bonuses for 4,000 employees with some taking over £ 1m .
Things are supercharged compared with the Eighties , yet there 's much that is familiar .
For one thing , the blind optimism that the boom will go on even though the world is palpably less stable .
( It could end with anything from a threat to oil supplies , a big sickness like Sars or bird flu to the collapse of the overheated Chinese stock market . )
For another , there is the resentment of the people who used to regard themselves as well off : the envy of those who were once envied .
Addressing his readers , the editor of Tatler , Geordie Greig , writes this month : ' The superclass is overtaking you in the race for the best schools , overpaying for the house you presumed was yours ... they are leaving the central core of middle Britain feeling very left out . '
One suspects the Daily Mail has turned on the people who run private equity firms , not because of their asset - stripping ways or the highly leveraged deals ( incidentally , both reminders of the dubious Eighties ) but because they have made the middle classes feel small .
Right down at the bottom , the underclass struggles away with few to champion its cause or lighten its despair .
The Rev Paul Nicolson who runs the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust - named after a tax collector in the New Testament - told me how HM Revenue and Customs suspended a woman 's benefit payments because they did n't believe she had six children .
His charity gave her money to feed the family for two weeks while she waited for an investigator to come to count heads .
Place that alongside the concessionary capital gains tax - as little as 10 per cent - negotiated by the private equity industry on its income and you begin to wonder if we have n't got things a bit wrong .
It is the inevitable remoteness of the super - rich from the community and the concerns of a society that rankles .
Many high earners give a great deal away and do much good , but , because of a failure of imagination or humanity , there are probably more who do not .
The super - rich have a responsibility to the morale of society and also - more acutely - to the environment .
The spending of these newly acquired fortunes on private planes and helicopters for instance , or on the construction of golf courses , such as the one planned for the rich by Clint Eastwood on the Monterey peninsula , represents a great menace to the environment .
Fish are being hunted to extinction for the delectation of jaded palates .
Rare trees are felled for interior decoration .
Landscape and coastlines are wrecked for resorts .
None of this is alleviated by the suspicion that these fortunes are generated by financial alchemy rather than by business - ie , making or supplying something which is useful .
In an article for the New York Times last month , political journalist Michael Kinsley described how the car hire company founded by Warren E Avis had been sold or reorganised 17 times since 1946 .
' Each time , ' he wrote , ' there have been fees for bankers and fees for lawyers , bonuses for top executives and theories about why this was exactly what the company needed . '
It is argued that capitalism thrives on this ceaseless churn , yet there seems to be no reason why the House of Commons Treasury select committee should not , when it meets this week , demand frankness from the five big private equity bosses about their personal tax arrangements , the treatment of employees of firms taken over and the escalating debt .
For there is something vaporous and untrustworthy about debt held in a kind of digital suspension
It makes the boom no more solid than its predecessors , and maybe a lot more dangerous .
What to do with the super - rich ?
How can they be integrated into society ?
Obviously the private equity barons should be paying more tax .
There should be a self - imposed ceiling on bonuses , with companies setting up , pound - for - pound , charitable schemes , inventing their own projects perhaps which involve the active participation of their rich employees .
I do n't believe in supertaxes for the very simple reason that these people can simply relocate to another financial centre , taking with them the much broader benefits in revenue that their activity generate .
But I do believe in educating the rich in one simple fact : no one person 's work is worth £ 10 m a year .

It is a verdict likely to cause great consternation to lonely prisoners throughout the US penal system .
A prisoner in Florida has been found guilty of indecent exposure for masturbating alone in his cell .
Terry Lee Alexander , 20 , of Lauderdale Lakes , Florida , was sentenced to a further 60 days in jail on top of the 10 - year term he is currently serving for armed robbery , the Miami Herald reported yesterday .
He was prosecuted after a female sheriff 's office deputy witnessed him performing the sex act in his cell in Broward County , Florida , last November .
The case drew sniggers from the courtroom as prospective jurors were questioned about their own masturbatory habits and the only witness was asked whether she had considered calling in a Swat team to tackle the defendant .
In reaching their verdict on Tuesday , jurors decided that an inmate 's cell was " a limited access public place " where exposing oneself wasagainst the law .
The only witness in the case , Broward sheriff 's office deputy Coryus Veal , testified that Alexander did not try to conceal what he was doing as most prisoners did .
She witnessed the act while working in a glass - enclosed master control room , 30 metres ( 100 ft ) from Alexander 's cell .
There was no videotape evidence of the offence .
The prisoner 's lawyer , Kathleen McHugh , failed to get him cleared on the grounds that a cell was a private place and what Alexander was doing was perfectly normal .
" Did other inmates start masturbating because of Mr Alexander ? "
Ms McHugh asked Ms Veal .
" Did you call a Swat team ? "
" I wish I had , " the deputy replied .
Ms Veal , who has charged seven other inmates with the same offence , said she was not against masturbation , but she objected to Alexander performing it so blatantly .
She told the court that most inmates masturbated in bed , under the blankets .
The deputy said it was the third time she had caught Alexander masturbating , and she had had enough .
After the verdict , the juror David Sherman said the case was " pretty straightforward " .
" The prosecution 's case was clear , and the defence did not dispute any of the major elements , " he told the Miami Herald .
Mr Sherman said jurors determined that a prison cell , which was owned and operated by the government , was neither public nor private but was a " limited access public place ' . '
Ms McHugh asked the 17 prospective jurors who among them had never masturbated .
No hands went up .
Prosecutors filed charges in all seven of Ms Veal 's other cases , according to a spokesman for the Broward state attorney 's office .
The charges were dropped in one of these cases to allow the defendant to begin his sentence in the state prison system on a more serious , unrelated charge .
Four of the others pleaded guilty and were sentenced to time served .
Charges against the other two inmates are pending .
Tomgram : The Seymour Hersh Mystery
A Journalist Writing Bloody Murder And No One Notices
By Tom Engelhardt
Let me see if I 've got this straight .
Perhaps two years ago , an " informal " meeting of " veterans " of the 1980s Iran - Contra scandal -- holding positions in the Bush administration -- was convened by Deputy National Security Advisor Elliott Abrams .
Discussed were the " lessons learned " from that labyrinthine , secret , and illegal arms - for - money - for - arms deal involving the Israelis , the Iranians , the Saudis , and the Contras of Nicaragua , among others -- and meant to evade the Boland Amendment , a congressionally passed attempt to outlaw Reagan administration assistance to the anti-communist Contras .
In terms of getting around Congress , the Iran - Contra vets concluded , the complex operation had been a success -- and would have worked far better if the CIA and the military had been kept out of the loop and the whole thing had been run out of the Vice President 's office .
Subsequently , some of those conspirators , once again with the financial support and help of the Saudis ( and probably the Israelis and the Brits ) , began running a similar operation , aimed at avoiding congressional scrutiny or public accountability of any sort , out of Vice President Cheney 's office .
They dipped into " black pools of money , " possibly stolen from the billions of Iraqi oil dollars that have never been accounted for since the American occupation began .
Some of these funds , as well as Saudi ones , were evidently funneled through the embattled , Sunni - dominated Lebanese government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora to the sort of Sunni jihadi groups ( " some sympathetic to al - Qaeda " ) whose members might normally fear ending up in Guantanamo and to a group , or groups , associated with the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood .
All of this was being done as part of a " sea change " in the Bush administration 's Middle Eastern policies aimed at rallying friendly Sunni regimes against Shiite Iran , as well as Hezbollah , Hamas , and the Syrian government -- and launching secret operations to undermine , roll back , or destroy all of the above .
Despite the fact that the Bush administration is officially at war with Sunni extremism in Iraq ( and in the more general Global War on Terror ) , despite its support for the largely Shiite government , allied to Iran , that it has brought to power in Iraq , and despite its dislike for the Sunni - Shiite civil war in that country , some of its top officials may be covertly encouraging a far greater Sunni - Shiite rift in the region .
Imagine .
All this and much more ( including news of U.S. military border - crossings into Iran , new preparations that would allow George W. Bush to order a massive air attack on that land with only 24 - hours notice , and a brief window this spring when the staggering power of four U.S. aircraft - carrier battle groups might be available to the President in the Persian Gulf ) was revealed , often in remarkable detail , just over a week ago in " The Redirection , " a Seymour Hersh piece in the New Yorker .
Hersh , the man who first broke the My Lai story in the Vietnam era , has never been off his game since .
In recent years , from the Abu Ghraib scandal on , he has consistently released explosive news about the plans and acts of the Bush administration .
Imagine , in addition , that Hersh went on Democracy Now ! , Fresh Air , Hardball with Chris Matthews , and CNN Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer and actually elaborated on these claims and revelations , some of which , on the face of it , seem like potentially illegal and impeachable offenses , if they do indeed reach up to the Vice President or President .
Now imagine the response : Front - page headlines ; editorials nationwide calling for answers , Congressional hearings , or even the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into some of the claims ; a raft of op - ed page pieces by the nation 's leading columnists asking questions , demanding answers , reminding us of the history of Iran - Contra ; bold reporters from a recently freed media standing up in White House and Defense Department press briefings to demand more information on Hersh 's various charges ; calls in Congress for hearings and investigations into why the people 's representatives were left so totally out of this loop .
Uh
All I can say is :
If any of this happened , I have n't been able to discover it .
As far as I can tell , no one in the mainstream even blinked on the Iran - Contra angle or the possibility that a vast , secret Middle Eastern operation is being run , possibly illegally and based on stolen funds and Saudi money , out of the Vice President 's office .
You can certainly find a few pieces on , or reports about , " The Redirection " -- all focused only on the possible build - up to a war with Iran -- and the odd wire - service mention of it ; but nothing major , nothing Earth - shaking or eye - popping ; not , in fact , a single obvious editorial or op - ed piece in the mainstream ; no journalistic questions publicly asked of the administration ; no Congressional cries of horror ; no calls anywhere for investigations or hearings on any of Hersh 's revelations , not even an expression of fear somewhere that we might be seeing Iran - Contra , the sequel , in our own moment .
This , it seems to me , adds up to a remarkable non-response to claims that , if true , should gravely concern Congress , the media , and the nation .
Let 's grant that Hersh 's New Yorker pieces generally arrive unsourced and filled with anonymuous officials ( " a former senior intelligence official , " " a U.S. government consultant with close ties to Israel " ) .
Nonetheless , Hersh has long mined his sources in the Intelligence Community and the military to striking effect .
Undoubtedly , the lack of sourcing makes it harder for other reporters to follow - up , though when it comes to papers like the Washington Post and the New York Times , you would think that they might have Washington sources of their own to query on Hersh 's claims .
And , of course , editorial pages , columnists , op - ed editors , Congressional representatives , and reporters at administration news briefings do n't need to do any footwork at all to raise these subjects .
( Consider , for instance , the White House press briefing on April 10 , 2006 , where a reporter did indeed ask a question based on an earlier Hersh New Yorker piece . )
As far as I can tell , there have n't even been denunciations of Hersh 's report or suggestions anywhere that it was inaccurate or off - base .
Just the equivalent of a giant , collective shrug of the media 's rather scrawny shoulders .
Since the response to Hersh 's remarkable piece has been so tepid in places where it should count , let me take up just a few of the many issues his report raises .
" Meddling " in Iran
For at least a month now , our press and TV news have been full to the brim with mile - high headlines and top - of - the - news stories recounting ( and , more rarely , disputing )
Bush administration claims of Iranian " interference " or " meddling " in Iraq ( where U.S. military spokesmen regularly refer to the Iraqi insurgents they are fighting as " anti-Iraq forces " ) .
Since Hersh published " Plan B " in the New Yorker in June 2004 in which he claimed that the Israelis were " running covert operations inside Kurdish areas of Iran and Syria , " he has been on the other side of this story .
In " The Coming Wars " in January of 2005 , he first reported that the Bush administration , like the Israelis , had been " conducting secret reconnaissance missions inside Iran at least since " the summer of 2004 .
In April of 2006 in " The Iran Plans , " he reported that the Bush administration was eager to put the " nuclear option " on the table in any future air assault on Iranian nuclear facilities ( and that some in the Pentagon , fiercely opposed , had at least temporarily thwarted planning for the possible use of nuclear bunker - busters in Iran ) .
He also reported that American combat units were " on the ground " in Iran , marking targets for any future air attack , and quoted an unnamed source as claiming that they were also " working with minority groups in Iran , including the Azeris , in the north , the Baluchis , in the southeast , and the Kurds , in the northeast .
The troops ' are studying the terrain , and giving away walking - around money to ethnic tribes , and recruiting scouts from local tribes and shepherds , ' the consultant said .
One goal is to get 'eyes on the ground '
The broader aim , the consultant said , is to ' encourage ethnic tensions ' and undermine the regime . "
In " The Redirection , " he now claims that , in search of Iranian rollback and possible regime change , " American military and special - operations teams have escalated their activities in Iran to gather intelligence and , according to a Pentagon consultant on terrorism and the former senior intelligence official , have also crossed the [ Iranian ] border in pursuit of Iranian operatives from Iraq . "
In his Democracy Now !
radio interview , he added : " [ W ]e have been deeply involved with Azeris and Baluchis and Iranian Kurds in terror activities inside the country and , of course , the Israelis have been involved in a lot of that through Kurdistan Iran has been having sort of a series of backdoor fights , the Iranian government , because they have a significant minority population .
Not everybody there is a Persian .
If you add up the Azeris and Baluchis and Kurds , you 're really 30 - some [ % ] , maybe even 40 % of the country . "
In addition , he reported that " a special planning group has been established in the offices of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , charged with creating a contingency bombing plan for Iran that can be implemented , upon orders from the President , within twenty - four hours , " and that its " new assignment " was to identify not just nuclear facilities and possible regime - change targets , but " targets in Iran that may be involved in supplying or aiding militants in Iraq . "
Were there nothing else in Hersh 's most recent piece , all of this would still have been significant news -- if we did n't happen to live on a one - way imperial planet in which Iranian " interference " in ( American ) Iraq is an outrage , but secret U.S. operations in , and military plans to devastate , Iran are your basic ho - hum issue .
Our mainstream news purveyors do n't generally consider the issue of our " interference " in Iran worthy of a great deal of reporting , nor do our pundits consider it a topic worthy of speculation or consideration ; nor , in a Congress where leading Democrats have regularly outflanked the Bush administration in hawkish positions on Iran , is this likely to be much of an issue .
You can read abroad about rumored American operations out of Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at unsettling Iranian minorities like the Baluchis and about possible operations to create strife among Arab minorities in southern Iran near the Iraqi border -- the Iranians seem to blame the British , whose troops are in southern Iraq , for some of this ( a charge vociferously denied by the British embassy in Tehran ) -- but it 's not a topic of great interest here .
In recent months , in fact , several bombs have gone off in minority regions of Iran .
These explosions have been reported here , but you would be hard - pressed to find out what the Iranians had to say about them , and the possibility that any of these might prove part of a U.S. ( or Anglo - American ) covert campaign to destabilize the Iranian fundamentalist regime basically does n't concern the news mind here , even though past history says it should .
After all , many of our present Middle Eastern problems can be indirectly traced back to the Anglo - American ur - moment in the Middle East , the successful CIA - British - intelligence plot in 1953 to oust Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh ( who had nationalized the Iranian oil industry ) and install the young Shah in power .
After all , in the 1980s , in the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan , the CIA ( with the eager connivance of the Pakistanis and the Saudis ) helped organize , arm , and fund the Islamic extremists who would someday turn on us for terror campaigns on a major scale .
As Steve Coll reported in his superb book Ghost Wars , for instance , " Under ISI [ Pakistani intelligence ] direction , the mujahedin received training and malleable explosives to mount car - bomb and even camel - bomb attacks in Soviet - occupied cities , usually designed to kill Soviet soldiers and commanders .
[ CIA Director William ]
Casey endorsed these despite the qualms of some CIA career officers . "
Similarly , in the early 1990s , the Iraq National Accord , an organization run by the CIA 's Iraqi exile of choice , Iyad Allawi , evidently planted , under the Agency 's direction , car bombs and explosive devices in Baghdad ( including in a movie theater ) in a fruitless attempt to destabilize Saddam Hussein 's regime .
The New York Times reported this on its front page in June 2004 ( to no effect whatsoever ) , when Allawi was the Prime Minister of American - occupied Iraq .
Who knows where the funding , training , and equipment for the bombings in Iran are coming from -- but , at a moment when charges that the Iranians are sending into Iraq advanced IEDs , or the means to produce them , are the rage , it seems a germane subject .
In this country , it 's a no- brainer that the Iranians have no right whatsoever to put their people , overtly or covertly , into neighboring Iraq , a country which , back in the 1980s , invaded Iran and fought a bitter eight - year war with it , resulting in perhaps a million casualties ; but it 's just normal behavior for the Pentagon to have traveled halfway across the planet to dominate the Iraqi military , garrison Iraq with a string of vast permanent bases , build the largest embassy on the planet in Baghdad 's Green Zone , and send special - operations teams ( and undoubtedly CIA teams as well ) across the Iranian border , or to insert them in Iran to do " reconnaissance " or even to foment unrest among its minorities .
This is the definition of an imperial worldview .
Sleepless Nights
Let 's leave Iran now and briefly take up a couple of other matters highlighted in " The Redirection " that certainly should have raised the odd red flag and pushed the odd alarm button here at home far more than his Iranian news ( which did at least get some attention ) :
1. Iran-Contra Redux : Does it raise no eyebrows that , under the leadership of Elliot Abrams ( who in the Iran - Contra period pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully withholding information from Congress and was later pardoned ) , such a meeting was held ?
Does no one want to confirm that this happened ?
Does no one want to know who attended ?
Iran -Contra alumni in the Bush administration at one time or another included former Reagan National Security Advisor John Poindexter , Otto Reich , John Negroponte ( who , Hersh claims , recently left his post as Director of National Intelligence in order to avoid the twenty - first century version of Iran - Contra -- " No way .
I 'm not going down that road again , with the N.S.C. [ National Security Council ] running operations off the books , with no [ presidential ] finding . " ) , Roger Noriega , and Robert Gates .
Did the Vice President or President sit in ?
Was either of them informed about the " lessons drawn " ?
Were the Vice President 's right - hand men , I. Lewis Libby and / or David Addington in any way involved ?
Who knows ?
In the Iran - Contra affair , the Reagan administration drew together the seediest collection of freelance arms dealers , intelligence agents , allies , and -- in the case of Ayatollah Khomeini 's Iranian regime -- sworn enemies in what can only be called " amateur hour " at the White House .
Now , it looks like the Bush administration is heading down a similar path and , given its previous " amateur hour " reputation in foreign policy , imagine what this is likely to mean .
2. Jihadis as Proxies : Using jihadis as American proxies in a struggle to rollback Iran -- with the help of the Saudis -- should have rung a few bells somewhere in American memory as another been - there , done - that moment .
In the 1980s -- on the theory that my enemy 's enemy is my friend -- the fundamentalist Catholic CIA Director William Casey came to believe that Islamic fundamentalists could prove tight and trustworthy allies in rolling back the Soviet Union .
In Afghanistan , as a result , the CIA , backed by the Saudis royals , who themselves represented an extremist form of Sunni Islam , regularly favored and funded the most extreme of the mujahedeen ready to fight the Soviets .
Who can forget the results ?
Today , according to Hersh , the Saudis are reassuring key figures in the administration that this time they have the jihadis to whom funds are flowing under control .
No problem .
If you believe that , you 'll believe anything .
3. Congress in the Dark : Hersh claims that , with the help of Saudi National Security Adviser Prince Bandar bin Sultan ( buddy to the Bushes and Dick Cheney 's close comrade - in - arms ) , the people running the black - ops programs out of Cheney 's office have managed to run circles around any possibility of Congressional oversight , leaving the institution completely " in the dark , " which is undoubtedly exactly where Congress wanted to be for the last six years .
Is this still true ?
The non-reaction to the Hersh piece is n't exactly encouraging .
To summarize , if Hersh is to be believed -- and as a major journalistic figure for the last near - 40 years he certainly deserves to be taken seriously -- the Bush administration seems to be repeating the worst mistakes of the Reagan administration and of the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan , which led inexorably to the greatest acts of blowback in our history .
Given what we already know about the Bush administration , Americans should be up nights worrying about what all this means now as well as down the line .
For Congress , the media , and Americans in general , this report should have been not just a wake - up call , but a shout for an all - nighter with NoDoz .
In my childhood , one of the Philadelphia papers regularly ran cartoon ads for itself in which some poor soul in a perilous situation -- say , clinging to the ledge of a tall building -- would be screaming for help , while passersby were so engrossed in the paper that they did n't even look up .
Now , we have the opposite situation .
A journalist essentially writing bloody murder in a giant media and governmental crowd .
In this case , no one in the mainstream evidently cares --- not yet anyway -- to pay the slightest attention .
It seems that there 's a crime going on and no one gives a damn .
Think Kitty Genovese on a giant scale .

THIS time , they ’ve gone too far .
A group of 9/11 conspiracy theorists – whackos who deny that jumbo jets brought down the World Trade Center – is on the attack .
But their latest target is n’t the government , which they claim destroyed the buildings with explosives .
They ’re using a vicious Internet assault to pick on an elderly widow .
“ They ’re dirty sons of bastards !
They are not real men , ” feisty Ellen Mariani , 69 , told me .
Ellen lost her husband aboard United 175 on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ They have no respect for women , no respect for the dead and no respect for little children who now have been orphaned . ”
Ellen is the subject of a blistering battering on the Web site of an outfit that calls itself “ 9/11 Researchers . ”
While conspiracy theories are nothing new – Rosie O’Donnell gave voice on “ The View ” to the belief the government was involved — these bozos blast fellow conspiracy groups for not going far enough .
On their Web site , Ellen ’s current , private home address is listed for every whack job to see .
There also is “ evidence ” that her husband helped plan the attacks .
How could a retired , 58 - year - old deliveryman help plan the destruction of the Twin Towers ?
The proof , presented as a kind of “ gotcha ! ” smoking gun , is strikingly shallow .
Linked to the Web site is a copy of a deed transferring her husband ’s real property to Ellen .
He took it out on July 26 , 2001 , 47 days before the trade center was destroyed .
As further “ proof ” that Louis Mariani – who went by his middle name , Neil – was involved , the Web site posts the lease transferring management rights of the World Trade Center to Larry Silverstein .
The lease was taken out two days before Louis Mariani put his property in Ellen ’s name .
Aha !
Confused ?
So am I .
The Web site is the work of a Rick Siegel , who hawks DVDs that purport to prove the trade center ’s destruction was an inside job .
He is partners with Nico Haupt , who is known for sending blistering e-mail rants to trade - center survivors .
My attempts to reach both men were fruitless .
The odd thing is that the loonies are picking on Ellen .
She has been outspoken in insisting that the government knows more about the attacks than it is admitting .
But a source familiar with the groups says they tend to target people who fall short of their extreme anti-Semitic , anti-everything views .
On Sept. 11 , 2001 , Neil , Ellen ’s husband of 13 years , boarded United 175 from Boston , bound for the wedding of Ellen ’s daughter .
Ellen was flying separately because she had booked her flight months before , and it was full .
She ’s refused to take a dime from the fund that compensates victims .
“ Could you go to sleep at night , knowing you took money for your husband ’s death ? ” she asks .
“ Try to eat alone .
Try to watch programs you both liked on TV without feeling guilty .
Try to go to sleep at night while you do n’t have your honey with you .
This is the hell I go through every day .
“ I do n’t need evil people attacking me . ”
It ’s gone far enough .

The Women ’s War
By SARA CORBETT
Many female soldiers have lived through the terrible violence of the war in Iraq .
Others have experienced sexual assault — or worse , a combination of the two .
They have found themselves struggling to cope with their lives .
By SARA CORBETTMany female soldiers have lived through the terrible violence of the war in Iraq .
Others have experienced sexual assault — or worse , a combination of the two .
They have found themselves struggling to cope with their lives .
Despite the fact that military procedure for dealing with AWOL soldiers is well established - most are promptly court - martialed and , if convicted , reduced in rank and jailed in a military prison - Suzanne Swift 's situation raised a seemingly unusual set of issues .
She told Army investigators that the reason she did not report for deployment was that she had been sexually harassed repeatedly by three of her supervisors throughout her military service : beginning in Kuwait ; through much of her time in Iraq ; and following her return to Fort Lewis .
She claimed too to be suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder , or PTSD , a highly debilitating condition brought on by an abnormal amount of stress .
According to the most recent edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , used by mental - health professionals to establish diagnostic criteria , PTSD symptoms can include , among other things , depression , insomnia or " feeling constantly threatened . "
It is common for those afflicted to " re-experience " traumatic moments through intrusive , graphic memories and nightmares .
The V.A. notes that as of last November , [ almost ] one - third [ see Seal et al. , 2007 ] of the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan treated at its facilities were given diagnoses of a mental - health disorder , with PTSD being the most common .
So far , the V.A. has diagnosed possible PTSD in some 34,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans ; nearly 3,800 of them are women .
Given that PTSD sometimes takes years to surface in a veteran , these numbers are almost assuredly going to grow .
While serving in a mostly male reserve unit in Kuwait , [ another soldier ] was sexually assaulted .
After returning home to Michigan , she began exhibiting symptoms of PTSD - jumpiness , intrusive thoughts and nightmares - and promptly went to her local V.A. hospital for help .
She was then put into group therapy - which has long been shown to be an economical and reasonably effective way of helping trauma survivors process their experiences - but her " group " was made up entirely of male Vietnam vets , some of whom were trying to work through sex crimes they committed during military service .
Others came home from war and beat their wives .
" I freaked out , " the female reservist told me .
" It sent me into a complete tailspin . "

No improvement of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms with guanfacine treatment .
Am J Psychiatry 163 : 2186 -8 .
OBJECTIVE :
The authors report an 8 - week , double - blind , randomized controlled trial of guanfacine versus placebo for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
METHOD : Veterans with chronic PTSD who were medication - free or receiving stable pharmacotherapy were randomly assigned to guanfacine ( N=29 ) versus placebo ( N=34 ) .
RESULTS : Guanfacine had no effect on PTSD symptoms , subjective sleep quality , or general mood disturbances .
Guanfacine was associated with a number of side effects .
CONCLUSIONS : These results do not support the use of alpha 2 agonists in veterans with chronic PTSD .

... propranolol , injected either systemically or directly into LA [ lateral amygdala ] lastingly impaired fear memory .
Postreactivation propranolol significantly weakened fear responses measured 48 h later .
...
Interestingly , our published findings indicate that propranolol disrupts reconsolidation of a memory 2 months after training .
Therefore , even well - consolidated old fear memories undergo reconsolidation and may be disrupted by means of pharmacological manipulation .

A single , specific memory has been wiped from the brains of rats , leaving other recollections intact .
The study adds to our understanding of how memories are made and altered in the brain , and could help to relieve sufferers of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) of the fearful memories that disrupt their lives .

Synapse - specific reconsolidation of distinct fear memories in the lateral amygdala Nat Neurosci .
Mar 11 ; [ Epub ahead of print ] .
When reactivated , memories enter a labile , protein synthesis–dependent state , a process referred to as reconsolidation .
Here , we show in rats that fear memory retrieval produces a synaptic potentiation in the lateral amygdala that is selective to the reactivated memory , and that disruption of reconsolidation is correlated with a reduction of synaptic potentiation in the lateral amygdala .
Thus , both retrieval and reconsolidation alter memories via synaptic plasticity at selectively targeted synapses .
which inhibits the kinase activity of MAP kinase kinase , or MEK -- aka MKK or MAP2K

The utility of these anti-adrenergics in the clinical treatment of PTSD remains to be determined , though it is possible that they may prove to have primary roles in a disorder that is only modestly responsive to antidepressant treatment .

Or so the story went , a story that motivated the idea of guanfacine treatment in the first place .
However , recent work ( Ramos & Arnsten , 2005 ; Arnsten & Li , 2007 ) has shown that alpha - 2 receptors are much more prominent post - synaptically , and guanfacine is more selective for those than for pre-synaptic autoreceptors ( and is selective to a greater extent than clonidine , another alpha - 2 blood pressure med known to produce sedation ) .

The 4th anniversary of the Iraq war was on Sunday , and some news outlets ran an obvious ( but highly neglected ) story : Violence takes severe mental toll on Iraqis Much more common are stories on the psychological toll of war in U.S. military personnel .
There 's a depressing article in the Magazine about post - traumatic stress disorder in women soldiers stationed in Iraq .
Among other examples , the article recounts the ordeal of Suzanne Swift , a 21 - year - old Army specialist , who went AWOL rather than return to a second tour of duty in Iraq :
Given their current track record of providing adequate medical care to returning veterans , will the current administration find the funds to improve the standard of care not only for the physically wounded ( see the Walter Reed debacle ) , but also for the astonishingly large number of vets ( 33 % ) diagnosed with mental illnesses ?
What are the appropriate treatments for women with PTSD ?
Surely not this one :
In addition to psychotherapy ( including Exposure Therapy -- a Cognitive Behavioral intervention -- and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ) for those with PTSD , drugs that affect the neurotransmitter norepinephrine have been tested .
A recent clinical trial of guanfacine was a complete failure ( Neylan et al. , 2006 ) : Guanfacine is an antihypertensive drug and an alpha - 2 adrenergic agoninst that binds to autoreceptors on locus coeruleus ( Berridge & Waterhouse , 2003 ) neurons ] , thereby inhibiting their activity and hence , the release of norepinephrine .
When administered at low doses , guanfacine binds to post - synaptic alpha - 2 receptors in places like the prefrontal cortex ( Arnsten et al. , 1988 ) .
Another blood pressure medication , propranolol ( a beta blocker ) , has been more widely used as a potential treatment for anxiety disorders and PTSD ( e.g. , Strawn & Geracioti , 2007 ) .
Similar to the use of alpha - 2 agents , the idea behind propranolol is to normalize the hyperactive noradrenegic system in PTSD ( a state produced by exposure to extreme levels of stress ) .
Excessive norepinephrine ( and the associated signal transduction activity ) is thought to result in a trauma - induced enhancement of memory encoding for the harrowing event ( Debiec & LeDoux , 2006 ) .
Animal models of fear conditioning have been used to assess possible pharmacological treatments targeting the amygdala , a critical region for fear learning ( Debiec & LeDoux , 2006 ) .
These treatments aim to impair memory consolidation and reconsolidation ( reactivating a memory by retrieving it ) :
For a more selective approach to PTSD , is it possible to All very Lacuna Inc. ( as other observers have noted ) .
Original paper :
In that experiment ( and others like it ) , rats were treated with the MEK Inhibitor , U0126 ] , not propranolol .
U0126 is not exactly approved for human useSo what about propranolol for PTSD ?

A TAXI driver in Toyama prefecture is arrested for rape and attempted rape , confesses to both crimes , is convicted after a brief trial and serves his three years in prison .
Meanwhile , another man , arrested on rape charges , also confesses to the two crimes the first man was convicted for .
He , too , goes to jail and serves his time .
Is this a story by Jorge Luis Borges , a case of trumped - up charges from the annals of Stalinist Russia , a trick question in a Cambridge tripos ?
None of the above .
It is a recent instance , and not an uncommon one , of the Japanese judicial system at work .
On January 26th Jinen Nagase , Japan 's justice minister , apologised for the wrongful arrest of the taxi driver and declared that an investigation would take place .
After all , the suspect had an alibi , evidence that he could not have committed the crime and had denied vociferously having done so .
But after the third day in detention without access to the outside world , he was persuaded to sign a confession .
With too many instances of wrongful arrest and conviction , few expect anything to come from the justice ministry 's investigation .
But the spotlight has begun to shine on the practices of police interrogation as well as on the court 's presumption of guilt .
More and more innocent victims of Japan 's judicial zeal are going public with grim accounts of their experiences at the hands of the police and the court system .
Now a new film about wrongful arrest by one of Japan 's most respected directors , Masayuki Suo , has just opened to critical acclaim .
The movie , entitled “ I Just Didn't Do It ” , is based on a true story about a young man who was accused of molesting a schoolgirl on a crowded train — and refused adamantly to sign a confession .
Thanks to support from friends and family , the real - life victim finally won a retrial after two years of protesting his innocence , and is today a free man .
The film , which was premièred in America and Britain before opening in Japan , depicts how suspects , whether guilty or innocent , are brutalised by the Japanese police , and how the judges side with the prosecutors .
Mr Suo argues that suspects are presumed guilty until proven innocent , and that the odds are stacked massively against them being so proven .
The statistics would seem to bear him out .
Japan is unique among democratic countries in that confessions are obtained from 95 % of all people arrested , and that its courts convict 99.9 % of all the suspects brought before them .
Prosecutors are ashamed of being involved in an acquittal and fear that losing a case will destroy their careers .
Judges get promotion for the speed with which they process their case - loads .
And juries do not exist , though there is talk of introducing a watered - down system called saiban - in for open - and - shut cases .
Apparently , members of the public are not to be trusted with cases that might involve special knowledge .
Those will still be heard and ruled on — as are all cases in Japan today — by judges alone .
Despite Article 38 of the Japanese constitution , which guarantees an accused person 's right to remain silent , the police and the prosecutors put maximum emphasis on obtaining a confession rather than building a case based on evidence .
The official view is that confession is an essential first step in rehabilitating offenders .
Japanese judges tend to hand down lighter sentences when confessions are accompanied by demonstrations of remorse .
Even more important , prosecutors have the right to ask for lenient sentences when the accused has been especially co-operative .
It is how the police obtain these confessions that troubles human - rights activists .
A suspect can be held for 48 hours without legal counsel or contact with the outside world .
After that , he or she is turned over to the public prosecutor for another 24 hours of grilling .
A judge can then grant a further ten days of detention , which can be renewed for another ten days .
Japan 's constitution also states that confessions obtained under compulsion , torture or threat , or after prolonged periods of detention , cannot be admitted as evidence .
Yet threats and even torture are reckoned to be used widely in detention centres — especially as interrogators are not required to record their interviews .
Accidental death during custody happens suspiciously often .
Facing up to a possible 23 days of continuous browbeating , or worse , could persuade many wrongfully arrested people to accept their fate and sign a confession as the quickest way to put the whole sorry mess behind them .

Rising interest rates can mean many things for the U.S. economy , but one thing is always certain when it comes to homeowners : when rates go up , refinancing goes down .
With the Federal Open Markets Committee — the 12 - member group that helps decide monetary policy as part of the Federal Reserve — set to meet on Dec. 13 and 14 , mortgage rates could be on track to do something they have rarely done in recent years , which is to move higher .
While a rise in mortgage rates is not ideal for the home refinance market , it calls more for a shift in tactics rather than completely giving up on the idea of refinancing .
5 ways to refinance when rates rise
Here are five ways you can think about refinancing when rates are rising :
Shift to a shorter loan .
15 - year mortgage rates have been running about 80 basis points below 30 - year rates , so even if rates overall have moved a bit higher , there might still be room to lower your interest rate by shifting to a shorter loan .
Also , even without dropping your rate a shift to a shorter loan should save you interest costs in the long run because you will be paying interest over fewer years .
Consider variable rates for short time horizons .
If you anticipate being able to pay of your mortgage in a few years , consider a shift to an adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) .
These offer even lower rates than 15 - year loans , and if you choose an ARM with a long initial reset period , you can reduce your exposure to rising rates .
Take advantage of improved credit .
The job market has gotten stronger in recent years , and now that you 're a few years older perhaps your income and credit rating have improved from when you first got your mortgage .
If so , this might help you qualify for a lower mortgage rate , and make refinancing worthwhile even though average rates have started to rise .
Use refinancing for payment management .
Lowering your mortgage rate is not the only reason to refinance .
If you are having trouble making your monthly payments , refinancing to a longer repayment period can help make those payments more manageable .
Even though this is likely to result in you paying more interest over the life of the loan , it is preferable to risking default .
Another option is using cash - out refinancing for debt consolidation , because mortgages are still cheaper than most other sources of debt , such as credit cards .
Do some comparison shopping .
When rates are on the move , comparing mortgage quotes from different lenders becomes especially important .
Different lenders are going to react to a rising rate environment at different times and to different degrees , so shopping around might make an especially big difference .

Plan Would Deny Legally Mandated Pay Increase , Stiff Military Servicemen and Women Serving in Combat in Most Dangerous Part of the World ...

{ Ed Note :
An error in this report was later discovered while working on a follow - up to it .
The illegality of the Bush military pay raise proposal as described in the report below , is based on a 1999 law which phased out the pay formula that Bush failed to meet , by fiscal year 2008 .
Lawmakers are in the process of restoring that provision , even while another law also keeps the legality of Bush 's proposal in doubt .
The full details and explanation for the error , after combing through a soup of defense authorization provisions , are explained in our follow up report .
The BRAD BLOG regrets the error.}
Recently the Bush Administration and Democratically - controlled Congress were at odds over how much to pay US soldiers serving in the most dangerous places in the world : Iraq and Afghanistan .
Congress said that the troops should get a raise of 3.5 % , while the Administration said any raise higher than 3 % was not deserved .
Administration officials even bluntly said the White House " strongly opposes " giving the troops that extra 0.5 % .
Although Democrats have been arguing for the 3.5 % raise , what neither they , nor any news organization seems to have thus far noticed , is that the Administration 's meager compensation plan would be , in fact , illegal .
Increases in military salary are traditionally determined by increases in average civilian salary , according to a method of measurement called the Employment Cost Index .
Regardless of the actual dollar increase in salary , the base pay for service - members must be at least 0.5 % above the corresponding civilian pay because of a Defense Authorization Act which Congress passed in 1999 .
But according to Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers , the Bush Administration 's proposed raise of only 3 % for active - duty troops in Iraq and Afghanistan is actually less than the average increase in civilian wages from 2006 to 2007 ( 3.3 % ) , instead of the required 0.5 % more than the average civilian wage ( which would be equal to 3.8 % ) .
If Congress passes the funding plan that the Administration has proposed , they will , in effect , be illegally depriving the troops of the minimum pay raise guaranteed to them by the earlier law .
The move would save the Bush Administration millions and could cost new US Army recruits ( who are the least effected by the proposed pay raise ) a few hundred dollars annually .
Still , some service - members might take comfort from the fact that the issue at hand is a raise in salary , not a decrease , as the Bush Administration and the Department of Defense had previously tried to pull off in 2003 , until they got caught red- handed attempting to stiff U.S. troops back then as well ...
In the summer of 2003 , the Bush Administration secretly planned pay cuts for soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was not until the plan was made public that the White House was forced to make an embarrassing political flip - flop on the matter , but not before several high - profile Democrats decried their efforts to save money by depriving the troops of their " imminent danger pay . "
As a result , American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan who faced considerable risk of being " killed , injured , or wounded by hostile fire , explosion of a hostile mine , or any other hostile action , " were allowed to keep their imminent danger pay .
Even so , that is n't much compared to the $ 2,100 a month that the Canadian government gives as a bonus to its soldiers stationed in hostile places like Afghanistan -- tax free .
That 's about $ 1,929 when converted to American dollars , which is still a far cry from the extra $ 7.50 each day that American soldiers get for putting themselves in the most dangerous place in the world .
The average salary of males age 25 and over in the United States is more than $ 39,000 according to the US Census Bureau .
There are soldiers in Iraq earning less than half that in basic pay .
Republican Representative Mike Pence of Indiana recently compared an Iraqi market he visited --- one that had been scene of an earlier car bomb --- to a " normal outdoor market in Indiana in the summertime . "
The average Indiana police officer earns more than $ 45,000 according to data available on the website Salary.com .
Privates starting out in the US Army , on the other hand , can get better pay at McDonalds flipping burgers .
Questions also arise about the pay that American soldiers are given compared to that of Iraqi soldiers .
The minimum wage in Iraq is the equivalent of 70 US dollars a month , and although the new Iraqi Army was paid that wage at its inception in 2003 , officials later raised Iraqi salaries by four times that amount .
Still , Iraqi soldiers complain that this is still not nearly enough money to compensate them for the enormous risks they face on the job .
So far in 2007 , 419 American soldiers have died in Iraq , but more than twice that number of Iraqi security forces have been killed , according to the website iCasualties.org which monitors fatalities in the conflict .
It 's not just American soldiers who are being paid shockingly low wages for their service .
British soldiers in Iraq risking their lives in the middle east are paid less than the average starting salary of a police officer back home in England --- less than half of the British minimum wage .
One British officer complained to the UK newspaper The Independent last year : " Frankly , [ British privates ] would make more money emptying dustbins .
They are being treated appallingly . "
Unless those dustbins are located in the middle of a war zone , it 's probably safe to say that emptying them is a lot less dangerous --- and smell every bit as bad --- as the job soldiers are being asked to do in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Update :
An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that the increase in ECI from 2006 to 2007 was 3.2 % , it was actually 3.3 % , meaning that the Administration 's salary plan would deprive service - members of slightly more salary than previously thought .
I regret the error .

You are probably familiar with the Rule of 72 , which tells you when the one dollar you invest today will be worth $ 2 once you have a rate of growth .
If your annual rate of return is R % , then it will take you ( 72 / R ) years to double your money .
For instance , for a 6 % return ( assuming the rate is constant ) , you will need 72/6 = 12 years to see 100 % gain of your money .
Now let ’s think about doubling the gain instead of the principle .
How long will it take for one dollar to become three ?
Again assuming the rate of return is R % , the number of years for one dollar to become three is given by the following equation :
The math is quite straightforward and can be done easily with Excel .
But if you do n’t want to do the “ dirty ” work yourself , then the following plot is provided for your convenience so you can have an idea on how long and how fast you should go .
Note that the number of years to triple is smaller than the rate of return ( without the percentage ) once the return rate reaches R = 11 , at which point , you only need ten and a half years to earn two dollars for every dollar invested .
So we know which rate can give us a reasonable time frame to triple our money .
The next question is how we can achieve that goal .
That is , where can we find that 11 % annual return to help us to earn 200 % return in a little over ten years ?
In the May issue of Kiplinger ’s Personal Finance magazine , an article , Triple Your Money , asks and answers this very question .
Using historical data from 1926 , the article points out that investors can expect to earn 200 % return in 11 years by investing in US stocks , which on average returned 10.4 % since 1926 .
The following is a re-produced plot from the article , showing average returns of some major investment vehicles ( 30 - day T - bills for Cash ) and the corresponding years to triple .
What if you want to see your asset triple in five years instead of ten ?
Is that do able ?
The answer is Yes , but that will require some aggressive investments .
The rate of return vs. years to triple plot above indicates that you can indeed triple your invested money in 5 years if the investments can sustain an annual return of 25 % for five years !
If history is any guide , we can find exactly which investments can make one dollar in 2002 worth three dollars in 2007 .
Using Morningstar ’s mutual fund screen tool and with the following criteria :
No load fund only
Minimum investment <= $ 3,000
Expense ratio ( ER ) <= 1.5 %
5 year return >= 25 %
There criteria , except the last one , are chosen such that small investors can participate without having to pay big fees .
The search returned just 24 funds that meet the above requirements and , not surprisingly , they are all in the three hot categories of the past several years : real estate , precious metal , and foreign stocks .

We do , however , have to remember that “ past performance does n’t guarantee future results . ”
The way I look at these funds ( or the fund categories ) is that they are important ingredients of a healthy portfolio , but I wo n’t bet big money on any of them just because they have returned nicely over some 5 + years ( here are some discussions on asset allocation and real estate investment ) .
I ’d love to see my money triple in five years , but I also want a good sleep every night without worrying what will happen to my money tomorrow .
And since they all performed incredibly well since 2001 , easy money may have already being made .
Therefore , some cautions are needed when weighing your options on when to get in and what to invest .
On another note , the theory of tripling your money for a given rate of return is based on the assumption that the investment is made at the beginning of the period instead of a gradual but regular approach .
If you do dollar - cost averaging , you will need much longer time to see the 200 % return ( here ’s why ) .
The reason is that all three categories are in a bull market for some time and every time you made a purchase , the shares were likely to be more expensive than what you paid last time .
When the Senate returns from recess on July 9 , they will turn their attention to the Department of Defense authorization bill and , among what I 'm sure will be a flurry of amendments , will be S. 185 , a bill to " â€¦restore habeas corpus for those detained by the United States . "
For some reason , standing up for our country 's creed can be tough for some politicians , and it will be instructive to see who in the Senate will move to reverse the Bush administration 's trampling of our Constitution and who will stand idly by as we lose more of our national identity and witness further erosion of our global reputation .
Senator Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI ) signed on last week to cosponsor S.185 , the Habeas Corpus Restoration
Act of 2007 , which made me go do a quick review of where we stand with demonstrable support for this vital measure .
The bill passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 11 - 8 earlier this month and has the following 22 Democratic Senators committed to cosponsoring the bill to restore the Constitutional protection of habeas corpus :
Joe Biden ( D - DE )
Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM )
Barbara Boxer ( D - CA )
Sherrod Brown ( D - OH )
Maria Cantwell ( D - WA )
Ben Cardin ( D - MD )
Hillary Clinton ( D - NY )
Chris Dodd ( D - CT )
Dick Durbin ( D - IL )
Russ Feingold ( D - WI )
Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA )
Tom Harkin ( D - IA )
Ted Kennedy ( D - MA )
John Kerry ( D - MA )
Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ )
Patrick Leahy ( D - VT )
Carl Levin ( D - MI )
Barack Obama ( D - IL )
Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV )
Ken Salazar ( D - CO )
Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI )
Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI )
These Democrats were joined by Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont in supporting S. 185 .
" Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last yearâ€™s legislation .
I hope that the new Senate will reconsider this historic error in judgment and set the matter right , " said Patrick Leahy in the June 7 Judiciary Committee hearings .
" Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II , the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear and another stain on Americaâ€™s reputation in the world . "
" Whatever long - term counterterrorism strategy America pursues , it will be undermined if we fail to adhere to our longstanding American value , " said Russ Feingold in the same Judiciary hearings .
" We cannot begin to make a dent in terrorist recruitment and plotting worldwide without sending a clear message that the United States will adhere to the principles that make our country great . "
So , with 22 Democratic Senators supporting the restoration of habeas corpus , the logical question that follows is where are the others on something this central to true American values ?
It 's one thing , though not necessarily the right thing , for a Gulf Coast Senator to shy away from openly supporting an oil - drilling ban or a Michigan lawmaker to balk at anything that might hurt the auto industry , but restoring rights that Team Bush has gutted from our Constitution seems like something that should get unanimous support -- at least among members of the Democratic party .
Here 's the list of Democratic Senators who need to hear from you .
Even if they intend to vote for the Habeas Corpus Restoration
Act of 2007 when it comes to the Senate floor next month , they need to be pushed further to stand up and cosponsor this important component in taking back our country :
Daniel Akaka ( D - HI )
Max Baucus ( D - MT )
Evan Bayh ( D - IN )
Robert Byrd ( D - WV )
Thomas Carper ( D - DE )
Robert Casey ( D - PA )
Kent Conrad ( D - ND )
Byron Dorgan ( D - ND )
Daniel Inouye ( D - HI )
Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN )
Herb Kohl ( D - WI )
Mary Landrieu ( D - LA )
Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR )
Claire McCaskill ( D - MO )
Robert Menendez ( D - NJ )
Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD )
Patty Murray ( D - WA )
Ben Nelson ( D - NE )
Bill Nelson ( D - FL )
Mark Pryor ( D - AR )
Jack Reed ( D - RI )
Harry Reid ( D - NV )
Charles Schumer ( D - NY )
Jon Tester ( D - MT )
James Webb ( D - VA )
Ron Wyden ( D - OR )
Tim Johnson ( D - SD ) is still recovering from a brain hemorrhage but may be able to come in for a close vote and , what the heck , you might even want to try giving Joe Lieberman 's office a call to see if he wants to start doing the right thing .
Today is the American Civil Liberty Union 's " Day of Action to Restore Law and Justice " and it's the day to call on Congress to restore habeas corpus , fix the Military Commissions Act , end torture and rendition and restore our Constitutional rights .
Calling your Senators and making sure your voice is heard on the importance of restoring habeas corpus is a good place to start .
Here 's the toll - free number to dial at the U.S. Capitol : 800-862-5530 .
Just call and ask to be connected to your Senator 's office .
If you get a chronic busy signal -- which is very possible today -- you can see a directory of direct lines to Senate offices here .
Let 's get going .
The world is watching .
Update : Christy Hardin Smith and the gang at Firedoglake are going to be keeping an eye on how this goes all day today .
Please visit them for more .
Clarification Update : I 've gotten quite a few e-mails from people asking if it 's possible for Senators to not cosponsor the bill , but still support it and vote for it .
Yes , that is entirely possible .
But cosponsoring the legislation ramps up the level of commitment and , for something that strikes to the core of American values like this , we should expect all Democrats to lead and not just follow .

Every Independence
Day we celebrate the founding of the world ’s most powerful — and for some , inspirational — nation .
Yet for several months after July 4 , 1776 , the self - proclaimed United States of America looked set to go down in history as a nation that never was .
That August , in the biggest battle of the Revolution , the British trounced the Continental Army on Long Island , nearly forcing an American surrender .
As Washington ’s beleaguered soldiers retreated through New Jersey , thousands of Americans loyal to King George III surged into New York City — where they would remain under British protection for the rest of the war .
These loyalists had no desire “ to dissolve the political bands ” with Britain , as the Declaration of Independence demanded .
Instead , as they explained in a petition to British authorities , they “ steadily and uniformly opposed ” this “ most unnatural , unprovoked Rebellion , that ever disgraced the annals of Time . ”
While the rebels sought to sever the connection between Britain and the colonies , the loyalists “ most ardently wish[ed ] for a restoration of that union between them . ”
Where the rebels challenged the king , the loyalists staunchly upheld royal authority : they had “ borne true Allegiance to His Majesty , and the most warm and affectionate attachment to his Person and Government . ”
During three days in November 1776 , this petition sat in Scott ’s Tavern , on Wall Street , to be signed by anyone who wished .
A frank declaration of dependence , it completely lacks the revolutionary genius and rhetorical grace of our hallowed July 4 document .
Yet in all , more than 700 people put their names to the parchment — 12 times the number who signed the Declaration of Independence .
Among the signatories were pillars of New York society : wealthy merchants like Hugh Wallace , who commanded vast tracts of land and capital ; members of some of New York ’s most prominent families , the DeLanceys , the Livingstons and the Philipses ; and the clergymen Charles Inglis and Samuel Seabury , who published articulate rebuttals to rebel pamphlets like Thomas Paine ’s “ Common Sense . ”
But most of the names belonged to the ordinary people who made New York run : tavern keepers and carpenters ; farmers from the Hudson Valley or New Jersey ; men like the baker James Orchard , who supplied bread for British troops ; the Greenwich blacksmith James Stewart , who joined the British Army ; and the hairdresser and perfumer James Deas .
Loyalists are the American Revolution ’s guilty secret : rarely spoken of , hauntingly present .
At least one in five Americans is believed to have remained loyal to Britain during the war .
They expressed their opinions passively and actively : refusing to forswear allegiance to the king , signing petitions or joining loyalist military regiments — as nearly 20,000 men did — to defend their vision of British America .
In retaliation , they faced harassment from their peers , most vividly ( if rarely ) by tarring and feathering .
Some would suffer for their loyalty in open battle ; others faced sanctions from state legislatures , which could strip them of their land and possessions , imprison them or formally banish them .
Bush skips baseball ’s opening day
By David Walsh
3 April 2007
If George W. Bush ’s unpopularity and isolation needed to be underscored , his decision not to throw out the ceremonial opening day ball of the major league baseball season served the purpose .
Bush spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore told the Washington Post that the president had been invited by the Washington Nationals baseball team to throw out the first ball at the afternoon game between the Nationals and the Florida Marlins at RFK Stadium , but “ it ’s not possible with his schedule . ”
She elaborated , “ He ’s got various meetings during the day , a meeting earlier in the morning . . .
It just was n’t going to work out . ”
With the president ’s ratings languishing , the Post asked Lawrimore whether Bush “ feared he ’d get booed . ”
“ No , ” she replied .
“ Certainly not . ”
Most people over the age of 10 would be skeptical .
According to the White House , the president ’s schedule included an 11 a.m. meeting on health savings accounts in the Roosevelt Room and at 2:35 p.m. the presentation of “ the Commander - in - Chief ’s Trophy to the United States Naval Academy Football Team in the Rose Garden , ” awarded to each season ’s winner of the college football series among the various service academies .
Of all the recent US presidents , Bush is most closely identified with baseball , having served ( profitably ) as a part - owner of the Texas Rangers ’ franchise from 1989 to 1994 .
In remarks before a group of baseball Hall of Famers at the White House in 2004 , Bush declared , “ You know , I love the game of baseball .
I grew up loving baseball . ”
He also noted that “ One of the traditions , of course , is for the president to throw out the opening pitch for baseball . ”
The official White House web site has special pages devoted to baseball .
One begins , “ When President George W. Bush threw out the first pitch at the 2001 World Series , the moment not only continued a presidential tradition , but it symbolized America ’s desire to continue life undeterred after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
“ President George W. Bush ’s love of baseball began during his childhood in Midland , Texas , where he played Little League Baseball and dreamed of following in the footsteps of baseball great , Willie Mays . . .
“ From throwing to catching and fielding to batting , America ’s presidents have long enjoyed playing or watching a good game of baseball .
A soldier ’s diary reveals that George Washington and his men played an early version of baseball called ‘ rounders ’ on the fields of Valley Forge .
History records that John Adams played ‘ bat and ball ’ and Andrew Jackson played a similar game of baseball called ‘ one old cat . ’
Abraham Lincoln ’s love of the game was so well known that an 1860 political cartoon showed Lincoln and his opponents on a baseball diamond . ”
The Baseball Hall of Fame web site carries an article entitled , “ Baseball as patriotism and pride : the connection between our national pastime and the presidency . ”
It declares , “ The president ’s annual appearance at the start of each season symbolically renews the bonds that unite the country , its leaders , and the game — a ceremonial springtime rebirth as America ’s National Pastime .
For presidents , baseball offers a welcome connection to a wholesome , all - American image .
“ Baseball and the American presidency have had a long history together .
Since baseball ’s inception in the mid-19th century , presidents have been involved with the National Pastime in many ways , by participating , watching or supporting .
As far back as 1860 , associations between presidents and baseball appeared in print and illustration .
Since 1910 , presidents have ceremoniously rung in the new baseball year by throwing out the first pitch on Opening Day , providing official sanction to the beginning of the season .
In addition , for more than a century , US presidents have also taken time from their busy schedules to attend other games , from amateur sandlot contests near the White House to All - Star and World Series games . ”
Photos of presidents , including famously Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt , throwing out the first ball at crowded stadiums are part of American political lore .
Major League Baseball ’s web site notes , “ When you think of Opening Day in Washington ballparks , you think of presidents throwing out the first pitch in the days of Walter Johnson and the old Senators . ”
However , “ For this game [ in 2007 ] , the ceremonial first pitch will feature a celebration of baseball history in the nation ’s capital . ”
In its article on Bush ’s decision not to attend the game , the Post , inevitably , downplays the real reasons .
The newspaper prefers to suggest that the decision merely perpetuates “ a ritual ’s slow decline , ” i.e. , fewer presidential appearances on baseball ’s opening day in recent decades .
Baseball no longer holds “ a singular grip on America ’s imagination , ” argues the Post .
Baseball may be losing that grip , but the gulf between the US population and the political establishment is growing at an even more rapid rate .
Bush ’s absence at RFK Stadium is the result of the fact that he is widely despised by the American public — and he despises it back .
Bush ’s approval ratings hover around 30 percent and Vice President Dick Cheney ’s are even lower .
In 2006 , Cheney appeared at the Washington Nationals home opener — apparently sporting a bulletproof vest under his baseball jacket — and was roundly jeered .
Fox News and others muted the sound when they ran videos of the vice president ’s appearance , because the booing was so politically embarrassing .
It was a humiliation to which Cheney was not likely to subject himself again .
This year , according to the White House , the vice president will be speaking at 1:30 pm at a reception for Republican Senator Jeff Sessions in Birmingham , Alabama .
The alienation of the present administration from wide layers of the population is perhaps unprecedented in modern American history .
It takes countless forms .
From manipulating information and the media , ensuring that no critics are allowed to attend any events where the president and vice president appear , to creating a physical barrier between themselves and the public , this government is unique .
Both the president and the vice president speak only before a select type of crowd .
Generally , they address right - wing veterans ’ organizations , business groups , vetted audiences of military personnel and the like .
Recently , for example , Bush delivered a bellicose attack on opponents of his Iraq war policy to a Washington DC convention of the National Cattlemen ’s Beef Association convention , the chief lobbying arm of beef producers and a notoriously right - wing outfit .
Dick Cheney addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars in early March , promising to fix the mess at the Walter Reed medical center in Washington , where wounded veterans have been mistreated .
In the middle of the month Cheney launched an attack on war critics before a crowd at the American - Israel Public Affairs Committee , the well - known pro-Israel lobby ( where he was received coolly , in fact ) .
It would be unthinkable for Bush or Cheney to make a spontaneous appearance in any large or even medium - sized American urban center .
Massive security , armies of Secret Service and local police , bullet - proof SUVs and Black Hawk helicopters accompany both men on their forays into American and foreign cities .
They move about like the heads of authoritarian regimes or invaders in hostile territory .
Their handlers , with good reason , operate on the premise that there are many reasons for these men to be despised .
During the recent trial of former Cheney chief of staff I. Lewis Libby in Washington , the difficulty of assembling an impartial jury was noted by commentators , so deep and widespread is the hostility to the Bush administration and its cast of characters .
Dozens of potential jurors were excluded after expressing contempt for the administration and Cheney in particular .
The Bush decision to skip the Nationals ’ home opener , in its own fashion , speaks to the political and social chasm between the people and the ruling elite .
Making use of SIMD units such as MMX , SSE , or AltiVec is usually a tradeoff of portability for speed .
Recent versions of GCC include an extension that allows you to write vector code without sacrificing portability .
David Chisnall takes a look at how to use it .

C : The Cross - Platform Assembler
The original intention of C was to provide a portable substitute for assembly language for implementing UNIX .
C semantics are very similar to those of the PDP - 11 ; for example , C includes shift operations but not rotation , because the PDP - 11 did n’t have a rotate instruction .
C did register naming for you , but everything else was designed to be trivial to map to an assembly language .
Because it was so close to the real hardware , C code written by a competent programmer typically ran quickly .
In recent years , by contrast , high - performance code has gained a big boost from running on the vector units found on most modern CPUs .
Traditional CPU instructions are single instruction , single data ( SISD ) , also called scalar operations .
A single instruction does something to a single set of operands , such as adding a single integer to another integer .
These operations are easily represented in C. Vector units , on the other hand , execute single instruction , multiple data ( SIMD ) operations .
Each instruction does the same thing to several sets of operations .
A vector add operation , for example , might take a vector of four integers , add them to another four integers , and give four integers as a result .
These days , most C compilers try to output vector instructions .
This is non-trivial .
For one thing , vector units are often quite picky about alignment ; while a CPU might only require alignment on 4 - byte boundaries for loads , its vector unit could need data aligned on 16 - byte boundaries .
For another , the compiler has to make sure that it can make the operations happen at the same time without altering the program semantics of the code .
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV
By Fyodor Mikailovich Dostoevsky
Translated by Constance Garnett
Chapter 5
The Grand Inquisitor
" EVEN this must have a preface - that is , a literary preface , " laughed Ivan , " and I am a poor hand at making one .
You see , my action takes place in the sixteenth century , and at that time , as you probably learnt at school , it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth .
Not to speak of Dante , in France , clerks , as well as the monks in the monasteries , used to give regular performances in which the Madonna , the saints , the angels , Christ , and God Himself were brought on the stage .
In those days it was done in all simplicity .
In Victor Hugo 's Notre Dame de Paris an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the Hotel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI in honour of the birth of the dauphin .
It was called Le bon jugement de la tres sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie , and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her bon jugement .
Similar plays , chiefly from the Old Testament , were occasionally performed in Moscow too , up to the times of Peter the Great .
But besides plays there were all sorts of legends and ballads scattered about the world , in which the saints and angels and all the powers of Heaven took part when required .
In our monasteries the monks busied themselves in translating , copying , and even composing such poems - and even under the Tatars .
There is , for instance , one such poem ( of course , from the Greek ) , The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell , with descriptions as bold as Dante's .
Our Lady visits hell , and the Archangel Michael leads her through the torments .
She sees the sinners and their punishment .
There she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a burning lake ; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they can't swim out , and ' these God forgets '- an expression of extraordinary depth and force .
And so Our Lady , shocked and weeping , falls before the throne of God and begs for mercy for all in hell - for all she has seen there , indiscriminately .
Her conversation with God is immensely interesting .
She beseeches Him , she will not desist , and when God points to the hands and feet of her Son , nailed to the Cross , and asks , ' How can I forgive His tormentors ? ' she bids all the saints , all the martyrs , all the angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all without distinction .
It ends by her winning from God a respite of suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day , and the sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell , chanting , ' Thou art just , O Lord , in this judgment . '
Well , my poem would have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time .
He comes on the scene in my poem , but He says nothing , only appears and passes on .
Fifteen centuries have passed since
He promised to come in His glory , fifteen centuries since
His prophet wrote , ' Behold , I come quickly ' ;
' Of that day and that hour knoweth no man , neither the Son , but the Father , ' as He Himself predicted on earth .
But humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love .
Oh , with greater faith , for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from heaven .
No signs from heaven come to - day To add to what the heart doth say .
There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say .
It is true there were many miracles in those days .
There were saints who performed miraculous cures ; some holy people , according to their biographies , were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself .
But the devil did not slumber , and doubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles .
And just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy .
' A huge star like to a torch ' ( that is , to a church ) ' fell on the sources of the waters and they became bitter . '
These heretics began blasphemously denying miracles .
But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent in their faith .
The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before , awaited His coming , loved Him , hoped for Him , yearned to suffer and die for Him as before .
And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervour , ' O Lord our God , hasten Thy coming ' ; so many ages called upon Him , that in His infinite mercy
He deigned to come down to His servants .
Before that day
He had come down ,
He had visited some holy men , martyrs , and hermits , as is written in their lives .
Among us , Tyutchev , with absolute faith in the truth of his words , bore witness that
Bearing the Cross , in slavish dress , Weary and worn , the Heavenly King Our mother , Russia , came to bless , And through our land went wandering .
And that certainly was so , I assure you .
" And behold , He deigned to appear for a moment to the people , to the tortured , suffering people , sunk in iniquity , but loving Him like children .
My story is laid in Spain , in Seville , in the most terrible time of the Inquisition , when fires were lighted every day to the glory of God , and 'in the splendid auto da fe the wicked heretics were burnt . '
Oh , of course , this was not the coming in which He will appear , according to His promise , at the end of time in all His heavenly glory , and which will be sudden 'as lightning flashing from east to west . '
No , He visited His children only for a moment , and there where the flames were crackling round the heretics .
In His infinite mercy
He came once more among men in that human shape in which
He walked among men for thirty - three years fifteen centuries ago .
He came down to the ' hot pavements ' of the southern town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had , ad majorem gloriam Dei , been burnt by the cardinal , the Grand Inquisitor , in a magnificent auto da fe , in the presence of the king , the court , the knights , the cardinals , the most charming ladies of the court , and the whole population of Seville .
" He came softly , unobserved , and yet , strange to say , everyone recognised Him .
That might be one of the best passages in the poem .
I mean , why they recognised Him .
The people are irresistibly drawn to Him , they surround Him , they flock about Him , follow Him .
He moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite compassion .
The sun of love burns in His heart , and power shine from His eyes , and their radiance , shed on the people , stirs their hearts with responsive love .
He holds out His hands to them , blesses them , and a healing virtue comes from contact with Him , even with His garments .
An old man in the crowd , blind from childhood , cries out , ' O Lord , heal me and I shall see Thee ! ' and , as it were , scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him .
The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet .
Children throw flowers before Him , sing , and cry hosannah .
' It is He - it is He ! ' repeat .
' It must be He , it can be no one but Him ! '
He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin .
In it lies a child of seven , the only daughter of a prominent citizen .
The dead child lies hidden in flowers .
' He will raise your child , ' the crowd shouts to the weeping mother .
The priest , coming to meet the coffin , looks perplexed , and frowns , but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail .
' If it is Thou , raise my child ! ' she cries , holding out her hands to Him .
The procession halts , the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet .
He looks with compassion , and His lips once more softly pronounce , ' Maiden , arise ! ' and the maiden arises .
The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round , smiling with wide - open wondering eyes , holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her hand .
" There are cries , sobs , confusion among the people , and at that moment the cardinal himself , the Grand Inquisitor , passes by the cathedral .
He is an old man , almost ninety , tall and erect , with a withered face and sunken eyes , in which there is still a gleam of light .
He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal 's robes , as he was the day before , when he was burning the enemies of the Roman Church - at this moment he is wearing his coarse , old , monk 's cassock .
At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and slaves and the ' holy guard . '
He stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance .
He sees everything ; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet , sees the child rise up , and his face darkens .
He knits his thick grey brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire .
He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him .
And such is his power , so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him , that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards , and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead him away .
The crowd instantly bows down to the earth , like one man , before the old Inquisitor .
He blesses the people in silence and passes on '
The guards lead their prisoner to the close , gloomy vaulted prison - in the ancient palace of the Holy , inquisition and shut him in it .
The day passes and is followed by the dark , burning , ' breathless ' night of Seville .
The air is ' fragrant with laurel and lemon . '
In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his hand .
He is alone ; the door is closed at once behind him .
He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face .
At last he goes up slowly , sets the light on the table and speaks .
" ' Is it Thou ?
Thou ? ' but receiving no answer , he adds at once .
' Do n't answer , be silent .
What canst
Thou say , indeed ?
I know too well what Thou wouldst say .
And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old .
Why , then , art Thou come to hinder us ?
For
Thou hast come to hinder us , and Thou knowest that .
But dost thou know what will be to - morrow ?
I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou or only a semblance of Him , but to - morrow I shall condemn
Thee and burn
Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics .
And the very people who have to - day kissed Thy feet , to - morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire .
Knowest
Thou that ?
Yes , maybe
Thou knowest it , ' he added with thoughtful penetration , never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner . "
" I do n't quite understand , Ivan .
What does it mean ? "
Alyosha , who had been listening in silence , said with a smile .
" Is it simply a wild fantasy , or a mistake on the part of the old man- some impossible quid pro quo ? "
" Take it as the last , " said Ivan , laughing , " if you are so corrupted by modern realism and can't stand anything fantastic .
If you like it to be a case of mistaken identity , let it be so .
It is true , " he went on , laughing , " the old man was ninety , and he might well be crazy over his set idea .
He might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner .
It might , in fact , be simply his ravings , the delusion of an old man of ninety , over - excited by the auto da fe of a hundred heretics the day before .
But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy ?
All that matters is that the old man should speak out , that he should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for ninety years . "
" And the Prisoner too is silent ?
Does
He look at him and not say a word ? "
" That 's inevitable in any case , " Ivan laughed again .
" The old man has told Him He has n't the right to add anything to what He has said of old .
One may say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism , in my opinion at least .
' All has been given by Thee to the Pope , ' they say , ' and all , therefore , is still in the Pope 's hands , and there is no need for Thee to come now at all .
Thou must not meddle for the time , at least . '
That 's how they speak and write too- the Jesuits , at any rate .
I have read it myself in the works of their theologians .
' Hast
Thou the right to reveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast come ? ' my old man asks Him , and answers the question for Him .
' No , Thou hast not ; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old , and mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt when Thou wast on earth .
Whatsoever
Thou revealest anew will encroach on men's freedom of faith ; for it will be manifest as a miracle , and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago .
Didst
Thou not often say then , " I will make you free " ?
But now
Thou hast seen these " free " men , ' the old man adds suddenly , with a pensive smile .
' Yes , we 've paid dearly for it , ' he goes on , looking sternly at Him , ' but at last we have completed that work in Thy name .
For fifteen centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom , but now it is ended and over for good .
Dost
Thou not believe that it 's over for good ?
Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me .
But let me tell
Thee that now , to - day , people are more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom , yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet .
But that has been our doing .
Was this what Thou didst ?
Was this Thy freedom ? ' "
" I do n't understand again . "
Alyosha broke in .
" Is he ironical , is he jesting ? "
" Not a bit of it !
He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy .
' For now ' ( he is speaking of the Inquisition , of course ) ' for the first time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men .
Man was created a rebel ; and how can rebels be happy ?
Thou wast warned , ' he says to Him .
' Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings , but Thou didst not listen to those warnings ;
Thou didst reject the only way by which men might be made happy .
But , fortunately , departing
Thou didst hand on the work to us .
Thou hast promised , Thou hast established by Thy word , Thou hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind , and now , of course , Thou canst not think of taking it away .
Why , then , hast Thou come to hinder us ? ' "
" And what 's the meaning of ' no lack of admonitions and warnings ' ? " asked Alyosha .
" Why , that 's the chief part of what the old man must say .
" ' The wise and dread spirit , the spirit of self - destruction and non-existence , ' the old man goes on , great spirit talked with Thee in the wilderness , and we are told in the books that he " tempted " Thee .
Is that so ?
And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject , and what in the books is called " the temptation " ?
And yet if there has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle , it took place on that day , on the day of the three temptations .
The statement of those three questions was itself the miracle .
If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books , and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew , and to do so had gathered together all the wise men of the earth - rulers , chief priests , learned men , philosophers , poets - and had set them the task to invent three questions , such as would not only fit the occasion , but express in three words , three human phrases , the whole future history of the world and of humanity - dost
Thou believe that all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness ?
From those questions alone , from the miracle of their statement , we can see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence , but with the absolute and eternal .
For in those three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is , as it were , brought together into one whole , and foretold , and in them are united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature .
At the time it could not be so clear , since the future was unknown ; but now that fifteen hundred years have passed , we see that everything in those three questions was so justly divined and foretold , and has been so truly fulfilled , that nothing can be added to them or taken from them .
" Judge Thyself who was right - Thou or he who questioned Thee then ?
Remember the first question ; its meaning , in other words , was this : " Thou wouldst go into the world , and art going with empty hands , with some promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand , which they fear and dread - for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom .
But seest
Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness ?
Turn them into bread , and mankind will run after
Thee like a flock of sheep , grateful and obedient , though for ever trembling , lest Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread . "
But
Thou wouldst not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer , thinking , what is that freedom worth if obedience is bought with bread ?
Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone .
But dost
Thou know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against
Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome
Thee , and all will follow him , crying , " Who can compare with this beast ?
He has given us fire from heaven ! "
Dost
Thou know that the ages will pass , and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime , and therefore no sin ; there is only hunger ?
" Feed men , and then ask of them virtue ! " that 's what they 'll write on the banner , which they will raise against Thee , and with which they will destroy Thy temple .
Where
Thy temple stood will rise a new building ; the terrible tower of Babel will be built again , and though , like the one of old , it will not be finished , yet Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years ; for they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower .
They will seek us again , hidden underground in the catacombs , for we shall be again persecuted and tortured .
They will find us and cry to us , " Feed us , for those who have promised us fire from heaven have n't given it ! "
And then we shall finish building their tower , for he finishes the building who feeds them .
And we alone shall feed them in Thy name , declaring falsely that it is in Thy name .
Oh , never , never can they feed themselves without us !
No science will give them bread so long as they remain free .
In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet , and say to us , " Make us your slaves , but feed us . "
They will understand themselves , at last , that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together , for never , never will they be able to share between them !
They will be convinced , too , that they can never be free , for they are weak , vicious , worthless , and rebellious .
Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven , but , I repeat again , can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak , ever sinful and ignoble race of man ?
And if for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee , what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of the heavenly ?
Or dost
Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the great and strong , while the millions , numerous as the sands of the sea , who are weak but love
Thee , must exist only for the sake of the great and strong ?
No , we care for the weak too .
They are sinful and rebellious , but in the end they too will become obedient .
They will marvel at us and look on us as gods , because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so dreadful and to rule over them - so awful it will seem to them to be free .
But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name .
We shall deceive them again , for we will not let Thee come to us again .
That deception will be our suffering , for we shall be forced to lie .
" ' This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness , and this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which Thou hast exalted above everything .
Yet in this question lies hid the great secret of this world .
Choosing " bread , " Thou wouldst have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity - to find someone to worship .
So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship .
But man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute , so that all men would agree at once to worship it .
For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other can worship , but to find community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time .
For the sake of common worship they 've slain each other with the sword .
They have set up gods and challenged one another , " Put away your gods and come and worship ours , or we will kill you and your gods ! "
And so it will be to the end of the world , even when gods disappear from the earth ; they will fall down before idols just the same .
Thou didst know ,
Thou couldst not but have known , this fundamental secret of human nature , but Thou didst reject the one infallible banner which was offered
Thee to make all men bow down to Thee alone - the banner of earthly bread ; and Thou hast rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven .
Behold what Thou didst further .
And all again in the name of freedom !
I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill - fated creature is born .
But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their freedom .
In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner ; give bread , and man will worship thee , for nothing is more certain than bread .
But if someone else gains possession of his conscience - Oh !
then he will cast away
Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience .
In that Thou wast right .
For the secret of man 's being is not only to live but to have something to live for .
Without a stable conception of the object of life , man would not consent to go on living , and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth , though he had bread in abundance .
That is true .
But what happened ?
Instead of taking men's freedom from them , Thou didst make it greater than ever !
Didst
Thou forget that man prefers peace , and even death , to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil ?
Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience , but nothing is a greater cause of suffering .
And behold , instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at rest for ever , Thou didst choose all that is exceptional , vague and enigmatic ;
Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of men , acting as though
Thou didst not love them at all -
Thou who didst come to give
Thy life for them !
Instead of taking possession of men's freedom , Thou didst increase it , and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever .
Thou didst desire man's free love , that he should follow Thee freely , enticed and taken captive by Thee .
In place of the rigid ancient law , man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself what is good and what is evil , having only Thy image before him as his guide .
But didst
Thou not know that he would at last reject even
Thy image and Thy truth , if he is weighed down with the fearful burden of free choice ?
They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee , for they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou hast caused , laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems .
" ' So that , in truth , Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the destruction of Thy kingdom , and no one is more to blame for it .
Yet what was offered Thee ?
There are three powers , three powers alone , able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent rebels for their happiness those forces are miracle , mystery and authority .
Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doing so .
When the wise and dread spirit set
Thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee , " If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself down , for it is written : the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself , and Thou shalt know then whether Thou art the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy Father . "
But
Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down .
Oh , of course , Thou didst proudly and well , like God ; but the weak , unruly race of men , are they gods ?
Oh ,
Thou didst know then that in taking one step , in making one movement to cast Thyself down , Thou wouldst be tempting God and have lost all Thy faith in Him , and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against that earth which Thou didst come to save .
And the wise spirit that tempted Thee would have rejoiced .
But I ask again , are there many like Thee ?
And couldst
Thou believe for one moment that men , too , could face such a temptation ?
Is the nature of men such , that they can reject miracle , and at the great moments of their life , the moments of their deepest , most agonising spiritual difficulties , cling only to the free verdict of the heart ?
Oh ,
Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books , would be handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the earth , and Thou didst hope that man , following
Thee , would cling to God and not ask for a miracle .
But
Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he rejects
God too ; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous .
And as man cannot bear to be without the miraculous , he will create new miracles of his own for himself , and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft , though he might be a hundred times over a rebel , heretic and infidel .
Thou didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee , mocking and reviling Thee , " Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou art He . "
Thou didst not come down , for again
Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle , and didst crave faith given freely , not based on miracle .
Thou didst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has overawed him for ever .
But
Thou didst think too highly of men therein , for they are slaves , of course , though rebellious by nature .
Look round and judge ; fifteen centuries have passed , look upon them .
Whom hast
Thou raised up to Thyself ?
I swear , man is weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast believed him !
Can he , can he do what Thou didst ?
By showing him so much respect ,
Thou didst , as it were , cease to feel for him , for Thou didst ask far too much from him -
Thou who hast loved him more than Thyself !
Respecting him less ,
Thou wouldst have asked less of him .
That would have been more like love , for his burden would have been lighter .
He is weak and vile .
What though he is everywhere now rebelling against our power , and proud of his rebellion ?
It is the pride of a child and a schoolboy .
They are little children rioting and barring out the teacher at school .
But their childish delight will end ; it will cost them dear .
Mankind as a whole has always striven to organise a universal state .
There have been many great nations with great histories , but the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were , for they felt more acutely than other people the craving for world - wide union .
The great conquerors , Timours and Ghenghis - Khans , whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth striving to subdue its people , and they too were but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal unity .
Hadst
Thou taken the world and Caesar 's purple , Thou wouldst have founded the universal state and have given universal peace .
For who can rule men if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in his hands ?
We have taken the sword of Caesar , and in taking it , of course , have rejected Thee and followed him .
Oh , ages are yet to come of the confusion of free thought , of their science and cannibalism .
For having begun to build their tower of Babel without us , they will end , of course , with cannibalism .
But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet and spatter them with tears of blood .
And we shall sit upon the beast and raise the cup , and on it will be written , " Mystery . "
But then , and only then , the reign of peace and happiness will come for men .
Thou art proud of Thine elect , but Thou hast only the elect , while we give rest to all .
And besides , how many of those elect , those mighty ones who could become elect , have grown weary waiting for Thee , and have transferred and will transfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp , and end by raising their free banner against Thee .
Thou didst Thyself lift up that banner .
But with us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom .
Oh , we shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us .
And shall we be right or shall we be lying ?
They will be convinced that we are right , for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them .
Freedom , free thought , and science will lead them into such straits and will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries , that some of them , the fierce and rebellious , will destroy themselves , others , rebellious but weak , will destroy one another , while the rest , weak and unhappy , will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us : " Yes , you were right , you alone possess
His mystery , and we come back to you , save us from ourselves ! "
" ' Receiving bread from us , they will see clearly that we take the bread made by their hands from them , to give it to them , without any miracle .
They will see that we do not change the stones to bread , but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the bread itself !
For they will remember only too well that in old days , without our help , even the bread they made turned to stones in their hands , while since they have come back to us , the very stones have turned to bread in their hands .
Too , too well will they know the value of complete submission !
And until men know that , they will be unhappy .
Who is most to blame for their not knowing it ?- speak !
Who scattered the flock and sent it astray on unknown paths ?
But the flock will come together again and will submit once more , and then it will be once for all .
Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by nature .
Oh , we shall persuade them at last not to be proud , for Thou didst lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud .
We shall show them that they are weak , that they are only pitiful children , but that childlike happiness is the sweetest of all .
They will become timid and will look to us and huddle close to us in fear , as chicks to the hen .
They will marvel at us and will be awe - stricken before us , and will be proud at our being so powerful and clever that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions .
They will tremble impotently before our wrath , their minds will grow fearful , they will be quick to shed tears like women and children , but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter and rejoicing , to happy mirth and childish song .
Yes , we shall set them to work , but in their leisure hours we shall make their life like a child 's game , with children 's songs and innocent dance .
Oh , we shall allow them even sin , they are weak and helpless , and they will love us like children because we allow them to sin .
We shall tell them that every sin will be expiated , if it is done with our permission , that we allow them to sin because we love them , and the punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves .
And we shall take it upon ourselves , and they will adore us as their saviours who have taken on themselves their sins before God .
And they will have no secrets from us .
We shall allow or forbid them to live with their wives and mistresses , to have or not to have children according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient - and they will submit to us gladly and cheerfully .
The most painful secrets of their conscience , all , all they will bring to us , and we shall have an answer for all .
And they will be glad to believe our answer , for it will save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at present in making a free decision for themselves .
And all will be happy , all the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them .
For only we , we who guard the mystery , shall be unhappy .
There will be thousands of millions of happy babes , and a hundred thousand sufferers who have taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil .
Peacefully they will die , peacefully they will expire in Thy name , and beyond the grave they will find nothing but death .
But we shall keep the secret , and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven and eternity .
Though if there were anything in the other world , it certainly would not be for such as they .
It is prophesied that Thou wilt come again in victory , Thou wilt come with Thy chosen , the proud and strong , but we will say that they have only saved themselves , but we have saved all .
We are told that the harlot who sits upon the beast , and holds in her hands the mystery , shall be put to shame , that the weak will rise up again , and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked her loathsome body .
But then I will stand up and point out to Thee the thousand millions of happy children who have known no sin .
And we who have taken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before
Thee and say : " Judge us if Thou canst and darest . "
Know that I fear Thee not .
Know that I too have been in the wilderness , I too have lived on roots and locusts , I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast blessed men , and I too was striving to stand among
Thy elect , among the strong and powerful , thirsting " to make up the number . "
But I awakened and would not serve madness .
I turned back and joined the ranks of those who have corrected Thy work .
I left the proud and went back to the humble , for the happiness of the humble .
What I say to Thee will come to pass , and our dominion will be built up .
I repeat , to - morrow
Thou shalt see that obedient flock who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile on which I shall burn
Thee for coming to hinder us .
For if anyone has ever deserved our fires , it is Thou .
To - morrow I shall burn Thee. Dixi . ' " *
* I have spoken .
Ivan stopped .
He was carried away as he talked , and spoke with excitement ; when he had finished , he suddenly smiled .
Alyosha had listened in silence ; towards the end he was greatly moved and seemed several times on the point of interrupting , but restrained himself .
Now his words came with a rush .
" But ... that 's absurd ! " he cried , flushing .
" Your poem is in praise of Jesus , not in blame of Him - as you meant it to be .
And who will believe you about freedom ?
Is that the way to understand it ?
That 's not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church ....
That 's Rome , and not even the whole of Rome , it 's false - those are the worst of the Catholics the Inquisitors , the Jesuits !...
And there could not be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor .
What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves ?
Who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind ?
When have they been seen ?
We know the Jesuits , they are spoken ill of , but surely they are not what you describe ?
They are not that at all , not at all ....
They are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future , with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that 's their ideal , but there 's no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it ....
It 's simple lust of power , of filthy earthly gain , of domination - something like a universal serfdom with them as masters - that 's all they stand for .
They do n't even believe in God perhaps .
Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy . "
" Stay , stay , " laughed Ivan .
" how hot you are !
A fantasy you say , let it be so !
Of course it 's a fantasy .
But allow me to say : do you really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power , of filthy earthly gain ?
Is that Father Paissy 's teaching ? "
" No , no , on the contrary , Father Paissy did once say something rather the same as you ... but of course it's not the same , not a bit the same , " Alyosha hastily corrected himself .
" A precious admission , in spite of your ' not a bit the same . '
I ask you why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile material gain ?
Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrow and loving humanity ?
You see , only suppose that there was one such man among all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain - if there 's only one like my old Inquisitor , who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and perfect .
But yet all his life he loved humanity , and suddenly his eyes were opened , and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain perfection and freedom , if at the same time one gains the conviction that millions of God 's creatures have been created as a mockery , that they will never be capable of using their freedom , that these poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the tower , that it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt his dream of harmony .
Seeing all that he turned back and joined - the clever people .
Surely that could have happened ? "
" Joined whom , what clever people ? " cried Alyosha , completely carried away .
" They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets ....
Perhaps nothing but Atheism , that 's all their secret .
Your Inquisitor does not believe in God , that 's his secret ! "
" What if it is so !
At last you have guessed it .
It 's perfectly true , it 's true that that 's the whole secret , but is n't that suffering , at least for a man like that , who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity ?
In his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble , unruly , ' incomplete , empirical creatures created in jest . '
And so , convinced of this , he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit , the dread spirit of death and destruction , and therefore accept lying and deception , and lead men consciously to death and destruction , and yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being led , that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy .
And note , the deception is in the name of Him in Whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long .
Is not that tragic ?
And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army ' filled with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain '- would not one such be enough to make a tragedy ?
More than that , one such standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with all its armies and Jesuits , its highest idea .
I tell you frankly that I firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement .
Who knows , there may have been some such even among the Roman Popes .
Who knows , perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way , is to be found even now in a whole multitude of such old men , existing not by chance but by agreement , as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the mystery , to guard it from the weak and the unhappy , so as to make them happy .
No doubt it is so , and so it must be indeed .
I fancy that even among the Masons there 's something of the same mystery at the bottom , and that that 's why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals breaking up the unity of the idea , while it is so essential that there should be one flock and one shepherd ....
But from the way I defend my idea I might be an author impatient of your criticism .
Enough of it . "
" You are perhaps a Mason yourself ! " broke suddenly from Alyosha .
" You do n't believe in God , " he added , speaking this time very sorrowfully .
He fancied besides that his brother was looking at him ironically .
" How does your poem end ? " he asked , suddenly looking down .
" Or was it the end ? "
" I meant to end it like this .
When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him .
His silence weighed down upon him .
He saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time , looking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply .
The old man longed for him to say something , however bitter and terrible .
But
He suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips .
That was all his answer .
The old man shuddered .
His lips moved .
He went to the door , opened it , and said to Him : ' Go , and come no more ... come not at all , never , never !'
And he let Him out into the dark alleys of the town .
The Prisoner went away . "
" And the old man ? "
" The kiss glows in his heart , but the old man adheres to his idea . "
" And you with him , you too ? " cried Alyosha , mournfully .
Ivan laughed .
" Why , it 's all nonsense , Alyosha .
It 's only a senseless poem of a senseless student , who could never write two lines of verse .
Why do you take it so seriously ?
Surely you do n't suppose I am going straight off to the Jesuits , to join the men who are correcting His work ?
Good Lord , it 's no business of mine .
I told you , all I want is to live on to thirty , and then ... dash the cup to the ground ! "
" But the little sticky leaves , and the precious tombs , and the blue sky , and the woman you love !
How will you live , how will you love them ? "
Alyosha cried sorrowfully .
" With such a hell in your heart and your head , how can you ?
No , that 's just what you are going away for , to join them ... if not , you will kill yourself , you can't endure it ! "
" There is a strength to endure everything , " Ivan said with a cold smile .
" The strength of the Karamazovs - the strength of the Karamazov baseness . "
" To sink into debauchery , to stifle your soul with corruption , yes ? "
" Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it , and then - "
" How will you escape it ?
By what will you escape it ?
That 's impossible with your ideas . "
" In the Karamazov way , again . "
" ' Everything is lawful , ' you mean ?
Everything is lawful , is that it ? "
Ivan scowled , and all at once turned strangely pale .
" Ah , you 've caught up yesterday 's phrase , which so offended Muisov - and which Dmitri pounced upon so naively and paraphrased ! " he smiled queerly .
" Yes , if you like , ' everything is lawful ' since the word has been said , I wo n't deny it .
And Mitya 's version is n't bad . "
Alyosha looked at him in silence .
" I thought that going away from here I have you at least , " Ivan said suddenly , with unexpected feeling ; " but now I see that there is no place for me even in your heart , my dear hermit .
The formula , ' all is lawful , ' I wo n't renounce - will you renounce me for that , yes ? "
Alyosha got up , went to him and softly kissed him on the lips .
" That 's plagiarism , " cried Ivan , highly delighted .
" You stole that from my poem .
Thank you though .
Get up , Alyosha , it 's time we were going , both of us . "
They went out , but stopped when they reached the entrance of the restaurant .
" Listen , Alyosha , " Ivan began in a resolute voice , " if I am really able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them , remembering you .
It 's enough for me that you are somewhere here , and I shan't lose my desire for life yet .
Is that enough for you ?
Take it as a declaration of love if you like .
And now you go to the right and I to the left .
And it 's enough , do you hear , enough .
I mean even if I do n't go away to - morrow ( I think I certainly shall go ) and we meet again , do n't say a word more on these subjects .
I beg that particularly .
And about Dmitri too , I ask you specially , never speak to me again , " he added , with sudden irritation ; " it 's all exhausted , it has all been said over and over again , has n't it ?
And I 'll make you one promise in return for it .
When at thirty , I want to ' dash the cup to the ground , ' wherever I may be I 'll come to have one more talk with you , even though it were from America , you may be sure of that .
I 'll come on purpose .
It will be very interesting to have a look at you , to see what you 'll be by that time .
It 's rather a solemn promise , you see .
And we really may be parting for seven years or ten .
Come , go now to your Pater Seraphicus , he is dying .
If he dies without you , you will be angry with me for having kept you .
Good - bye , kiss me once more ; that 's right , now go . "
Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back .
It was just as Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before , though the parting had been very different .
The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyosha 's mind in the distress and dejection of that moment .
He waited a little , looking after his brother .
He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left .
He had never noticed it before .
But all at once he turned too , and almost ran to the monastery .
It was nearly dark , and he felt almost frightened ; something new was growing up in him for which he could not account .
The wind had risen again as on the previous evening , and the ancient pines murmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse .
He almost ran .
" Pater Seraphicus - he got that name from somewhere - where from ? "
Alyosha wondered .
" Ivan , poor Ivan , and when shall I see you again ?...
Here is the hermitage .
Yes , yes , that he is , Pater Seraphicus , he will save me - from him and for ever ! "
Several times afterwards he wondered how he could , on leaving Ivan , so completely forget his brother Dmitri , though he had that morning , only a few hours before , so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doing so , even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night .

This morning ’s Washington Post reports that Democratic leaders are using porkbarrel projects as inducements in an effort to secure votes for bills supporting their policies in the Iraq War :
House Democratic leaders are offering billions in federal funds for lawmakers ’ pet projects large and small to secure enough votes this week to pass an Iraq funding bill that would end the war next year .
So far , the projects — which range from the reconstruction of New Orleans levees to the building of peanut storehouses in Georgia — have had little impact on the tally .
For a funding bill that establishes tough new readiness standards for deploying combat forces and sets an Aug. 31 , 2008 , deadline to bring the troops home , votes do not come cheap .
But at least a few Republicans and conservative Democrats who otherwise would vote “ no ” remain undecided , as they ponder whether they can leave on the table millions of dollars for constituents by opposing the $ 124 billion war funding bill due for a vote on Thursday .
“ She hates the games the Democrats are playing , ” said Guy Short , chief of staff to Rep. Marilyn Musgrave ( R - Colo . ) , a staunch conservative who remains undecided , thanks to billions of dollars in the bill for drought relief and agriculture assistance .
“ But Representative Musgrave was just down in southeastern Colorado , talking to ranchers and farmers , and they desperately need this assistance . ”
Democratic leaders say the domestic spending in the bill reflects the pent - up demand from lawmakers who last year could not win funding for programs that had bipartisan support such as disaster assistance .
As the 2008 Russian presidential election approaches , no one is more concerned about Russia 's future policy direction than those that stand to benefit from Russia 's energy largesse .
In particular , China and Japan are very anxious about the final routing of the East Siberia - Pacific Ocean oil pipeline ( VSTO - its Russian acronym ) , which is expected to be the world 's longest oil pipeline ( 2,500 miles ) , originating in East Siberia at Taishet and extending to a Pacific port at Kozmino Bay .
VSTO is Russia 's first pipeline to East Asia , ultimately unlocking the supposedly vast oil reserves in East Siberia , an area that has been likened to the final frontier of hydrocarbons exploration .
Whomever is elected ( ie , appointed ) president in 2008 will be the one who determines which country will benefit most from VSTO .
What makes VSTO so critical to the Chinese and Japanese is the changing energy and geopolitical landscape .
In 2003 , China surpassed Japan to become the world 's second - largest consumer of oil .
Chinese state oil companies ( CNPC , Sinopec , and CNOOC ) are pursuing a " going - out " strategy , where promises of Chinese investment in other sectors of a nation 's economy secure guaranteed supplies of hydrocarbons , such as China 's good - will investment in the Tehran subway system .
The Chinese are rightfully worried about their dependence on Middle Eastern oil sources and the routes by which that oil is transported .
China receives 51 % of its oil from the Middle East .
The vast majority of that oil is shipped through the Strait of Malacca , and therefore , is threatened by U.S. naval dominance .
Thus , the Chinese are seeking to diversify their energy supply base , not only by increasing production of coal and hydropower , but by developing oil and gas pipelines with neighboring Kazakhstan and Russia .
More than any other region of the world , energy is seen in East Asia as something of a zero- sum game : Japan increasingly views China 's positive gains in securing energy supplies as its own loss .
Even though the Chinese still do n't have a ministry - level agency to coordinate energy policy , Japan feels that it is a step behind .
Eighty seven percent of Japanese oil is imported from the Middle East - an extraordinary amount that also must pass through the Strait of Malacca .
Hence VSTO begins to take on hues of geopolitical significance .
While technically the routing of VSTO is not important from a market perspective ( any oil purchased at world prices from VSTO by either Japan or China will simply free up oil supplies elsewhere ) , in light of the strategic chokepoints through which oil traverses - chokepoints that are critical to both the Chinese and Japanese economies ( and subsequently , social stability in China ) - Russia 's ultimate decision is of paramount importance to both nations .
After years of Sino- Russian and Japanese - Russian memoranda of understanding , joint communiques , and declarations of intent , each ostensibly negating the one before , in 2005 the " final " route chosen by Moscow was the best ( or worst ) of both worlds .
VSTO was planned to extend from Taishet to Perevoznaya Bay , just south of Vladivostok , with a branch line running from the Russian border town of Skovorodino to Daqing ( Kozmino Bay would later be selected over Perevoznaya as the terminus ) .
The road to that decision was more than circuitous .
***
VSTO was originally vetted as an idea in the mid-1990s by the Yeltsin administration as a way to expand Sino - Russian economic ties .
However , things did n't really get off the ground until the Putin presidency .
In May 2003 , Chinese President Hu Jintao ( in Moscow ) signed a joint communiquŽ with Russian President Vladimir Putin endorsing a pipeline route from East Siberia to the Chinese oil - refining city of Daqing in Manchuria .
At the same time , Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky signed a 20 - year agreement with a " Chinese state - owned oil company " ( which later was reported to be CNPC ) to supply China via some form of eastern oil pipeline .
At the time , Yukos was viewed as the main proponent of a China - only route for any East Siberia oil pipeline .
Japan was conspicuously absent from any plans .
However , during the second half of 2003 , a pipeline feasibility study had still not been approved by the appropriate Russian agencies .
Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that the lack of a coherent framework for action by the Russian government was leading Russian oil companies - including Yukos - to act independently .
Increasingly , it appeared that there was a behind - the - scenes struggle occurring between Yukos and Transneft , the state - owned pipeline monopoly , over the final route .
Transneft , with everything to gain by constructing the longest route possible , was pushing for a pipeline to the Pacific , not China .
By October of that year , Mikhail Khodorkovsky had been arrested on charges of tax evasion and other unsanitary habits .
The Chinese were miffed ; their main man in Moscow was now behind bars and it appeared that the final route for VSTO was far from settled .
Furthermore , during the run-up to Khodorkovsky 's arrest , the governor of Primorye , Sergei Darkin , lobbied heavily for a Pacific route - one that would clearly terminate in his home region .
Darkin went to Tokyo to meet with the Japanese foreign minister , and he accused Yukos of deliberately underestimating East Siberia 's resources to promote the Daqing route .
In July 2003 , during a meeting between Putin and Darkin , the governor urged the president to help integrate Primorye into the East Asian economy .
Darkin implied that VSTO - and specifically the Pacific route - would be the perfect candidate for immediate economic integration with the region .
The momentum seemed to be turning in Japan 's favor .
In February 2004 , Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov told reporters that the government was considering multiple options - presumably not mutually exclusive - and would " give priority to its own interests when selecting which option to follow . "
On December 31 , 2004 - not two weeks after Yuganskneftegaz was sold in a rigged auction to Baikal Finans Group and later state - controlled Rosneft - Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov approved the Transneft - endorsed route from Taishet in Siberia to Nakhodka on the Pacific coast .
A branch to China was not included in the approved plan .
But , in typical Russian teeter - totter fashion , by April 2005 , the Kurile Island dispute between Russia and Japan had impeded forward progress on the pipeline plan .
This hang - up was indicative of the fact that Russia was using VSTO as a bargaining chip in the Kurile Island dispute .
It is important to note that a Pacific terminus would allow any country to import East Siberian crude - both China and Japan , and possibly America .
Pipeline length notwithstanding , it would seem to be in Russia 's interest to build to the Pacific in order to export to any number of markets rather than just one under the China plan .
However , Russia wanted to use that potential route as leverage over the Japanese in its territorial claims .
That same month , the Russian government announced that the two original plans - ( 1 ) Taishet - Daqing and ( 2 ) Taishet - Nakhodka - would be integrated , thereby giving Russia leverage over both nations during the construction process .
The first stage of VSTO would originate at Taishet and end at Skovorodino , a town that borders China ; a branch line to Daqing would be built .
The second stage would continue on from Skovorodino to Perevoznaya Bay , just south of Vladivostok .
The Japanese immediately threatened to terminate funding for VSTO because the pipeline would start pumping oil to China before terminating on the Pacific .
Oil would flow to Skovorodino by 2008 and Perevoznaya by 2012 .
VSTO was announced to have a capacity of 1.6 million b/d , although a debate rages as to whether East Siberia has enough accessible oil reserves to fill VSTO to capacity .
In July 2006 , Transneft declared that Kozmino Bay , closer to Nakhodka , would be the ultimate terminus for VSTO .
***
While VSTO has been the subject of much environmental controversy , especially with regards to the World Heritage Site of Lake Baikal , it is its geopolitical significance that motivates the most pressing questions .
Even more important , however , is what VSTO says about Russia 's future policy direction in the spheres of energy and foreign relations .
Immediately clear is the fact that Russia ( rightly ) considers its energy resources as a strategic asset rather than a purely economic one - and consequently leverages those resources for strategic gain .
But Russia also worries quite a bit about competition .
When Kazakhstan 's Atasu - Alashankou oil pipeline to China began pumping oil in May 2006 , the Russian government hit the accelerator on VSTO construction .
With Atasu - Alashankou pumping , Russian oil firm Lukoil announced its intention to ship oil via that pipeline in lieu of any Russian alternative .
A Russian alternative was clearly a strategic imperative for the Kremlin .
State - controlled Rosneft plans to double its investment in the East Siberian Vankor oil field to $ 1.5 billion in 2007 .
The company is also making noises about building an oil refinery in Nakhodka , near VSTO 's terminus ( a project Lukoil wants to get in on ) .
One of Yukos 's last units , Tomskneft , is slated to be sold off in a couple months ' time .
( Interestingly enough , Chevron is trying to reverse its bad luck in Russia by partnering with Gazpromneft , the oil - producing subsidiary of state - controlled Gazprom , to purchase Tomskneft ... Stupid or genius ?
I give it 80/20 . )
Tomskneft is actually not in East Siberia , but rather the far eastern part of West Siberia .
Here is where it gets interesting .
While Tomskneft does n't seem to be immediately important to the success of VSTO , many analysts are predicting that East Siberia will not have enough oil to fill the pipeline , and therefore , Russia will instead " borrow " from West Siberia - adding roughly 1,250 miles to the distance of transport .
According to Leon Aron of the American Enterprise Institute :
Even with all of the currently known major oilfields in eastern Siberia coming fully ' on stream ' by 2015 , production will be no more than 287 million barrels per year - or less than half of the planned amount .
Thus , what would cost between $ 6.40 and $ 9.80 per barrel in transportation costs from East Siberia , the oil being shipped from West Siberia would cost well over $ 12 per barrel just for transport .
It becomes immediately clear that the Russian government does n't view VSTO from a purely economic perspective , but rather from a political and strategic one .
What does that mean for Japan ?
By most indications , it increasingly appears that VSTO will not extend to the Pacific , but rather dive south via Skovorodino into China .
It would not be surprising if sometime in 2008 or soon thereafter the Russian government announces that production in East Siberia does not merit an extension of VSTO to the Pacific .
Yet , at the same time , the Russian government fears being tied into a single - buyer relationship with China a la Blue Stream in Turkey .
Granted , the natural gas market is fundamentally different from the oil market , but after getting burned by the Turks in 2003 , the Russians are afraid of China using its monopsonistic market power to force prices down for East Siberian crude .
Can Russia sustain its energy largesse in the Far East ?
It would be easy to claim that Russia is on a collision course with reality - that oil prices will fall from their historic peaks in due time , that state intervention in the Russian oil , natural gas , and pipeline sectors will eventually decimate oil production increases , thereby decimating rents , thereby causing the Russian government to wake up to the fact that less state control , not more , is what is needed to infuse new vitality into the industry .
But such claims are standard Western boilerplate and avoid the fundamental shifts occurring in the global oil market .
As the Chinese economy continues to grow at breakneck speeds , its people will continue to consume more and more oil .
Despite all the talk of biofuels and alternative energy sources , the United States is not going to transition into a post - petroleum economy in the near or medium term .
And as long as the Russian government enjoys the support of its populace as well as positive media coverage - both a near certainty - the Russian government can continue to funnel money into giant , state - sponsored industrial projects .
Moreover , we face a world where the oil majors are desperately in need of access to acreage .
Less and less oil is available to the ExxonMobils of the world to develop .
Thus , investors are increasingly pleased to invest in state - owned ( yet inefficient ) energy ventures like Gazprom and Rosneft .
Capital is not hard to come by .
Because of this , Russian state - controlled energy companies have little incentive to bring Western oil majors on board any major projects , thus decreasing the likelihood that these projects will be done well with the maximization of return to investment for shareholders .
With the full backing of the Russian state on specific pipeline projects like VSTO , Transneft does not need to worry about the economics of any project .
The subsidization of the industry - and associated diversion of resources from other , more efficient sectors - does not stir any outrage in the Russian media .
There is little reason to expect a change in the fundamental conditions that foster the corporate - energy state that Russia has become .
This is a road paved with $ 60 + oil and VSTO is just one of many manifestations of Russia 's state - sponsored largesse .
***
So .
Who wins ?
The Russian state for one .
It gets a new export market in China - and potentially other markets in East Asia .
No longer will Russian oil revenues be based solely on European demand .
Europe is certainly worried that Russian exports to China will either reduce Russian exports to Europe or allow Russia to threaten a cutoff like the one that occurred with Belarus this January .
The first worry is a red herring : the nature of the global , fungible oil market implies that less oil exports from Russia simply means more oil imports from other regions .
Furthermore , it is prohibitively expensive , even for the Russian government , to ship oil being produced west of the Urals to China .
The second concern is more reasonable .
A cutoff in Russian oil exports to Europe or a threatened cutoff would cause global oil prices to spike in the same way a shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz would .
Western governments must mitigate any diplomatic rows with Russia to avoid this contingency .
China wins in some sense .
Because VSTO is viewed in China as a strategic asset as well , its completion will allow Beijing to breathe a bit easier .
The Chinese fear of an energy cutoff actuated by the U.S. navy in the Strait of Malacca can not be overstated .
Diversifying their oil supplies is a significant boon .
Furthermore , the Chinese can hope that in any potential conflict with the United States over Taiwan , the U.S. will avoid bombing VSTO for fear that such an action would draw Russia into the conflict ( on China 's side ) .
However , the Chinese will never achieve full energy independence or even diversify energy supplies to the extent that an energy cutoff will be entirely impossible .
Thus , the onus is upon China , the United States , Russia , and other energy consumers and producers to forge a consensus enshrining the preeminence of the market as the key purveyor of energy security .
Everyone wins .
This is less talked about but possibly the most important element of VSTO .
This is not a strategic threat to the United States or Japan or the European Union .
VSTO is but one way of further liberalizing the energy trade by opening new corridors of exchange .
East Siberian crude would not be exported without a pipeline - even an expensive and ill - planned one like VSTO ( Deutsche UFG recently estimated a total price tag of $ 20 billion ) .
Thus , the introduction of new sources of supply on world markets will only help in a time of demand outstripping supply .
Indeed , even if VSTO dumps its oil into China , that will theoretically free up oil supplies elsewhere to be consumed by other nations , thereby dampening world prices .
***
Given the strategic and economic nature to VSTO , Russia 's vast undertaking represents the best and worst possible worlds .
Like Churchill 's famous utterance , it is a " puzzle wrapped inside of an enigma , " jointly meeting the sovereign needs of multiple nations , but doing it in a way that is overly costly and overly politicized .
Even though construction has already commenced , the conclusive route of VSTO is never a certainly - not until the pipeline is buried and oil is flowing .
The Japanese and Chinese will be eagerly watching what the Russians ultimately decide to do .

Below the Fold : Learning about Our Rights , or Lack of Them , on TV
CSI , Law and Order , 24 , Cold Case Files , Without a Trace , Criminal Minds , The Shield , Crossing Jordan , The Wire .
I learn a lot about life .
For instance , there is evil , sometimes petty , sometimes monstrous , but always deadly .
There is good : the police , the prosecutors , and their beleaguered , but heroic witnesses .
Of course , there are the squealers , the snitches , the sleazeballs , or simply the entrapped that help get some portion of evil greater than their own off the street .
Defense attorneys have pride of place in the evil paragon .
They are sort of the Beelzebubs of the evil operations , scheming , unscrupulous , tricksters that made it so difficult for the do - gooders to defeat evil .
Sebastian Shark of CBS ’ Shark , for example , is the most dangerous trickster of all , for he now applies his incomparable skills with the tools of evil to serve the good .
He now puts evildoers , sometimes even his ex-clients , in jail .
Once evil , he has morphed into someone good .
The moral of his story is that the good must learn , or stronger still , must be a little evil to get evil off the streets .
Justice is a result , not a process , for Shark .
His young and beautiful lawyer posse is often revolted by his tactics , but the lesson they are taught by Shark is that evil must be used to ensure that good will triumph .
I prefer Orson Wells in Touch of Evil .
Now there was evil incarnate , three hundred ugly pounds of it .
Chomping a wet cigar , unshaven , clearly getting the better of his opponent , the goody - goody cop Charlton Heston whom he transforms into someone evil .
Only Marlene Dietrich , the borderlands madam , took pity on Welles ’ Hank Quinlan .
Dietrich as Tanya was not exactly the hooker with a heart of gold .
Instead she was the weary , cynical stable keeper for men like Wells whose peccadillos were her bread and butter .
As Wells framed hundreds of suspects throughout his career , he had also hooked up with a sneaky , violent , dark - faced , Spanglish - speaking criminal Mexican gang , that he uses to break the mestizo and obviously uppity Heston , the proud husband of the blond - haired Janet Leigh whom the Mexicans kidnap and torture for good measure .
Except for Leigh ’s Susie , the damsel in distress , everyone else gets more evil , and some of the worst of them kill , die , or in Heston ’s case sober up to the need to do evil in order to do good .
Well , that is the big lie – to do evil in order to do good – that TV tells us is the moral of our version of Crime and Punishment .
The good must do evil so that the bad are caught , murdered , jailed , and / or sometimes executed .
What do we learn about our civil rights , good or evil as we are ?
What does TV tell us about the practice of criminal justice in the United States ?
More accurately , what does TV portray as everyday practice in our daily battle against crime ?
The first lesson is that everyone is a suspect and their rights an impediment to uncovering evil .
Your are supposed guilty until you prove yourself innocent , and every attempt you make to clear yourself or help the police out will be turned against you .
You can be " liked " for a crime , not a compliment on your character or good looks , and become a suspect without knowing it .
If and until you are arrested , they do not need to tell you that their " liking " you makes you a suspect in their book , until they find someone better .
So the second lesson is that it is better to remain silent .
Cooperation is a mistake .
Request a lawyer .
If you have no lawyer ( woe betide you if you are poor or like most people in America consider lawyers potential road kill ) , then ask to go home .
Whatever you do , seek to avoid staying at the station house because that is where the tricks often occur .
At home , answer the door cautiously , as guns may be drawn , and never , never invite police into your house .
If you do , you have invited them to grab up whatever they need for their case against you .
Suppose you are transformed from witness , to person of interest , to suspect .
You are arrested .
Take the warning seriously and say nothing once more .
Ask immediately for a lawyer .
Do n’t cop an attitude , or they will clock you .
A whack on the head or anywhere else on your body , so long as it leaves no bruises , is practically the duty of a morally outraged cop .
It seems that the good cop is never quick enough to restrain the bad cop .
Ask for aspirin as soon as you can , as you will bruise more easily , and perhaps shorten the beat down .
The good cop , bad cop routine is still the order of the day , and amazing grace at least on TV , seems to work .
The good cop is constantly asking you to help them out , or suggesting you help yourself by getting the evil off your chest .
It will go easier if you confess now or if you give up your partner in crime .
Beware the prisoner ’s dilemma : it works too .
I personally can’t understand how cooperating and confessing makes things easier .
The image of the prison with which they threaten the accused is an inferno .
Sweet young things , male or female , are threatened with gang rape or being sold as sex slaves for a pack of cigarettes .
HIV infection lurks in every sex act .
The middle - aged are told they will die miserably in jail .
Most criminal indictments end in plea bargains – 85 % of them .
You may be surrendering your right to self - defense , but your odds do n’t improve through jury trials , which for murder suspects ends 85 % of the time in conviction .
( If you are African - American , please note that you are three and a half times more likely to be convicted of murder through trial by jury than your white counterparts . )
But Law and Order ’s " Maximum Sam " Waterson ’s .750 batting average does represent reality : crime usually leads to punishment .
Much of the success , for better or worse , owes to being incriminated before you are arrested , and according to TV , way before you even know you ’re " liked " for the crime .
But who knows about innocence ?
Northwestern University ’s Center for Wrongful Convictions found in 2001 that of 86 persons wrongfully convicted and exonerated , 53 % were convicted on the basis of mistaken or perjured eyewitness testimony ; 20 % were convicted regardless of police and prosecutorial misconduct ; another 12 % were convicted with jailhouse informant testimony ; another 9 % on the basis of coerced or false confessions ; and finally ( take that CSI ! ) , another 11 % were convicted with what the center calls false or misleading " junk " science .
Illinois in 2003 found so many wrongful murder convictions in their midst that the 17 defendants on death row were exonerated , and then Governor Ryan commuted the death sentences of 160 others .
The wrongful conviction movement has spread throughout the country and the convicted in many cases exonerated , but this is seldom seen on TV .
Instead , alla Cold Case Files , the past offers up its old murderers for the convicting .
This brings us back to what we learn on TV .
It is not the truth of the matter , but a rather well - set and coherent collection of ideas about crime and punishment in America .
It is rather like the old westerns with good and evil starkly portrayed , and the Indians vested with few , if any rights .
This is no Dirty Harry syndrome any more , as in cops hampered by court decisions , and the guilty escaping because of our fecklessness in the face of evil .
No , the cops usually catch the culprit under circumstances of their choosing , rather than those once prescribed by the Constitution .
If they get it wrong , there is little recourse .
Old Gil Grissom , in the recollection of this CSI - addicted writer , has only once worked to exonerate someone whom his office has wrongly convicted .
Outside of the tube and bumping around the everyday world , people are wrongly convicted through abuse , sloppiness , or the rush to judgment .
If you are a person of color , watch out especially .
All of you whose income falls beneath that of the well - heeled wo n’t get a snide , slick , and successful defense lawyer .
There is no Shark in your future .
Instead , you may get an over - worked and under - paid public defender , or a lawyer whom you cannot pay enough to do a really thorough job , given the endless complications of justice in America .
Public advocates can only save the few and the really endangered .
An occasional jury will jump the rails and find for a defendant believed to have been treated badly or wrongly , or who they believe to be innocent .
In Boston last year , several juries in a row refused to believe police testimony and found defendants not guilty .
But if the TV is about our beliefs , then it seems that we believe that evil is back big time , and evil criminals are caught and punished , even if by hook or crook , and this is really okay .
And most of us , me included when I leave my rational world and head into the realms of American authoritarian fantasies , really enjoy it .
... Did I forget your favorite crime show ?
I confess .
Sometimes during a Thursday night seminar , my mind wanders to the question :
Will I get home in time for CSI , the real one in Nevada with Gil Grissom and the rest of the gang ?
Sometimes , I have to content myself with a killing in Miami or New York .

CHICAGO -- The strange faces drawn on the first pottery made in the South Pacific more than 3,000 years ago have always been a mystery to scientists .
Now their riddle may have been solved by new research done by two Field Museum scientists to be published in the February 2007 issue of the Cambridge Archaeological Journal .
What archaeologists working in the Pacific call prehistoric " Lapita " pottery has been found at more than 180 different places on tropical islands located in a broad arc of the southwestern Pacific from Papua New Guinea to Samoa .
Experts have long viewed the faces sometimes sketched by ancient potters on this pottery ware as almost certainly human in appearance , and they have considered them to be a sign that Pacific Islanders long ago may have worshiped their ancestors .
John Terrell , Regenstein Curator of Pacific Anthropology at The Field Museum , and Esther M. Schechter , a Research Associate in the Department of Anthropology at The Field Museum , have pieced together evidence of several kinds leading to a radically different understanding of the religious life of people in the South Pacific 3,000 years ago .
Most of these mysterious faces , they report , may represent sea turtles .
Furthermore , these ceramic portraits may be showing us ideas held by early Pacific Islanders about the origins of humankind .
Terrell and Schechter say the evidence they have assembled also shows that these religious ideas did not die when people in the Pacific stopped making Lapita pottery about 2,500 years ago .
They have not only identified this expressive symbolism on prehistoric pottery excavated several years ago by Terrell and other archaeologists at Aitape on the Sepik Coast of northern New Guinea , but they have also found this type of iconography on wooden bowls and platters collected at present - day villages on this coast that are now safeguarded in The Field Museum 's rich anthropological collections .
Terrell and Schechter 's discovery suggests that a folktale recorded by others on this coast in the early 1970s - - a story about a great sea turtle ( the mother of all sea turtles ) and the origins long ago of the first island , the first man , and the first woman on earth -- might be thousands of years old .
This legend may once have been as spiritually important to Pacific Islanders as the Biblical story of Adam and Eve has been in the Judeo - Christian tradition .
" Nothing we had been doing in New Guinea for years had prepared us for this discovery , " Terrell explained .
" We have now been able to describe for the first time four kinds of prehistoric pottery from the Sepik coast that when considered in series fill the temporal gap between practices and beliefs in Lapita times and the present day .
" A plausible reason for the persistence of this iconography is that it has referenced ideas about the living and the dead , the human and the divine , and the individual and society that remained socially and spiritually profound and worthy of expression long after the demise of Lapita as a distinct ceramic style , " Terrell added .
More research needed
Terrell and Schechter acknowledge that more work must be done to pin down their unexpected discovery .
Nevertheless , it now looks like they have not only deciphered the ancient " Lapita code " inscribed on pottery vessels in the south Pacific thousands of yeas ago , but by so doing , may have rescued one of the oldest religious beliefs of Pacific Islanders from the brink of oblivion .
" I was skeptical for a long time about connecting these designs with sea turtles , " Schechter said , " but then the conservation biologist Regina Woodrom Luna in Hawaii pointed out that some of the designs match the distinctive beach tracks that a Green sea turtle makes when she is coming ashore to lay her eggs .
" Everything made even more sense when we came across the creation story about a great sea turtle and the first man and woman on earth , " she added .
" This story comes from a village only 75 miles away from where The Field Museum is working on the same coast of Papua New Guinea . "

Mysterious Lapita face
The " Lapita face " has befuddled scientists for centuries .
Here you can see these strange faces as they were drawn thousands of years ago on a ( partially reconstructed ) pottery vessel found by archaeologists on the Foué Peninsula of New Caledonia .
A new study to be published in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal concludes that faces such as these are those of sea turtles , not human beings .

THE MODERN FACE OF TERRORISM ….
Federal authorities have arrested six men who were plotting to kill American soldiers at Ft. Dix in New Jersey .
From the Washington Post :
Charging document filed in federal court in Camden yesterday portray an ambitious and cold - blooded — but somewhat bungling — cadre who hoped to kill at least 100 soldiers , but also dropped training videos off at a local store to be copied , and spoke openly to a Philadelphia police sergeant about obtaining maps of Fort Dix . ….
In March of 2006 , an FBI informant established a relationship with one of the men believed to be in the videotape … .
The informants convinced members of the group that they could help them obtain automatic weapons to use in their attacks .
…. Their training regimen included playing paintball , the docments say .
Let me get this striaght : these guys dropped off jihadi videos at a local store , talked to Philly cops about getting a map of Ft. Dix , were still trying to procure weapons after 17 months of planning , and practiced for the attack by playing paintball .
This reminds me of that guy who planned to bring down the Brooklyn Bridge with a blowtorch .
Or those dudes who wanted to destroy the Sears Tower but could n’t even afford to buy boots and rental cars , let alone explosives .
Or Jose Padilla , who , it turns out , was a deluded schmoe who did n’t really have serious plans to do much of anything .
Is al - Qaeda recruiting these doofuses just to lull us into a false sense of security ?
Or maybe they ’re Jon Stewart fans and want to provide him with fresh material ?
WTF ?
I 'm sorry to announce that even when the likes of George W. Bush , Dick Cheney and all the other Republican Chickenhawks are mercifully out of our lives , a whole new breed of big - talk - no - action types are waiting in the wings to proudly proclaim " I love war -- but for God 's sake do n’t askto go ! "
Max Blumenthal went directly into the chicken coop and found a whole bunch of them at the College Republican National Convention .
And you 'll be shocked to hear this but , while they all support Bush 's failed policy in Iraq , none of them plan on enlisting themselves .
Max 's best line in a great film : " For some reason , the college Republicans I met , had a curiously high level of health problems .
" Enjoy .
Ten times last year , Judi Kinch , a geologist , got e-mail messages telling her that the next afternoon any electricity used at her Chicago apartment would be particularly expensive because hot , steamy weather was increasing demand for power .
Each time , she and her husband would turn down the air - conditioners — sometimes shutting one of them off — and let the dinner dishes sit in the washer until prices fell back late at night .
Most people are not aware that electricity prices fluctuate widely throughout the day , let alone exactly how much they pay at the moment they flip a switch .
But Ms. Kinch and her husband are among the 1,100 Chicago residents who belong to the Community Energy Cooperative , a pilot project to encourage energy conservation , and this puts them among the rare few who are able to save money by shifting their use of power .
Just as cellphone customers delay personal calls until they become free at night and on weekends , and just as millions of people fly at less popular times because air fares are lower , people who know the price of electricity at any given moment can cut back when prices are high and use more when prices are low .
Participants in the Community Energy Cooperative program , for example , can check a Web site that tells them , hour by hour , how much their electricity costs ; they get e-mail alerts when the price is set to rise above 20 cents a kilowatt - hour .
A data center on wheels
Introduction
Which way to go ?
Sun has always been somewhat of a mysterious company , from its humble origins at Stanford University through the dotcom boom and out the other side .
Its numerous changes of strategic direction have confounded attempts to pin the company down .
One thing almost everyone agrees on , however , is that Sun still makes very powerful server hardware .
So when I was offered the opportunity to get a guided tour of Sun 's new " Project Blackbox , " I jumped at the chance .
Project Blackbox is the code name for Sun 's new mobile datacenter .
The computing facility fits in a standard 20 foot shipping container , and the entire container plus surrounding infrastructure is hooked up to a semi trailer , decked out nicely in black for the occasion .
The Project stopped off in Seattle , Washington for a visit on Monday , and I got a guided tour of the interior .
Finding the demonstration was not as simple as it could have been .
The event was held at the University of Washington , but Sun 's website did not specify an exact address .
Fortunately , once I found the correct parking lot , it was easy enough to spot the trailer .
Ah .. there it is
The Big Black Box
Trevor McGill opening the vault
When I arrived , there was only one other person waiting for a guided tour , although Trevor McGill , our guide from Sun , assured us that there had been much larger crowds earlier that day .
The trailer is very nicely outfitted , with solid doors at the back that could keep out even the most determined intruders .
At the rear entrance the power grid is visible ( there are two giant switches that control the show ) as well as the air filtration system and a grid of fans .
Blackbox requires a 200 KW generator and a 60 - ton chiller ( the water needs to be no more than 55 degrees Fahrenheit , so in some environments a nearby river may suffice ! ) .
The fans ( and one of the switches ) were powered down , as the actual datacenter part of the datacenter was sadly not operational for the demonstration .
Inside the main compartment are eight racks , each of which slides out on a dolly for maintenance and inspection .
One of the racks is occupied with various monitoring equipment , including a dehumidifier , sensors , and network switches .
This leaves seven six - foot tall racks available to be populated with servers from the 1U to 4U variety .
For 1U servers , this works out to a total of 294 servers , all ready to be driven to anywhere that massive computational power is needed .
The demo system was loaded with Sun Blade 8000s , Netra 2000s , and various SunFires and network storage devices .
The total weight of the box was 20,000 pounds when fully populated .
The box is sealed in a climate - controlled environment , with everything from racks of fans to a series of cooling pipes keeping everything appropriately chilled .
Although the system was being shown ensconced in marketing - friendly black coverings , the actual units will be sold with a white paint job , to minimize the warming effect ironically caused by the sun 's rays .
Outside of the box are three large sockets : one for power , one for the chilled water , and a third for network access .
McGill said that the network bandwidth could be " whatever you want , " as many different options were available including Fiber Channel .
A CP Labs Experiment
Shift Option Rinse
Michele read a couple weblog entries and heard an NPR story about how you might be able to clean your computer keyboard in the dishwasher .
So she organized a bit of an experiment .
Just like with socks in the laundry , somehow a couple of our matching keys disappeared in the process .
Luckily they were F10 and F11 .
We never use those anyhow .

I ’ve often written scripts only to discover once added to crontab that it relies on an environment setting such as having the java command in the PATH or having CVSROOT set .
To avoid this I now run scripts I ’m developing for cron with
env -i
to simulate the script running without an environment as follows :
env -i somescript.sh
This has greatly increased my success rate of adding a script to cron and having it work from the get go .
The Tech Crunch folks published a nice review of Amazon S3 grid storage .
But they totaly missed what ’s so cool about it .
If you read beyond the standard features about price and storage you will find out why it ’s really the killer app .
Take a look at the developer documentation and have a look at the last section entitled “ Using BitTorrent with S3 “ .
That ’s right Amazon S3 supports BitTorrent , it will create and seed your object ( file ) .
Here is the snippet from the docs ,
There is no extra charge for use of BitTorrent with S3 .
Data transfer via the BitTorrent protocol is metered at the same rate as client / server delivery .
To be precise , whenever a downloading BitTorrent client requests a “ piece ” of an object from the S3 “ seeder , ” charges accrue just as if an anonymous request for that piece had been made using the REST or SOAP protocol .
These charges will appear on your S3 bill and usage reports in the same way .
The difference is that if a lot of clients are requesting the same object simultaneously via BitTorrent , then the amount of data S3 must serve to satisfy those clients will be lower than with client / server delivery .
This is because the BitTorrent clients are simultaneously uploading and downloading amongst themselves .
The data transfer savings achieved from use of BitTorrent can vary widely depending on how popular your object is .
Less popular objects require heavier use of the “ seeder ” to serve clients , and thus the difference between BitTorrent distribution costs and client / server distribution costs may be small for such objects .
In particular , if only one client is ever downloading a particular object at a time , the cost of BitTorrent delivery will be the same as direct download .
Wow !
And to create that torrent ?
No problem ,
Retrieving a . torrent file for any publicly available object is easy .
Simply add a “ ? torrent ” query string parameter at the end of the REST GET request for the object .
No authentication is required .
Once you have a BitTorrent client installed , downloading an object using BitTorrent download may be as easy as opening this URL in your web browser .
Jerome Groopman and Atul Gawande , two Harvard University ­researchers , clinicians , and best - selling authors , are for my money the best medical writers around .
The New Yorker ’s one - two punch for a decade now , the two have set a new standard with their precise prose , command of facts , and investigative brilliance .
On topics ranging from the proper care of terminal cancer patients to how the best cystic fibrosis doctors push their patients ’ life spans far beyond the mean , they have certainly educated this colleague .
Now , from different angles , they each go after the same crucial question :
Why is n’t medical care better ?
And each , in turn , misses the mark .
Medical errors made headlines in 1999 when an Institute of Medicine report revealed that these mistakes cause 98,000 deaths a year .
Since then , a bevy of cognitive - science studies have demonstrated how doctors jump to conclusions , overrely on quick pattern recognition , let prejudices sway them , and of course , do n’t listen enough .
In his new book , How Doctors Think ( Houghton Mifflin , $ 26 ) , Groopman goes at the problem from the inside out , examining “ what goes on in a doctor ’s mind as he or she treats a patient . ”
His concern stems from recent studies confirming that “ the majority of errors are due to flaws in physician thinking , not technical mistakes . ”
By acquainting laymen with the most common mental errors , he aims to give patients and their families the tools to help their doctors think and thereby prevent misdiagnoses .
Groopman sifts through representative cases for the mental blinkers , blind spots , and prejudices that lead to error .
There ’s the saga of a woman repeatedly misdiagnosed over 15 years with irritable bowel syndrome and psychiatric problems until a gastroenterologist detects celiac sprue — an immune assault triggered by gluten in her diet .
Next is the adopted Vietnamese baby girl with severe infections :
She almost gets a bone marrow transplant until her Web - scouring adoptive mother persuades doctors to repeat her immune - function tests , which all turn out to be normal .
In Better ( Metropolitan Books , $ 24 ) , Gawande , for his part , gives us case studies of high - performing medical innovators — from military surgeons in Iraq who have devised ways to improve the survival of the severely injured to the designers of hand - washing campaigns to reduce hospital - borne infections in the United States — and roots through the methods of these “ positive deviants ” to reveal how they do things , well , better than the rest of us .
The elements of their success , he tells us , boil down to key personal strengths : diligence , moral integrity , willingness to acknowledge failure , and ingenuity in seeking solutions .
This includes carefully tracking the details of their own performance , since only by measuring outcomes can they later analyze which approaches work and which do not .
A subtle provincialism pervades both of these heartfelt , well - ­reasoned accounts .
Both authors describe the tribulations of American medicine as if they were universal .
Worse , by concentrating on individual minds or hospitals and ignoring larger - scale malfunctions , they unwittingly illustrate exactly what ’s wrong with how American doctors think .
Like most in our profession , Groopman and Gawande fail to adequately acknowledge — much less take on — the larger institutional forces that landed us in our current health care mess .
Consider :
We spend 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country , for a total of $ 2 trillion a year , yet our health system , according to the World Health Organization , ranks 37th worldwide ( France is number one ) .
By any measure — longevity , infant mortality , burden of disease — we sit in the basement of the industrialized world .
Yet we American doctors still fancy ourselves the best - trained ­anywhere , our care second to none .
Why the disconnect ?
And why , if physicians ’ cognitive pitfalls are so predictable and the benefit of measuring outcomes so compelling , ca n’t our vaunted medical schools ( including Harvard ) simply teach success ?
" Being a part of the Arthur Ventures portfolio family provides access to a great group of companies sharing a similar passion about solid execution , value creation , and growth , something we were able to tap into to accelerate our own momentum . "

Ken Norton , Product Manager , Google Docs & Spreadsheets , proudly said today .
The battle between Google and Microsoft is taken to another level as the two giants are challenging one another with new innovations and goodies for its products .
This new competition of the Office suites is very important especially for the consumers because until now , there was no other alternative for the famous Microsoft Office .
Some of you might say that Google 's Office pack of tools can't be described as a potential Microsoft rival due to several reasons .
But Google 's solutions has a lot of advantages .
Google Apps is available in several versions including a free one that allows the consumers to use the product and benefit from the basic functions .
In comparison , Microsoft Office is quite an expensive product that is available only after you paid a certain amount of money .
However , the competition is only at its beginning and we should wait and see if any of the two rivals manages to become the leader of the market .

“ AZIZ , LIGHT ! ”
Out of all the great lines in this film , the one most frequently used within my circle of friends is undoubtedly , “ AZIZ , LIGHT ! ”
In addition to setting up a great joke near the end of the scene , the repetition of the archaeologist berating his child servant does a pretty good job of quickly and efficiently developing the characters of the French archaeologist , and his American student ( played , for no discernible reason , by Luke Perry ) who keeps a running tally of how many times the professor yells the phrase .
This line has been used many times by my friends and I , often when someone has forgotten to turn on their headlights whilst driving at night , or when someone is entering a darkened room but has not yet flipped the lightswitch .
If there are two lines that should stick with the viewer after watching The Fifth Element , they should be “ AZIZ , LIGHT ” and “ I am a meat popsicle . ”
That said , you ’ll ( hopefully ) have much more use for the former line than the latter .
The Futuristic Setting
Though the vast majority of the characters in The Fifth Element have American accents , the film was actually a French - British joint production , and roughly 90 % of the actors belong to one of those countries .
As a result of the fact that the director , costume designer , and production manager were all French , the film took on a very wacky , very ... well , French tone and visual style .
Everyone is wearing odd clothes ( designed by fashion guru Jean - Paul Gaultier ) , the aliens look oddly bombastic , and the entire universe seems to follow the creed of form over function .
This is not a bad thing .
If you want a realistic sci - fi world , you watch Blade Runner : if you want a trippy sci- fi fantasy universe , you watch The Fifth Element .
However , even for all its over - the - top qualities , the world still has some nice technological touches , like the “ four a day ” cigarette dispenser , designed to wean users off smoking ( made additionally funny due to the fact that the cigarettes seem to be inverted – the filter takes up 90 percent of each stick ) , the auto - wash in Korben ’s shower , and dozens of other futuristic inventions too complicated to name or explain .
Korben Dallas
In essence , there really is n’t anything special about Bruce Willis in The Fifth Element .
He ’s a badass , yeah , but he ’s a badass in the exact same way that every other Bruce Willis character is badass – wry catchphrases , cocky attitudes , manly grunts .
Etcetera .
Yet it ’s this stereotypical personality that makes Korben Dallas , a futuristic ex-marine - cum - cab - driver , such an interesting character to watch : considering the world around him feels so odd and alien and French , the presence of a clichéd action hero provides a great entry point for the audience , making the rest of the film seem more accessible .
All things considered , Korben Dallas is pretty much just John McClaine is space – at any moment , it seems like Korben is but an inch away from smiling to himself , shaking his head , and whimsically exclaiming , “ California … ” *
Also , “ Korben Dallas ” may be the single weirdest fucking name ever conceived .
Even weirder than “ Castor Troy , ” and that ’s saying something .
Gimme da cashhhhhhhh
The scene where Korben is almost mugged by a hyperactive crook wearing a hat with a photo of Korben ’s hallway on it ( in order to fool Korben ’s peephole camera ) is genius .
Period .
Firstly , the mugger is holding the most absurd looking gun ever conceived : there are two different clips , spikes coming out of the barrel , a sight almost as big as the gun itself , and a little yellow button on the side that serves no purpose other than to render the gun useless .
Secondly , after the mugger has the gun confiscated from him , he – again , for no reason – starts dancing nervously .
Thirdly , this weird , crazy , ridiculously - dressed mugger is actually played by Mathieu Kassovitz , an established French writer and director ( if you ’ve seen Amelie , he played the object of Audrey Tautou ’s affection ) .
When the guy who played quiet , introspective Nino Quincampoix starts shrieking “ GIMME DA CASHHHHHHHHH , ” it ’s an odd , yet kickass moment .
Tiny Lister as the President of the Galaxy
This may be one of the only unintentionally funny things in the entire film , but Tommy “ Tiny ” Lister ’s casting as the President of the Federated Territories or Whatever makes for some frequent , albeit unforeseen , comedy .
When wringing his hands over General Staedert ’s decision to fire at the evil fireball , he looks less like a nervous president and more like he ’s trying to decide whether to eat two babies for dinner , or just the usual one .
When he tells Staedert “ Get out of there – I do n’t want an incident , ” he puts awkward pauses between the first half of the sentence and removes roughly 2/3 of the consonants from the second half , resulting in a sentence that sounds like , “ Get - out - of - there !
I don ’ wan ’ a issiden ! ”
Ruby Rhod
Chris Tucker should have ended his acting career after The Fifth Element .
And not because his other movies suck ( though they do ) , and not because he would prove himself to be an insufferable douchebag ( which he has ) , but rather due to the fact that Ruby Rhod , an intergalactic superstar radio host , was literally the role of Chris Tucker ’s career .
While Tucker ’s loud voice , bugged - out eyes , and ostentatious personality are usually a liability in most of his other film roles , they are a perfect match for the spastic , over - the - top character of Ruby Rhod .
From the first time we meet Ruby as he slides across a floor , dancing , shouting , and giving a huge group of Japanese girls his “ autograph ” ( “ autograph , ” in this context , meaning that he dips a paintbrush into a can and runs it over all of the girls ’ photos of him while walking past them ) , to his awkward handling of an action scene ( “ Korben ?
Korben ?
Korben , my man ?
One of em comin— aw , shit ¸three comin , Korben ” ) , to his whining bitchiness near the end of the film when a medic pulls a splinter from his hand ( “ OW , ” he yells , slapping the medic on the head .
“ WHAT ’S WRONG WITH YOU ! HURT ! ” ) , Ruby Rhod is an incredible character , and represents the absolute only time Chris Tucker ’s insanity is used to a positive effect .
Special Effects
It ’s no exaggeration to say that , at the time , The Fifth Element may have boasted the best special effects ever seen .
Mixing practical set design , green screen , and CG animation ( but only when necessary ) , the New York City of the 21st century was truly a sight to behold .
The CG was so good , in fact , and the world seemed so fully realized , that I frequently hear the laments of countless gamers who wish that the Grand Theft Auto series might eventually make a game set in a similar universe to that of The Fifth Element , replete with flying cars and a polluted underworld .
I tend to agree with them .
We ’ll probably never see another film like The Fifth Element again , effects - wise : so many of the awesome setpieces are largely practical ( when Bruce Willis ’s stuntman narrowly escapes a large explosion in the ballroom fight , that ’s a real explosion ) , thus making them much more realistic and relatable .
Mr. Kim
I hate to be a racist and say that the majority of Mr. Kim ’s hilarity comes from his absurd pronunciation of regular English , but I ’m going to say it anyway .
Plus , I ’m part Asian , so it ’s cool .
Anyway , Mr. Kim serves as the yin to Korben ’s yang for one very short scene .
As Kim serves Korben lunch ( on his flying Chinese boatcar , no less ) , Korben receives a message , which he immediately assumes is bad news .
Kim , ever the optimist , tells Korben , “ Grandfather say , it never rain every day .
Is good news , guaranteed .
I bet you lunch . ”
Kim grabs the letter , opens it , and unknowingly exclaims : “ You are FIYAHD ! ”
Robot Bartender
Shortly before Korben and Leeloo board the shuttle to Fhloston Paradise , we see Father Vito Cornelius drowning his sorrows in alcohol .
He complains endlessly to the bartender about how Leeloo is supposed to be strong , but she ’s also fragile , and some other shit , and ends it all with , “ … do you know what I mean ? ”
Then the camera show us the reverse shot , and reveals that Vito has been talking to a robotic bartender the entire time .
The robot shakes his head quickly , and responds in the only way he knows how : by offering another spritz of alcohol and blankly asking , “ You - want - some - more ? ”
This is funny enough on its own , but during the next dialogue scene at the bar where Vito and David argue about who will pursue Korben , the waiter can again be heard asking , “ You - want - some - more ? ” , in the exact same tone of voice .
It ’s funnier when you actually see it , trust me .
Gary Oldman
There are two things that one can a director can add to absolutely any movie to make it at least three times better : zombies , and Gary Oldman .
Given that The Fifth Element is sci- fi enough without the addition of the walking dead , Luc Besson opted for the latter .
While not quite as hilariously evil as Agent Stansfield in Leon / The Professional , Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg is the rare villain who balances a hilarious lack of menace ( as the writers seem to know that the evil asteroid , and not Zorg , is supposed to be what frightens the audience , Zorg is responsible for almost as many laughs as Ruby Rhod ) with an unusual amount of cool .
Zorg gets screwed over at nearly every turn in the film : he fails to get the stones in the first scene , he almost chokes to death on a cherry , again fails to get the stones in the middle of the film , fails to get the stones at the end of the film , almost saves himself at the very end , but then dies .
And yet , thanks to Oldman ’s performance , he ’s a pleasure to watch : the screenshot above is taken from the moment near the end of the film where Zorg finds out that the case he just worked so hard to get does n’t have any of the four stones in it .
Oldman , in his inimitable fashion , plays the scene brilliantly : he checks the box , smiles and laughs ( seemingly because the stones are there ) , checks again , laughs harder , but the laughs quickly turn to tears as he laments , “ They ’re not here . ”
Since Zorg and Korben never really meet one another ( more on that later ) , and since Zorg almost consistently gets his ass handed to him , he becomes oddly fun : he ’s not sympathetic , by any means , but he ’s very entertaining to watch thanks to Gary Oldman ’s absurd accent ( “ Laihf , which yew so nobly surve , comes from deshtruction , dishorder , and chaosh ” ) and mannerisms .
“ Negative , I am a meat popsicle ”
I know that “ meat popsicle ” has since become a euphemism for a penis , but – to the best of my knowledge – its first official usage was in this film , and it was not meant to serve as a phallic metaphor .
The cops show up in Korben ’s apartment building , searching every room for him and Leeloo .
They ask Korben to put his hands on the scan circles in his room ( every single room comes with scan circles – echoes of a police state ? ) .
” Sir , are you classified as human ? ”
Without batting an eye , Korben replies ,
” Negative .
I am a meat popsicle . ”
Firstly , this line ceases to be funny if “ meat popsicle ” serves only as a substitute for “ cock . ”
If Korben is literally describing himself as a frozen slab of protein on a wooden stick made for human consumption , he seems that much crazier to the cop who is interrogating him .
If he had said , “ I ’m a penis , ” the cop would have taken it as an insult ( in roughly the same way they take insult to Korben ’s next door neighbor , who flips them off and yells “ SMOKE YOUUUUUUU ” instead of putting his hands in the circles ) .
Secondly , this may be the single funniest moment of the entire film .
It ’s hard to explain why the timing of “ meat popsicle ” is so funny , but it probably has something to do with typically - badass Bruce Willis making an absurd joke at the expense of the fuzz .
If I wracked my brain for a week , I would still never be able to come up with as absurd a line as “ I am a meat popsicle . ”
And this is coming from a guy who makes videos about eating babies .
Bruce Willis getting his shit wrecked by Ian Holm
This shot is hilarious for several reasons :
1. Bruce Willis never gets knocked out , by anyone , ever .
To see him get cold - cocked by fucking Bilbo , of all people , is hysterical .
2 . The look on Korben ’s face as he goes down is an insane mixture of confusion , pain , flabbergastedness , and Bruce Willis checking to make sure he does n’t miss falling on the cushioned mat placed directly below frame .
3 . While not audible in animated gif format ( obviously ) , Korben makes an incredible “ EEUUUGHAOUUUGH ” noise as he falls .
Watch the animation till it becomes hilarious , then keep watching until it becomes not funny anymore , then finish the rest of the article and come back and watch it until it becomes funny again .
The ZF - 1
It 's light .
Handle 's adjustable for easy carrying , good for righties and lefties .
Breaks down into four parts , undetectable by x-ray , ideal for quick , discreet interventions .
A word on firepower .
Titanium recharger , three thousand round clip with bursts of three to three hundred , and with the Replay button - another Zorg invention - it 's even easier .
One shot , and Replay sends every following shot to the same location .
And to finish the job , all the Zorg oldies - but - goldies : rocket launcher , arrow launcher with explosive or poisonous gas heads ( very practical ) , Zorg ’s famous net launcher , the always efficient flamethrower ( Zorg ’s favorite ) , and for the grand finale , the all - new ice cube system .
Even during my first time watching this film , I only had one complaint : that the ZF - 1 was n’t used more frequently .
Zorg spends a good five minutes explaining how cool the gun is in an early scene , and he later uses it himself – but he never utilizes any of the awesome features he showed the audience in the beginning .
Not even the Replay button .
I thought this complaint might reduce over time – sadly , this is still not the case .
Even when I re-watched it for the purposes of this article , during the moment when Zorg corners Leeloo in the ventilation system and starts wildly blasting away at the ceiling , I kept wanting him to use the ZF - 1 ’s rocket launcher .
Or flamethrower .
Or ice cube system .
You know , anything other than the default machine gun etting .
With that said , the ZF - 1 ’s single scene of badassity is still enough to make it one of the coolest and most memorable things in the film .
“ HELM , 108 ! ”
About three fourths of the way through the movie , after pretty much every main character has made it onto the good ship Fhloston Paradise , the audience is treated to a very brief scene inside the ship ’s control room , as a way of setting the location up so it will be easily recognizable once the Mangalores burst in and take over .
This scene also includes one of the most nonsensical moments in the entire film – and we ’re talking about a movie where Chris Tucker wears a hairdo resembling a giant penis .
The captain , an older , official - looking gentleman , tells his first mate “ Helm to 108 , ” ostensibly an order to change course .
The first mate nods , says “ yes , sir , ” and , for seemingly no reason at all , turns to the ship ’s pilot and literally fucking screams ,
“ HELM , 108 ! ” The pilot seems to take all of this in stride , confidently repeats the order , and turns the ship ’s wheel .
Even when I was younger , this scene seemed funny to me – firstly , we never see this first mate do anything else throughout the entire course of the movie .
Are we therefore meant to believe that his only job on the ship is to relay orders from the captain to the pilot despite the fact that the two men are literally about three feet away ?
And secondly , does he really have to yell the orders so loud ?
All things considered , the pilot probably heard the captain give the order in the first place — I imagine that having redundant sentences screamed at him over and over by a self - important officer might have a slightly negative effect on his skills as a pilot .
Still , it ’s pretty entertaining to watch the completely unassuming pilot get screamed at , and then cheerfully repeat the order as if this is something that , for better or worse , happens every day .
The pilot has accepted his lot in life : it ’s a loud , incredibly repetitive life , but it is a life , nonetheless .
Clever multi-location dialogue
Given that Luc Besson derived much of the story and visual style of The Fifth Element from a French comic book , it makes sense that he would also crib some of comics ’ main storytelling mechanics .
In fact , Besson frequently uses one particular mechanic to great effect : multi-locational dialogue .
In comics , this device is a quick and easy way of drawing parallels between scenes , or by way of transitioning from one scene to another ( read Watchmen for several examples of this – or better yet , just read Watchmen because it ’s really goddamn good ) .
In The Fifth Element , it works in much the same way , but considering it is used with live actors in a real movie , the mechanic becomes much more entertaining .
Take a scene near the beginning of the film , where Zorg opens the case he hired the Mangalores to acquire for him , expecting to find four stones inside .
In Zorg ’s factory , he opens the case , and , irritated , exclaims , “ This case is empty . ”
Quickly , we cut to a shot of Leeloo , laughing her ass off in Father Vito ’s apartment : while , within the context of her conversation with Vito , she is laughing at his question of where the four stones are , the editing makes it seem like Leeloo is laughing directly at Zorg – which , in a way , she is .
Vito asks ,
“ What do you mean , empty ? ”
Again , we quickly cut back to Zorg as he continues a seemingly separate conversation in an entirely different location , as he effectively replies to Vito ( whilst actually talking to his number two ) : “ Empty .
The opposite of full .
This case is supposed to be full !
Anyone care to explain ? ”
Then we cut back to Leeloo as she does , in fact , explain why the case is empty .
The scene goes on like this , and , apart from being a clever method of delivering a great amount of exposition to the audience and separate characters , the inherent comic timing of the mechanic make the sudden cuts and jumps in location consistently entertaining and funny .
A significant portion of the film ’s dialogue scenes are plotted out this way ( some scenes more subtly than others ) , and it gives a serious kick to what might have otherwise been boring , expository conversations .
The hero and villain never once meet each other
Yep .
Not once .
Korben Dallas works for Zorg ’s ubiquitous corporation and ends up getting fired , but that is literally the only contact , direct or indirect , the protagonist and antagonist have : they are never in the exact same location , they never talk to one another , and they are n’t even in the same frame , though near the end of the film , they get criminally close .
As Korben runs to the Fhloston Paradise hangar with Leeloo , Vito , and Ruby in tow , he steps into an elevator .
Mere moments after he and his gang disappear inside the lift , Zorg rushes out of a different elevator right next to Korben ’s : the two are technically both seen , one after another , in this unbroken shot , but they are n’t visible at the same time .
This neat aspect of the story is one of those things that I would n’t have noticed had it not been pointed out to me , but it makes a big difference : since Zorg and Korben never meet one another , the audience is spared some of the clichés that come with the territory of a big budget action movie : the monologuing , the standoff , the duel , etcetera .
Each character becomes that much more interesting when they function separately from their main enemy – indeed , in Korben ’s case , he is literally not even aware of Zorg ’s existence .
Cut it any way you like , but that shit is cool .
