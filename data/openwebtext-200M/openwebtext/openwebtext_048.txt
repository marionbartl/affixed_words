Marketing for Geeks
This page serves as the table of contents for my series of articles entitled " Marketing for Geeks " .
The central theme here is that if we demystify marketing , it can be competently done by technical people .
In most small ISVs , it 's important for at least some of the developers to have an understanding of basic marketing .
However , most geeks tend to shy away from marketing , citing their lack of creativity and graphic design skills .
But these are typically not the differentiators which determine whether marketing is competent or not .
Marketing efforts tend to succeed or fail on their strategy , not on their artwork .
In fact , many teams can improve their marketing simply by realizing that marketing , like software development , has two distinct phases .
The Two Phases of Marketing
When we build software , we typically have a design phase , followed by an implementation phase .
In the design phase , we carefully figure out exactly what we want to do .
In the implementation phase , we do it .
Likewise , marketing has a strategic phase , followed by a communication phase .
The strategic phase is analogous to the design phase of building software .
( In fact , they are related and must usually be done together . )
The communication phase is analogous to the implementation phase of building software .
We call this set of activities " marketing communications " , or " marcomm " for short .
I find it interesting that although marketing people and technical people often think they have nothing in common , both groups naturally try to weasel out of doing their first phase .
Maverick programmers do n't want to write specs and do design .
They simply want to write code .
Similarly , marketing people often prefer to plunge headfirst into creating messages , taglines and ad campaigns .
In either case , skipping the first phase will get you the instant gratification of visible results , but you 'll have all kinds of trouble down the road .

Baptists and Boundaries
In the neighborhood where I live , 100 % of the people need a well that is at least 300 feet deep .
I could extrapolate from this and decide that there is a big market for well drilling in my area .
However , the city water system is only three miles away .
This example may seem absurd , but at this very moment , there are lots of entrepreneurs writing business plans which use similar logic .
How to get people talking about your product Word - of - mouth is not a strategy .
It is the result of a strategy .
How do we make it happen ?
The Game is Afoot We can understand deep abstractions and object oriented programming .
We have no problem grasping how virtual memory works .
Some of us can even remember the keystrokes to do a search and replace in vi .
But when geeks start talking about the issues of software product strategy in a competitive market , otherwise intelligent people suddenly sound like Paris Hilton .
We just do n't get it .
Geeks understand market competition about as well as men understand women .
Geek Gauntlets
To reach mainstream customers , we sometimes need to ignore our own preferences and just do what the customers want .
Non -geeks in marketing generally have no trouble with this .
Once they decide what the market prefers , all they want to do is get that product into the customer 's hands .
They do n't have strong opinions about technology , so they do n't have trouble separating customer preferences from their own .
Act Your Age
But step three is something that happens to your product whether you like it or not .
Not unlike the natural aging process we experience as human beings , our products go through various stages of life .
In both cases , the only way to avoid the next stage is death , so we might as well learn to handle these stages with a measure of grace .
Marketing is not a Post - Processing Step " Marketing is not just telling the world about your product .
Marketing is also deciding what product to build .
You have to design and build your product to fit the market position you want it to have . "
Choose Your Competition
It 's important to specifically choose who you want your competition to be .
I like the Jim Barksdale philosophy of choosing competition : Find a competitor who is " big and dumb " .
Articles about Marcomm
Going to a Trade Show Trade shows are my favorite of the basic " marcomm " tools because they are so interactive .
Advertising and PR are primarily one - way communication , from you to the customer , without much chance for information to flow the other way .
Other marcomm tools certainly have their place , but there is nothing like a trade show .
It ’s interesting but just before the communist got to power as a result of October Revolution of 1917 , there was a USA friendly propaganda in Russia .
For example this poster is from 1917 , a few months before the communist ’s takeover .
It says : “ Friends - Democrats – Uncle Sam and Ivan ” .
But just a few month later uncle Sam became a negative hero and stayed so 70 years .

The Centre for Science and Environment on Wednesday came out with a fresh study claiming the presence of ' pesticide cocktail ' in 11 brands of soft drink giants Coca Cola and PepsiCo , three years after the same brands were found to have contained pesticides .
The new findings , publicised after testing 57 samples of 11 soft drink brands of Coca Cola and PepsiCo collected from 25 manufacturing units across 12 states , claims that all the bottles examined were a " cocktail of 3 - 5 different pesticides " which was 24 times above the standards finalised by Bureau of Indian Standards .
" We have found pesticide residue in all soft drinks tested .
Three years ago , when the tests were conducted we could spot only four pesticides .
This time it has increased to five in some cases , " Sunita Narain , director , CSE said .
The study - ' Soft Drinks - Hard Truth II ' - claims that the average amount of pesticide residues found in all the samples was 11.85 parts per billion , which is 24 times higher than the BIS standards for pesticides in soft drinks ( 0.5 ppb ) .
In 2003 , the average level of pesticide residues in Delhi samples were 34 times above the same BIS standards .
" This can not be taken as a marginal reduction , because this time to our utter shock , we have found pesticides as high as 52 times in samples of Kolkata and 42 times in Nainital and Gorakhpur , " said Chandrabhushan , associate director said .
Narain said the study has found that Pepsi Cola contained 30 times higher residues on an average and it was 27 times higher for Coca Cola .
It also found the presence of Lindane ( a carcinogen ) , Chlorphyrifis ( a neurotoxin ) , Heptachlor , Mealthion and HCH .
Heptachlor , banned in India , was found in 71 per cent of the samples , at four times higher than BIS standards .
On an average , the levels of deadly Lindane were over 54 times above the approved standards while one Coca Cola sample from Kolkata had this pesticide 140 times .
Chlorpyrifos levels were on an average 47 times higher and a Coca Cola sample from
Thane tested for this particular pesticide at a level that is 200 times than the approved levels .
" This is clearly unacceptable as we know that pesticides are tiny toxins and impact our bodies over time .
Our soft drinks remain unsafe and unhealthy and public health remains severly compromised , " said Narain .
She said the fresh study was conducted by the same Pollution Monitoring Laboratory of CSE , which has conducted the 2003 tests after acquiring ISO 9001:2000 standards .
" This will silence the criticism raised by Cola companies that we are not competent enough to carry out such tests . "
Meanwhile , the Indian Soft drink Manufacturers Association has said , " The soft drinks manufactured in India comply with stringent international norms and all applicable national regulations .
Over the past three years , the soft drink industry has worked with the government of India ( Ministry of Health and Bureau of Indian Standards ) , scientific community and NGO 's to establish stringent science based norms . "
" These efforts of the government , have led to establishment of stricter norms that are at par with the best in the world .
We understand that the Ministry of Health is in the process of developing validated testing protocols to which all members of ISDMA are fully aligned and co-operating in the process , " it added .
One hundred people aged from 22 to 45 went on five three - minute dates and were asked how they chose who to see again .
Psychologist Professor Richard Wiseman said the experiment showed that many women made decisions about prospective partners after just 30 seconds .
Most successful chat - up lines included ' What 's your favourite pizza topping ? '
The experts said looks were obviously a major factor and further research would be conducted into that area in weeks to come .
Almost 50 % of women made decisions about potential mates after half a minute during the experiment , carried out at the city 's International Science Festival .
Professor Wiseman , of Hertfordshire University , said : " One in five men had made their minds up about a person within the first 30 seconds of meeting them , compared to about half of the women .
" The key thing , particularly as women are making up their minds so quickly , is that the opening line really matters . "
The academic said men and women adopted a " pretty similar approach " to chat - up lines .
However , some differences between the sexes were highlighted by the study .
" It tended to be the guys that used closed questions ; ones that would elicit either a yes or no answer and that would be the end of the conversation , " he said .
" Our top male and female were using the same sort of chat - up lines , with topics that would make the person feel quite light - hearted .
" The most successful lines were ones which were impossible to answer with a simple yes or no , such as ' What 's your favourite pizza topping ? ' and ' Who would you be if you were going on Stars In Their Eyes ? ' .
Professor Wiseman said at the other end of the spectrum , the worst chat - up lines included ' I have a PhD in computing ' and ' My best friend 's a helicopter pilot ' .
" It 's very difficult to respond to these in an interesting or creative way , " he said .
The psychologist also found that those looking for a potential partner should steer clear of topics which could cause disagreement , such as favourite films .
He said : " We asked participants to talk about certain topics and when they spoke about films it was a disaster , I could just hear people arguing .
" No - one wanted to meet each other afterwards , mainly because men and women often disagree about the best types of films .
" But when you shifted the conversation to travel , everyone became a lot more energised and that ended in far more dates . "

Microsoft ’s new ( beta ! ) portal page , live.com , does n’t work in Firefox , and does n’t work too great in IE either .
The first thing I used it for was to search for “ firefox market share . ”
Like every search engine , you get a list of search results .
I clicked on the first one , read the article , and then clicked “ back ” to find the next result .
Oops !
What happened to the search results ?
Live.com uses dynamic HTML in a broken way such that clicking “ back ” takes you all the way back to the home page , not the search results .
Which makes it pretty unusable as a search engine .
I noticed this right away , because just yesterday we spent a lot of time thinking about this very issue in our own product , FogBugz .
I played around with the RSS subscription feature for a minute or two .
It crashed IE .
Oh well .
I do n’t remember Microsoft ever shipping anything quite this half - baked .
Maybe that means that they ’re moving firmly into the “ agile ” camp : ship early and often .
Does ship - early - and - often really work for a huge company doing massive PR pushes that ’s going to get millions of people checking out their early release ?
I do n’t think it does .
This is a classic example of what I ’ve always called the Marimba Phenomenon .
The Marimba Phenomenon is what happens when you spend more on PR and marketing than on development .
“ Result : everybody checks out your code , and it ’s not good yet .
These people will be permanently convinced that your code is simple and inadequate , even if you improve it drastically later . ”
The Marimba Phenomenon is very hard to avoid when you spend too much money trying to launch a new product .
It ’s easy to spend on marketing and PR , since that just takes cash , but it ’s hard to spend on software development , because that actually takes time and talent .
So cash - rich companies , whether Microsoft or VC - backed startups , run the risk of launching to a bigger audience than they really should have , getting millions of people to be thoroughly unimpressed by version 1.0 and never bothering to come back again to see if 2.0 might have gotten it right .
By contrast , small companies that do n’t have great marketing budgets are in a great position to launch early and often .
In the first few weeks after we launched our remote assistance product , Fog Creek Copilot , we found some pretty serious bugs handling proxy servers that affected about 5 % of our customers .
But we only had a few customers every day , since the service was new and did n’t have a superbowl ad .
We fixed the bugs in a matter of days and now there are only a tiny number of people wandering around who had a bad experience with Copilot .
And now as the service builds in popularity we ’ve rolled out dozens of new builds and fixed hundreds of bugs and even added some major cool features , like automatic screen resizing , which makes it easy to control a computer with a large monitor from a computer with a smaller monitor .
By the way , Firefox is probably around 10 % .
Jason Lefkowitz : “ Live.com is the perfect example : as far as I can tell , it ’s just a customizable portal page .
We had those in 1998 and they sucked then .
Seven years later , they have n’t gotten any better . ”
PS .
I do n’t get the difference between start.com and live.com , two remarkably similar Microsoft websites .
Start.com already works in Firefox , launches search results in a new browser window , which is awkward but not as bad as what live .com does , and seems to be more polished .
Chavez 's speech talked about the need to defeat imperialism
He described recent US government actions as " aggressive " in a speech at a youth festival in Caracas .
As a result , Venezuelan oil " instead of going to the United States , could go elsewhere , " he said .
Venezuela exports about 1.3 million barrels a day to the US and is the world 's fifth largest oil producer .
Tensions between the two countries have escalated since President Chavez accused the US Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) of spying on his government .
Washington denies the charge and has accused Caracas of failing to co-operate in the fight against drug - trafficking .
On Friday the Venezuelan government withdrew diplomatic immunity from DEA agents working in the country in response to a US decision to revoke the visas of six Venezuelan officials based in Washington .
Venezuela is an important transport route for cocaine from neighbouring Colombia , which produces 80 % of the world 's supply .
Medical tourism is accelerating , as well it should .
Advancing biotechnology , computing power and materials science means that ( a ) the practice of good medicine is coming down to pretty much the cost of regulation plus the cost of the people running the show , and ( b ) many more regions of the world have the technology base , medical community and level of economic success to do the job well .
A Filipino doctor has partnered with a Hong Kong - based company to give his countrymen hope in experiencing renewed health and strength with autologous stem cell transplants .
There is so much controversy surrounding stem - cell research because of cloning issues but plastic and cosmetic surgeon Dr. Florencio Lucero believes that autologous transplants will not only help Filipinos but also enhance medical tourism in the Philippines .
In fact , he said less than a fourth of his over 20 stem cell patients are Filipinos .
This sort of thing is " eat your lunch out from under you " competition for the biotechnology and medical industries of over - regulated US and Europe .
Here , competition is relatively muted , squashed beneath the regulatory burden of patents , trials , compliance with a thousand inane laws .
Those comparative few who source enough capital make it past the regulatory costs move into the realm of protectionist policies and short term gain - the barrier now behind them is the fence against competition , and it is in their interest to keep that fence high .
A high fence means high profits and less of a need to try anything new and better to keep the money coming in .
Let me say this : human beings are damn lazy when there is n't a spear prodding them in the back .
It 's our nature .
Competition is that spear , the serious threat of your profits and edges vanishing elsewhere , forcing you to inventively accomplish more and better for less .
Competition is the alchemical weapon that transforms all the worst aspects of human nature into tools to bring progress to all as rapidly and cheaply as possible .
The more aggressive , open and unrestricted the competition , the better the resulting service is for the customers - folk like you and I .
So we should all be very pleased to see Asian biotech and medical entrepreneurs eating the very lunch out from underneath late - stage researchers and new businesses in the US and Europe .
It 's the only way that those insulated folk inside the regulatory fence are going to feel any meaningful pressure to help tear it down - and thus better serve us over the long term .

The Dread Pirate Bin Laden
How thinking of terrorists as pirates can help win the war on terror .
By Douglas R. Burgess Jr.
INTERNATIONAL LAW LACKS A DEFINITION FOR TERRORISM as a crime .
According to Secretary General Kofi Annan , this lack has hampered " the moral authority of the United Nations and its strength in condemning " the scourge .
But attempts to provide a definition have failed because of terrorists ' strangely hybrid status in the law .
They are neither ordinary criminals nor recognized state actors , so there is almost no international or domestic law dealing with them .
This gives an out to countries that harbor terrorists and declare them " freedom fighters . "
It also lets the United States flout its own constitutional safeguards by holding suspects captive indefinitely at Guantánamo Bay .
The overall situation is , in a word , anarchic .
This chaotic state is reflected in , and caused by , the tortuous machinations of the U.N. in defining terrorism .
Over 40 years of debate have produced a plethora of conventions proscribing acts ranging from hijacking to financing terrorist organizations .
But the U.N. remains deadlocked on what a terrorist is .
As a result , terrorists and countries like the United States pursue one another across the globe with virtually no rules governing their actions .
What is needed now is a framework for an international crime of terrorism .
The framework should be incorporated into the U.N. Convention on Terrorism and should call for including the crime in domestic criminal law and perhaps the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court .
This framework must recognize the unique threat that terrorists pose to nation - states , yet not grant them the legitimacy accorded to belligerent states .
It must provide the foundation for a law that criminalizes not only terrorist acts but membership in a terrorist organization .
It must define methods of punishment .
Coming up with such a framework would perhaps seem impossible , except that one already exists .
Dusty and anachronistic , perhaps , but viable all the same .
More than 2,000 years ago , Marcus Tullius Cicero defined pirates in Roman law as hostis humani generis , " enemies of the human race . "
From that day until now , pirates have held a unique status in the law as international criminals subject to universal jurisdiction meaning that they may be captured wherever they are found , by any person who finds them .
The ongoing war against pirates is the only known example of state vs. nonstate conflict until the advent of the war on terror , and its history is long and notable .
More important , there are enormous potential benefits of applying this legal definition to contemporary terrorism .
AT FIRST GLANCE , THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PIRACY AND TERRORISM seems a stretch .
Yet much of the basis of this skepticism can be traced to romantic and inaccurate notions about piracy .
An examination of the actual history of the crime reveals startling , even astonishing , parallels to contemporary international terrorism .
Viewed in its proper historical context , piracy emerges as a clear and powerful precedent .
Piracy has flourished on the high seas for as long as maritime commerce has existed between states .
Yet its meaning as a crime has varied considerably .
The Roman definition of hostis humani generis fell into disuse by the fifth century A.D. with the decline of the empire .
But the act did n't disappear with the definition .
By 912 , pirates along the coasts of Western Europe who styled themselves as " sea - warriors , " or Vikings , had terrorized Britain and conquered Normandy .
In the early Middle Ages , with no national navies to quash them , pirates held sway over nearly every trade route in Europe .
Kings like Edward I of England then began to grant " Commissions of Reprisal " to merchantmen , entitling them to attack both pirate ships and any other merchant vessel flying the same country 's flag as the one flown by the pirates they had seen before .
By the 16th century , piracy had emerged as an essential , though unsavory , tool of statecraft .
Queen Elizabeth viewed English pirates as adjuncts to the royal navy , and regularly granted them " letters of marque " ( later known as privateering , or piracy , commissions ) to harass Spanish trade .
It was a brilliant maneuver .
The mariners who received these letters , most notably the famed explorers Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh , amassed immense fortunes for themselves and the Crown , wreaked havoc on Spanish fleets , and terrorized Spain 's shoreside cities .
Meanwhile , the queen could preserve the vestiges of diplomatic relations , reacting with feigned horror to revelations of the pirates ' depredations .
Witness , for example , the queen 's disingenuous instructions saying that if Raleigh " shall at any time or times hereafter robbe or spoile by sea or by lance , or do any acte of unjust or unlawful hostilities [ he shall ] make full restitution , and satisfaction of all such injuries done . "
When Raleigh did what Elizabeth had forbiddennamely , sack and pillage the ports of then - ally Spain Elizabeth knighted him .
This precedent would be repeated time and again until the mid-19th century , as the Western powers regularly employed pirates to wage secret wars .
After a series of draconian laws passed by George I of England effectively banished pirates from the Atlantic , the Mediterranean corsairs emerged as pre-eminent maritime mercenaries in the employ of any European state wishing to harass another .
This situation proved disastrous .
The corsairs refused to curtail their activities after each war 's conclusion , and the states realized that they had created an uncontrollable force .
It was this realization that led to the Declaration of Paris in 1856 , signed by England , France , Spain , and most other European nations , which abolished the use of piracy for state purposes .
Piracy became and remained beyond the pale of legitimate state behavior .
IF THIS CHRONOLOGY SEEMS FAMILIAR , IT SHOULD .
The rise and fall of state - sponsored piracy bears chilling similarity to current state - sponsored terrorism .
Many nations , including Libya , Iran , Iraq , Yemen , and Afghanistan , have sponsored terrorist organizations to wage war against the United States or other Western powers .
In each case , the motivations have been virtually identical to those of Elizabeth : harass the enemy , deplete its resources , terrify its citizens , frustrate its government , and remain above the fray .
The United States is credited with manufacturing its own enemy by training , funding , and outfitting terrorist groups in the Middle East , Afghanistan , and Central America during the cold war .
But the important lesson for us is not merely that history repeats itself .
Looking at the past provides a parallel to our current dilemma but also a solution .
The Declaration of Paris is , on the one hand , a recognition of shared guilt .
On the other , it represents the first articulation since the Roman era of piracy as a crime in and of itself .
The pirate , by this definition , exists like a malevolent satellite to the law of nations .
" Considering . . . that the uncertainty of the law and of the duties in such a matter [ as piracy ] gives rise to differences of opinion between neutrals and belligerents which may occasion serious difficulties , and even conflicts , " the declaration stated , the signing parties " have adopted the following solemn declaration : Privateering is and remains abolished . "
Until 1856 , international law recognized only two legal entities : people and states .
People were subject to the laws of their own governments ; states were subject to the laws made amongst themselves .
The Declaration of Paris created a third entity : people who lacked both the individual rights and protections of law for citizens and the legitimacy and sovereignty of states .
This understanding of pirates as a legally distinct category of international criminals persists to the present day , and was echoed in the 1958 and 1982 U.N. Conventions on the Law of the Sea .
The latter defines the crime of piracy as " any illegal acts of violence or detention , or any act of depredation , committed for private ends . "
This definition of piracy as private war for private ends may hold the crux of a new legal definition of international terrorists .
DANIEL DEFOE , THE GREAT CHRONICLER OF PIRACY'S GOLDEN AGE in his
The myth of the romantic buccaneer , perpetuated by such diverse artists as Robert Louis Stevenson and Johnny Depp , must be set aside .
The pirates of the so - called golden age , as historian Hugh Rankin described them , were " a sorry lot of human trash . "
Coming from the lowest tier of the English merchant navy , they struck indiscriminately in ferocious revenge against the societies that they felt had condemned them .
Often these disenchanted sailors cast their piratical careers in revolutionary terms .
The 18th - century English legal scholar William Blackstone defined a pirate as someone who has " reduced himself afresh to the savage state of nature by declaring war against all mankind , " while another account tells of one Edward Low , common seaman , who " took a small vessel , [ hoisted ] a Black Flag , and declared War against all the World . "
Pirates gave their ships names that reflected this dark purpose : Defiance , Vengeance , New York 's Revenge , and even New York Revenge 's Revenge .
Perhaps the most telling statement of the pirates ' motives comes from a pirate named Black Sam Bellamy .
To a captured merchant captain , he boasted , " I am a free prince , and have as much authority to make war on the whole world as he who has a 100 sail of ships and an army of 100,000 men in the field . "
This was more than bravado .
Historian Marcus Rediker has suggested that it indicates a new " pirate democracy " that drew its revolutionary principles from its perceived war against civilization and cast itself as civilization 's antithesis .
Some pirate bands even had constitutions .
The " pirate articles " that became commonplace in the early 18th century purported to lay out in legal terms both the rights and obligations that members in a pirate band enjoyed .
An excerpt from articles of Captain John Phillips , drafted in 1723 , even provides a sort of liability insurance for injured comrades .
The corollaries between the pirates ' " war against the world " and modern terrorism are profound and disturbing .
With their vengeful practices , pirates were the first and perhaps only historical precedent for the terrorist cell : a group of men who bound themselves in extraterritorial enclaves , removed themselves from the protection and jurisdiction of the nation - state , and declared war against civilization .
Both pirates and terrorists deliberately employ this extranationality as a means of pursuing their activities .
The pirates hid in the myriad shoals and islands of the Atlantic .
The terrorists hide in cells throughout the world .
Both seek through their acts to bring notice to themselves and their causes .
They share means as well destruction of property , frustration of commerce , and homicide .
Most important , both are properly considered enemies of the rest of the human race .
WHILE THESE HISTORICAL PARALLELS MAY TITILLATE THE IMAGINATION , they only go so far .
Piracy and terrorism may share similar histories , but are they the same crime under the law ?
How could something generally thought of as sea robbery equal the crime committed by the people who destroyed the World Trade Center ?
This apparent incongruity has prevented scholars from recognizing the currents that run through them both .
A crime , under the domestic law of most nations , has three elements familiar to veterans of introductory classes in criminal law : mens rea , the mental state during the commission of a crime ; actus reus , the actions that constitute a crime ; and locus , the place where a crime occurs .
If two crimes share the same mens rea , actus reus , and locus , they are , if not identical , comparable .
While piracy and terrorism may not be the same crime , they share enough elements to merit joint definition under international law .
First , consider the mens rea .
Terror has always been an integral part of piracy , often used to achieve a psychological effect .
Perhaps the greatest terrorist of all time was Edward Teach , alias Blackbeard .
When boarding a prize in battle he wove sulfur fuses into his long beard and lit them , wreathing his face in green smoke and giving himself a satanic appearance .
Pirates like Blackbeard understood that their trade was a highly dangerous one and that the odds were rarely on their side .
If the sight of a pirate flag could strike terror into the hearts of the victim and lead to a bloodless capitulation , pirates could avoid exposing their vulnerabilities .
Pirates used fear as a tactic and for its own sake as well .
They often viewed their predatory activities as a means of striking blows against civilization .
Terror , in this light , became a vital part of the message they wished to send .
It was not uncommon for pirates to leave a single captured sailor alive to pass on the story of their depredations .
Thus the mens rea of piracy the desire to inflict death , destruction , or deprivation of property through violent acts accompanied by deliberate use of terrorism is a close cousin to the perceived mens rea of organized terrorism .
The main distinction between them is that , although pirates might use terror as a means to an end or an end in itself , terrorists necessarily employ it for the latter purpose .
A similar calculus can be made for the actus reus .
Piracy still refers to sea robbery , and most piratical incidents that occur today , particularly in the Malacca Straits in Southeast Asia and other pirate " hot spots , " have pecuniary rather than political motives .
Yet piracy also includes a great many acts that involve no actual theft at all .
In 1922 , in the aftermath of World War I , France , Italy , Japan , Britain , and the United States pledged in the Washington Declaration to punish " as an act of piracy " any unprovoked submarine attacks .
The Spanish Civil War a decade later produced a second and even more revolutionary treaty , the Nyon Agreement of 1937 .
Signed by countries including Egypt , Greece , France , Britain , and the Soviet Union , it extended universal jurisdiction to any unidentified vessels or aircraft attacking merchant shipping on behalf of the Spanish insurgents , referring to such acts as " piratical . "
President Ronald Reagan extended this politicized definition of piracy still further during the Achille Lauro affair of 1985 .
Following the seizure of an Italian cruise liner by members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the murder of one of its passengers ( a wheelchair - bound American ) , Reagan declared the terrorists " pirates " and demanded their extradition .
This melding of terrorist and piratical crimes later resulted in the creation of a U.N. convention that introduced the term " maritime terrorism " into the legal lexicon of piracy .
Over time , then , the actus reus of piracy and terrorism have moved closer to one another , and overlapped in incidents like that of the Achille Lauro .
Finally there is the locus .
It seems axiomatic that piracy must occur at sea , but that assumption is false .
Legal scholars have long recognized two secondary forms of piracy , one ancient , one quite modern .
The first is termed " descent by sea . "
In the old days , this meant sending jolly boats ashore and sacking a town , as Captain Henry Morgan did throughout the Spanish colonies at Portobello , Maracaibo , and Panama City in the late 17th century .
The second form , far more recent , is aerial piracy , commonly known as hijacking .
The linkage of piracy and hijacking under the law is made explicit in numerous sources , including the Tokyo , Hague , and Montreal conventions on hijacking , the latter of which extended the definition of piratical acts to those committed " by the crew and passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft . . . against another ship or aircraft or against persons or property on board . "
Even in the infancy of aerial flight , jurists recognized the potential linkages between piracy in the air and piracy at sea .
The Harvard Draft Convention on Piracy of 1932 stated , " The pirate of tradition attacked on or from the sea .
Certainly today , however , one should not deem the possibility of similar attacks in or from the air as too slight or too remote for consideration .
. . . "
Suppose an airplane is hijacked en route and sent hurtling into a coastal city , causing great loss of life and destruction of property .
Under both the U.N. hijacking and piracy conventions , it is certainly an act of aerial piracy .
Yet it is also a descent by sea under the broadest understanding of the term .
The pirates seize the vessel and use it to attack a shoreside target , descending upon their target from the air .
This piratical understanding of locus lends itself to the attacks of September 11 , of course , but also to many other cases .
It could be extended to include any terrorist acts committed after the terrorist has landed in a foreign nation , provided that he arrives with the intention to commit them meaning that there 's great similarity in mens rea , actus reus , and locus between piracy and terrorism .
TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL OF DEFINING TERRORISM as a species of piracy , consider the words of the 16th - century jurist Alberico Gentili 's
De jure belli : " Pirates are common enemies , and they are attacked with impunity by all , because they are without the pale of the law .
They are scorners of the law of nations ; hence they find no protection in that law . "
Gentili , and many people who came after him , recognized piracy as a threat , not merely to the state but to the idea of statehood itself .
All states were equally obligated to stamp out this menace , whether or not they had been a victim of piracy .
This was codified explicitly in the 1856 Declaration of Paris , and it has been reiterated as a guiding principle of piracy law ever since .
Ironically , it is the very effectiveness of this criminalization that has marginalized piracy and made it seem an arcane and almost romantic offense .
Pirates no longer terrorize the seas because a concerted effort among the European states in the 19th century almost eradicated them .
It is just such a concerted effort that all states must now undertake against terrorists , until the crime of terrorism becomes as remote and obsolete as piracy .
But we are still very far from such recognition for the present war on terror .
President Bush and others persist in depicting this new form of state vs. nonstate warfare in traditional terms , as with the president 's declaration of June 2 , 2004 , that " like the Second World War , our present conflict began with a ruthless surprise attack on the United States . "
He went on : " We will not forget that treachery and we will accept nothing less than victory over the enemy . "
What constitutes ultimate victory against an enemy that lacks territorial boundaries and governmental structures , in a war without fields of battle or codes of conduct ?
We can't capture the enemy 's capital and hoist our flag in triumph .
The possibility of perpetual embattlement looms before us .
If the war on terror becomes akin to war against the pirates , however , the situation would change .
First , the crime of terrorism would be defined and proscribed internationally , and terrorists would be properly understood as enemies of all states .
This legal status carries significant advantages , chief among them the possibility of universal jurisdiction .
Terrorists , as hostis humani generis , could be captured wherever they were found , by anyone who found them .
Pirates are currently the only form of criminals subject to this special jurisdiction .
Second , this definition would deter states from harboring terrorists on the grounds that they are " freedom fighters " by providing an objective distinction in law between legitimate insurgency and outright terrorism .
This same objective definition could , conversely , also deter states from cracking down on political dissidents as " terrorists , " as both Russia and China have done against their dissidents .
Recall the U.N. definition of piracy as acts of " depredation [ committed ] for private ends . "
Just as international piracy is viewed as transcending domestic criminal law , so too must the crime of international terrorism be defined as distinct from domestic homicide or , alternately , revolutionary activities .
If a group directs its attacks on military or civilian targets within its own state , it may still fall within domestic criminal law .
Yet once it directs those attacks on property or civilians belonging to another state , it exceeds both domestic law and the traditional right of self - determination , and becomes akin to a pirate band .
Third , and perhaps most important , nations that now balk at assisting the United States in the war on terror might have fewer reservations if terrorism were defined as an international crime that could be prosecuted before the International Criminal Court .
For now , these possibilities remain distant .
But there are immediate benefits to pointing out that terrorism has a precedent in piracy .
In the short term , it is a tool to cut the Gordian knot of definition that has hampered antiterrorist legislation for 40 years .
In the long term , and far more important , it provides the parameters by which to understand this current and intense conflict and the means within which it may one day be resolved .
That resolution will begin with the recognition among nations that terrorism is a threat to all states and to all persons , the same recognition given to piracy in 1856 .
Terrorists , like pirates , must be given their proper status in law : hostis humani generis , enemies of the human race .
Douglas R. Burgess Jr. is the author of Seize the Trident : The Race for Superliner Supremacy and How It Altered the Great War , published this year by McGraw - Hill .
INTERNATIONAL LAW LACKS A DEFINITION FOR TERRORISM as a crime .
According to Secretary General Kofi Annan , this lack has hampered " the moral authority of the United Nations and its strength in condemning " the scourge .
But attempts to provide a definition have failed because of terrorists ' strangely hybrid status in the law .
They are neither ordinary criminals nor recognized state actors , so there is almost no international or domestic law dealing with them .
This gives an out to countries that harbor terrorists and declare them " freedom fighters . "
It also lets the United States flout its own constitutional safeguards by holding suspects captive indefinitely at Guantánamo Bay .
The overall situation is , in a word , anarchic .
This chaotic state is reflected in , and caused by , the tortuous machinations of the U.N. in defining terrorism .
Over 40 years of debate have produced a plethora of conventions proscribing acts ranging from hijacking to financing terrorist organizations .
But the U.N. remains deadlocked on what a terrorist is .
As a result , terrorists and countries like the United States pursue one another across the globe with virtually no rules governing their actions .
What is needed now is a framework for an international crime of terrorism .
The framework should be incorporated into the U.N. Convention on Terrorism and should call for including the crime in domestic criminal law and perhaps the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court .
This framework must recognize the unique threat that terrorists pose to nation - states , yet not grant them the legitimacy accorded to belligerent states .
It must provide the foundation for a law that criminalizes not only terrorist acts but membership in a terrorist organization .
It must define methods of punishment .
Coming up with such a framework would perhaps seem impossible , except that one already exists .
Dusty and anachronistic , perhaps , but viable all the same .
More than 2,000 years ago , Marcus Tullius Cicero defined pirates in Roman law as , " enemies of the human race . "
From that day until now , pirates have held a unique status in the law as international criminals subject to universal jurisdiction meaning that they may be captured wherever they are found , by any person who finds them .
The ongoing war against pirates is the only known example of state vs. nonstate conflict until the advent of the war on terror , and its history is long and notable .
More important , there are enormous potential benefits of applying this legal definition to contemporary terrorism .
AT FIRST GLANCE , THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PIRACY AND TERRORISM seems a stretch .
Yet much of the basis of this skepticism can be traced to romantic and inaccurate notions about piracy .
An examination of the actual history of the crime reveals startling , even astonishing , parallels to contemporary international terrorism .
Viewed in its proper historical context , piracy emerges as a clear and powerful precedent .
Piracy has flourished on the high seas for as long as maritime commerce has existed between states .
Yet its meaning as a crime has varied considerably .
The Roman definition offell into disuse by the fifth century A.D. with the decline of the empire .
But the act did n't disappear with the definition .
By 912 , pirates along the coasts of Western Europe who styled themselves as " sea - warriors , " or Vikings , had terrorized Britain and conquered Normandy .
In the early Middle Ages , with no national navies to quash them , pirates held sway over nearly every trade route in Europe .
Kings like Edward I of England then began to grant " Commissions of Reprisal " to merchantmen , entitling them to attack both pirate ships and any other merchant vessel flying the same country 's flag as the one flown by the pirates they had seen before .
By the 16th century , piracy had emerged as an essential , though unsavory , tool of statecraft .
Queen Elizabeth viewed English pirates as adjuncts to the royal navy , and regularly granted them " letters of marque " ( later known as privateering , or piracy , commissions ) to harass Spanish trade .
It was a brilliant maneuver .
The mariners who received these letters , most notably the famed explorers Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh , amassed immense fortunes for themselves and the Crown , wreaked havoc on Spanish fleets , and terrorized Spain 's shoreside cities .
Meanwhile , the queen could preserve the vestiges of diplomatic relations , reacting with feigned horror to revelations of the pirates ' depredations .
Witness , for example , the queen 's disingenuous instructions saying that if Raleigh " shall at any time or times hereafter robbe or spoile by sea or by lance , or do any acte of unjust or unlawful hostilities [ he shall ] make full restitution , and satisfaction of all such injuries done . "
When Raleigh did what Elizabeth had forbiddennamely , sack and pillage the ports of then - ally Spain Elizabeth knighted him .
This precedent would be repeated time and again until the mid-19th century , as the Western powers regularly employed pirates to wage secret wars .
After a series of draconian laws passed by George I of England effectively banished pirates from the Atlantic , the Mediterranean corsairs emerged as pre-eminent maritime mercenaries in the employ of any European state wishing to harass another .
This situation proved disastrous .
The corsairs refused to curtail their activities after each war 's conclusion , and the states realized that they had created an uncontrollable force .
It was this realization that led to the Declaration of Paris in 1856 , signed by England , France , Spain , and most other European nations , which abolished the use of piracy for state purposes .
Piracy became and remained beyond the pale of legitimate state behavior .
IF THIS CHRONOLOGY SEEMS FAMILIAR , IT SHOULD .
The rise and fall of state - sponsored piracy bears chilling similarity to current state - sponsored terrorism .
Many nations , including Libya , Iran , Iraq , Yemen , and Afghanistan , have sponsored terrorist organizations to wage war against the United States or other Western powers .
In each case , the motivations have been virtually identical to those of Elizabeth : harass the enemy , deplete its resources , terrify its citizens , frustrate its government , and remain above the fray .
The United States is credited with manufacturing its own enemy by training , funding , and outfitting terrorist groups in the Middle East , Afghanistan , and Central America during the cold war .
But the important lesson for us is not merely that history repeats itself .
Looking at the past provides a parallel to our current dilemma but also a solution .
The Declaration of Paris is , on the one hand , a recognition of shared guilt .
On the other , it represents the first articulation since the Roman era of piracy as a crime in and of itself .
The pirate , by this definition , exists like a malevolent satellite to the law of nations .
" Considering . . . that the uncertainty of the law and of the duties in such a matter [ as piracy ] gives rise to differences of opinion between neutrals and belligerents which may occasion serious difficulties , and even conflicts , " the declaration stated , the signing parties " have adopted the following solemn declaration : Privateering is and remains abolished .
" Until 1856 , international law recognized only two legal entities : people and states .
People were subject to the laws of their own governments ; states were subject to the laws made amongst themselves .
The Declaration of Paris created a third entity : people who lacked both the individual rights and protections of law for citizens and the legitimacy and sovereignty of states .
This understanding of pirates as a legally distinct category of international criminals persists to the present day , and was echoed in the 1958 and 1982 U.N. Conventions on the Law of the Sea .
The latter defines the crime of piracy as " any illegal acts of violence or detention , or any act of depredation , committed for private ends . "
This definition of piracy as private war for private ends may hold the crux of a new legal definition of international terrorists .
DANIEL DEFOE , THE GREAT CHRONICLER OF PIRACY'S GOLDEN AGE in his General History of the Pyrates , described his subjects as stateless persons " at war with all the world , " a definition that may connect contemporary terrorism to piracy even more than state sponsorship does .
The legacy of the Elizabethan era was a diaspora of unemployed , malcontent mariners throughout the Atlantic colonies .
By the late 17th century , they began to coalesce into small pirate bands , seize vessels at anchorages or on the high seas , and wage their own private wars .
The myth of the romantic buccaneer , perpetuated by such diverse artists as Robert Louis Stevenson and Johnny Depp , must be set aside .
The pirates of the so - called golden age , as historian Hugh Rankin described them , were " a sorry lot of human trash . "
Coming from the lowest tier of the English merchant navy , they struck indiscriminately in ferocious revenge against the societies that they felt had condemned them .
Often these disenchanted sailors cast their piratical careers in revolutionary terms .
The 18th - century English legal scholar William Blackstone defined a pirate as someone who has " reduced himself afresh to the savage state of nature by declaring war against all mankind , " while another account tells of one Edward Low , common seaman , who " took a small vessel , [ hoisted ] a Black Flag , and declared War against all the World . "
Pirates gave their ships names that reflected this dark purpose : Defiance , Vengeance , New York 's Revenge , and even New York Revenge 's Revenge .
Perhaps the most telling statement of the pirates ' motives comes from a pirate named Black Sam Bellamy .
To a captured merchant captain , he boasted , " I am a free prince , and have as much authority to make war on the whole world as he who has a 100 sail of ships and an army of 100,000 men in the field .
" This was more than bravado .
Historian Marcus Rediker has suggested that it indicates a new " pirate democracy " that drew its revolutionary principles from its perceived war against civilization and cast itself as civilization 's antithesis .
Some pirate bands even had constitutions .
The " pirate articles " that became commonplace in the early 18th century purported to lay out in legal terms both the rights and obligations that members in a pirate band enjoyed .
An excerpt from articles of Captain John Phillips , drafted in 1723 , even provides a sort of liability insurance for injured comrades .
The corollaries between the pirates ' " war against the world " and modern terrorism are profound and disturbing .
With their vengeful practices , pirates were the first and perhaps only historical precedent for the terrorist cell : a group of men who bound themselves in extraterritorial enclaves , removed themselves from the protection and jurisdiction of the nation - state , and declared war against civilization .
Both pirates and terrorists deliberately employ this extranationality as a means of pursuing their activities .
The pirates hid in the myriad shoals and islands of the Atlantic .
The terrorists hide in cells throughout the world .
Both seek through their acts to bring notice to themselves and their causes .
They share means as well destruction of property , frustration of commerce , and homicide .
Most important , both are properly considered enemies of the rest of the human race .
WHILE THESE HISTORICAL PARALLELS MAY TITILLATE THE IMAGINATION , they only go so far .
Piracy and terrorism may share similar histories , but are they the same crime under the law ?
How could something generally thought of as sea robbery equal the crime committed by the people who destroyed the World Trade Center ?
This apparent incongruity has prevented scholars from recognizing the currents that run through them both .
A crime , under the domestic law of most nations , has three elements familiar to veterans of introductory classes in criminal law : , the mental state during the commission of a crime ; , the actions that constitute a crime ; and , the place where a crime occurs .
If two crimes share the same , and , they are , if not identical , comparable .
While piracy and terrorism may not be the same crime , they share enough elements to merit joint definition under international law .
First , consider the .
Terror has always been an integral part of piracy , often used to achieve a psychological effect .
Perhaps the greatest terrorist of all time was Edward Teach , alias Blackbeard .
When boarding a prize in battle he wove sulfur fuses into his long beard and lit them , wreathing his face in green smoke and giving himself a satanic appearance .
Pirates like Blackbeard understood that their trade was a highly dangerous one and that the odds were rarely on their side .
If the sight of a pirate flag could strike terror into the hearts of the victim and lead to a bloodless capitulation , pirates could avoid exposing their vulnerabilities .
Pirates used fear as a tactic and for its own sake as well .
They often viewed their predatory activities as a means of striking blows against civilization .
Terror , in this light , became a vital part of the message they wished to send .
It was not uncommon for pirates to leave a single captured sailor alive to pass on the story of their depredations .
Thus theof piracy the desire to inflict death , destruction , or deprivation of property through violent acts accompanied by deliberate use of terrorism is a close cousin to the perceivedof organized terrorism .
The main distinction between them is that , although pirates might use terror as a means to an end or an end in itself , terrorists necessarily employ it for the latter purpose .
A similar calculus can be made for the .
Piracy still refers to sea robbery , and most piratical incidents that occur today , particularly in the Malacca Straits in Southeast Asia and other pirate " hot spots , " have pecuniary rather than political motives .
Yet piracy also includes a great many acts that involve no actual theft at all .
In 1922 , in the aftermath of World War I , France , Italy , Japan , Britain , and the United States pledged in the Washington Declaration to punish " as an act of piracy " any unprovoked submarine attacks .
The Spanish Civil
War a decade later produced a second and even more revolutionary treaty , the Nyon Agreement of 1937 .
Signed by countries including Egypt , Greece , France , Britain , and the Soviet Union , it extended universal jurisdiction to any unidentified vessels or aircraft attacking merchant shipping on behalf of the Spanish insurgents , referring to such acts as " piratical .
" President Ronald Reagan extended this politicized definition of piracy still further during the Achille Lauro affair of 1985 .
Following the seizure of an Italian cruise liner by members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the murder of one of its passengers ( a wheelchair - bound American ) , Reagan declared the terrorists " pirates " and demanded their extradition .
This melding of terrorist and piratical crimes later resulted in the creation of a U.N. convention that introduced the term " maritime terrorism " into the legal lexicon of piracy .
Over time , then , theof piracy and terrorism have moved closer to one another , and overlapped in incidents like that of the Achille Lauro .
Finally there is the .
It seems axiomatic that piracy must occur at sea , but that assumption is false .
Legal scholars have long recognized two secondary forms of piracy , one ancient , one quite modern .
The first is termed " descent by sea . "
In the old days , this meant sending jolly boats ashore and sacking a town , as Captain Henry Morgan did throughout the Spanish colonies at Portobello , Maracaibo , and Panama City in the late 17th century .
The second form , far more recent , is aerial piracy , commonly known as hijacking .
The linkage of piracy and hijacking under the law is made explicit in numerous sources , including the Tokyo , Hague , and Montreal conventions on hijacking , the latter of which extended the definition of piratical acts to those committed " by the crew and passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft . . . against another ship or aircraft or against persons or property on board . "
Even in the infancy of aerial flight , jurists recognized the potential linkages between piracy in the air and piracy at sea .
The Harvard Draft Convention on Piracy of 1932 stated , " The pirate of tradition attacked on or from the sea .
Certainly today , however , one should not deem the possibility of similar attacks in or from the air as too slight or too remote for consideration .
. . .
" Suppose an airplane is hijacked en route and sent hurtling into a coastal city , causing great loss of life and destruction of property .
Under both the U.N. hijacking and piracy conventions , it is certainly an act of aerial piracy .
Yet it is also a descent by sea under the broadest understanding of the term .
The pirates seize the vessel and use it to attack a shoreside target , descending upon their target from the air .
This piratical understanding oflends itself to the attacks of September 11 , of course , but also to many other cases .
It could be extended to include any terrorist acts committed after the terrorist has landed in a foreign nation , provided that he arrives with the intention to commit them meaning that there 's great similarity in , andbetween piracy and terrorism .
TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL OF DEFINING TERRORISM as a species of piracy , consider the words of the 16th - century jurist Alberico Gentili's : " Pirates are common enemies , and they are attacked with impunity by all , because they are without the pale of the law .
They are scorners of the law of nations ; hence they find no protection in that law . "
Gentili , and many people who came after him , recognized piracy as a threat , not merely to the state but to the idea of statehood itself .
All states were equally obligated to stamp out this menace , whether or not they had been a victim of piracy .
This was codified explicitly in the 1856 Declaration of Paris , and it has been reiterated as a guiding principle of piracy law ever since .
Ironically , it is the very effectiveness of this criminalization that has marginalized piracy and made it seem an arcane and almost romantic offense .
Pirates no longer terrorize the seas because a concerted effort among the European states in the 19th century almost eradicated them .
It is just such a concerted effort that all states must now undertake against terrorists , until the crime of terrorism becomes as remote and obsolete as piracy .
But we are still very far from such recognition for the present war on terror .
President Bush and others persist in depicting this new form of state vs. nonstate warfare in traditional terms , as with the president 's declaration of June 2 , 2004 , that " like the Second World War , our present conflict began with a ruthless surprise attack on the United States . "
He went on : " We will not forget that treachery and we will accept nothing less than victory over the enemy . "
What constitutes ultimate victory against an enemy that lacks territorial boundaries and governmental structures , in a war without fields of battle or codes of conduct ?
We can't capture the enemy 's capital and hoist our flag in triumph .
The possibility of perpetual embattlement looms before us .
If the war on terror becomes akin to war against the pirates , however , the situation would change .
First , the crime of terrorism would be defined and proscribed internationally , and terrorists would be properly understood as enemies of all states .
This legal status carries significant advantages , chief among them the possibility of universal jurisdiction .

Pirates are currently the only form of criminals subject to this special jurisdiction .
Second , this definition would deter states from harboring terrorists on the grounds that they are " freedom fighters " by providing an objective distinction in law between legitimate insurgency and outright terrorism .
This same objective definition could , conversely , also deter states from cracking down on political dissidents as " terrorists , " as both Russia and China have done against their dissidents .
Recall the U.N. definition of piracy as acts of " depredation [ committed ] for private ends . "
Just as international piracy is viewed as transcending domestic criminal law , so too must the crime of international terrorism be defined as distinct from domestic homicide or , alternately , revolutionary activities .
If a group directs its attacks on military or civilian targets within its own state , it may still fall within domestic criminal law .

Terrorists , like pirates , must be given their proper status in law : , enemies of the human race .

New Years
It is a bit past midnight on New Year 's Eve and I am in bed , alone , with a book and two spastic cats for company .
I feel utterly boring .
I had offers from Dan Kessler and vaguely from Melissa , though she never returned my call .
I denied Dan so I could go to the annual family party , where I overate and beat my younger brother in Dance Dance Revolution .
This is one of the less wise combinations .
There is this weird quirk to my social programming when it comes to food at parties .
I am physically aware that I am well past sated , that I do not in fact need more weak " hot " wings or six - foot sub with proportionally two feet of meat .
However , the programming reminds me that I will not have the option to eat these foods later - whether I would like to or not - and should therefore keep eating to make up for those times when I might absently wonder if it would be wise to gorge on food I do n't particularly like .
Gluttonous overconsumption as ersatz socialization , as though enough bad food will make the occasion more special .
As eating disorders go , it is rather a specific and lame one .
My infant niece Alyssah - she of my biology and not merely affection - has discovered the social smile and thus the majority of our activities post - DDR focused on provoking her .
I think it happens to every family , in awe as a barely formed new being experiences our cultural eccentricities for the first time , as though she will remember more than a glimmer of any of this .
Emily claims to remember the bars of her crib , but I remember nothing before my parents telling me that the dog had chewed the face off my favorite toy , Elka .
I wrapped it in toilet paper as a burial shroud and put it in the bathroom garbage .
They let me .
I doubt I was younger than three , meaning that Alyssah is going to have a couple more New Year 's Eves before her brain realizes it is capable of remembering as well as drooling .
Right now , it pushes her toward the latter as she shows a prodigious aptitude .
I suppose it is just a night and it is silly to put much emphasis on it .
I could n't kiss Emily at midnight , as she was a country away and , I would later discover , asleep when the ball dropped in our respective time zones .
This hardly dooms our coming year .
So many superstitious develop simply out of the fear and the need to feel that we are in control of our lives .
Some cultures refuse to clean on New Year 's Day , some require a dark haired stranger to be the first one to pass through the threshold .
Yet the scientific method hardly applies .
Our minds grasp for patterns and reason in the chaos of life .
Some even make predictions for the coming year , ignoring the paltry success rate for those who do .
Random guessing would prove more reliable than celebrity psychics , who employ an art little better .
We even try to make resolutions for how we will change our lives in the coming year , promises made to the universe broken before we can manage to clean up all the confetti or find our missing underpants .
I refuse to resolve anything amorphous and I certainly do n't wait for some inaccurate milestone to do my resolving .
All I am willing to wager is that this will be a very different year than the past .
Night of the Day of the Dawn
If the zombies break in , I would almost certainly die .
In the prep school theater where I am to endure a week of orientation , there are only two exits .
One goes outside to the small campus the other goes deeper into the building .
Neither goes to a tenable position , like the roof or anything that can be fortified .
Maybe I can convince some of the other faculty members - most whom have lived more than twice as many years as I and thus are ripe for noble and futile sacrifice - to try to battle the revenants .
With enough distractions between the undead and me , I 'm sure I can hide in the basement of the kitchen until all the heroic above are zombified and get bored enough to move on to a more populous area .
I will wait a while longer , at least until I run out of non-canned food .
Once that happens , I will steal the prep school 's bus and escape with as much canned food as I can .
On a conservative campus such as this , I hold out absolutely no hope for decent distance weapons .
There are some field hockey sticks in the storage area , but I have no interest in getting close enough to the zombies to use them .
One of my new coworkers keeps coughing through the speeches and lectures - a dry , hollow hack - and I wonder if she is one of the infected .
I 'm not about to check for bites or fresh wounds , for the viscous , black effluence that serves for the blood of these ghouls .
If she becomes one of the walking undead , I pray one of my colleagues will show her the mercy of a chair to the skull .
I just hope no one is fool enough to get bitten by her because it goes without saying that they can't be allowed to " live " to spread the Walking Plague .
I am not surprised that my mind drifts .
I am the only new faculty member , as well as being one of the youngest .
Yesterday , I was formally introduced and a staff member motioned for my attention so she could mouth that I have dimples .
Cuteness hardly correlates with professional respect , nor does it do much for my reputation that I cannot go by the last initial of my surname as is my fashion .
There was a Mr. Q who was recently fired and with apparent good reason , though no one feels the need to tell me what this reason is .
I imagine somewhere between serial arson and kiddy diddling given their vehemence .
I want to bring more boxes to my apartment and unpack rather than sit through further orientation .
I know enough about state and national educational policy from getting my Master 's , though I understand the need for these lectures .
The school paid for these faculty members to go to these conferences and classes and this is one way to get their money 's worth .
Possibly not the best way - the faculty members themselves want to keep their speeches short - but certainly a way .
Now if someone could discuss where the armory is and the best plans in case the dead should rise , I would be all ears .
The Bleach Apocalypse
" It will be an adventure , " I state , channeling someone more Pollyanna given the daunting task before us .
" Moving your furniture is not an adventure , " Zack informs me .
He looks at the rear window and asks the blueberry muffin none of us wished to eat for breakfast .
He responds in its stead in a quavering falsetto , " Nah , he 's right .
Now , please do n't eat me . "
We had appointed the muffin the mascot of our day and , in naming him Blueberry Muffin , assured that no one would eat him .
You can not eat something you name .
I try maintaining some external positivity to combat the hesitancy within .
I want all of this to feel right , to feel the spark of the divine patting me on the tapping my shoulder to tell me , " This is a part of your path . "
And it is , of course , simply by the fact that I am on it .
It does not mean that this is the right path , though it is a path I will be forced to continue to walk for a while longer by my amorphous contract .
Even if it is to move to a rent - free apartment , the time I spent moving while Emily was in Cozumel inspired an empty sort of sadness .
As every bit of minutiae so easy to confuse for life ( ten points for knowing the reference ) was purged from my apartment in Wappingers , put in boxes and taped shut , I felt a likewise vacancy spawning within my chest .
Carload by carload , I abandoned the life I built .
While it is likely for the best - almost certainly so given the state of my finances - it was something I built and something I topple over for an ambiguous opportunity .
I like the balance of Wappingers Falls , our countrified city or vice versa .
I like seeing my hometown finally getting its due through gentrification .
I like the proximity to culture or even a movie theater .
The closest movie theater to my Anemia apartment seems to be Wappingers Falls .
It is not the physical distance that bothers me as much as it is the responsibility into which I was duped .
One or two nights on call has turned into four as the administration realized I was actually moving on campus full time and abandoning my current apartment .
During a private meeting with two of the deans , I was told that I have to make sure I give all the boys in my dorm equal time if I invite one of them into my apartment .
The man went on for a few minutes , musing the permutations , before I cut him off and made it damned clear that the students are not now , nor will they ever be , allowed in my apartment .
That is my space and I am no more going to allow my students into my space now than I did as a substitute teacher .
One , doing so creates a very inappropriate relationship with people who do not understand the appropriate boundaries by their very natures .
Similarly , the parents will never get my home or cell numbers .
Two , I have no interest in anyone who does n't already know me touching my things .
I know the school prescreens these children and are well aware at the strictness of punishment at this school , but they are still teenagers and prone to bad choices .
Three , in a situation such as this , it is crucial that I keep my home space separate from my work space and do not commingle the two ; I need my sanctuary .
Four , Emily and I hang huge pentacles and death masks from our walls and I do not fancy the retired Catholic priest who hired me inquiring as to their purpose .
Far from being offended that I was so vehement , the dean seemed to be impressed that I gave a correct answer to a question I did n't know I had been asked .
Zack and Cristin prove adept at packing all of our furniture in the U - Haul .
As they come in for another load , they keep commenting how unnaturally clean the truck smells .
I had smelled it too , but none of us processed that there was no reason for anything in the truck to smell that way .
Nor did it make sense that the scent was growing stronger .
I am not sure who figured it out , though imagine that Cristin bumped against the hamper and found it a little too warm even given the unseasonable temperature that graced our day .
Emily had put the bottle of bleach in with the dirty clothes .
The bleach somehow decided that this was its one chance to shine , to have a night on the town and see new places , so it exploded .
I feel " exploded " is precisely the right term because one of my black t- shirts was not only white but in pieces .
Likewise , Emily 's cashmere sweater seemed to have encountered a burrowing cave mole with contagious albinism , who chewed a sizeable hole on its way to the brown earth .
The Bleach Apocalypse was , however , the worst thing that happened all day .
During lunch - the recompense to Zack , Cristin , and her brother for providing us their services as movers - I looked over at the young couple being seated next to us .
The blonde wife cooed at her small baby and I realized that she is a girl with whom I went on one unsuccessful date at Dutchess .
The years ' difference is obvious on her face .
She does not seem to recognize me , but I would n't expect her to .
Perhaps it is n't really the same girl and I simply project too much .
How strange to again cross paths with this acquaintance , both of us just beginning huge life changes .
I would not even know what to say to this girl in the best of situations , to say nothing of when I am unshowered , exhausted , and sweaty in the middle of my labor .
She would not have approached me when she was in the same situation .
As night falls in Anemia , I watch as our possessions fit into the tiny apartment , as the walls seem to flux and twist to accommodate furniture that seemed so much larger in my mind 's eye .
It wo n't be easy and will require creativity to make this look good , immediately evidenced by the useless diet books propping up our glass table so we can fit our TV underneath , but it is within our abilities .
Actually , as my teaching begins Monday , it will mostly be Emily 's skill as decorator .

Honeybees join the bomb squad
The latest advance in bomb - sniffing technology relies on simple devices — honeybees .
" Oh , yeah , there is a laugh factor there , " says entomologist Timothy Haarmann of Los Alamos ( N.M. ) National Laboratory .
" We walk into a room with security experts and say , ' We use bees , ' so they have to shift gears . "
But with defense researchers at places such as the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency focusing on anti-terrorism measures , scientists are looking at nature 's native soldiers , bees and wasps , to augment dogs widely used for bomb detection .
" Honeybees are as good as dogs , " Haarmann says .
The trick , it turns out , is training the little critters to detect bomb scents .
Some bees , exposed to the scents of bomb ingredients and rewarded with sugar water , get it right away .
Others wash out , a surprise given that insects are seen as automatons because their behavior is so uniform , Haarmann says .
So far , his team has trained bees to pick up the scent with their antennae and then flick their proboscises — a tubular feeding organ that extends from the mouth — when exposed to TNT , howitzer propellant and liquid - explosives ingredients at a level in the air of a few parts per trillion .
Bees are natural - born sniffers , antennae sensing pollen in the wind and tracking it down to the flowers that are a food source for their hives .
From the outside , a bee bomb - detection unit in practice would look like a plain box with a few air holes , perhaps stationed outside an airplane entrance ramp or train platform .
Strapped into straw - like tubes within the box , a sensing device already manufactured by the British firm Inscentinel Ltd. , rows of bees would be exposed to puffs of air , constantly checking for faint bomb smells .
A video camera tied to pattern - recognition software would signal when the bees suddenly start waving their proboscises in unison .
An open - air application with released bees may be used to detect land mines .
Analyzing where bees cluster using a laser device reveals the presence of mines in U.S. Army - funded field tests , says entomologist Jerry Bromenshenk of the University of Montana - Missoula .
Other research , Bromenshenk says , finds that bee behavior changes in the presence of toxic airborne chemicals .
Wasps , genetic cousins to bees , also have been proposed for bomb - sniffing duty .
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the University of Georgia last year unveiled a " wasp hound " device that relies on five strapped - in wasps to sniff out danger .
Insect sniffers may have uses in areas such as food quality , counterfeit - goods smuggling and even in detecting drug smugglers .
A colleague of Haarmann's , Los Alamos biochemist Kirsten McCabe , has trained bees to sniff out cocaine and methamphetamine .
" The really nifty thing is we are allowing Mother Nature to do the heavy lifting , " Haarmann says .
The recent publication of the honeybee genome in the journal Nature showed that bees have about five times more smell - related genes than flies do .
" I guess we got lucky , we picked the right insect , " Bromenshenk says .
" They are amazing critters . "

Trained to be sensitive to materials used in explosive devices , the bees ' reactions are captured by a camera and pattern - recognition software .
Mit 24 zu 16 Punkten endete ein Faustkampf zwischen Andrei Smirnov und einem nicht namentlich genannten Schwarzhändler in Moskau .
Laut MosNews ertappte Smirnov , der bei der Moskauer Software - Schmiede Cognitive Technologies arbeitet , den Piraten in einem Computermarkt beim Verkauf gebrannter CDs mit Cognitive - Software .
Nach Smirnovs Aufforderung , den Handel einzustellen , brach ein Gerangel aus , das der Wachdienst unterbrach .
Auf den Vorschlag , die Auseinandersetzung kurzerhand auf der Straße fortzuführen , ging Smirnov nicht ein .
Statt dessen trafen sich die Kontrahenten in einem Fitness - Center zu einem Fight über drei Runden zu drei Minuten , den Smirnov klar für sich entscheiden konnte .

Full time position for German speaking Linux admin with Docker and
Common Lisp experience near Frankfurt , Germany
We are a small German software shop based in Mainz , Germany , founded in
2000 .
We create custom software solutions for mid-size to big companies
in finance / payment , health care , and media research .
For some of our customers , we also cover operational aspects of the
software lifecycle by creating and running Docker containers in
development , test , and production environments on clusters of servers
running Apache Mesos .
Missing pieces of infrastructure are written in Common Lisp ( CL ) and
interact with existing software components of the cluster ( DNS , load
balancer etc. ) .
Docker images are based on the embedded Linux
distribution OpenWrt .
We are looking for new colleagues who ideally
– have 3 + years of Linux experience ( e.g. are fluent in shell scripting
and have a good overview of the GNU / Linux tools )
– have a working knowledge of Docker , its interaction with the host , and
the role of the container image
– have experience in Common Lisp ( not necessarily professional )
– want to use CL to solve systems engineering problems ( e.g. dynamic
load balancing , DNS re-configuration )
– are interested in mastering the OpenWrt build system ( buildroot +
make / cmake ) to create a secure in - container distribution
Experience in the mentioned areas is not as important as curiosity ,
intelligence and open - mindedness .
You will get the necessary time to
learn the missing skills .
We are interested in a long - term relationship
rather than just staffing a project with ‘ resources ’ .
Due to our size as a small company , we do care about each one of our
colleagues and react flexibly to the ( sometimes changing ) necessities of
their life .
Together we try to develop a plan for your personal career ,
depending on your own goals .
Curious ?

Как привлечь людей к себе на форум ?
Привет , около двух месяцев назад создал форум компьютерной тематики , пытался привлечь людей .
Заказывал контекстную рекламу на яндекс , вступил в баннерообенную сеть , писал друзьям по ICQ .
В результате на данный момент имею 627 пользователей и примерно 400 сообщений :(
Пишут мало .
Может кто подскажет какие есть особеености в раскрутке форумов ?
Ссылки на статьи или еще что -нибудь ?

Staff Sgt. Rony Theodore , 33 , of Brooklyn , N.Y. : " All of us want to change what we 're doing because we 're not doing very much . "
Sgt. Christopher Wiacik , 28 , of Livonia , Michigan : " It 's just a study group .

I think both sides will promise to get troops out and give timelines then , but not before .

It 's annoying .
You 're not motivated to help anybody .
I do n't want to live my life like this . "

U.S. soldiers are dying trying to help people who do n't want their help . "
Speaking on behalf of software engineers who have to interview prospective new hires , I can safely say that we 're tired of talking to candidates who can't program their way out of a paper bag .
If you can successfully write a loop that goes from 1 to 10 in every language on your resume , can do simple arithmetic without a calculator , and can use recursion to solve a real problem , you 're already ahead of the pack !

Malcolm Gladwell wrote in Outliers ,
Whether or not you 're in college , nothing is stopping you from contributing to an existing Open Source project .
One good way to start is to add unit or regression tests ; nearly all projects need them , but few projects have a good set of them , so your efforts will be greatly appreciated .
I suggest starting by adding a conformance test to the Wine project .
That 's great because it gives you exposure to programming both in Linux and in Windows .
Also , it 's something that can be done without a huge investment of time ; roughly 40 work hours should be enough for you to come up to speed , write a simple test , post it , address the feedback from the Wine developers , and repeat the last two steps until your code is accepted .
One nice benefit of getting code into an Open Source project is that when prospective employers
Google you , they 'll see your code , and they 'll see that it is in use by thousands of people , which is always good for your reputation .
Here 's another good quick reality check , one closer to my heart .
Last Change 4 Dec 2014
(C) Dan Kegel 2004,2005,2006,2011,2012,2014
Picture this : beside the electric toothbrushes at your local chemist , you can pick up complete kits of syringes , needles , cotton balls , lighters , rubber tying - off cords and cute stainless - steel spoons - all vacuum - sealed in plastic .
Just as you can request some high - strength cortisone cream to treat that pesky eczema on your shin , you can ask your GP for heroin .
Thus you can hand the pharmacist an NHS prescription for a two - week supply of commercial opiates ( let 's say Merck 's version is called Scagodrine ) , inviting nary a raised eyebrow .
As with all NHS prescriptions , your co-payment will only amount to about £ 6.50 .
You can walk out of the chemist with your Boots Home Works Kit and Scagodrine ( bagged into single dosages whose potency is printed on the box ) , and wave to the bobby on the corner .
He 'll wave back .
Are you , in your mind 's eye , scampering down to your nearest surgery for that prescription , and racing off to Boots ?
Perhaps you 're thinking , " Blimey , all this time I have n't been an intravenous drug addict because heroin is against the law !
If I would n't get arrested , I 'd spend every day in an apathetic swoon , alienate my friends and lose my job ! "
Most of us are n't heroin addicts because we do n't want to be heroin addicts .
Or coke heads or meth freaks .
The people who do want to be junkies are junkies .
Were hard drugs decriminalised , it 's dubious that consumption would appreciably rise .
Which is why Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies 's calling for the legalisation and regulation of hard drugs last week really should n't qualify as " brave " .
Nor should Lord Birt 's now partially leaked 2003 report on UK drug policy qualify as " controversial " .
The report 's assertions make common sense : for drug cartels , government seizures are merely a modest line - item in their budgets ; the " maximum " - meaning , farcically optimistic - estimate of drug seizures runs to 25 % of total supply .
Confiscation only serves to drive up the street price of hard drugs and so benefits their purveyors .
Therefore , even more effective narcotics enforcement would simply push users into stealing yet more DVD players to fund costlier habits .
Alas , common sense is in short supply on this matter .
The west 's prohibition approach to drugs is as entrenched as it is idiotic .
Davies and Birt are pissing in the wind .
So , by the way , am I .
But I 've nothing else to do this afternoon , so let 's fritter away my time .
It would be nice if everyone were happy and good .
If everyone were a productive member of society , reliably rising to greet the morning , bursting into song and eager for the day ahead .
If we all took such joy in the miracle of sheer being that it would never enter our heads to try to fuzzy up a single blade of grass .
But government can't manifest this healthy look - life - square - in - the - eye by fiat .
Frankly , most of us need to take the edge off once in a while - or put it on .
Get a buzz from a cup of coffee or a few drags of a fag .
Put our feet up with a glass of cabernet or sink into the sofa with a cognac before bed .
Plenty of folks in my boomer generation still suck on the odd spliff in the privacy of their living rooms , and the sky does n't fall when they do .
If most of us tinker with our consciousness on occasion , a subsection of our fellows finds raw reality not just hard to take , but unbearable .
Whether to induce exhilaration or oblivion , the compounds are out there to do the job , and these people , by hook or by crook , are going to get their mitts on those drugs .
There may be a set percentage of the population determined to throw their lives away .
Calling drug abuse a " victimless crime " may be a misnomer , for you can victimise yourself .
Be that as it may , we 've plenty of evidence by now that it costs a society far more to try to stop people from " self - medicating " than to let them .
It 's hard enough to protect people from each other ; it 's impossible to protect people from themselves .
Davies was dead sound in calling for an end to drug prohibition in the name of mere " harm reduction " .
There 's no good answer here .
But the costs of this puritanical thou - shalt - not are gobsmacking .
We 've delivered whole countries such as Afghanistan largely into the hands of crooks .
Internationally , we 've created a massive shadow economy out of the reach of the law .
On the US - Mexico border , murderous battles between rival drug gangs are getting so out of hand that this month Arizona and New Mexico declared states of emergencies .
In the UK alone , crimes committed by heroin and cocaine addicts to feed their habits come to £ 16bn a year .
We can take Vioxx off the market , but the appetite for pain relievers of the dodgy variety is not going to go away , no matter how many scary adverts run on television .
So deal with it .
Regulate drugs , tax them , monitor them , just like alcohol .
You 'd take preying on that appetite away from elements that have grown so powerful that they constitute rival governments .
You 'd have far few drug - related deaths , because the product would be pure , its potency established .
You 'd clear prisons of people guilty of nothing more than wanting to feel different , and you 'd free up the police force to go after people who actually want to hurt somebody else .
You 'd take the cultural shine off drugs altogether , depriving them of their furtive cachet .
Isolated European experiments with more liberal drug policies have poorly tested the premise that prescription beats proscription .
When a single country such as the Netherlands loosens its narcotics laws while its neighbours continue to pursue punitive ones , naturally the country becomes a magnet for wasters , and there goes the neighbourhood .
A Europe - wide rethink would spread the wasters around .
Yet as for working out the details of a legal distribution scheme that would effectively result in " harm reduction " , why bother ?
Davies was wasting his breath , Birt his paper - as I am wasting yours .
I cannot imagine a rational , pragmatic approach to drugs in the western world evolving in my lifetime .
Davies 's proposal was sane , it was welcome ; it was also self - destructive .
Fellow Lib Dems rushed to clarify that he was not promoting party policy .
And these are Lib Dems !
Can you envisage an American presidential candidate going out on a limb to advocate that the US decriminalises heroin ?
That 's right , with pigs flying merrily overhead , and hell freezing below .

これでは日記か落書きではないかと思う水準の記述が目について唖然とした。思想家や政治家については、書き手の個人的な好悪も見え隠れする。これでいいなら書き込む側は気楽だろうが、「百科事典」という名称は混乱を招く。「メモ書き掲示板」といった定義をするほうがいい。それなら、読むほうもあやまった幻想を抱かずにすむ。
研究所や大学、大手企業ではネットの事典サービスや情報サービスを組織として契約しているところもあり、所属している間は有料の情報資源を日常的に比較参照できる。そうした立場にない場合は、信頼できるレファランスサービスにあたれないとしたらまずい。これでは情報格差を埋めるより、拡大することになってしまう。私も、ウィキペディアはそれとして、別に本格的なオープンレファランスの企画があるべきだという意見に賛成する。ちゃんとした運営であれば執筆者として参加したい。

専門の労働史関係は、項目の絶対数が少ない上に、不正確な事実が記されていたり、内容的に不十分な記述が目立ちます。その限りでは「問題あり」に近い立場です。ただ現にある労働組合組織の解説など、現状に関する情報提供を主とする項目は、役員氏名など、活字本にくらべ、より新しい事実が記されているようです。全体として玉石混淆、ただし石の方が多いなーという印象をもちます。
批判するなら執筆に参加せよという意見は正論だと思いますが、無署名で、後の執筆者が自由に編集できるシステムでは、私自身は参加することに躊躇があります。国際的に展開されているもので日本だけでこうした仕組みを変えることは難しいでしょう。ウィキペディアとは別のオンライン百科辞典の企てがあっても良いのではないかと考えます。

同様の指摘が出ていたが、断片的な知識の貼り合わせ以上にはなっておらず、「内容」というにも足りない。この分野はとくにまだ項目だけというものも多い。ウィキペディアが発表している「項目数」を無批判に受け止めて既存の辞典類と比較することはひかえる必要があるだろう。
さらにいえば、信頼するに足るといえる内容を構築し、それを維持していくためには、現在の書き込みの仕組みに根本的な限界があると考えざるを得ない。学問的な観点からみて精密な内容をアップしても、それらは自由に書き換えられてしまう。これでは責任をもった参加の仕方ができないし、充分な知識をもった執筆者に意欲をうながすものとは到底いえない。最低限、本人同定がおこなえるしっかりした登録制度をつくり、署名執筆の原則を導入することを強く勧めたい。

私 もWikipedianのひとりですので、純粋に客観的なことはいえないのですが、伝統芸能に関して述べますと、｢能｣は、きちんとしています。ほか、｢浄瑠璃｣｢地歌｣｢河東節｣など、専門家の手がはいったと思われる信頼に足る記事があります。（名前をあげた項目は、私自身が執筆にかかわらなかったものです）
伝統芸能に関してはいわゆる｢あらし｣がはいりにくいということもあり、しっかりするのだと思うのですが、歴史上の人物関係記事には、かならずといっていいほど鄙説がはいってまいります。小説、ゲームなどの影響が多いのでしょう。これはある意味おもしろい事象だと私は思います。つまり、「人は、自由に書ける場で、なぜこのように書きたがるのか（なにを信じたがり、なにを信じさせようとするのか）｣という興味をもって読んでおります。

The head of the software giant told the BBC that its ambition is to be bigger than Google in search .
He said that competition had ultimately been good for web users because it had pushed search technology .
This meant search would be " far better " in a year .
The next decade looks even better , he said , with a lot more advances in software technology ahead .
" The beauty of software is that we are always making breakthroughs .
We will have more in the next 10 years than we have had on the last 30 , " he said in an exclusive BBC interview .
Mr Gates said he saw Microsoft 's strengths lying in search , but also in its software that provides the glue to make different devices talk to each other so that people can have more power over their content .
Our success is overwhelmingly greater than theirs [ Apple 's ] is - they are learning from us every step of the way and we are learning from them
Bill Gates , Microsoft
But he stressed that Google was not the only threat it faced in the long term .
It had competition in every arena , from the likes of Nokia , Sony and Apple , but that was something with which Microsoft had become accustomed .
More to do
He admitted Apple had had the biggest bite out of the digital music business with its iPod and iTunes success , and wished that Microsoft and its device partners had a bigger share .
But he stressed that , in most part , Microsoft was not about making devices .
" Our success is overwhelmingly greater than theirs [ Apple 's ] is - they are learning from us every step of the way and we are learning from them , " he said .
Microsoft is still about making PC technology work for people , with software being at the centre of it to " help people out . "
Although software has been his life 's work , Mr Gates said that the PC of today is still not the PC he dreamed about 30 years ago however , and that was a challenge he would continue to pursue .
TV will be redefined so that the shows can be when you want them .
They can be personalised ; when you see the news it will on the topics you care about
Bill Gates , Microsoft
Although there were a billion PCs , that was still very different to having six billion in the world and that they was still more to be done to make them much smarter .
" They can do lots of things , but still you can't talk to them , and that is one of the things we will get this decade , " he predicted .
" So being part of really getting that ultimate tool that empowers you , lets you achieve your potential , lets you pursue your curiosity - there is nothing more fun than making that 100 % true . "
Playing in the home
What was becoming ever more important to the company was providing the glue that makes it easy to get one device to talk to another , particularly in the home .
With more broadband penetration , Mr Gates said he still saw the PC as the device through which people could organise and share their digital content , such as photos and music .
He sees Microsoft 's role as critical in helping to change people 's lifestyle in the home , for example , making " digital memories " easily accessible .
Microsoft offers more than just software
" TV will be redefined so that the shows can be when you want them .
They can be personalised ; when you see the news it will on the topics you care about , " he said .
But it is also an evolving arena which is embracing gaming and other types of content much more , as well as video , music and TV .
The Xbox 360 , released in November in the US and December in Europe and Japan , joins the media centre as part of Microsoft 's effort to provide people a hub through which they can organise and share their content .
" The whole family home can be connected together so it is easy to see your photos on different screens in the house , and easier to get the music wherever you go . "
Longer term
Looking ahead , the strategy Microsoft is taking to remain a dominant player relies on work being done in its global research laboratories .
" It 's based on the long - term approach we 've taken in investing in things like speech recognition so you can talk to your phone , or visual recognition so that if a phone takes a picture of a sign in a foreign language we can translate for you , " Mr Gates said .
" We are stronger than ever because we have a research lab in Cambridge , we have one now in China , one in India and that is where the top problems in computer science are going to be solved . "
Sometimes people ask me how I find time to go learn new stuff .
Here 's the answer : you make time .
Nobody ever likes that kind of answer , but we all know it 's the real one .
My brother Dave put on some pretty serious weight after he graduated from high school .
He 'd gone from playing varsity football to working two jobs and going to college full time .
It did n't help that one of his jobs was pizza delivery , and the other was waiting tables .
Soon he was a fat , fat kid .
Went from a buck - eighty to a deuce and a half , at least , maybe a deuce sixty .
One day he saw a truck with a bumper sticker on it that said : " Lose weight now , ask me how ! "
So he pulled up next to the truck at the next stoplight , and said to the two cowboy - types in it : " How do I lose weight ? "
They yelled back : " Just lose weight , ya fat pig !
Haw haw haw HAW HAW HAW HAW ! " and then drove off .
Dave was sad about this advice for a brief while , but eventually he brightened up , because he did know how to lose weight .
Cripes , he 'd been a champion varsity football player two years prior .
It 's not like there 's any magic to it .
He went and bought a mountain bike , started riding the crap out of it , joined a gym , watched what he ate , and lost about 85 pounds over the next year .
I was 145 pounds 2 years ago today , after a similar 2 - year diet and exercise kick that took me down from a deuce and a half myself .
Then I fell off the wagon — it happens — and put on 50 pounds over the next 2 years .
It sucks , but there 's no magic .
Two months ago I finally started going to the gym every day , 7 days a week , and my legs are sore every day .
My weight has n't improved at all yet .
But it will .
You just have to work at these things consistently .
But you knew that , did n't you ?
This is n't a self - help blog , by the way .
I 'm not in that business .
I 'm not here to help , since I do n't actually know the answers .
I 'm just here to rant , and pose occasional questions .
It 's what I do , when I 'm not doing other stuff .
I do n't know why I blog .
I 'm just compelled ; it just happens whether I like it or not .
Do n't read too much into my blogs .
My opinions change from day to day .
The only things I 've learned , the only universal constants , are that I do n't know very much , and that public whale explosions are just about the funniest thing human beings can experience during our stay on Earth .
I do n't know why that is , either .
Today 's blog is truly a rant ; I just need to get this particular one off my chest , so my gym partner Todd can listen to me rant about something different next week .
We all have to choose how to spend the time we 're given .
If you do n't choose , it just slips right by you .
I know .
On a trip to Vegas not too long ago , I made a pit stop in a casino restroom , and as I was washing my hands , there was this older guy there , also washing his hands .
On a whim , I asked , " Hey man , how old are you ?
" His reply ?
" Seventy - two !
I have a son : I remember the day he was born like it was yesterday !
I was holding him just like so .
Well , guess what , he turned 40 years old just last week !
It goes by in a flash !
Before long , you 'll be lookin ' at THIS ! "
He pointed at his wrinkled mug , and concluded his monologue with : " Haw , haw , haw !
HAW HAW HAW * cough * * cough * HAW * cough * * hack * HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW ! " and walked out .
I think I made his day , although I can't exactly say he made mine .
When you graduate from college ( or high school , for that matter ) , you have a simple choice facing you .
You can either keep learning , or you can stop .
There is an almost unbelievably easy heuristic for knowing whether you 're learning .
It goes like this : no pain , no gain .
Learning is hard .
If it 's easy , then you 're coasting ; you 're not making yourself better at something fundamentally new that you could n't do before .
In other words , it 's just like working out .
You 've gotta mix it up .
If you 're sore every day , then you 're getting good workouts ( assuming you can tell the difference between " good " soreness and " injury " soreness ; if you 're not sure , go ask a professional . )
When you do study , there 's a lot of appeal to studying what you already know , because it 's less painful .
And of course to become an expert at any field , you have to focus on it pretty hard for a long time .
But cross -training is well established in sports ; you do n't typically become a world - class baseball player by just playing baseball all the time .
You have to do other kinds of workouts and exercises to maximize your strength , agility and endurance gains .
Cross - training improves you every bit as rapidly in other disciplines .
That includes programming .
If you 're cranking out code as easily as breathing , then if you 're getting better at all , it 's so gradual that you 'd never notice it happening .
You wo n't have great insights until you get new perspectives from working hard , even if only occasionally , at stuff other than what you already know .
Being in school full - time is an amazing luxury , one that 's hard to appreciate when you 're actually there , because learning is painful .
But trust me on this one : it 's even more painful when all you have is scraps of time here and there .
While you 're in school , assuming you make a reasonable effort at applying yourself once in a while , you learn a fantastic amount , and you learn it at a fantastic rate .
Later you 'll learn at a slower rate ; it 's pretty much guaranteed .
Non-educational activities will inevitably intrude and consume the majority of your time .
Hence the choice .
After you graduate , you can either learn a little , or not at all .
If you 're in the " not at all " camp , well you 've made your choice , and I respect it .
You 'll probably be happier than I am .
I 'm tormented by how slowly I have to move as a programmer .
I now believe programming languages have failed .
All of them .
The programming world is a giant body shop , and we 're building huge pyramids with millions of years of hard labor .
I believe that stuff should be easier than it is , and it pisses me off that most people are so content with the state of the art , because it means they 're not helping make it better .
To me , mainstream languages have failed because they 're still fundamentally serial , fundamentally early von Neumann , fundamentally single - box languages .
They 're all vying for the position of " least crappy " , and the current winner ( whether it 's Python , Ruby , Lisp , name your favorite ) is just that : the least crappy .
Because they 're all focused on finding more elegant ways to express mostly - serial computations for crap computers .
That , or faking parallelism poorly with threads , if the language supports them at all .
Sure , there have been some interesting attempts at parallel languages .
Erlang is one of the better - known ones , and it 's actually quite cool .
But Erlang has failed too , because you have n't heard of it .
Our industry is in a seriously ugly position , right now , as we speak .
Most of the hardware designers are focused on keeping Moore 's Law going , because that 's where the money is .
They want that doubling every 18 months .
Today it 's probably quite within our reach to get 10 x every 18 months , if we 'd agree to focus on parallelism ( in the massively distributed computing sense . )
But programmers like XML , to the point of focusing on it to an unhealthy extent .
Same with C++. And Java .
They like these things because they work , and because they like to minimize the amount of crap they have to learn .
Because learning is painful .
Remember ?
You might think I 've gone way off track , off the deep end , even , but this is the same thread .
Let 's face it : a parallel language will have to be radically different if it's to break free of the von Neumann Turing - machine rat race we 're in .
If we move to cellular automata , or in fact any other parallel computational model that 's resilient to node failures , then we 'll need a new language , because the current serial languages will perform badly , or be horribly hard to manage , or both .
Cell or grid ( or whatever ) parallel computing will have a radically different internal economy .
It 'll need new data structures , new algorithms , new instruction sets , new everything .
You do realize that John von Neumann was an economist , right ?
Among ( many ) other things , he was an economist , and it influenced the design of his first computer , that one right there on your desk .
The computing machine JvN built was created in an environment very similar to the one in the movie Apollo 13 , where the folks at Houston had to build a carbon - dioxide remover out of exactly the free junk available on the spacecraft , and then explain it to the crew so they could build their own copy of it .
Johnny went out collected a bunch of engineers : materials engineers , electrical engineers , mechanical engineers , everyone who had some spare junk .
They came up with a design for a computation machine that just barely sufficed , one that could be built out of the crap they had available at the time : vacuum tubes , magnetic drums , wire , duct tape .
As he was creating this thing , Johnny was focusing on what he was calling the " internal economy " of the resulting machine .
Secondary storage accesses were painfully slow .
Memory accesses were faster .
Register accesses were very fast .
And so on .
So he designed representations , data structures , and algorithms that were appropriate for that particular machine , the one he was building from spare parts .
If he'd made the machine out of Brazilian rainforest army ants , or mechanical gears , or falling dominoes with marionettes to pick them up again , his data structures and algorithms would have been very , very different .
There are some commonalities , sure — you need numbers , and arithmetic , and functions , and data storage , and sorting , and so on .
But what 's most efficient for army ant computers is n't going to be most efficient for vacuum tube computers .
You do realize you can make a computing machine out of just about anything , right ?
And they do n't all have to work like Turing machines do .
Turing was one of the greatest geniuses of the century , but he'd have been the first person to tell you that there are infinitely many machine designs capable of the same computations .
His was just one model , and his professor 's ( which led to Lisp ) was just one other model .
But who 's to say they 're the best models ?
Some computing machines are more efficient at certain computations than others .
Some are more practical to build than others .
Some are faster than others .
Some are more robust , or more inherently parallel .
You do realize that your brain is such a machine , right ?
And that it 's 100,000 times faster than today 's computers at pattern - matching tasks , because while JvN 's machine operates serially , your neurons can all fire independently .
Let me give you a hint : your brain 's operating system is n't written in C ++.
Is our industry ever going to get out of this amazing backwater of a gridlock , this evolutionary dead - end we 're in , where we programmers act like army ants , churning out loops and SOAP calls and UML diagrams as if we 're weaving cloth with the very fabric of the computational universe ?
If it ever happens , and by God I hope to witness it in my lifetime , then the computers and languages and data structures and algorithms are all going to have to change simultaneously .
Because a language optimized for a serial computer will perform like crap along some important dimension of performance , probably more than one .
But we can't switch wholesale to parallel languages either , because they 'll perform like crap on today 's computers : again , for some value of " perform " that 's not worth discussing here , but it 'll be some form of either computer - performance or people - performance .
And programmers are nothing if not fanatically obsessed with performance .
Kinda ironic , huh ?
Half the irony stems from knowing that there are far more productive languages out there than the ones most of us are using .
But most of them perform poorly on our hardware , because these languages are targeting meta-virtual machines , typically " defined " ( informally ) by the capabilities of the language itself .
And if you 're not targeting exactly the hardware you 're on , the impedance mismatch will slow the language down .
That 's the problem with most JVM languages other than Java : they need hardware ( think ants ! anything can be hardware ! ) to support operations like long - jumps and tail - call optimization , but the JVM does n't export those facilities as part of its abstract machine definition .
Same goes for Lisp .
It ca n't get the performance break it deserves because the hardware available today is n't a Lisp machine .
They 've built them , and I can assure you that C++ would be the loser slug of a language on a Lisp machine .
But , alas , performance is n't the only thing programmers care about .
They also care about not having to learn anything new .
That 's the other half of the irony .
Programmers are obsessed with performance , and they 'll go to almost any length to fiddle with their algorithms and data representations in order to eek every last cycle and byte from their programs .
Any length , that is , except for learning a new language on new hardware .
Even if it would get them a thousand - X performance improvement for the same productivity .
Or a 1000 x productivity improvement for the same performance .
Because they do n't want to learn anything hard .
No gain , no pain , problem solved .
And that 's where we 're at .
Moore 's Law is crap .
If we ever want to be 10 x as productive and computationally efficient , let alone 1000x , then our whole computing model will have to change at once .
Nothing else will do .
The incremental approaches have all failed .
It 's got to be a revolutionary change .
If everything changes all at once , that 's going to pose a bit of a problem for the folks on the Zero Learning curve , would n't you say ?
Do n't freak out and mail me about this , either , because I 'm a pessimist now , at least about this particular topic , and I doubt we 'll ever get out of our rut .
We 're ignoring the First Law of Holes .
You do realize that John von Neumann spent the last 10 years of his life singlehandedly developing a theory of computing based on cellular automata ?
The computer you 're reading this blog rant on was his frigging prototype !
He was going to throw it out and make a better one !
And then he died of cancer , just like my brother Dave did , just like so many people with so much more to give and so much more life to live .
And we 're not making headway on cancer , either , because our computers and languages are such miserable crap .
You have no idea the pain I feel when I sit down to program .
I 'm walking on razor blades and broken glass .
You have no idea the contempt I feel for C++ , for J2EE , for your favorite XML parser , for the pathetic junk we 're using to perform computations today .
There are a few diamonds in the rough , a few glimmers of beauty here and there , but most of what I feel is simply indescribable nausea .
Are you beginning to see why I prefer to work with programmers who stay on the Upward Curve after they get out of school ?
Because even while we 're grubbing around in the dirt — just a sorry bunch of illiterate , innumerate cavemen , here in the very heart of the Stone Age of programming — at least these upward - curve programmers give me some hope .
Hope that if something better comes along , they 'll give it a try , a serious try , the old college try .
Or hope , even , that they 'll build that " something better " with me .
Fat chance .
But hope can keep ya going for a good long while .
It 's all still fun , though .
Broken glass and razor blades are n't so bad , when I think about how much worse my lot in life could be , had I been born in a different time or place .
I 've got it pretty good , and so have you , in all probability .
At my current jobthey feed us and massage us like Kobe cows , and I 'm surrounded by unbelievably brilliant people , all way smarter than me , and we 're doing great stuff together .
Make no mistake : my blog whining is all relative to a totally imaginary future , one which in all likelihood , should it ever come to pass , will be filled with even more whining about totally imagined new futures .
It 's just in our nature to whine .
But really , I have no complaints .
I put a lot of stock in fun .
And family .
And trying to live my life in such a way that I wo n't have any major regrets when the game 's over .
So there 's the first part of my schedule : having fun .
If you want to be on an upward curve , just make some time for it , and make it a habit .
That 's all there is to it .
It does n't matter if you 're trying to get better at programming , or math , or fitness , or flying kites , or even humanity 's Number One Fear , even worse than the fear of Death : public speaking .
You just work your way up , a little at a time .
I can't promise you any satisfaction from the upward curve .
You 'll get better at a lot of things , and you 'll have plenty of interesting insights .
You may even get a better job , or build some software that makes you famous , or just have more fun at what you do .
But you wo n't have much time for television .
Something will have to give .
We all have to choose how to play our time , and it's a zero - sum game .
If , like me , you 're dissatisfied with the current state of affairs , well , believe you me , you can find a lot of consolation in a book on math , or machine learning , or compiler construction , or on just about anything that promises to help in some small way .
You do have to learn to put up with the pain of learning , though , and make it a habit to push yourself a little each day .
As far as the actuals go , well , you 'll just have to find an approach that works for you personally .
You might only be able to devote one quiet hour a week to studying , but like unit testing , or working out , or brushing your teeth , it 's better than not doing it at all .
Just try to have fun , and hopefully the rest will fall into place .
NotesPermit me to assure you that I do not ever speak in any way for my current employer .
Like , do n't you even think it for one second .
They 're them , I 'm me , and let 's leave it at that .
In fact , I do n't even work there .
My friend does .
And neither me nor my friend speaks for them .
OK ?
OK .
Gather the ingredients .
Spray an 8 - ounce microwave - safe mug or cup with nonstick cooking spray .
Drop the eggs , milk , and sour cream right into the cup and mix with a fork until blended .
Add salt and pepper or any other herbs or spices you 'd like to taste .
Then stir in the add-ins , if using .
Microwave the egg mixture for 2 minutes for an 800 to a 1000 - watt oven ( most of them today ) , 2 1/2 minutes for a 600 - watt oven , or 3 minutes for a 400 - watt oven .
If you like fluffier eggs , remove the mug from the microwave and stir after 1 minute , then return and finish cooking .
You may have to experiment to find the right time for your oven .
The omelet should puff up over the top of the cup , then it will retreat somewhat when you take it out of the microwave .
The eggs should register 165 F on a food thermometer .
( You 'll only need to test it once ; after that , the time should be the same as long as you keep the ingredient amounts the same . )
Sprinkle with a bit more cheese , let stand for 1 minute , then eat !
I spent the weekend on an emergency trip to CA to visit my little brother Kevin , who 's in the hospital with a burst appendix .
It 's a little worse and a little more complicated than that , but it looks like he 'll be OK .
He's in the UC Davis Medical Center , where my family 's been spending an awful lot of time lately .
Last year my dad had one of his kidneys removed there , on account of a tumor they found inadvertently ( and very luckily ) during a routine checkup .
As if that were n't bad enough , a few months later he stopped in again because he had a terrible stomach ache ; an hour later he was in open - heart surgery , getting a triple bypass .
And now his 17 - year - old son Kevin is spending another 2 weeks in the same hospital , for the second time in the last 2 months .
They 're really getting to know the place .
I was chatting with my dad ( who also goes by Steve Yegge ) while Kevin was sleeping .
Dad mentioned he 'd written a letter to the hospital staff after his bypass surgery , and that it had made quite an impression on them .
At least one of the nurses told him she 'd cried when she read it .
The hospital director sent Dad a personal reply , saying his letter was being used to drive a massive new program to improve the patient experience at UC Davis Medical Center .
I figured it was your typical grumpy irate - customer letter ; Dad 's been known to write them before ( and so have I ) .
But it turns out to be something altogether different : it 's his retelling of his bypass - surgery experience , written in gentle good humor , specifically from the perspective of a patient , which is something hospitals probably do n't see very often .
It 's a good read , and only takes about ten minutes .
I 'm posting it here because I think you might like it , and because I think it has some lessons we can all take away .
First lesson : the pen is still mightier than the sword .
A thoughtful , carefully written essay can carry great weight .
It can be a greater impetus for change than any number of email exchanges or hallway conversations .
If you want to make an impression on people , an essay still appears to be the most powerful way to do it .
Second , I think Dad 's experience is ( unintentionally ) a metaphor for our Amazon customers ' experience .
We 're all working on this huge , well - oiled machine , and when things go wrong , we respond quickly and professionally .
We have tickets , and order backlogs , and charging errors , all manner of bugs and issues that we fix daily .
But I 'll bet you 're rarely thinking of them as customers as you do your prioritizing and triage .
A hundred broken orders might seem like a very small number , but that 's a hundred people whose lives are impacted to some extent .
Finally , it 's a pretty sobering reminder that you need to monitor your health and take good care of yourself .
It 's easy to forget about your health as the weeks and months roll by here at work .
But get those checkups !
Both times my dad went to the hospital last year , it saved his life .
Here 's Dad 's letter :
An Open Letter To The Medical Staff
Of UC Davis Medical Center by Steve Yegge
This is really no big deal ...
As a 53 - year - old husband and father , I am the proud new owner of one of your latest 2003 Model Triple Bypasses .
I 'd like to share with you the story of my brief stay at the Medical Center , as well as what I 've learned from the experience .
It all started out innocuously enough .
I was out running some errands one afternoon late last month , when I decided to stop by the Emergency Room to register a complaint about some severe heartburn that I could n't seem to kick .
With tons of people in the waiting area , I suspected I might be there awhile .
But , I was pleasantly surprised to be ushered into the back room as a VIP .
The attendant said something like , " This is really no big deal .
We just want to make sure that it 's not your heart . "
What I heard him say was , " You just said the magic words , Gonzo , to bypass all those losers in the waiting room and go to the head of the line . "
Before you could say , " An apple a day ... " , I had the uneasy feeling I was being wired for light and sound .
I said to the nurse , " I can't help but notice that you 've just hooked me up to a Chevy engine analyzer . "
She responded with something like , " This is really no big deal .
This is an EKG that will monitor your heart function . "
What I heard her say was , " Settle down , Big - Boy , we 're going to see how many volts we can pump through your chest before you black out . "
Things get a little confused at this point as there was a flurry of activity thereafter and I was rolled into a holding cell with a coat rack next to me .
Another nurse hung a sack on the coat rack and started swabbing my arm intently with grain alcohol .
She then produced a needle from somewhere - presumably a holster - and started slapping my bound arm with her other hand .
Slightly alarmed , I said , " What 's that ? "
She said something like , " This is really no big deal .
I 'm just starting an IV . "
What I heard her say was , " If I 'm not mistaken , if I leave this rubber thingy around your arm long enough , and then jab you with a needle , you 'll pop .
Let 's find out . "
No less than forty - seven doctors came in over the next half hour and asked me the same questions about my heartburn , frowned , and then left .
Finally , a woman who was obviously in charge came in and told me she was going to do an angiogram .
I said - with something more than trepidation - " I 'm hoping that involves Maalox . "
The most notable things here are as follows .
My wife says that I always call angiograms " anagrams " .
Now , I know what an anagram is , but I was n't too sure about angiograms .
As I recall , the doctor said something like , " This is really no big deal .
We insert a tube into your heart to see how it 's functioning . "
What I heard her say was , " Quit your bellyaching , Numbskull , or we wo n't use Novocain on your ribs . "
At this point , for the sake of brevity and ease of reading , I 'd like to substitute the term ' TIRNBD ' for the phrase ' This is really no big deal ' .
The doctor went on to say something like , " TIRNBD .
But , I need to tell you all of the things that could go wrong . "
The list seemed to go on forever and ranged from gout and rabies , to my head exploding , after which she said something like , " Sign here in triplicate - just for our records . "
What I heard her say was , " Prick your finger and put your mark on this puppy , Loser .
You wo n't be able to do so after the fact . "
Feeling a little more than confused and nervous , I was surprised when a woman came into my cell and said she was my Social Worker .
I thought , " Wow !
A guy with indigestion gets a Social Worker !
What do you suppose they give the guys who are going to have a brain transplant or something ? ! "
The Social Worker said something like , " TIRNBD .
But , is there anyone in the waiting room that I could speak to ? "
What I heard her say was , " Can I notify your next of kin ? "
When I responded that there was no one out there , that I had driven myself to the ER , she looked at me in momentary disbelief , blinked twice and said something like , " Oh . Well , is there someone I can call ? "
What I heard was , " I hate giving the survivors this kind of information over the phone . "
Someone jerked off my shoes and pants - without so much as a kiss on the cheek - and proceeded to swab me with red Coolaid .
I said to the closest medic , " Excuse me .
But , I can't help but notice that you 're shaving my testicles .
With abandon !
You started out with my chest .
But , you seem to have worked your way down into the nether regions , as it were .
And , as much as I appreciate the gesture , if I could get you to concentrate on something closer to my clavicle than my sacroiliac , we might both get out of this with our reputations intact . "
I went on , " I should point out that at any moment someone is likely to come running through that door with a flask of Milk of Magnesia and a teaspoon and we would n't want to give them the wrong impression here . "
She responded with something like , " TIRNBD .
I 'm just preparing you for the angiogram . "
What I heard her say was , " We failed to mention that the tube we stick in your heart is actually 36 inches in diameter . "
I was wheeled into a room where no one would touch me without putting on rubber gloves and a mask , which was slightly disconcerting .
And , I was laid out on a bench the width of a sawhorse .
Someone said , " Count backwards from ... " and that 's the last thing I remember .
I awakened some indeterminate time later , attempted to clear my head , and took stock of the situation .
I had more pipes and wires coming out of me than a Borg warrior .
My first thought was , " Man , these anagrams are more complex than I thought ! "
I tried to reach up to pull a few pipes out of my face and discovered that I was hogtied to some kind of a large chair .
About a day later , and after numerous attempts , I was able to convey to the nurse in attendance that I wanted to write something on a tablet .
He loosened my restraints somewhat , gave me a pencil and pad on which I wrote - without any reservation whatsoever - " I 'm a little scared . "
He ciphered it for awhile and then said something like , " Oh . You 're scared .
Well , TIRNBD .
You 've gone through the hard part .
You 're in recovery now . "
What I heard was , " Too bad , Cowboy , I 'm holding the ropes . "
Each passing day , someone new would come in and say something like , " We 're going to be removing XX tubes from your body . "
I would respond with the mother of all understatements , " I 'm a little nervous . "
And , they would invariably say something like , " TIRNBD .
You may feel a tug and it may be unpleasant for moment , but that 's all . "
What I would hear is , " Find a leather belt to bite down on , Bubba , cuz this one 's gonna make your eyes water . "
I was moved to the sixth floor somewhere .
And , over the next several days , plague and pestilence was visited upon me in the form of psychological torture - or at least , that 's what I thought at the time .
As an example , a nurse would come in , day or night , and say , " I hear you 're a hard stick " ; meaning , " from which to draw blood " .
I would respond with , " I may be running low .
Is there a test for that ? "
And , she would say something like , " Well , TIRNBD .
We 'll try to get it in one . "
What I would hear was , " Do n't hold your breath , Bad Boy , there are more needles where this one came from . "
Another example of the psychological torture was the night nurse coming in every four minutes to shine a bright light in my face and say , " I need to take your vital signs . "
I would respond with , " No need .
I can tell you categorically they are diminishing rapidly . "
She would say something like , " Well , TIRNBD .
It will only take a moment . "
And , the phrase " TIRNBD ' started to sound very much like " Well , tough luck , Bonehead " - at least to me .
About day five , the apparent Lead Doctor came early , shook me awake and said , " I 'm going to remove the pacing wires from you now . "
I felt cold and said , " I 'm very nervous about this . "
And , he responded ( without eye contact ) with something like , " TIRNBD .
It will only take a few moments . "
What I heard him say was , " I 'm going to give these wires here a jerk and see if I can yank them out of your chest without your heart popping out at the same time . "
On day six , I was exhausted and elated at the same time .
I was going home .
I was actually standing at the window looking out to the parking lot for my wife 's car - longingly - when the point of the angiogram into my femoral artery burst and began to fill my groin and leg with blood .
I fell back on the bed , hit the call button , and was attended immediately by a nurse , then the cardiac doctor , and finally a vascular surgeon .
He said something like , " TIRNBD .
Happens in a certain percentage of cases .
But , we 'll have to close that with some superglue and keep you another day . "
I managed to hold off crying until everyone was gone and my wife had arrived .
The next morning the cardiac assemblage of doctors swept through , gave me a once over and said something like , " As far as we 're concerned you can go home . "
What I heard was , " Do n't get too excited .
We 're just students here , Stinky . "
Later that morning , the vascular assemblage of doctors came in and gathered around my bed .
The head one said something like , " We 're here to check the healing progress of your femoral artery . "
What I heard her say was , " I 'm going to expose your genitals for the amusement of myself and my colleagues here because I can't think of anything more humiliating to do to you at this particular time . "
When I did n't respond , she proceeded with the examination .
When the first set of hands touched me , I jerked involuntarily and she asked , " Is it painful ? " I said , " It 's tender .
But , I 'm just a little skittish about the number of stethoscopes in my crotch at any one time before noon . "
They finished speaking - in tongues , I think - and she said , " Well , as far as we 're concerned , you can go home today . "
Elation !
Again !
I was going home !
I was overjoyed .
But , the feeling was short - lived .
The Lead Doctor came in about an hour later and said , " Everything looks good .
I 'll get the vascular and cardiac teams in here for a final look . "
I said , " They 've already come and gone .
Both said I could go home today ! "
He responded with something like , " Well , let me make sure everyone is on the same page . "
What I heard was , " TIRNBD . "
Distraught is too simple a word to describe my feelings .
It was closer to panic .
I began to hyperventilate .
I could n't stay another day .
I would n't stay another day .
I got up and sat in the furthest corner of the room away from the bed .
When the nurse came in to take my vitals and draw blood , I refused .
I did n't want to be touched .
They called for a Staff Nurse and I pictured Nurse Ratchet and a couple of Bouncers walking through the door at any moment .
The Staff Nurse - not at all like Nurse Ratchet , as it turns out - presented herself and said something like , " We have n't received your discharge orders from the doctor yet .
The process after that for leaving the hospital is minimal and can be expedited . "
What I heard her say was , " Get back in that bed before I slap you silly , Bonzo .
We 've got more work to do on your pitiful body . "
When I did n't respond , she asked , very simply , " Is something wrong ? "
My eyes started to water and I said , " Well , let 's just take stock of the situation here , if you have a moment .
" I came in here a week ago with a tummy ache .
I was then shunted off into some Orwellian nightmare that just kept getting worse .
I was asked if I had a ' living will ' , sawed up from head to toe and my parts rearranged .
" I 've got a sore in my nostril from one of the pipes you stuck in me and a sore in my mouth from another one .
I 've had pipes in my abdomen , some kind of a pencil holder stuck in my neck , a pipe in an indiscreet place I 'd rather not talk about right now , and jumper cables hanging out of my chest .
" My body and legs look like a 1,000 - piece Freddy Krueger puzzle .
I have n't had a bowel movement or a shower in seven days and look here , I 've got two IV 's capped off in each arm , for a grand total of four IV's .
But , when someone needs another blood donation , they come in and stick me again !
My arms look like dried prunes .
" I 've suffered sleep deprivation and have taken enough Percocet that it 's 50 - 50 whether I 'm really talking to you or to a bed pan .
I want to go home .
I need to go home " I pleaded .
" And , another thing " , I added as though it were the final indignation .
" My underwear is missing ! "
My hospital gown felt cold and wet on my body .
With a little coaxing , she brought me around to at least taking my morning medication and promised she would expedite the process at all costs - which she did , in fact , accomplish .
When my wife arrived I was a basket case .
I insisted that she not leave my side .
At each point in the paperwork and departure process when someone would say something like , " Do you understand this so far ? "
I would hear , " You 're not done yet , Wimp Boy . "
And , I would then look at my wife to see if we understood .
By and by , my wife sprang me from the joint and I fell sound asleep on the way home in the back of our vehicle with the wind on my face .
It was about two days before I was back to my normal surly self again ...
I 've learned a few things from this adventure .
The first thing is that my legs look pretty darn good when they 're shaved - which is disturbing to me on several levels .
Another is that once having gone through bypass surgery , one should avoid sneezing at all costs .
More importantly , I 've learned that the professionals at the Medical Center are incredibly talented and manage to operate the facility like a well - oiled machine .
They take the most complex problems imaginable and turn them into a series of discrete parts , each of which is addressed with its own formulae and solutions .
The result is an astonishingly sound methodology for managing an enormous number of patients with such diverse issues .
If there is something that I would hope the Medical Center personnel could learn from this brief iteration of my story , it is as follows .
Within each step of these medical processes and procedures , the medical personnel that touch the lives of the patients , do so for only very brief periods of time - sometimes as little as a few minutes .
But , these patients are not simply cogs in the machinery of this well - oiled machine .
They hurt and are tired and are very often frightened .
Take care that you treat them with dignity and respect for their condition .
Because , this really is a big deal .
As a postscript , I went to my two - week / 20,000 mile check up with the surgeon , who had a medical student with him that looked to be no more than a child .
Being only slightly apprehensive , I thought , " Oh well , how bad could it be ? "
I laid flat on the exam table , closed my eyes and exposed my new contusions , abrasions and wounds to their - on average - reasonably experienced hands .
After they had strummed me like a cheap banjo , the surgeon asked her to remove the couple of stitches that were still in my chest .
She said she had not performed that particular procedure and asked how it was done .
He grabbed a handful of tools and materials , and my eyes popped open when he said , " This is really no big deal ... "

Comments
Your dad is a pretty tough guy .
An articulate too , for a man who does n't know an angiogram from an anagram .
In the UK the expression is " Now , this is nothing to worry about .... " just in case either of you are over here and want to know what to look out for .

I am a moderate procrastinator .
Even when I believe that I would be best served by finishing a task ( say , filing this story ) , I will occasionally put it off in favor of some short - term reward ( like a much needed caffeine fix ) .
This tendency on my part to delay what is in my long - term interest can now be explained by a simple mathematical equation , according to industrial psychologist Piers Steel of the University of Calgary .
Steel developed the equation U = E x V / I x D , where U is the desire to complete the task ; E , the expectation of success ; V , the value of completion ; I , the immediacy of task ; and D , the personal sensitivity to delay , as a way of mathematically mapping a given individual 's procrastination response .
So , for example , my desire to finish this article is influenced by my relative confidence in writing it well and the prospect of a paycheck as well as a looming deadline and my inherent desire to go home at the end of the day .
" You 're more likely to put something off if you 're a very impulsive individual , " Steel says .
But , " if you only work at the last minute , time on task tells . "
Of course , this does not explain why humans would procrastinate in the first place , but it is certainly not a new problem .
The Greek poet Hesiod , writing in 800 B.C. , averred " a man who puts off work is always at handgrips with ruin " and the divine incarnation Krishna singled out procrastinators for special scorn in the Bhagavad Gita .
Nor does it explain why procrastination seems to be on the rise -- afflicting as many as 95 percent of students and at least 15 percent of adults , according to two recent surveys .
Perhaps the answer lies in the cornucopia of distractions that surround us , ranging from YouTube on our computers to finally getting around to uncluttering our desks just when we should be writing that article .
" We have a workplace that is motivationally toxic , " Steel says .
" Convenient access to inferior choices is decidedly inconvenient . "
But the problem of procrastination , which Steel came to by suffering from a particularly acute case of it in his own schooling , may have broader applications .
The equation to describe it , dubbed temporal motivational theory , may be applicable to the entire field of human motivation .
" You can use it to predict stock prices and other theories of motivation , such as goalsetting , [ which ] can be derived from it , " Steel notes .
" Even the behavior of nations and groups can be better described by using this theory . "
Insights into our procrastinating ways may help explain why humans struggle with long - term problems that require immediate solutions such as climate change and mounting public debt .
And by reducing human motivation to a formula , powerful computer models can be put to work to predict our choices ( and perhaps create avatars that will successfully mimic us in online worlds ) .
" Modeling complex systems is something that we 've done .
We do it with the weather , " Steel says .
" This gives us the initial foundation to do it with people 's personalities . "
For my part , I hope that game designers and other modelers procrastinate on taking up this challenge , perhaps distracted by things like this news item or by the motivational tests Steel has devised .
Already , one of his tests ( linked below ) labeled me as a moderate procrastinator and delayed this story by a good 15 minutes .
" Millions of people - hours are spent making [ distractions ] as succulent as possible , " he adds .
" There are so many ways we could do something else . "
Apple Computer ’s UNIX - based Mac OS
X operating system is making inroads in the business community , according to a report by market research firm Jupiter Research .
The report tracks desktop and server operating systems in medium to large sized business .
The report found that 17 percent of businesses with 250 employees or more were running Mac OS X on their desktop computers .
Twenty - one percent of businesses that had 10,000 or more employees used Mac OS X on their desktop .
Mac OS X Server is also doing well with businesses .
Nine percent of companies with 250 employees or more used Mac OS X Server , while 14 percent of companies with 10,000 employees or more used Apple ’s Server software .
Due reporting techniques , comparisons to where Mac OS X was last year at this time were not available .
However , Jupiter Research Senior Analyst and author of the report , Joe Wilcox , characterized the numbers as significant for Apple .
“ What we are seeing is Mac OS X taking share away from traditional UNIX installations , ” Wilcox told MacCentral .
In some cases , OS X is taking share away from Windows , as well . ”
Wilcox explained that large businesses with expensive UNIX systems are opting for Mac OS X when they upgrade for a variety of reasons .
OS X is winning out over Linux in some cases as well , said Wilcox because these businesses would already have UNIX expertise on staff ; OS X has a good stable of server applications and it can run traditional UNIX apps ; and OS X is more viable as a desktop platform .
Jupiter also sees opportunities for Apple with companies that currently run a UNIX and Windows combination .
With Mac OS X’s UNIX underpinnings , companies can use Apple ’s operating system to replace the other two .
Microsoft ’s Windows Server operating system saw a marginal decrease in installed base this year , according to the report .
Wilcox said it was too early to gauge reaction to Apple ’s recent announcement that it intends to switch to Intel - based systems next year .
While cost will be definitely be a factor , Jupiter ’s Wilcox said that is not always the largest cost center .
“ With a lot of these systems the biggest cost is software , not hardware , ” said Wilcox .
Linux users also represent a big pool of potential switchers , according to the report .
“ I ’m surprised to see just how much Mac OS X has captured the interest of potential Linux switchers , ” said Wilcox .
“ Companies that were considering Linux are now buying Mac OS X instead . ”
Update Clarified the percentage of companies using Mac OS X client .

Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries hat auf Drängen von Kabinettskollegen und der Unterhaltungsindustrie die geplante P2P - Bagatellklausel aus dem Regierungsentwurf für die Urheberrechtsnovelle gestrichen .
Dies erfuhr heise online vor dem heutigen Kabinettsbeschluss aus Regierungskreisen .
Mit dem Paragraphen wollte Zypries eigentlich die " Kriminalisierung von Schulhöfen " verhindern .
Film - und Musikindustrie hatten die Passage dagegen frühzeitig als " Raubkopier - Klausel " gebrandmarkt und einen Lobbysturm entfacht .
Im Januar hatte sich Kulturstaatsminister Bernd Neumann hinter die Interessen der großen Inhalteproduzenten und Rechteverwerter gestellt und mit seiner Kabinettskollegin angelegt .
Aber auch im Bundestag konnte sich bei der Beratung eines FDP - Antrags gegen die Bagatellklausel außer den Grünen keine Fraktion für das vorgesehene Pardon für erstmalig auffällig werdende private Filesharer erwärmen .
Zur Eindämmung der Selbstbedienung der Surfer in P2P - Netzwerken sieht der Kabinettsentwurf für die zweite Reformstufe des Urheberrechts allgemein vor , Downloads " rechtswidrig hergestellter und öffentlich zugänglich gemachter Vorlagen " aus dem Internet als Straftat zu behandeln .
Es drohen für Rechtsbrecher , die im nicht - gewerblichen Umfeld handeln , Haftstrafen bis zu drei Jahren .
Zypries hatte zunächst auch in der leicht überarbeiteten Vorlage für einen Kabinettsbeschluss Anfang Januar noch die Klausel beibehalten wollen , dass " in geringer Zahl " für den privaten Gebrauch erstellte Kopien straffrei bleiben sollen .
Diese Passage sollte nach einer überraschenden Erweiterung im vergangenen Jahr auch für die Versorgung des " persönlich verbundenen " Bekanntenkreises sowie " Bearbeitungen oder Umgestaltungen von Werken " , also etwa die viel zitierten Schulhöfe , gelten .
Dieses Überbleibsel aus der rot -grünen Regierungszeit fiel nun insbesondere heftigen Protesten aus der CDU zum Opfer .
Dort heißt es zur Begründung , dass man ja auch nicht den Diebstahl eines Pfennigartikels im Supermarkt straffrei stelle und das geistige Eigentum genauso zu schützen sei wie physische Güter .
Die Bundesregierung sagt dem illegalen Treiben in Tauschbörsen mit dem Regierungsentwurf zum so genannten 2 . Korb des Urheberrechts nun entschlossen den Kampf an .
Das Aus für die Bagatellklausel soll zudem ergänzt werden durch die Einführung eines zivilrechtlichen Auskunftanspruchs gegenüber Internet - Providern .
Diese müssten dann die Identität von Verdächtigen etwa anhand aufgezeichneter IP - Adressen gegenüber Rechtehaltern preisgeben .
Für das ausreichende Datenmaterial zur Rückverfolgung der Surferspuren soll die Umsetzung der EU - Richtlinie zur Vorratsspeicherung von Telefon - und Internetdaten sorgen .
In strafrechtlichen Verfahren bliebe es bei der Bestätigung des Falls der Bagatellklausel durch den Bundestag künftig nur noch den Staatsanwaltschaften überlassen , Verfahren gegen Tauschbörsen - Nutzer noch wegen Geringfügigkeit einzustellen .
Diese sehen sich selbst aber bereits mit Anzeigen gegen Filesharer überschüttet und nach eigenen Angaben weitgehend lahm gelegt .
Zu den Diskussionen um das geistige Eigentum , zu den juristischen Streitigkeiten um das Urheberrecht und zur Novellierung des deutschen Urheberrechtsgesetzes siehe den Artikel auf c't aktuell ( mit Linkliste zu den wichtigsten Artikeln aus der Berichterstattung auf heise online und zu den Gesetzesentwürfen und - texten ) :

Rep. believes Democratic media reform bill may prevent possible ' fascist ' takeover of US media
Miriam Raftery
Published : Sunday January 21 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Hinchey : New bill would break up media monopolies and restore fairness doctrine Warns media reform critical to prevent ' end of democratic republic '
Concerns about monopolies and fears of a possible " fascist " takeover of the US media have prompted a Democratic congressman to push to restore the Fairness Doctrine , RAW STORY has learned .
" Media reform is the most important issue confronting our democratic republic and the people of our country , " Representative Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) said at the Free Press National Media Reform Conference held in Memphis , Tennessee last weekend .
" This is a critical moment in history that may determine the future of our country maybe forever . "
Hinchey told RAW STORY he plans to reintroduce the Media Ownership Reform Act ( MORA ) that would break up media monopolies and restore the Fairness Doctrine , which was eliminated by the Federal Communications Commission under the Reagan administration .
 If Rush shoots his mouth off , he must give equal access to our side ,  Hinchey said .
 The American public will begin to get both sides or all sides of an issue .
That is basic  fundamental to a democracy .
Last year , Hinchey introduced H.R. 3302 ( MORA ) , but Republicans blocked the measure in committee .
He also founded the Future of American Media Caucus in Congress in 2005 .
With Democrats now in control of Congress , a new media reform measure is expected to be assigned to the House Energy and Commerce Committee within the next couple of weeks , Hincheys staff confirmed .
 Well be trying hard to get the subcommittee and the full committee chairs to bring this to the House floor ,  Hinchey pledged .
A companion bill will be introduced on the Senate side by Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) , he added .
MORA would restore the Fairness Doctrine , reinstate a national cap on ownership of radio stations , lower the number of radio stations that one company can own in a local market , and reinstate the 25 percent national cap on television ownership , among other restrictions .
The bills no -grandfathering provision would compel media conglomerates to divest to comply with new ownership limitations .
MORA would also require public interest reports from broadcasters and require more independently produced programming on TV .
In addition , it establishes new public interest obligations to assure that broadcasters meet the needs of local communities and requires increased , sustained public input and outreach to give the people a voice in programming .
Media ' con job '
Hinchey faults the mainstream media for failing to tell Americans the truth about an administration in Washington that has falsified information to people about weapons of mass destruction in order to justify an illegal and unjustified attack perpetrated on Iraq .
How was it that Congress voted to give the President that authority ?
And how was it that so many people just bought into it when Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks on the World Trade Center and whatever weapons they had were given to them by the Reagan administration ? 
Talk radio has become dominated by shows that are right wing , even neo - fascist ,  he said , adding that even the best newspapers gave readers a con job by reporting false information fed by the administration .
 This should make every single citizen in America deeply concerned ,  he told conference attendees .
 What lies will they tell in the future to jeopardize this democratic republic or even end this democratic republic ?
That is the objective of many of those involved .
Hinchey believes the takeover of the U.S. media has been carefully calculated by the political right wing ,  starting with the abolition in 1987 of the Fairness Doctrine , which was originally adopted in 1949 in reaction to the rise of global fascism prior to World War II .
 Fascist government dominated discussions in Europe .
They could now broadcast all over and control all information going out .
That s how they took over governments in Spain and Italy ,  Hinchey recalled .
 The U.S. said the airways should be owned by everyone .
The Fairness Doctrine required that broadcasters give equal time to people who wished to express an opposing viewpoint .
 Under the Reagan administration , the FCC wiped out that rule and said only businesses that operate stations can express their view ,  Hinchey noted .
Congress passed a bill that would have required the FCC to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine , but that bill was vetoed by Reagan .
 The veto said clearly that this is an idea from the political right wing because we do not want to allow other points of view  because if we allow free and open discussion on the environment , healthcare [ and other issues ] , in almost every case the right wing will lose . 
Asked whether the Congressman believes there is now an attempt at a fascist takeover of the U.S. , a Hinchey staffer noted that Rep .
Hincheys legislation arose from his concern about increasing concentration of media ownership into the hands of a few individuals and corporations .
 Whether or not there is a purpose that includes fascism , we could wind up in a fascist situation if corporations end up controlling information without the government providing some balancing mechanism , such as the Fairness Doctrine ,  said the staffer , who spoke on background only and did not wish to be named .
 He would also say that the FCCs recent efforts to weaken media ownership rules in order to enable corporations to own more and more outlets plays into that as well .
How far would the Fairness Doctrine go ?
If reinstated by Hincheys bill , the Fairness Doctrine would govern all news programs on public airways , including networks as well as cable stations such as Fox or MSNBC , but would not apply to entertainment shows .
Thus a broadcaster such as Comedy Central could argue that the Daily Show or Colbert Report is exempt .
Requiring multiple viewpoints via a Fairness Doctrine is particularly important in rural areas , where residents may have access to only a single TV station and cant afford cable , the staffer added .
Similarly , regulation of talk radio programming would be dependent on whether those shows are defined by broadcasters as news or entertainment .
But a Hinchey staffer noted ,  We would argue that they are providing commentary on news much like what you see at the end of a news broadcast and as such , they should provide time to people providing other views .
We are not saying that they should be taken off the air .
Just how far would the Fairness Doctrine go ?
RAW STORY asked Hincheys staff whether a station might be compelled to give equal time to a holocaust denier or KKK spokesman if pro-Jewish or civil rights viewpoints were aired .
According to a staffer , a station might air controversial opposing views with a disclaimer that those views do not necessarily reflect the stations viewpoint .
A broadcaster might also provide a factual report to dispel lies told by a guest .
A Hinchey spokesperson stressed that the Fairness Doctrine does have limits .
 If you re reporting on al Qaeda , you re not going to have to have a sympathizer talk about the merits of Al Qaeda activities . 
What about races such as the California gubernatorial election following the recall of Governor Grey Davis , in which around 100 candidates were on the ballot ?
A broadcaster could impose reasonable standards .
For example , a TV debate during the California gubernatorial race included candidates who polled above a certain level .
 There is no way to have an exact science , but the spirit is whats important ,  Hinchey s staffer said .
 The FCC would look to see that a broadcaster had employed some guidelines and done its utmost to respect the doctrine .
Complaints would be investigated on a case - by - case basis by the FCC , as is currently done for indecency complaints , the staffer added .
The need for media reform is crucial , Hinchey stressed , citing the Presidents escalation of the Iraq War and jacking up  a need to attack Iran and Syria . 
He also expressed concerns over the elimination of habeus corpus and the Presidents recent signing statement declaring a right to open citizens mail .
 He is violating the Constitution and the law ,  Hinchey said .
 If you can control the media , you control ideas and actions of the people . 
While Hinchey said that impeachment is not likely to go forward , he stressed the importance of making sure that the American people see the proceedings of a series of investigations  in the new Congress .
 The people of America have got to understand what happened , who did it , and why they did it to make sure that no future president gets away with it again . 
Asked by RAW STORY what steps can be taken to assure that Congressional oversight hearings on the administration will be aired by major broadcast networks , Hinchey replied ,  Some networks will carry it .
Hinchey added ,  There is a definite role for the public .
The American people have got to understand how important this is .
Five corporations control ninety percent of radio and TV .
They are trying to change the rules of access to let them control the newspapers as well .
In an op - ed published at a website run by the right - wing think tank Frontiers of Freedom Institute , the owner of the web - based news journal , Daley Times - Post , argues that Democratic efforts to exhume the fairness doctrine reveal " just how far to the left their party has slid over the years . "
" Mr. Hinchey states that MORA ' seeks to restore integrity and diversity to America 's media system by lowering the number of media outlets that one company is permitted to own in a single market , ' but he fails to point out that no company is going to be successful enough to buy very many media outlets in any market unless it gives its audience what it wants , " Edward L. Daley writes .
" Fed up with the left - wing bias that has permeated the television news industry for decades , today 's media consumers demand both diversity and integrity from the people who provide them with news and information . "
" That 's why talk radio programs are so popular these days , " Daley adds .
" Shows like Rush Limbaugh 's afford their listeners with a wide variety of viewpoints , and their hosts routinely cite articles from the most reputable news sources around . "
On newspaper consolidation RAW STORY spoke with Hinchey about increasing newspaper consolidation and newspapers that restrict access to political candidates .
For example , the San Diego Union - Tribune refused to cover Democratic Congressional candidate Jeeni Criscenza , who was running against Republican incumbent Darryl Issa , the richest member of Congress , despite the fact that Criscenza visited hotspots in the Middle East , traveled to Mexico to observe the vote count , and made numerous high - profile campaign appearances throughout the district she sought to represent .
 This is an issue well have to look at and address ,  Hinchey said .
 It s clear it is a conspiratorial agenda going on , led by the right wing political operatives in America . 
Asked whether a Fairness Doctrine for newspapers is worth considering , particularly in cities with only one major newspaper , Hinchey responded ,  It is , but the big thing now is for television and radio .
The primary focus is on the broadcasting system , because that is where most Americans get their news . 
Partisan newspapers is nothing new , he added , noting that Colonial Era publishers attacked both Jefferson and Madison .
As early as April of this year , a window is expected to open for the FCC to approve applications for FM radio stations .
RAW STORY asked Hinchey what criteria the FCC will use to determine who will be awarded high - power FM licenses and how to make sure that right - wing groups or churches are not given priority over progressive applicants .
 To be candid , there isnt anything we can do to be certain that this wont happen ,  the Congressman revealed .
He noted that the FCC is an executive branch agency with five commissioners  and three are Republicans who control decisions .
 It is a roll of the dice ,  he warned , but some of those dice are loaded  and the FCC is loading them . 
With Democrats now in control of the House , Hinchey has been named to a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee with jurisdiction over the FCC budget .
He posed a challenge to members of Congress to pass media reform , asking ,  Will we be strong enough to bear this responsibility ? 
This will be the first in hopefully a series of smaller posts covering common Smalltalk idioms for those not already familiar with Smalltalk style and contrasting to a more well known language for those not already familiar with Smalltalk syntax .
Now , for a real expert on the subject of idioms , I 'd recommend reading Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns by Kent Beck , but I 'll offer up my limited experience on the subject as well , because hey , I have to write about something .
A common thing one wants to do , in any object oriented language , is to initialize an instance variable lazily on first access .
In C# this might look like ...
public string SearchType { get { if ( searchType == null ) searchType = " AddressSearch " ; return searchType ; } set { searchType = value ; } }
In Smalltalk , I 'd write that like this ...
searchType ^searchType ifNil :[ searchType := # AddressSearch ] searchType : aSymbol searchType := aSymbol
Symbols are often used where strings might be used in languages that lack them .
The method # ifNil : when evaluated on a non nil object , simply returns the object itself , but when evaluated on a nil object ( nil is a real object in Smalltalk ) , #ifNil : evaluates the block it was given , and returns the result of the block , which in a block , is always the last expression evaluated , in this case , the value we just set # AddressSearch .
So we 're setting and returning the value in a single line .
Smalltalk has many such conveniences to allow one to write very terse code that 's extremely readable .
Now , being object oriented code , there 's a chance this class could at some later date be subclassed .
If so , the programmer doing so might not like the default you 've chosen , and this code offers him no chance to override your decision .
If I intended this code to be part of a framework , i.e. subclassed , I 'd extract that default value into a method of its own like so ...
public string SearchType { get { if ( searchType == null ) searchType = DefaultSearchType ; return searchType ; } set { searchType = value ; } } protected string DefaultSearchType { get { return " AddressSearch " ; } }
In Smalltalk , I 'd write that like this ...
searchType ^searchType ifNil :[ searchType := self defaultSearchType ] defaultSearchType ^#AddressSearch searchType : aSymbol searchType := aSymbol
I 'd then categorize these in the method categories " accessing " and " accessing defaults " .
This would be somewhat equivalent to a region in C# , but far better because categories , as far as the code browser is concerned , actually contain those methods , and I can drag and drop methods around to categorize them .
Learning the common category names greatly helps one when browsing existing Smalltalk code , and they act as a form of documentation that you do n't really get in other languages .
Regions have a similar intent , but their implementation fails to provide the same value .
On thing to always remember when using lazy accessors , is that one can't ever access the instance variable directly from inside the class .
You need to always use the accessor method .
I 've waffled back and forth between direct variable access and lazy initialization several times , but I 've finally chosen lazy initialization as my preferred method because it allows one to grow a program better by allowing existing objects to be upgraded on the fly without worrying about uninitialized instance variables .
I also enjoy being lazy .
As Digg increasingly confronts the spectre of spam and gaming of the system ( Tony Hung has the latest round ) , Kevin Rose and Co. have been forced to add increasing complexity to the Digg algorithm , to the point where the value of a Digg on Digg has become so opaque as to be rendered utterly meaningless .
Which raises the question — why even bother to show the number of Diggs ?
Here ’s a sample from today ’s front page :
![ Digg Homepage1 ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/publishing2-images/Digg Homepage1.jpg )
And just below those stories …
![ Digg Homepage2 ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/publishing2-images/Digg Homepage2.jpg )
Anyone coming to the Digg homepage for the first time would have no idea what these numbers mean — even insiders , despite all the speculation on Digg ’s algorithm , do n’t really know for sure what these numbers mean .
So what ’s the point really ?
A “ democracy ” that has to forgo transparency in order to avoid becoming undemocratic has already ceded its democratic ideals .
I wonder what would happen if Digg stopped displaying the number of Diggs — the loss of transparency would only be superficial .
And what if they removed the record of who Dugg what and the Digger ranking ?
What if all incentives for power and fame were removed , and the only incentive was to help your fellow Diggers find useful information ?
You know , community .
Of course , Digg would never do that because the “ community ” would eviscerate them .
Digg has been a fascinating laboratory — the stories of gaming Digg are actually far less interesting than what Digg has taught us about the dynamics of “ social media . ”

in response to David Heffelfinger GWT applications are served to the client as a single HTML / JavaScript file , containing the entirety of the user interface .
The Google Web Toolkit is a thick - client UI technology ( applications run on the client )
To access business data or perform a business process , a GWT user interface makes a remote procedure call ( RPC ) from the browser to a Servlet There 's something about your explanation of GWT I do n't understand .
If the client served up to the browser is all HTML / Javascript , how is the application a think client ?
GWT has some limitations due to the fact that applications are run on the client browser But GWT is all HTML / Javascript -- ther is no " applicaton running in the browser " , that is , there 's no Applet or thick client .
It 's just HTML that talks Javascript to Servlets on the server , right ?
Please elaborate .

in response to Stephen Legge A thick client ( also known as a fat client or rich client ) is a client that performs the bulk of any data processing operations itself , and relies on the server it is associated with primarily for data storage .
Although the term usually refers to software , it can also apply to a network computer that has relatively strong processing abilities .
A thin client is a minimal client .
Thin clients utilize as few resources on the host computer as possible .
A thin client 's job is generally just to graphically display information provided by an application server , which performs the bulk of any required data processing .
With Echo2 the client is being used primarily as a display .
The server is contacted when the user performs any event that requires the immediate execution of an application 's code .
For example , when the user clicks a button , the server is contacted in order to process the button 's ActionEvent , as the ActionEvent - handling code exists on the server .
( NOTE : operations which do not require immediate execution of server - side user interface code will not result in server contact . )
With GWT the Java user interface has been compiled to JavaScript and is actually running on the client .
When a user clicks a button , the code to process the resultant event actually exists on the client ( as it has been compiled to JavaScript ) .
The server is only contacted when the user interface needs to contact the middle tier to retrieve or manipulate data .
Even though GWT is not using Applets or Plugins and all GWT code is HTML and JavaScript -- this design falls under the category of thick client .
" Thick clients " sometimes have a negative connotation , in that many associate the term with the requirement that IT folks will be installing client software on each workstation ( either by pushing installations from a central server or even manually visiting each workstation ) .
Obviously this is not the case with GWT -- the client software is automatically " reinstalled " ( if necessary ) each time you visit a web page containing a GWT application .
First let me define " thick client " and " thin client " ... or rather let me quote Wikipedia 's definition of them :

in response to David Heffelfinger I would probably go with Echo2 , simply because it does not limit what Java classes and libraries can be used to develop the application .
that statement makes me really question your understanding of GWT .
What GWT provides is the possibility to move parts of your application logic , together with the display logic , to the client in the form of JavaScript , where it is both obvious and completely desirable to not have every conceivable library available .
If you need access to , say , hibernate , then , please , delegate back to the server .
After all , we 're writing a rich - not fat or thick - client .
This is by no means a limitation but an architectural feature .
I dont think Echo can really compete in that space ( although I dont deny it can create slick and highly interactive web apps ) that statement makes me really question your understanding of GWT .

in response to bad mASH I'm in the process of creating a rather large website with GWT .
It was timed pretty well with the start of my project .
My reasons for choosing GWT : - I have a lot to do , and basically 0 time to be fooling around in javascript , GWT seems to do the best job of taking care of it for me - I know I can scale GWT out without worry , and failing over to another server is very easy -
It is fairly quick ( relative to other javascript - hiding frameworks ) -
If I need the power of java , it is but a RPC call away -- and I can generally get away with doing it infrequently enough that it is n't a problem - Full event system , that is n't slowed down by having to communicate with the server -
The vast majority of what I need in the GUI is buildable with the blocks GWT provides , the rest is worked around easily enough - I am not a fan of building GUI 's from markup languages , or any of the more conventional Java web frameworks
The application will be large in size , fairly small in load , and will require high standards for both security and reliability .
So there 's at least one company out there actively developing an app based on GWT . :)
And for what it is worth , if GWT had n't come out , I would be building the app in Echo 2 .

in response to Thomas Meeks I 'd like to use ECHO2 for intranet application and choose GWT for internet application .
for gwt can integrate with existing html , some tranditional web design tools can benifts for it .
for example , use dreamweaver template to maintain overall style .
echo looks more like swing , for it is a PURE java app , app will be reliable .
compiling time check , refactor , and so on ... echo runs a little far from HTML , it will be easier for swing developer .
gwt api is flexible , html block can be set as a link text .
on the other hand , ech o2 may reder output 's to flash , or xaml in the future .
maybe gwt add some mechanism to let controls work like a server side control .
for now , I believe Echo / GWT will lead the future web devlopement .

in response to Neeme Praks
What is the best combination of an WYSIWYG IDE + debugger ?
IDEA is having its own UI designer , which is pretty neat for a Swing , all what it does it automatically generates XML layout for you components and bind them to Swing classes with proprietary Layout managers all these is simple and easy , also event listeners .
But echo2 has its own set of classes , libraries - One might really question the quality of that product it might be good , but by taking a look at it at glance maybe not perfect - too java oriented .
For ex , I could not really instal Eclipse plugin for echo2 , some tiny things didnt work etc .
You can not go to production with such a library .. can you ?
there are other frameworks like opelazzo , etc , they are TOOOO xml oriented .
Doesnt anybody want to code everying in XML ?? heh ?
even control flow ?
In echo2 why have a set of parallel classes of swing ?? why not to do some BCEL to existing Swing classes ?
and provide a decent support for a couple of layout managers as in IDEA .
and translate them to Javascript or whatever during the build transparently ..
I dont want to work with parallel classes honestly ..
So in the end what is the best tool to do UI designs WYSIWYG and have very simple java binding in web preferably from the same product suite ?
to have really COST cost effective / high testability / fully debugged / application ?
ANY commercial products that worth money ?
hey gooruuus ?

The best thing would be if Swing could access an " HTML layout manager " , so that real Java code could replace JavaScript on the client .
I 'd like to see some discussion , on this thread , of the various barriers to this architecture .
I mean , is n't what we all want to be able to do " just write java code " on the client .
Well , we can do that with an applet , but the applet can't interact with the browser the same way Javascript can .
So , what would have to be done to make it possible ?
Here are some wacky possibilities : 1 ) Java interpreter ships with the browser , allowing Java to be executed like a script .
HTML " layout manager " interface is provided by browser 's java interpreter , and you can access the layout manager via standard " import " statement .
2 ) Java - to - Javascript bridge allows standard Java class , in an applet , to execute Javascript calls .
Would again require some support in the browser .
Somebody implements an HTML layout manager on top of the bridge .
3 ) A Java -centric browser .
I really think it 's time to try this again !
So when is Google 's web browser going to be released ?

in response to Tod Liebeck I have done a bit of work with both frameworks , both are very well thought out and tackle the same problem in very different ways .
It really comes down to which one has limitations that irk you the most :-)
Echo 2 has two large limitations as I have discovered .
One is events .
Since the framework runs entirely on the server , the client side script will only send events to the server under very specific circumstances .
For example , the click of a button .
Meaning that if you want to create something like an auto - complete form field , or have something occur on a mouseover , you have to make custom components .
Which is a pain .
The second large limitation is server affinity -- which makes echo2 much harder to scale out in very large programs .
Though this is a limitation Echo 2 shares with almost every other Java web framework .
Echo 2 compares favorably to GWT in terms of having the entire power of java available and a * lot* more components available at the moment .
GWT has its share of big limitations as well .
Your client code can't make use of reflection , java .
text , regular expressions , and a few other utility classes I have found to be very useful in GUI programming .
On the other hand , it has a much better event system ( events happen on the client , you can hook up to just about anything ) , better support for custom javascript , and can do rather crazy amounts of scaling .
All said , I think both frameworks are better than pretty much everything else I have seen for java .
But between the two it just depends on what you need more .

in response to Tod Liebeck all of your GWT code is executed on the client
This is very misleading .
Yes , GWT takes care of translating your client - centric Java code to HTML , JS , and CSS but you still use your existing server - side code ( think Spring , Hibernate , business logic , etc ) to drive the client code .
Google has done a great job of making GWT flexible enough where you can write a full blown client with GWT or a simple " widget " placed in an existing HTML page with the addition of a div tag .
GWT limits the developer to a subset of the Java 1.4 libraries Again , this is somewhat misleading and not entirely true .
I was able to write a GWT app using Java 1.5 .
The only limitation is that the client portion of the GWT code must use 1.4 conventions .
You can still use Java 1.5 for most of your service / middle tier .
There are some issues to using it for the creation of large applications , where downloading an entire application to a client web browser in one shot would not be practical .
I do n't think this is a limitation of GWT but calls into question how you design the application .
Having several " entry points " to the application may be an option .
I found GWT to be a refreshing change to the AJAX library landscape where there are tons of small and some useful ( Prototype ) libraries : GWT provides a nice abstraction which most Java developers can pick up quickly .
This abstraction also promotes reuse so you can easily use a " widget " from one app in another with minimal effort .
This alone is huge in the AJAX space and lowers the barrier to developers that have n't been able to effectively incorporate AJAX into their apps .
Enabling the development cycle to happen using Java byte code is also huge .
I would guess that this would reduce the development time of the app a minimum of 30 % .
No more app server restarts ( for client - related code ) and debug your client code using your favorite debugger .
BTW , I 'm not a Google employee but ... shameless plug coming ... I do have a little website called When GWT was first released , I spent a solid week investigating it and writing a small application .
I 'd like to response to a couple of the points made here based on my experience .

in response to Shane Witbeck entire application , but rather to the application 's user interface layer .
The same applies with regard to the statement that GWT is limited to a " subset of the Java 1.4 libraries . "
Additionally , after reading your complaint , I now believe this last statement could have been better termed a " subset of the Java 1.4 API specification " .
I do n't think this is a limitation of GWT but calls into question how you design the application .
Having several " entry points " to the application may be an option .
I do not believe the large - application - problem is a show - stopper .
I do think this is rightly called an " issue " though , as it does create additional work for the developer .
As an example , take the case where those multiple entry points need to share information at the UI level .
It can most certainly be done , but it does require more work than if one were able to create a single " application " unit .

What ?
You want Spring in your JavaScript now , too ?
You know , I do n't have any issues with Spring or DI , but the number of developers that blindly throw it in to every little bit of code they write is quite disturbing .
As far a GWT goes , I imagine most users will implement the true business logic on the server and expose it as services .
In that regrard , all you are really doing is writing a servlet , so using Spring / Hibernate / < insert favorite framework / library here > is no problem .

If you have a great idea and the determination to make it happen , you could join that list of young entrepreneurs who enjoy some huge success .
What do you need for being an entrepreneur ?
Well , you just need a problem and a unique way for solving it .
You would also need a lot of determination and belief in your idea .
If you do n't believe you will be successful - it 's better to stop with that .
Moreover a great help is to have the emotional support of your friends and family .
It will be even better to have a mentor with a lot of knowledge and experience to help you .
Of course , you should be ready to devote a lot of your free time to your passion and future business .

Miller : “ Why , if I want to install Adobe Reader [… ] , should I download a program that runs an installer to install some software to download an updater than downloads more files to run an installer that installs software that is way too big and slow to start … ” [ via Daring Fireball ]
Although Adobe Reader install process proves to be the most painful , second place goes to the Adobe Creative Suite for the following dialog alone .
I title it , “ Update ” :
When I first saw it , I was disappointed that the “ OK ” button was n’t labeled “ Update ” .
At ARM ’s Length
When Steve Jobs introduced the Apple TV during the keynote , he mentioned that it was powered by an Intel CPU , and they popped up a slide with an Intel logo .
But what Intel processor ?
Well , no one seems to be saying .
The Apple TV tech specs page says “ Intel processor ” and no more .
( My guess is that it ’s some sort of x86 CPU , and that the guts of an Apple TV pretty much resemble a stripped - down Mac Mini . )
But that ’s an avalanche of information compared to what Apple has announced regarding the iPhone ’s CPU , which is nada .
The lack of an Intel shout - out or logo during the keynote led me to believe it was “ not Intel ” , and Intel itself has officially confirmed that they are not involved with the iPhone .
Sources familiar with the matter ( as they say ) hinted to me that the iPhone is powered by an ARM processor .
This in itself is intriguing , as it is an entirely new chip architecture that Apple ’s operating system1 is now apparently targeting .

Also interesting is the fact that Apple is n’t publicly admitting that they ’re using ARM chips .
One reason , perhaps , might be that Apple does n’t want to draw attention to the fact that they once owned a significant stake in ARM and sold it all at the end of the ’90s .
( Credit to Gus Mueller for suggesting this theory during dinner last night . )
Apple owned a big chunk of ARM because ARM was the company that supplied processors for the Newton ; they dumped it , perhaps , not just for profit but because they did n’t see the need to maintain a stake in a company that produced processors that were useful for things like portable touch - screen communication devices .
Whoops .
Another theory is that perhaps Apple has n’t yet decided on exactly which processor to use in the actual production units of the iPhone .
June is still pretty far away .
( Update : Just to be clear , I ’m not suggesting they have n’t decided on the basic processor architecture at this point ; I ’m saying maybe it ’s possible they have n’t decided , say , which ARM processor . )
And the ( admittedly outlandish ) long shot ?
What if it ’s not an ARM , but a PowerPC , and in which case Apple does n’t want to mention it because they do n’t want any sort of confusion regarding the still dripping - wet switch to Intel of the entire Mac line - up ?
Update :
This job listing from Apple for an iPhone software engineer hints strongly that it ’s an ARM processor .
Three missing boys found dead Father finds young friends in car trunk Sheets were hung around the car where three boys were found dead Friday night .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Police Crime , Law and Justice or or Create Your Own CAMDEN , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
Three young boys missing for two days were found dead Friday night in the trunk of a car by one child 's father , who jumped away screaming and sobbing after his grim discovery .
Later he fell to the ground yelling , " Let me go !
Let me go ! " as several men sought to hold and console him .
A large crowd quickly gathered , crying and shouting , not far from the home of one of the children , 11 - year - old Anibal Cruz .
Cruz , 6 - year - old Daniel Agosto and 5 - year - old Jesstin Pagan had been missing since Wednesday .
" We are saddened by the events that have turned up this evening , " Police Chief Edwin J. Figueroa told reporters late Friday .
" As you know ... the three children have been found , and they were found in the trunk of a car . "
The cause of their deaths is unknown , and police were not ruling out the possibility that it was an accident , Figueroa said .
He said the car -- a maroon Toyota Camry -- was an older model , and had no device in the trunk that would allow someone inside to open it .
Figueroa said he did n't know when the autopsies would be completed .
" Preliminary indications show that the vehicle was located there " when the hunt for the boys got under way in that area
Thursday morning with the help of a bloodhound , he said .
" We know the car was searched , " Figueroa added .
He said logs will be examined to find out which officers were at that site .
Many police officers were extremely upset over the discovery of the bodies , he said .
" We have a very fresh and active investigation in this case , " said Camden County Prosecutor Vincent Sarubbi at the same news conference .
" There are many issues that we have to look into . "
The families of the children , he said , were " extremely distraught and grieving . "
They were receiving counseling to help them cope with their losses .
Sarubbi initially said investigators were treating the area where the car was found as a crime scene , but then said it was an " open investigation .
We have n't determined whether this was foul play or just a tragic accident . "
The bodies were found about 7 p.m. in the Cramer Hill neighborhood .
After the discovery , police cordoned off the area with crime tape , then hung sheets over it to hide the car from view near a wooded area .
The children were last seen around 5 p.m. Wednesday playing in the side yard of Cruz 's home .
Daniel Agosto lived nearby , while Jesstin Pagan lived farther away .
Elba Cruz , Anibal 's mother , said she left the three children playing in the yard for five to 10 minutes while she cooked dinner .
When she returned , they were gone .
There was a massive search for the boys by police , firefighters and other officials , using dogs , helicopters and boats .
Police had said they did an exhaustive search of the entire neighborhood , about three square miles .
Earlier Friday , police announced a $ 9,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the boys .

Based on the results of my Unobtrusive OpenID post , it is quite evident that there is a lot of partial knowledge about OpenID out there .
While my knowledge on the subject is far from complete , this post is my attempt to share what I have learned with others .
The target audience for the bulk of this post is people who are capable of adding autodiscovery links to their blog templates , may be able to install a small PHP script and / or know what a HTTP header is .
Claim Your Blog
For starters , one thing I did n’t make clear is that I was expecting people to continue to use their blog or homepage URI ’s ; what I did not expect was that people would start to use their identity URIs instead .
These people have identities hosted by LiveJournal , Verisign , MyOpenID , 2idi , Technorati , Vox , TypeKey , and others .
What I expected would happen instead is that people would claim their blogs using their identity .
In OpenID terms , this is called delegation , which sounds scary , but in reality it is just a form of autodiscovery , just like you do for your feed .
If you have an OpenID identity and a blog , then follow these instructions .
If you do n’t have an OpenID identity , you can get one for free at MyOpenID .
Here ’s mine .
Given such an identity , copy the following into the head section of your weblog , adjusting the two URIs as appropriate :
< link rel= " openid.server " href = " http://www.myopenid.com/server " /> < link rel= " openid.delegate " href = " http://samruby.myopenid.com/ " />
That ’s pretty much it .
What this says is that the web page in question is owned by the owner of http://samruby.myopenid.com/ and furthermore http://www.myopenid.com/server may be used to verify ownership of http://samruby.myopenid.com/ .
By claiming your blog or homepage in this fashion , you can then use your URI ( i.e. , the URI of your blog or homepage ) as your identity .
Having this level of indirection is a good thing .
If you ever become dissatisfied with your identity provider for whatever reason , you can easily and transparently switch providers .
When done , feel free to check your setup .
You may find that the autodiscovery features of most OpenID libraries are not as robust as those for feed autodiscovery .
Never fear , there is a solution for this later in this post .
Master Of Your Domain
This next step is entirely unnecessary , but I suspect that it will be popular with many of the readers of this blog .
Letting someone else host your identity is actually good from a security perspective , after all , any fool can vouch for themselves ( and below , I ’ll show you how ) , but having somebody else vouch for you is often better , if for no other reason , it gives the person who is checking up on you a place to report spammers .
Of course , services can be compromised ; but as already stated , you can always switch providers quickly .
The real downside is privacy .
It gives somebody else partial information about a portion of your online habits .
And much of the information that they do n’t have is readily discoverable .
There is also control issues .
After all , what good is a decentralized identity system where your only real choice is to delegate to a centralized server that you do n’t control ?
The good news is that it is easy .
You do n’t need any of these libraries .
Simply download phpMyID .
Place the one php file in on your web server and modify two lines :
' auth_username ' => ' test ' , ' auth_password ' => 'e8358914a32e1ce3c62836db4babaa01 '
In the first , put your desired username ( Duh ! ) , and in the second one put the md5 hash of the following : username : phpMyID : password .
There are many ways to compute this , and the README suggests the following for Unix / OSX :
echo -n ' username:phpMyID:password ' | openssl md5
Or the following for Windows :
md5.exe - d" username:phpMyID:password "
I ’ll add that you can even get by with :
echo '<?
print md5 ( " username:phpMyID:password " ) . "
" ?>' | php
Now visit the page you just updated in your browser .
It will identify itself with something like this : http://intertwingly.net:80/id/MyID.php .
Place this information in both the openid . server and openid .
delegate autodisovery links , and re-verify your setup .
Unlike other implementations , this one avoids using HTML forms for login , and instead uses HTTP digest authentication .
This is a good thing .
Update : phpMyId has changed a bit since the time this was originally written .
Decrufting
So far , you have been able to host your own identity , but let ’s face it , the URIs are a bit crufty , eh ? .
This should n’t matter much to anyone , but cleaning this up a bit will provide a bit of future proofing should you ever want to use a different implementation to host your own identity .
Often you can decruft your openid . server URI simply by renaming the script from MyID . php to index.php .
You may need you to tweak your Directory Index , which in turn may require AllowOverride Indexes to be set in your Apache configuration .
Simply by doing this , my decrufted server is now :
http://intertwingly.net/id/
Decrufting your openid .
delegate is even easier .
Simply find the line in the php script that sets $ idp_url and add another line after it which sets it to the value you want it to be .
By setting it to my weblog address , I can eliminate the need for a openid .
delegate autodiscovery link entirely !
$ idp_url = ' http://intertwingly.net/blog/';
YADIS
At this point , I have two Identities , but I can only declare one , and can only declare it in a rather fragile and HTML specific manner .
This is good enough for most purposes , and one can certainly stop there .
But let ’s not .
YADIS defines a simple format for declaring multiple identities , potentially using multiple different protocols .
Here ’s what mine looks like so far :
< xrds: XRDS xmlns:xrds=" xri://$xrds " xmlns= " xri://$xrd *( $ v*2.0 ) " xmlns:openid= " http://openid.net/xmlns/1.0 " > < XRD > < Service priority = " 1 " >
< Type>http://openid.net/signon/1.0</Type>
< URI > http://intertwingly.net/id/</URI> < openid : Delegate > http://intertwingly.net/blog/</openid:Delegate> </ Service > < Service priority = " 2 " >
< Type>http://openid.net/signon/1.0</Type>
< URI > http://www.myopenid.com/server</URI> < openid: Delegate > http://samruby.myopenid.com/</openid:Delegate> </ Service > </ XRD > </xrds:XRDS >
Not too bad , eh ?
Two services , one of a lower numerical ( and therefore higher logical ) priority that I host myself , and one using MyOpenID ; both associated with http://openid.net/signon/1.0 .
This information is simultaneously richer , more extensible , and easier to consistently parse than autodiscovery links placed in HTML as practiced on the web today .
Just be sure to return this information with the correct MIME type :
AddType application / xrds+xml .xrdf
Now , how do I connect it in with my weblog ?
It turns out that there are multiple ways , so let me start out with what I consider the best way to be : redirecting requests based on the value of the HTTP accept header , thus :
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} application/xrds\+xml RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} !application/xrds\+xml\s*;\s*q\s*=\s*0(\.0{1,3} )?\s*( , |$ ) RewriteRule ^ $ http://intertwingly.net/public/yadis.xrdf [ R,L ]
I like that way best because tools looking for my identity do n’t first have to fetch my blog at all .
The next best way involves a HTTP header which you can set thus :
< Files index.html >
Header onsuccess set X - XRDS - Location http://intertwingly.net/public/yadis.xrdf
</ Files >
Finally , one can put this information in the HEAD sections of HTML documents , but only as a last resort :
< meta http-equiv= " X - XRDS - Location " content = " http://intertwingly.net/public/yadis.xrdf " >
As always , when done , check your setup .
In fact , you might find it instructive to check mine .
Recap
Astute readers will note that I still have the link in my main weblog home page .
That ’s a fallback for consumers that do n’t ( yet ) support YADIS .

現在では，専門誌やITニュース・サイトに限らず，一般誌／紙や通常のニュース・サイトなどでも，コンピュータ・セキュリティの重要性を解説することが増えている。それにもかかわらず，一般ユーザーの多くは，セキュリティに対して無関心のように思える。
その理由としてよく聞かれるものの一つが，コンピュータ・ウイルスなどの被害に遭ったとしても，身体に危害が及ぶことはないからということ。あるベンダーの方は，セキュリティ対策を一切施さないユーザーから，「本物のウイルスとは異なり，コンピュータ・ウイルスに感染しても寝込むことはない。何かあったらOSを再インストールすれば済むこと」と言われて，言葉に詰まったという。
筆者も， 「被害に遭ったとしても致命的なことにはならない」と思っていることが，一般ユーザーの多くがセキュリティ対策に無関心であることの大きな理由の一つだと考えていた。しかし，最近ある講演を聞いて，たとえ身体に危害が及ぶとしてもセキュリティ対策は進まないのではないかと思い始めた。どのような状況であれ，人間というものは思った以上に「自分だけは大丈夫」と考えるようだ。
事故には遭わないが宝くじには当選？
筆者が拝聴したのは，群馬大学工学部建設工学科
都市工学講座教授の片田敏孝氏による講演である（片田研究室のWebサイト）。片田氏は，災害時の住民避難などについて研究されている。
筆者は片田氏の講演で初めて知ったのだが，「自分にとって都合の悪い情報を無視したり，過小評価してしまう人の特性」を「正常化の偏見（normalcy bias）」と呼ぶそうだ。
講演では具体例の一つとして，交通事故と宝くじのそれぞれに対して抱く，期待（不安）の違いが挙げられた。交通事故に遭って死亡する確率は，宝くじの1等に当選するより高い。にもかかわらず，会社からの帰りに車にはねられると考えている人はほとんどいない。一方で，宝くじには当選を期待して，多くの人々が人気の売り場に行列を作る。
そのほか，建物内で非常ベルが鳴っても，すぐに逃げ出そうとする人がいないことも，正常化の偏見の表れだという。ほとんどの人は，非常ベルに加えて，非常事態を裏付ける他の情報がないと，本当の非常事態だとは判断しない。逆に，非常ベルだけで逃げ出そうものなら，「慌て者」と笑われてしまうおそれさえあるとする。
また， 「もし大地震が起きたら，どのように対応するか」と尋ねると，「机の下に避難する」「建物の外に避難する 」「瓦礫の下敷きになっている人を助ける」---といった答えばかりで，自分が被害に遭うことを想定した答えは，一切ないという。
津波が来るのに避難しない？
片田氏は，一刻を争う災害時の避難に関しても，正常化の偏見が見られることを，以前実施した調査研究を引き合いに解説してくれた。2003年，ある沿岸地域で震度5強の大きな地震が観測された。同地域は，過去に何回か津波によって犠牲者を出している，いわゆる「津波常襲地域」である。実際には地震による津波は発生しなかったものの，過去の経験に基づけば，住民は大きな地震から津波の襲来を想起し，避難することが予想される地域である。
そこで，片田氏が2003年の地震発生時におけるその地域の避難状況を調べてみたところ，興味深い結果が得られた。3000名を超える住民への調査では，確かに87.1％の住民が，地震発生時に津波の襲来を思い浮かべたという。そして，全体の25.4％が「津波が来ると思った」，38.4％が「来る可能性は高いと思った」と回答した。回答者の過半数は，津波の襲来を予想していたのだ。津波常襲地域だけのことはある。
だが，津波を警戒して実際に避難したと答えた住民は，わずか1.7％に過ぎなかったという。1.7％である。ほとんど避難しなかったといってもよいだろう。その行動の裏付けとなったのは，正常化の偏見であるという。「津波によって身に危険が及ぶと思ったかどうか」の問いに，「危険は及ばないと思った」との回答が24.1％，「危険が及ぶ可能性は低いと思った」が25.5％で，およそ半数は「自分は大丈夫」と思ったようだ。
ちなみに ， 「危険が及ぶと思った」と答えたのは11.3％，「可能性が高いと思った」としたのは17.9％，「どちらともいえない」が21.3％だった。
以上の調査結果を興味深く聞いていた一方で，筆者は「津波に比べれば，コンピュータ・ウイルスなどかわいいもの。津波が来ると思っても逃げないくらいなのだから，『危ないぞ』といくら呼びかけてもウイルス対策など施すわけがない」と，暗い気持ちになってしまった。
ただ，上述の津波のケースでは，高い情報依存が避難を妨げた側面もあるという。このときの地震では，津波警報は出されず，避難に関する情報はテレビやラジオで放送されなかった。結局，地震発生から12分後に「津波による被害なし」という情報が出された。とはいえ，もし津波が発生していれば，この12分間が原因で，被害が発生した恐れはあった。
「 逃げなければいけないことは分かっているが，正常化の偏見によって逃げていない自分がいる。このため『認知的不協和』が発生して，逃げていない自分を正当化する理由を探す。だが，そんな理由は簡単に探せる。『前に避難勧告が出たときも，大丈夫だった』『隣の人も逃げていない』『テレビでも何も言っていない』などだ」（片田氏）。
「 脅す」より も 「 理解してもらう」ことが大事
とはいえ，暗い気持ちばかりになっていても仕方がない。今後の記事執筆の参考になることはないかと講演を聞き続けていると，片田氏からヒントになりそうな次の言葉をいただいた。「脅かすだけでは効果は薄い。その場では『怖い』と思っても，長続きはしない。重要なことは，なぜ危ないのか，どのように回避すればよいのかを理解してもらうこと」。
脅かす一方では，相手は思考停止に陥って，結局，正常化の偏見に“すがって”しまう。相手に危険性と対策をきちんと理解してもらうことが重要であるという。もちろん，一朝一夕にできることではない。片田氏は津波常襲地域に足しげく通い，住民を対象に説明会を実施している。説明会では，コンピュータ・シミュレーションによるデモを交えて，「津波によってどのような被害が発生するのか」「いつの時点で避難すれば助かるのか」などを繰り返し解説している。その甲斐あって，住民の理解は確実に深まっているという。
コンピュータ・セキュリティについても同様だろう。危険性と対策を分かりやすく，かつ繰り返し伝えることが重要だと思う。記者の立場からすれば「同じような記事を先日書いたばかりだが……」と思うことは少なくないが，大事なことは繰り返し書くべきだろう。ITproをいつもご覧いただいている読者の方には食傷気味の感があるだろうが，今後もお付き合いいただければ幸いである。
The $ 720 m ( £ 397 m ) Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) blasted off at 1243 BST ( 1143 GMT ) on Friday after being delayed for two days running .
A launch attempt on Thursday was scrubbed due to a sensor malfunction .
MRO will arrive at Mars in March on a four - year mission ; its cameras will send back the clearest images yet of the planet from space .
" What a difference a day makes , " said Nasa launch manager Chuck Dovale .
" It could n't have been any smoother . "
The spacecraft is the size of a small bus and weighs about 2,000 kg ; it will carry some of the most sophisticated instruments ever taken to the Red Planet .
Cameras and spectrometers will enable scientists to study Mars ' composition and structure and search for surface features related to water .
MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER 1 ) 3 m high - gain antenna 2 ) High - resolution Imaging Science Experiment 3 ) Electra UHF comms relay 4 ) Mars Climate Sounder 5 ) Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars 6 ) Orbit insertion thrusters
7 ) Shallow subsurface radar 8 ) Thrusters
9 ) Optical Navigation camera 10 ) Low - gain antennas
" A prime goal of ours is to achieve higher spatial resolution in our observations of the surface and of the atmosphere and of the sub - surface by radar , " said Richard Zurek , MRO project scientist .
" When you increase your resolution and you still want to cover adequate areas of the planet what you have to be able to do is return much more data than previous missions have done . "
As such , MRO is also equipped with the largest communications antenna ever sent to the Red Planet , which will transmit 10 times more data each minute than previous Mars probes .
This will allow the robotic probe to serve as a powerful communications relay for future missions to the surface .
Life search
Nasa has adopted the mantra " follow the water " in its approach to robotic exploration of the Red Planet , since water is an essential ingredient for life .
One of the scientific objectives of the mission is to investigate whether Mars could once have supported microbial life forms .
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will support future surface missions
" Learning more about what has happened to the water will focus searches for possible Martian life , past or present . "
The US space agency mission could also reveal what happened to lost Mars landers such as the British - built Beagle 2 probe , which was lost in 2003 , and the US Mars Polar Lander , which disappeared in 1999 .
Professor Colin Pillinger , from the Open University , who led the Beagle 2 mission , said : " If we could just see some trace of it on the surface then at least we could see how far it got - the not knowing is the worst bit .
" It will be a very difficult thing to do , but this is our best chance of finding out what happened and we will be watching the progress of the mission with great interest and anticipation . "
Future plans
Thursday 's attempt was abandoned because sensors that monitor fuelling of the rocket were giving a " dry " reading even though the rocket was being filled with hydrogen propellant .
A scheduled lift - off on Wednesday was scrubbed after a gyroscope of the type used in the Atlas V failed while being incorporated into a rocket unrelated to the MRO mission .
MRO will join two operational US orbiters - the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey - and one European orbiter , Mars Express , at the Red Planet .
Two US robotic rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , have been on the Martian surface for the past 18 months , investigating the geology of Mars .
Nasa is planning two further Mars missions this decade : the Phoenix module , set for launch in 2007 , and Mars Science Laboratory in 2009 .
The box office numbers have led to intense , broad - ranging conversations across Hollywood about the implications .
Many studios have commissioned market research to investigate the causes of moviegoing behavior -- or the lack thereof .
At New Line , executives have been talking about the " sameness of everything " on movie schedules , one executive said .
At 20th Century Fox this week , a half - dozen top executives held an impromptu brainstorming session at the commissary with a reporter , debating the effects of gas prices and marketing missteps .
Tom Rothman , co-chairman of 20th Century Fox , was one of the few to see no negative trend in the current numbers .
" Everybody keeps saying it 's the worst of times ; it seems fine to me , " said Mr. Rothman , whose studio has had some big - budget successes this summer , with " Mr. and Mrs. Smith " and " The Fantastic Four . "
He noted , for example , that the advent of DVD's has expanded the overall revenues of the movie industry .
" For us the business is healthy , but it requires management , " Mr. Rothman said .
Just about everywhere else , though , the concern is palpable -- and understandable , not only because of the performance of this summer 's movies , but also because a decline is discernible over time : overall movie attendance , a figure not affected by inflation , has slid to below where it stood in mid-August 2001 .
DVD sales , while still robust , are no longer rising exponentially , and some analysts say that a poor box office performance this summer will lead to poor DVD sales this winter .
With billions of dollars at stake , nerves are growing understandably frayed .
Last week , John Fithian , the president of the National Association of Theatre Owners , accused Robert A. Iger , the incoming chief executive of Walt Disney , of leveling a " death threat " at theater owners for having suggested that the lesson to be drawn from the slump is that moviegoers want films to be accessible in theaters and on DVD simultaneously .
" The structure of the industry is sound , " said Mr. Fithian , who believes in maintaining a distance between the theatrical release and the DVD .
" We just need a few more good movies . "
Mr. Iger had observed that studios ignored consumers at their peril .
" We can't allow tradition to stand in the way of where the consumer can go , or wants to go , " he told analysts this month , warning that " the music industry learned this the hard way . "
An Operating System for Real People :
A Challenge to the OpenSource Community
In 1984 Apple Computer introduced to the world an operating system designed for real people who want to get real work done , and changed the world of computing -- hopefully forever .
But by the time the system memory and disk drive space were big enough to do useful work on it , only the users fully understood the power and value of the Macintosh operating system .
In 2002 Apple officially killed the Macintosh operating system and went back to a system designed by geeks for geeks .
If you must use unix , Apple 's OSX is arguably the best one available today , but it 's not as easy to use as Windows , nor even as easy as Apple 's own failed AU /X .
The Macintosh vision lives on , crippled somewhat by vendors and developers who really do n't get it but are smart enough to build something that the users want .
It 's called WindowsXP and it's a far cry from what the Macintosh was , but it 's better than anything else , especially including Apple 's own OSX .
What is it that made the Mac different ?
Direct manipulation , plain and simple .
What you see is what you get , there ain't nothing else under the hood to make it hard to use .
Everything that needs to be done can be done by clicks and drags ; typing is for data and data alone .
Five or ten years ago the difference between a Mac user and a PC user was stark : Mac users had a job to do and their computer was an unobtrusive tool to get the job done , while PC users liked to fiddle with their computer .
That 's less true today , probably because more and more you have to fiddle with the Mac also .
For the last two years , all the traditionally Mac magazines have been filled with articles on how to open a terminal window to type in arcane commands that do what a couple clicks and a drag used to do in the original Mac OS -- or else did n't need doing at all .
And the creative people who have been hard - core Mac addicts held out , using OS / 9 to the bitter end and refusing to " upgrade " to OSX .
The Mac is gone and Apple is running on fumes in the gas tank , plus some innovative but easily copied industrial design .
However , millions of computer users and potential users are still out there , resenting the fact that computers are too complicated to use .
What they see is Windows and Linux / unix , and they are right .
But it should not be so .
Microsoft , while not really understanding the driving force , is still incrementally moving in the right direction .
We can do better than that .
The automobile was invented near the end of the 19th century .
It was noisy , expensive , and hard to use .
Only rich geeks could afford one -- and wanted to .
Henry Ford changed that , by making the car affordable and a little ( but not much ) less geeky .
You still had to crank it to start it , and double - clutch to change gears .
All kinds of things could go wrong and often did .
Then somebody invented the electric starter , and somebody else invented the automatic transmission .
Now every person can drive .
The geekiest of drivers today get a car with a stick shift , but nobody hand - cranks it to start .
They do n't even have a hole to put a crank in .
Forty years ago , when I started using computers , they were all command - line batch systems , the equivalent of hand - crank stick - shift automobiles from the 19th century .
Then Apple gave us an electric starter and automatic transmission in one fell swoop .
Just like the auto manufacturers 70 years before them , Microsoft copied the look and feel -- they added an electric starter and took out the clutch , but you still have to shift gears ... also they left in the hole for the crank , perhaps to make the geeks feel good .
Apple has abandonned their innovations and gone back to a Tin Lizzie : it has a metal body like the modern cars , but still runs like the 19th - century hand - crank double - clutch shifters .
Where is unix and Linux in all this ?
They are still stuck in the 19th century .
But oh how much fun they have tinkering with their system !
What is it that makes Linux and Unix adherents so loyal ?
That 's another story .
Wake up , it 's now the 21st century !
Direct manipulation is where it 's at .
Command lines are dead ( or should be ) .
In 38 years of making a living off of computers , I have never once met an application that was inherently easier and / or faster to drive from a command line than by a direct manipulation ( graphical ) user interface .
I have seen some very badly done GUIs -- some even this year -- which are harder to use than a well - built command line interface , but a mediocre GUI will beat out the best of CLIs in performance and usability .
By performance I mean the total time to get a job done , or else the total time it takes the user to think about getting the job done , and only after that the total number of CPU cycles it takes .
This challenge is addressed to the OpenSource community , primarily Linux geeks .
That 's not a put - down ; as the joke goes , " I are one " too .
Although I have not yet personally experienced it , I 'm willing to concede that Linux is probably the most stable and robust of systems available today .
And for the 90 % of all geeks still stuck in the 19th century , Enjoy !
To the remaining 10 % or 5 % or 2 % who would like to see Linux eat Microsoft 's lunch , here 's how we / you can make it happen .
Linux is already eating Windows for breakfast in the server market .
That 's because the Windows server is complicated to set up and administer , requiring a high - priced guru with 6 months of specialized training .
To run any kind of Linux system at all requires an equally high - priced guru with a lot of training , so the manpower requirements are the same ; the remaining cost of server software is entirely on the Microsoft side .
The cost there easily overcomes the fear of buying Linux ( one copy , at $ 25 ) from small and brittle vendors .
The desktop is something else .
Most desktop computers are not computer experts , and do n't want to be .
ALL Linux users must be computer experts .
Unless the system is usable by your mother without a manual , it 's not going to make it on the office desktop .
Windows is mostly usable ; it still requires some guru consultant help -- perhaps 5 - 20 hours per year ( the median Mac guru requirement was closer to 1 hour / year , but no longer ) .
If Linux or a Linux derivative could get its guru requirement below that of Windows , Microsoft would be locked out of the lunchroom .
The Challenge
Requirements
1. NO COMMAND LINE AT ALL .
There was no command line in the Mac OS , and there 's only a fake command line in WindowsXP : you can bring up a DOS prompt in a separate window , which I think runs in emulation on top of the system , and there are command - line options in some shortcuts .
All this amounts to a hole in the front bumper to stick a hand - crank into , but it 's not connected to the motor .
There are some profound , but not insurmountable , implications of this requirement :
1a .
No shell scripts .
That does not mean no scripts .
AppleScript works fine without a command line for it to drive .
You need a scripting tool with a " watch me " mode , and a text representation for power users to edit and add loops and conditionals .
It could even look somewhat like one of the existing shell scripts .
1b . No command - line options on programs .
You can still support them the way Apple supported them in AU/X , with a wrapper dialog box where the options are represented by checkboxes and text fields , or maybe the way Win32 does it with a mini-CLI in the shortcut , but this 19th century model of computing should be deprecated and given a decent burial .
It 's not that hard to put options into menus and dialogs , and to remember their state across runs .
Files are best selected by DragonDrop on the application icon ( or its shortcut ) .
1 c. Real people and real programs use structured data not text , so piping data from program to program is not very useful .
However , if somebody really wants to do that , it 's not so hard to build a graphical utility to lay out the plumbing , command line not needed .
1d .
The windowing environment must be embedded in the kernel .
There is no console logon , the system boots up into graphical user mode from the get - go .
19th century programs grandfathered in can dump their text / console output to a file that nobody will look at anyway .
2 . Only one desktop environment , with fewer ( and more understandable ) options .
Users do not need ( nor want ) two very different desktops , and they really do n't need 25 different ways to set infrequent preferences , just one that they can find .
Geeks like lots of choices ; real users just want one that works .
3 . A simpler and more robust file structure .
Linux and unix are both very brittle , with zillions of hard - coded file pathnames that if the user moves something to a different folder , the whole system comes to a " panic " halt that is irrecoverable .
The early Mac systems had two files that had to be in the same folder , that 's all .
Other system capabilities , if they were n't there , it muddled along without them .
Very robust .
Later Mac systems , as more unix - trained people got into the act , became more brittle with more ways to break it .
Maybe the Linux use of the file system cannot be fixed .
I do n't know yet , I 'm still learning .
At least Apple has hidden the dangerous folders .
4. Automatic single - user login .
Unix was originally designed for multiple users in a research environment , logged into a single computer .
It 's still primarily used in university labs where multiple users makes sense .
Desktop computers are primarily used by a single person all day .
There are still a lot of home computers that are shared by several family members , but that percentage is going down rapidly with the decreasing cost of computers .
I do not personally know of any ( multiple user ) single - computer homes any more ; everybody has their own .
Microsoft understands that , and it's part of making the computer easy to use .
5. Simpler install .
To install Windows , you push the CD into the drive , click OK a few times , then go get lunch .
Linux is not even close .
Microsoft does not own the hardware , it 's made by independent vendors from an open specification ; there 's no reason Linux can't use the same spec and work as easily .
It 's not necessary to support every obscure hardware type , supporting the major volume vendors will be adequate for capturing the market -- especially if it's a no -hassle install .
Also ,
5a . Self - configuration at boot time .
This is related to all those hard - coded file pathnames ( # 3 above ) , which make the system fail if you picked up the wrong boot floppy or changed out a piece of hardware .
Apart from obsolescence , any Mac boot disk will boot up on any Mac it will physically fit in .
If I change out a hard drive , whatever is there mounts and is immediately usable ; if I change out or add some other peripheral , I may have to drag a driver into the SystemFolder and restart ( should not be necessary , but it is ) , or just select it in the chooser .
In the new USB Mac systems , I can hot - plug in a peripheral and there it is , ready to use .
Why ca n't Linux do that ?
5b. Better / faster bootup .
WindowsXP takes forever to boot up , but at least they show a nice peaceful sky scene ; Linux takes even longer and puts up these ugly ( and sometimes disturbing " Failed " ) lines of text .
If the boot process is not successful , the average user cannot do anything about it anyway .
Even better : build a ready - to - go boot image at installation , then just swap it in on power - up .
That 's for starters .
Now What ?
Let me know .
Tom Pittman ( TPittman@IttyBittyComputers.com )
Recently I implemented a small scripting language with Antlr and I thought it would make for a good mid-level example .
Antlr is a grammar generator like JavaCC or the venerable lex / yacc tools .
Seems like most examples of Antlr you can find out on the web are either trivial ( the canonical calculator example ) or very complicated ( the Java grammar ) .
The language I ’m trying to implement lets you define a set of named scripting blocks .
Each scripting block is composed of commands .
Each command consists of a command name followed by a set of properties .
Properties can be either keyed ( key=value ) or unkeyed ( value ) .
A BNF for this simple language is :
script : block * block : STRING LBRACE command * RBRACE command : STRING property * SEMI property : ( STRING EQUALS ) ?
STRING
In this BNF , lower - case words represent non-terminal rules and upper - case words represent literal terminal tokens .
* is 0..n and ? is 0..1 .
An example script might look something like this :
# What to do in the morning morning { wake_up ; eat bacon ; brush_teeth ; wash hair=true minutes =10 ; } # What to do in the evening evening { read book =
" How To Be a Ninja " ; brush_teeth ; sleep hours=8 ; }
When you work with Antlr ( or pretty much any grammar tool set ) , you will need to define at least a lexer ( aka tokenizer ) and a parser ( usually defined as a grammar ) .
The lexer takes a stream of characters and emits a stream of tokens .
The parser takes a stream of tokens and ( usually ) emits an Abstract Syntax Tree ( AST ) which represents the structure of the input stream as a tree .
To visualize how a grammar produces a tree , imagine each concrete token match as a leaf and each non-terminal rule that is activated as an intermediate node .
The start rule ( script in our example ) is the root .
In reality , the AST story is not quite so straight - forward , but conceptually , this works .
So , let ’s first define the lexer using Antlr .
We mentioned and will need to define the following tokens in our grammar : STRING , LBRACE , RBRACE , SEMI , EQUALS .
So , let ’s start with the punctuation and leave STRING out for the moment :
class ScriptLexer extends Lexer ; options { k=1 ; // Only 1 lookahead character required } // Punctuation LBRACE : '{ ' ; RBRACE : '} '; EQUALS : '='; SEMI : '; ';
We start the Lexer with a class declaration , then an options block , then the punctuation definitions ( officially known as “ lexer rules ” ) .
The k=1 option defines how many tokens ahead the Lexer should look .
In this case , all of the token definitions are unambiguous from the first character , so k=1 is sufficient .
Lexer rules must start with a capital letter and by convention they are usually all - caps .
Here we ’ve defined tokens as single characters but the token definitions are actually regular expressions which makes things more interesting .
So , let ’s define the token for STRING values now .
For now , let ’s do something simple with a limited set of characters :
STRING : ( ' a '..'z '| ' A '..' Z'| '0 ' ..'9 '|'_ ' ) +
Here we define some character ranges ( ‘ a ’..’z’) combine them with an or ( ) and state them want one or more of them in a row (+ ) .
One other thing that we ’re missing is a rule that tells the lexer to ignore whitespace .
Otherwise , the lexer will fail on all those spaces in between words in our script .
This is a pretty common thing in grammars as one of the benefits of using a parser - generator ( over writing one yourself ) is that the generator can take care of the nasty stuff .
All we have to do is declare a rule like this :
WS : (' ' | ' \\t ' | ' \\r ' '\
' { newline ( ) ; } | '\
' { newline ( ) ; } ) { $ setType( Token.SKIP ) ; } ;
In this rule you see a couple of times where we drop out of the grammar and into code blocks .
The calls to newline ( ) increment the line counter in the Lexer class so that error messages have accurate line / column information .
The $ setType command is a special instruction to ignore these tokens and not put them in the token stream the Parser will work on .
That means that a string of characters like :
“ a {
b ; }
” is turned into a stream of tokens like : STRING LBRACE STRING SEMI RBRACE and the whitespace is matched but skipped .
Many grammars have a whitespace rule that looks very similar to this .
What about comments ?
We ’d like # to serve as a single - line comment character indicating that the rest of the line should be skipped .
This sounds similar to what we did with whitespace and it is :
LINE_COMMENT : '# ' ( ~('\
' | '\\r ' ) ) * ( '\
' | '\\r ' ( ' \
' ) ? )? { $ setType(Token.SKIP ) ; newline ( ) ; } ;
The LINE_COMMENT rule first matches a # symbol , then a series of any character other than an end of line , then an end of line .
Once we match this line comment token , we skip it and mark a new line ( since we consumed a new line ) .
One tricky detail here ( that tripped me up ) is what happens here if you have a comment on the last line of a file .
In this case , there will be no end of line , but we still want to match the line comment .
This is the reason that the end of line group is marked with a ( ) ? , which indicates an optional group .
In that case , our newline ( ) call is incorrect , but it wo n’t matter as we are at EOF .
At this point , we can tokenize almost all of our original script example .
Can you spot what I left out ?
I ignored the whole issue of accepting quoted strings as part of the STRING token .
Let ’s tackle that now .
We ’ll need to add an additional kind of string that starts and ends with a quote and allows any other character within the quotes .
We will redefine the STRING rule as follows :
STRING : ( ' a '..'z '| ' A '..' Z'| '0 ' ..'9 '|'_' ) + | ( ' " ' ( ~ ' " ' ) * ' " ' ) ;
That concludes the complete lexer for our simple scripting language .
So , how do we actually use Antlr to generate the grammar ?
Well , we need to add the antlr . jar to our classpath , then run :
java antlr .
Tool lexer.g
This will produce two files : ScriptLexer.java ( the nasty generated tokenizer code ) and ScriptLexerTokenTypes.java ( just some token constants ) .
Then we can write some sample code that examines the token string emitted from the Lexer for our test script .
import java.io.BufferedReader ; import java.io.
FileReader ; import java.io.
Reader ; import antlr .
Token ; public class TestLexer { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { System.out.
println ( " Parsing : " + args [ 0 ] ) ; Reader reader = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( args [ 0 ] ) ) ; ScriptLexer lexer = new ScriptLexer ( reader ) ; Token token = lexer.nextToken ( ) ; while ( token.getType( ) != ScriptLexerTokenTypes.EOF ) { System.out.println ( " \t " + getTokenType(token.getType( ) ) + " \t\t " + token.getText ( ) ) ; token = lexer.nextToken ( ) ; } } private static String getTokenType( int tokenType ) { switch ( tokenType ) { case ScriptLexerTokenTypes.STRING : return " STRING " ; case ScriptLexerTokenTypes.LBRACE : return " LBRACE " ; case ScriptLexerTokenTypes.RBRACE : return " RBRACE " ; case ScriptLexerTokenTypes.EQUALS : return " EQUALS " ; case ScriptLexerTokenTypes.SEMI : return " SEMI " ; default : return " OTHER " ; } } }
When we run this on our test script , you ’ll see :
Parsing : src/test.script STRING morning LBRACE { STRING wake_up SEMI ; STRING eat STRING bacon SEMI ; STRING brush_teeth SEMI ; STRING wash STRING hair EQUALS = STRING true STRING minutes EQUALS = STRING 10 SEMI ; RBRACE } STRING evening LBRACE { STRING read STRING book EQUALS = STRING " How To Be a Ninja " SEMI ; STRING brush_teeth SEMI ; STRING sleep STRING hours EQUALS = STRING 8 SEMI ; RBRACE }
You may think we ’re done at this point , but we ’re only half - way there .
Right now we can tokenize a stream of characters , but we are doing nothing to enforce the actual grammar .
The lexer will happily tokenize a stream like this too : “ ; ; ; ; blah}{= ” and emit a stream of tokens .
The next step is to define the set of tokens that constitute a valid script and that ’s done through the parser .
At this point , we ’ll take a break .
It took me a long time to explain it , but we wrote a really small and ( mostly ) simple set of rules to cover all the tokens we needed .
In Part 2 , we ’ll actually define our grammar and create our parser .
Here are the files discussed in Part 1 if you ’re interested :

Correction Appended
THE most vivid characters in Alan Moore 's graphic novels are antiheroes of ambiguous morality and identity : costumed avengers like Rorschach , the disturbed street vigilante of " Watchmen , " or the crusader known only by the letter V , who commits catastrophic acts of terrorism in the dystopian tale " V for Vendetta . "
With inventions like these , and a body of writing that spans nearly three decades , Mr. Moore , a 52 - year - old native of Northampton , England , distinguished himself as a darkly philosophical voice in the medium of comic books -- a rare talent whose work can sell solely on the strength of his name .
But if Mr. Moore had his way today , his name would no longer appear on almost any of the graphic novels with which he is most closely associated .
" I do n't want anything more to do with these works , " he said in a recent telephone interview , " because they were stolen from me -- knowingly stolen from me . "
In Mr. Moore 's account of his career , the villains are clearly defined : they are the mainstream comics industry -- particularly DC Comics , the American publisher of " Watchmen " and " V for Vendetta " -- which he believes has hijacked the properties he created , and the American film business , which has distorted his writing beyond recognition .
To him , the movie adaptation of " V for Vendetta , " which opens on Friday , is not the biggest platform yet for his ideas : it is further proof that Hollywood should be avoided at all costs .
" I 've read the screenplay , " Mr. Moore said .
" It 's rubbish . "
Mr. Moore has never been shy about expressing himself .
With " Watchmen , " a multilayered epic from 1986 - 87 ( illustrated by Dave Gibbons ) about a team of superheroes in an era of rampant crime and nuclear paranoia -- and again with " V for Vendetta " ( illustrated by David Lloyd ) , published in America in 1988 - 89 , about an enigmatic freedom fighter opposing a totalitarian British regime -- Mr. Moore helped prove that graphic novels could be a vehicle for sophisticated storytelling .
" Alan was one of the first writers of our generation , of great courage and great literary skill , " said Paul Levitz , the president and publisher of DC Comics .
" You could watch him stretching the boundaries of the medium . "
Interactive Tutorials Virtual Scanning Electron Microscopy
We have teamed up with award - winning electron microscopist Dr. Dennis Kunkel to produce a series of interactive tutorials that explore various aspects of virtual Scanning Electron Microscopy ( vSEM ) .
Use the tutorial below to discover how specimens appear when magnified in the virtual SEM .
When the tutorial is first loaded , the specimen is out of focus and brightness and contrast are not optimized .
Use the Focus slider to achieve focus and the Contrast and Brightness sliders to optimize specimen appearance .
Next , use the Magnification slider to slowly increase the magnification .
Higher magnification images load in the background , so please be patient and allow some time for these images to download into your browser cache .
Use the pull - down menu bar to change specimens .
Each time a new specimen is loaded into the browser , the focus , brightness , and contrast controls are randomly reset to simulate the situation in a real microscope .
For questions about Scanning Electron Microscopy , email Dr. Dennis Kunkel at the University of Hawaii or visit his website : Dennis Kunkel 's Microscopy for a sampling of optical and electron microscopy images .

Remember that election last November ?
You know , the one that signaled the need for change .
Well , apparently that change does n’t include taking a more enlightened approach to legislation involving new technology .
Earlier this month a bipartisan group of Senators lead by Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) introduced a bill that would create a variety of new restrictions for both Internet broadcasters and listeners .
Bill S.256 , also known as the “ Platform Equality and Remedies for Rights Holders in Music Act ” ( PERFORM ) , would , among other things , require that Internet broadcasters protect their audio streams with DRM technology .
Apparently the RIAA has convinced Feinstein that unencrypted audio streams are contributing to the global piracy problem .
In a world where just about every song ever recorded is available from any number of online sources , it ’s hard to believe that a significant number of listeners are sitting around waiting for their favorite song to play on some Internet station so they can record the stream , cut the song out of the stream , tag it , then transfer it to their iPod .
No , something tells me that people who do n’t want to pay for songs have more efficient ways of stealing music .
It ’s unfathomable that lawmakers would spend time attempting to cripple a new industry that is still in its infancy .
Worse yet , this is n’t the first time we ’ve seen this bill .
It was introduced last year and ultimately failed .
The fact that it ’s been reintroduced is a testament to the RIAA ’s persistence as a lobbying group .
It ’s conceivable that , if passed , the law would eliminate a large number of existing Internet broadcasters .
If the cost of investing in proprietary DRM streaming systems does n’t run broadcasters out of business , the new royalty and licensing fees just might .
Keep in mind that Internet broadcasters are already paying the same licensing fees that terrestrial broadcasters pay , as well as additional fees that terrestrial broadcasters do n’t pay .
Then there are the issues related to the use of DRM .
Since there ’s no such thing as an open DRM standard broadcasters will likely pick and choose from the motley assortment of available options .
Not only will this create confusion among consumers , but it will likely leave many users out in the cold .
Very few DRM schemes are cross-platform , and the ones that are ( FairPlay ) would likely not be available to Internet broadcasters .
Chances are that many broadcasters would select Microsoft ’s DRM system , effectively turning Internet radio into a Windows - only medium ( and ironically leaving Zune users out of the loop ) .
If I did n’t know better I might think that these politicians and lobbyists were actively trying to kill Internet radio .
If this bill passes they ’ll be off to a good start .
We encourage you to take action by contacting your local lawmaker and sharing your opinions on this matter .

Le Grand Content
Le Grand Content examines the omnipresent Powerpoint - culture in search for its philosophical potential .
Intersections and diagrams are assembled to form a grand ' association - chain - massacre ' .
which challenges itself to answer all questions of the universe and some more .
Of course , it totally fails this assignment , but in its failure it still manages to produce some magical nuance and shades between the great topics death , cable tv , emotions and hamsters .
The film is a co-production with Karo Szmit .
Narration is by Andre Tschinder .
The diagrams are inspired by the site indexed .
blogspot.com created by Jessica Hagy .
There is also an alternate version with music by Andre Tschinder instead of Aphex Twin .
For those of you who want to read the text of the narration , click here .
Here 's a link to an additional synopsis from Stefan Grisseman in german , english and french .
German short promo text :
Le Grand Content untersucht die allgegenwärtige Powerpointkultur auf ihr philosophisches Potential .
Schnittmengen und Diagramme werden zu einem wahren Assoziationskettenmassaker zusammengestellt , das sich die Aufgabe stellt alle Fragen des Universums und noch ein paar mehr zu beantworten und darin natürlich grandiosest scheitert , aber in diesem Scheitern dennoch ein paar bezaubernde Zwischentöne inmitten der großen Themen Tod , Kabeltv , Gefühlen und Hamstern erschafft .
Synopsis from sixpackilm :
At the film ’s very beginning the voice over , a man speaking in gently broken English , claims that the most important issues in life can be summed up with three words : how , why and what — three basic questions which are provably the most popular words in the autograph books of teenagers around the world .
Teenagers themselves share a basic principle with coffee and the stock exchange :
They ’re hot for a limited time only .
A little more is required for eternity , most importantly time , which can be used to experience adventures of various degrees of intensity .
The wild chains of associations set in motion by Le Grand Content are insidiously translated into the language of contemporary PowerPoint presentations : pie charts , graphs and tables .
At the same time , very subtly , the connection between beer and self - confidence , and the ratio of ( psychological ) pain to ( physical ) scars is explored , as is the inner connection between solitary consumption of ice cream and an intense increase in self - disgust .
Le Grand Content is a subversive undertaking :
It demonstrates how systematically disorientation can take place , how logical nonsense can seem .
The well - organized presentation , despite its authoritative appearance , does not at all ensure that it should be taken seriously .
The persuasive power of the graphic deductions is precisely equal to their absurdity .
The gently ringing music which plays throughout the film subtly emphasizes its underlying principle : the melancholy nature of the apparatus .
Le Grand Content is a rare kind of work , brimming with dry humor , esthetic confidence and terse precision .
For these reasons it has become a surprise hit on YouTube.com , the Web site for digital clips .
With nearly half a million viewers , Le Grand Content could well be one of the most - watched Austrian films of the past few decades .

Mr Katsav has said he was the victim of " public lynching "
Attorney General Menachem
Mazuz must now decide whether to press charges .
President Katsav is due to open the winter session of parliament on Monday , but a number of deputies have already threatened to walk out if he attends .
The president denies claims that he forced two female employees to have sex with him , and all other allegations against him .
He has said he is the victim of a " public lynching without trial or investigation " .
The police statement said : " There is sufficient evidence indicating that in several cases ... the president carried out acts of rape , forced sexual acts , sexual acts without consent and sexual harassment . "
" There is sufficient evidence indicating violation of the law banning wire - tapping by the president , " it added .
Residence searched
The statement said police also found basis for charges of fraud and malfeasance in office concerning presidential pardons granted by the president - one of the few powers of his office .
Police searched the president 's home in August after allegations of sexual harassment emerged , and have questioned him repeatedly and seized documents during the investigation .
Israeli media reports have said the case is based on complaints from up to 10 women .
The 61 - year - old father - of - five has rejected calls that he quit the largely ceremonial post that he has held since 2000 .
If charged , he would be immune from prosecution .
However , he could be impeached by parliament if it felt he had acted inappropriately .
Israeli dissatisfaction
Mr Katsav will not address the Knesset during the ceremony opening its winter session , the first time in Israeli history that the president has not done so .
Some representatives have threatened to walk out if Mr Katsav is even present .
The BBC's Richard Miron in Jerusalem says Mr Katsav may resign if he is indicted .
The police recommendations come at a time when Israelis of all political hues are dissatisfied with their leadership , our correspondent says .
A number of politicians have faced scandals recently , with charges ranging from sexual misconduct to corruption .
And the handling of the recent war against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been widely criticised .
Mr Katsav is a veteran member of the right - wing Likud party , serving as transport minister in the late 1980s and in 1996 as minister of tourism and deputy prime minister .
The post of president , to which he was elected for a seven - year term which ends in 2007 , is largely ceremonial .
We ’re in big trouble .
Have a look at The Washington Note , whose latest begins like this :
Washington intelligence , military and foreign policy circles are abuzz today with speculation that the President , yesterday or in recent days , sent a secret Executive Order to the Secretary of Defense and to the Director of the CIA to launch military operations against Syria and Iran .
The President may have started a new secret , informal war against Syria and Iran without the consent of Congress or any broad discussion with the country .
If this is true , we ’re in very big trouble .
Or , if the rumor was sparked by an order ‘ only ’ authorizing clandestine operations ( or , worse , bombardment ) as a form of provocation , this is serious stuff .
But even if it ’s not at all true in any way , we ’re in pretty big trouble , as the spread of this rumor means we ’ve reached a point in our politics when sober , quite moderate , people like Steve Clemons are starting at shadows .
I can only remember one time that felt like this : when Nixon was in the last weeks of his Presidency , and people — including the then - Secretary of Defense– got worried that Nixon might try to start a war to distract the country from his troubles , or even stage some sort of coup .
People in DC even began to speculate as to what military forces could be assembled as a counterweight in the event that Nixon , rumored to be drunk and unstable , chose to subvert the Constitution .
According to reports published after Nixon resigned , Defense Secretary James Schlesinger even went as far to tell some of the highest - ranking military officers to inform him if any ‘ extraordinary orders ’ went out from the White House and to refrain from carrying out any orders which came from the White House outside the normal military channels .
( An action , incidentally , of dubious formal legality on the part of both James Schlesinger and his generals . )
Those were not good times .
Any time there is serious speculation by ordinarily sober people that the President has launched a secret war against one — or two !
— countries , well , those are not good times either .
I think this is true whoever you think is at fault — the administration for being Hell - bent for lunacy , or the DC Democrats ( or if you prefer the DC Establishment ) , for being a bunch of strategic cowards .
Whenever the level of trust within the governing class has so broken down , we are in for hard times indeed .
And if , as Clemons ’s article suggests , the White House is launching a new secret war ( or two ) , then we ’re far worse off than we were in 1974 , for who in the modern White House would cast him or herself as our modern James Schlesinger ?

The " Dumbness of Crowds "
Community .
Wisdom of Crowds .
Collective Intelligence .
The new emphasis on net - enabled collaboration is all goodness and light until somebody gets an eye I poked out .
Is it merely a coincidence that Apple , run by ( as James Gosling put it ) " a dictator with good taste " leads the way in tech design , while risk - averse companies using design - by - committee ( or consensus ) are churning out bland , me - too , incremental tweaks to existing products ?
And if that 's true about companies , why do we think consensus will work on an even larger scale with " users " in Web 2.0 ?
Jaron Lanier , in his controversial Edge essay Digital Maoism , has a great quote :
" In the last year or two the trend has been to remove the scent of people ... "
All geeks - and - personal - hygiene - jokes aside , we need the smell .
And the most frustrating part for me is how the " Wisdom of Crowds " idea has been twisted and abused to mean virtually the opposite of what New Yorker columnist James Surowiecki says in the book of the same name .
He opened a talk at ETech telling us that while ants become smarter as the number of collaborators increases , humans become dumber .
In what is potentially the most misleading book / idea title in the history of the world , the " Crowds " in " The Wisdom of Crowds " was never meant to mean " mobs " , " groups acting as one " , " committees " , " consensus " or even " high collaboration " .
By " crowd , " , I think he meant " more people " , sure , but he also defined a big ol ' set of constraints for how much togetherness people can have before the results became dumber .
And it turns out , not that much .
By " crowd " , he was referring to a collection of individuals .
Individuals whose independent knowledge ( and " independent " is a key word in what makes the crowd " smart " ) is aggregated in some way , not smushed into one amorphous Consensus Result .
Web 2.0 and putting the Community in Control
One of the high - profile concepts of the Web 2.0 meme is community .
Giving community the control .
Letting the community make decisions .
Trusting the community .
And -- if you 're a lucky bubble - 2.0er -- letting the community do all the work while you collect the money .
But this idea of consensus - community is not at all what I 've heard Tim O'Reilly talk about when he uses the phrase , " harnessing collective intelligence " or when he describes Web 2.0 as something whose value to users grows with the number of users .
What 's the difference between Collective Intelligence and Dumbness of Crowds ?
A few examples :
" Collective intelligence " is a pile of people writing Amazon book reviews .
" Dumbness of Crowds " is a pile of people collaborating on a wiki to collectively author a book .
( Not that there are n't exceptions , but that 's just what they are -- rare exceptions for things like reference books .
I 'm extremely skeptical that a group will produce even a remotely decent novel , for example .
Most fiction suffers even with just two authors . )
" Collective Intelligence " is all the photos on Flickr , taken by individuals on their own , and the new ideas created from that pool of photos ( and the API ) .
" Dumbness of Crowds " is expecting a group of people to create and edit a photo together .
" Collective Intelligence " is about getting input and ideas from many different people and perspectives .
" Dumbness of Crowds " is blindly averaging the input of many different people , and expecting a breakthrough .
( It 's not always the averaging that 's the problem it's the blindly part )
" Collective Intelligence " is about the community on Threadless , voting and discussing t- shirts designed by individuals .
" Dumbness of Crowds " would be expecting the Threadless community to actually design the t- shirts together as a group .
Art is n't made by committee .
Great design is n't made by consensus .
True wisdom is n't captured from a crowd .
At least not when the crowd is acting as a single entity .
Clearly there IS wisdom in the many as long as you do n't " poison " the crowd by forcing them to agree ( voting does n't mean agreeing ) .
According to Surowiecki , even just sharing too much of your own specialized knowledge with others in the group is enough to taint the wisdom and dumb - down the group .
It 's the sharp edges , gaps , and differences in individual knowledge that make the wisdom of crowds work , yet the trendy ( and misinterpreted ) vision of Web 2.0 is just the opposite -- get us all collborating and communicating and conversing all together as one big happy collborating , communicating , conversing thing until our individual differences become superficial .
Imagine a community -- let 's say the Dog Lover 's Society -- that through a genetic breakthrough is given the chance to design the perfect dog .
Everyone gets to contribute .
Everyone 's idea counts .
The dog will be the perfect reflection of the wisdom of the dog- loving crowd .
What will they come up with ?
I see two options :
1 ) A non-descript Generic Dog -- the average of every possible dog attribute .
It would look something like the abstract DOG used in pre-school books where you teach two - year olds to " point to the DOGGY "
OR
2 ) Frankendog -- a hideous patchwork of dog parts that were never meant to go together .
It would look something like a Star Trek transporter accident .
Of course most of what I 've been dissing is the popular , rampant misinterpretation of Wisdom of Crowds , not what Surowiecki actually meant .
Read the book and you 'll see just how significant and powerful the aggregation of individual knowledge really is , and how in the right circumstances with the right constraints , the wisdom found in that group CAN be smarter than the smartest individual in the group .
But he never says the group itself becomes smarter when they work together to produce a result as a group .
20Q - a perfect example of the real Wisdom of Crowds
If you 're one of the twelve people who have n't yet played with the 20Q " toy " , you have no idea how scarily well this thing " guesses " what you 're thinking about .
The creepy thing is n't necessarily that it figures out you were thinking of thermometer , bra , microscope , painting , mp3 player , or lightbulb ( all things it guessed correctly for me yesterday ) .
The really creepy thing is how it got there from the questions it asked .
Although the program clearly changes questions based on your answer to the previous questions , it does n't change them nearly as much as you 'd think it would need to .
If I did n't know better , I 'd swear it 's using voice recognition to cheat .
But no , it turns out there 's a perfect explanation for its supernatural accuracy .
The creator harnessed collective intelligence .
Hundreds of thousands of people " taught " the program over a period of years , by playing software versions of his game .
The program uses a neural net , and learned .
It learned so well , in fact , that it learned a few dumb things .
For example , way too many people think a dolphin is a fish , so even if you say " yes " when asked by the device if what you 're thinking of is a fish , it can still figure out you mean dolphin from other cues .
( Apparently it also thinks human beings may not actually be animals , based on the " collective intelligence " of those who 've played the online version . )
Finally , while I disagree with much of what Jaron talks about in his essay , I know how damn smart this guy is ( we were on a panel together a long time ago at the Junos in Canada ) .
A few of my favorite quotes :
" Meanwhile , an individual best achieves optimal stupidity on those rare occasions when one is both given substantial powers and insulated from the results of his or her actions .
" If the above criteria have any merit , then there is an unfortunate convergence .
The setup for the most stupid collective is also the setup for the most stupid individuals .
" Every authentic example of collective intelligence that I am aware of also shows how that collective was guided or inspired by well - meaning individuals .
These people focused the collective and in some cases also corrected for some of the common hive mind failure modes . "
No matter what , I believe that in our quest to exploit the " We " in Web , we must not sacrifice the " I " in Internet .

Nice post , Kathy !
This made me think of two books :
" Blue Ocean Strategy " by Kim & Mauborgne , which advocates leaving the red oceans of mass " wisdom " for the blue oceans of edgy but uncontested space .
Great book .
Meanwhile , there IS a novel written by a collection of very accomplished writers : " Naked Came the Manatee " .
Dave Barry must have penned the title , and he wrote the first chapter , then a host of other well - known writers took turns with succeeding chapters .
It was bizarre , but fun to see how it twisted with each new author 's hand ( and voice ) .
As for that 20Q toy , I thought it was just scamming me when it said , after about 12 questions , " I 'm going to win " -- and damned if it did n't guess correctly ( soccer ball ) .
Posted by : John Windsor | Jan 2 , 2007 9:32:55 PM
By the way , just in case it 's not obvious ...
I concocted this whole long and rambling post just so I could show off the new chart I just learned how to make -- that radar - looking thing at the top ( I think they 're called ' spider ' charts ) .
DeltaGraph rocks .
John : Blue Ocean Strategy is one of my all - time favorite books for sure .
And I do think there will be novelty and ' artistic ' projects that use multiple authors ( I think the surrealists used to do that for fun ) , but those will be special exceptions .
Even non-fiction tech books often suffer from having multiple authors .
The only solutions for this are to strip the writing of any voice at all so you do n't have franken - chapters , or for a single editor to do a lot of work to give it " a single voice " ( some gifted editors can do this quite well , but I have no idea how ) .
And yeah , the 20Q " attitude " is really annoying , but the thing really does scare me sometimes .
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Jan 2 , 2007 9:42:31 PM
Great post Kathy .
I think this trend is a bit like the period just before the bubble 1.0 burst , when everyone was convinced that community could solve every problem , but few knew the real work it took to really make it happen .
It is a shame that the wisdom of crowds has been co-opted as you describe .
I think it was Chris Anderson in The Long Tail that said that the key point is that the WoC works as long as each person is working in their own self - interest and not the interests of the group .
I think about this when I tag my photos on Flickr - I do it for myself - my own interests , but my interests also roll - up into value for the community .
Posted by : Lee LeFever | Jan 2 , 2007 11:52:22 PM
Great article , it coveres exactly the feeling I have with some of the so much liked web 2.0 - thingy's .
After the community is done , you keep the most boring and safe stuff around - while the most cool and needy things are lost in ' translation ' .
On the other hand u might need to ask yourself : is n't this dumbness of crowds exactly what many people do all day long ?
Adopting to the value 's , meaning and opinion of others ?
It 's propably very ' human ' to just concensus things out and accepting the middle of the road - leftovers :-)

Kathy
An interesting and challenging post , as usual .
As a Brit who lives in Europe and who has worked all over the world , I see the ' we ' in the wisdom of the crowd vs. the ' I ' in individual or Internet as very much a cultural thing .
Geert Hofstede 's work on ' cultural dimensions ' identifies five core dimensions through which to look at national or company cultures .
It should be no surprise that the USA comes out very strongly on one of the dimensions , ' individualism ' compared to say Japan , Germany , or much of the rest of the world .
See http://www.geert-hofstede.com/geert_hofstede_resources.shtml for more details .
People from highly individualistic cultures often challenge the value of collective action due to their inherent cultural biases .
The same happens in reverse in colective cultures of course , albeit to a lesser extent .
The real challenge , as you point out , is in identifying how to make collective intelligence through collaboration work better .
Surowiecki's book is a good start .
The Center for Collaborative Organisations at the Uni of North Texas ' workbooks are much better .
But making collaboration work in individualistic cultures is difficult .
Witness the general failure of TQM in the 1980s .
Graham Hill
PS .
Rather than Apple , which is a relatively unimportant company in the larger scale of things , perhaps you should have contrasted the failure of individualistic companies like GM and Ford with the success of collective companies like Toyota .
Posted by : Graham Hill | Jan 3 , 2007 4:50:37 AM
This must be one of the best things written about Web 2.0 I 've seen .
Your " collective intelligence is about ... " vs. " dumbness of crowds ... " contrasts are right on the money .
Posted by : Larry Sanger | Jan 3 , 2007 6:28:50 AM
Sometimes a rant is inevitable !
Good summary of the REAL wisdom of crowds , and the necessary constraints that enable it .
I get pretty frustrated with people who do n't know the facts passing judgement on what can be a very useful idea .
Thanks for saying it well !

Posted by : Daniel Berger | Jan 3 , 2007 8:03:31 AM
I would have to disagree with Graham ; the failure of companies like GM has more to do , I think , with the attempt to follow the " crowd " - - whereas when they were directed by strong individuals such as Lee Iacocca , they were saved from a more premature failure .
I wrote about it in my blog , but this post reminded me of the way it feels to work with various types of theatre groups .
My preference is the " Director - as - Dictator " model ; where there is a good design team , a lot of different ideas brought to the table , but that energy is harnessed and focused by the Director , who ( along with great power ) also has ultimate responsibility .
This is contrasted with groups I 've worked with that try to work by " consensus " -- which , aside from taking forever , tends to dilute and soften the focus of a performance idea , until everyone ( or , more often , no one ) is pleased , but all can get by with the result .
The " insulated from consequences " rule applies inversely here : if there is a bad review , the director faces those consequences , where as the collective always can point the finger at someone else .
Just my opinion .
Posted by : Gray | Jan 3 , 2007 8:44:22 AM
Similarly , we always hinge between the safety of the group and the awareness of the individual , the crowd scene in Borat is a perfect example of that ballence
http://www.gotuit.com/player/index.html?c=SM_Entertainment&t=6021&s=47992
in the beginning , the collective is at work , and very quickly the individual is triggered .
I did n't tag the whole thing , but by the end , they return to a booing mob ....
We are playing with something delicate and dangerous to say the least .
Posted by : Grendly | Jan 3 , 2007 9:18:34 AM
It appears there is an important difference between what one averages out of the crowd and what emerges from the crowd .

Posted by : John Furrier | Jan 3 , 2007 10:51:45 AM
You 're right on , Kathy .
The most under - appreciated part of Suroweiki 's book is the notion of independence .
There 's also another under - appreciated notion , that of aggregation at scale .
When you aggregate many * independent * things , say millions of them , the result is actually much more rich than one initially assumes .
Many folks look at a technology like tagging , for example , and say that all sorts of meaning will be lost because tagging is n't comprehensive .
That is , because there is no rule saying that you have to use all the NY tags ( like NewYork , NewYorkCity , NY , BigApple , and everything in between ) when we tag something , that there will be holes in the completeness of our data set .
But what scale gives us is the ability to include so many independent actions that * if it is important to someone it will be in the system * .
It might not be what everyone does , but it will be there .
So , if you aggregate all the tags , it will be clear which ones refer to New York and which ones do n't , because of the small but many overlaps between what people do .
This is a long way of saying that I think independence and aggregation at scale are the two most under - appreciated notions of the networked world .

These are interesting and valid points , Kathy , that raise a fundamental question .
Crowds have already accomplished incredible things - some of which I would have sworn were well outside a crowds capabilities .
Wikipedia is the prototypical example , there are many others .
I 'm convinced that the arguments you present here mean that we still have a lot to learn about how crowds do optimal work - but that we still have n't tapped into their true power .
And now the question :
How can we use the objections you raise here to improve the wisdom of crowds in areaas where it does n't work well today , rather than give up on it ?
In my opionion , crowds are still in their infancy , and have still to do their greatest works .
And yes , that makes me a true believer :o )

I 'm glad someone finally said what I 've been thinking for a while .
It 's truly scary the number of start - ups that have been created based upon misunderstanding this idea .
You only have to look at mainstream media of any form to see that the lowest common denominator is what 's most popular .

Based on my experience at University , it is clear that there is an optimum size for a group based on a given task .
Want to write something ?
Two .
One to write , one to edit .
Want to devise a plan of some consequence ?
Two to four -- the folks available with the most personally vested in the outcome of the plan .
Anything above that extends the time required and will not increase , and will likely decrease , the intelligence of the plan .
The * definition * of time wasted is a bunch of academics sitting around a table at a regular time .
Its called a faculty meeting .

the book I thought of was East of Eden ...
" Nothing was ever created by two men .
There are no good collaborations , whether in music , in art , in poetry , in mathematics , in philosophy .
Once the miracle of creation has taken place , the group can build and extend it , but the group never invents anything .
The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man . "

Hey Kathy ,
Great post , but I am failing to follow one of your points .
You write " Giving community the control " as one of the concepts of Web 2.0 , and then follow with " if you 're a lucky bubble - 2.0 er letting the community do all tho work " .
With the big 2.0ers like myspace and flickr for example , I do n't see how the community is in control .
One the contrary , I see those communities as a decentralized , scattered " herd " and suffering from lack of control .
It is exactly this decentralization that gives the bubble2.0er the opportunity to collect the money .
Your refinement of the " wisdom of the crowds " concept made me think of open - source projects .
In many ways , open source is * the* model that predated Web 2.0 .
Open source projects existed , collaborated and shared collective wisdom long before the Web 2.0 days .
I think that it is exactly their ability to exert control , and act as a unified community , and keep the control out of commercial hands , that made the projects so successful .

A couple of years ago , watching " The Apprentice " , I noticed a similar trend .
There was the Male group and the Female group .
The male group picked a leader , collected ideas , and one person made a decision .
The female group collected ideas and then tried to get " Consensus " .
The males kept winning the challenges .
Individuals bring a lot to the party .
They increase the breadth of available ideas .
The leader ( if he is good ) , collects the idea , and chooses the one with the most merit .
Trying to get everyone to agree on what is the right choice is a waste of time .

Suspension of Disbelief Art Student Expelled — For Atheism ?
Bob Averill 's classmates at the Art Institute of Portland had finished up their work in a character development class on November 8 , and were chatting to pass the time until class was over .
The discussion moved toward spirituality .
Averill , a Game Art Design student and a devoted atheist — he even runs a blog called Portland Atheist — sidled over and joined the conversation .
It was the last time he'd be in an Art Institute class — within two weeks , he was expelled , less than a year before he'd hoped to graduate .
In the classroom that day , Averill says one young woman was talking about her belief in energy layers and astral beings .
" I jokingly asked her if she believed in leprechauns .
It turns out , she does .
They live on another energy layer , " Averill wrote in notes to himself later that day .
" In the interest of bringing my own view to the discussion , I began to ask her how she knew these things .
Again I know all too well that people can be sensitive about their spiritual beliefs , so I was pretty much walking on glass as I did so . "
Averill says he was n't trying to disprove the other student 's religious beliefs , but " to convince her not to insist that they were scientifically proven . "
The student , apparently offended , complained to the teacher .
Averill was called into a meeting that evening , he says , with the Art Institute 's dean of education , associate dean , and the dean of student affairs .
According to Averill , he was told the meeting was " because of my altercation with [ the other student ] . "
Averill says he pointed out that he'd " only offered a different viewpoint in a discussion that [ my classmate ] had started . "
" They did n't respond well , " Averill told the Mercury .
" Their mantra was ' no discussing religion in school , ' which is fine except that I did not initiate the conversation , she had . "
Averill was suspended for four days , until a judicial hearing with the dean of student affairs .
Immediately after the meeting with the deans , Averill found a classmate who had witnessed the initial conversation , and dragged him to the dean 's office .
" I thought I could clear this up , this is just a misunderstanding . "
( The witness did not respond to an inquiry from the Mercury . )
But the associate dean , Averill says , " told me she did n't want to hear from me again that day .
So she reported it to the dean as rude and belligerent behavior . "
At the judicial hearing , on November 17 , Dean of Student Affairs Ron Engeldinger was more focused on the " rude and belligerent behavior " report from the associate dean , Averill says , than on the initial conversation about religion .
Then Engeldinger , he says , brought up the fact that Averill had had some trouble with three instructors in October .
" The thing is , I had already had a meeting with the associate dean about [ that ] .
We resolved the issue and I apologized to the professors involved . "
Averill was surprised that Engeldinger brought it up again .
" I expressed that I felt discriminated against as an atheist , and he informed me that mine was not a protected class of people , " Averill says .
Averill has since contacted the Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and Freedom from Religion Foundation , based in the Midwest .
He says the Freedom from Religion Foundation told him to seek legal counsel , and he expects the ACLU will respond to his inquiry within 60 days .
According to an emailed letter from Engeldinger , Averill had violated the student conduct policy .
The decision to dismiss Averill was " not the result of a single action on your part , but a series of actions .
I believe that , in several instances , your actions have been aggressive , demeaning , and threatening and that this demonstrates a pattern of inappropriate and unacceptable behavior , " Engeldinger wrote .
The student who complained on November 8 wished to remain anonymous , but her account backs up Engeldinger 's letter .
Her complaint was not the only reason he was sent into the Dean 's office .
" The teacher even told me that my complaint was the ' last straw ' as SEVERAL other complaints were stated before mine . "
However , she says she " did not wish for him to be expelled or get in trouble and I had no idea that it was going to happen until after the fact . "
On Monday morning , November 20 , Averill met with the school 's president , Dr. Steven Goldman , to appeal his dismissal .
" He upheld the dean 's decision to throw me out , " Averill says .
" He offered to re-admit me if I underwent — get this — psychiatric evaluation . "
Goldman declined to discuss specifics without Averill 's permission .
" I can say that we have never suspended or terminated or disciplined or otherwise troubled any student at any time about religious issues .
It 's never even come up as an issue , " says Goldman , who also teaches a comparative religion class at the school .
Given the Art Institute 's liberal arts curriculum , there is no policy against discussing religion or philosophy , " or any other subject as far as I know .
We have an academic community in which people are free to explore ideas . "

Summary :
The fads and big deals that get the press coverage are not important for running a workhorse website .
To serve your customers , it 's far better to emphasize simplicity and quality than to chase buzzwords .
Because we 're in the midst of Web Bubble 2.0 , I decided to dust off some of my Bubble 1.0 columns and retool them for current conditions .
In 1997 , I wrote an Alertbox called The Fallacy of Atypical Web Examples .
In it , I complained about the excessive attention focused on a few highly prominent Web projects that did n't represent the vast majority of websites .
I also warned against emulating these big and famous examples .
The sidebar , Stories from 1997 Revisted , looks at some of those well - hyped stories in light of recent developments .
Indeed , as it turns out , most websites have had to follow very different paths than those trod by the much - discussed sites .
Back then , designers would have been better served by focusing on their own unique circumstances , rather than listening to the Bubble 1.0 hype .
And now ?
History repeats itself .
There is endless coverage of a few atypical stories in the trade press , mainstream media , and even on specialized Internet - focused websites .
Once again , it 's worth remembering : your site is different from the ones in big stories .
Focus on fixing the basics to get a simple and communicative website .
Simple steps do n't get hyped , but they drive much more business value for the average site than the issues that everyone writes about .
Will AOL Team Up With Google or Microsoft ?
( Hype Level : Blue )
This story 's hype has somewhat subsided , but it was going strong for some time .
Whether AOL teams up with one search engine or another is irrelevant for anyone outside the actual deal .
It will be equally irrelevant next month , when the overhyped story again features a big company looking for a search - engine partner .
AOL 's choice does n't matter because it makes no difference to your SEM ( search engine marketing ) strategy .
Each searcher represents a unique selling opportunity .
When Joe Schmoe enters a query for " vacation Mexico " you 'd better get an ad or an organic listing in his face if you 're selling Mexican vacations .
Running fancy ads on one search engine wo n't get you any of Joe 's vacation dollars if he 's searching elsewhere .
Thus , you need to advertise on all the search engines -- or at least those with enough market share to be worth the few minutes required to copy over the text ads and targeted keywords lists from your other campaigns .
Your SEM strategy should n't change one whit when a particular search engine gains a few percent in market share .
Yes , you 're likely to pay them a bit more because they 'll deliver more clicks .
But your only strategic decision is to decide how much to pay per click , which requires you to track conversions and calculate ROI .
Once that 's done , the budget will allocate itself depending on how many clicks each search engine delivers .
There is one twist on this story :
Because the search engines attract different types of users , you 'll likely experience different ROI on clicks from different search engines .
You should thus specify different maximum bids for clicks on different sites .
AOL tends to have low - level users , so AOL clicks are likely to be worth less for B2B sites and high - end B2C sites .
If you 're selling diet pills , however , AOL clicks might be found money .
While most sites should lower their bids on advertising networks that include AOL , some sites should actually bid more for these clicks .
This is the only practical implication of where AOL is allied this month .
Wikipedia vs. Encyclopedia Britannica ( Hype Level : Yellow )
A recent study found that Wikipedia contains only slightly more errors than the Encyclopedia Britannica .
While this might be bad news for EB 's management , it 's a misleading story .
First , while counting errors is easy , it 's not sufficient for evaluating a publication 's quality .
Given time constraints , it 's also important that a topic 's coverage emphasizes the most important points so readers are n't bogged down in minutiae .
Writing style and clarity matter as well , as does point of view .
All of these are more a matter of editorial judgment , and are not as easily scored as factual errors .
Luckily , we do have methods for judging content usability .
Such methods involve letting a set of users loose on the information and seeing how well it supports typical tasks .
Here , the tasks might be anything from writing a high school essay to understanding a bit of a country 's history before going there on vacation .
In any case , the point is : you must judge content relative to the readers and their needs .
It 's a usability question , and must be addressed with empirical studies .
Second , while it's impressive that Wikipedia has corralled so many people to write it for free , it 's not a model that generalizes to corporate websites .
You might be able to collect user - contributed content for a support area , and this is well worth looking into .
But you can't get outsiders to write your product descriptions or news items for free .
Finally , the value of Wikis extends far beyond such highly publicized free - for - alls .
Intranet Wikis , for example , are typically much more interesting .
Several recent Intranet Design Annual winners employed Wikis for lightweight content management .
Because these are internal solutions , you do n't hear nearly as much about them .
However , these practical Wikis are much more important than the overhyped ones :
An intranet Wiki is an example of the trend toward simplified collaboration and non-bureaucratic workgroup support that will change the way we all work in the future .
The Wikipedia 's most exciting aspect is that it's a highly interlinked hypertext .
Most of the time , if you visit for one article , you end up reading five , because the richness of associative links lead you to more and more interesting information that you did n't even know you wanted .
Sadly , the Web has generally lost its foundation as hypertext , and most sites offer only heavily regimented navigation that 's tied into an official information architecture .
Usually , there 's little in the way of associative , " see also " links and local navigation .
Wikipedia shows the benefits of reverting to the view of websites as hypertexts .
Now , if only someone would make a Wiki solution with great usability that average people could use to author strongly interlinked hypertexts .
That would be something worth almost any level of hype .
The way to knock out Microsoft Office is not to reimplement its feature set from two versions ago in a different programming language .
We do n't need bad copies -- we need collaborative authoring of hyperspaces as opposed to linear documents .
Will " Citizen Journalist " Bloggers Wipe Out MSM ?
( Hype Level : Orange )
If you work in the MainStream Media , this question surely seems very important , which is why floods of ink are spilled over it .
But newspaper executives ought to spend more time worrying over what 's happening to their classified advertising .
Classified ads are one of the two advertising forms that work on the Web ( search ads are the other ) .
In fact , as I said in 1997 , classifieds are better on a computer than in print .
Eventually , newspapers will lose this revenue stream , which was once their biggest source of income and underwrote their expensive newsgathering operations .
Yes , newspaper owners who react in time may capture some online classifieds for their holding companies .
But they 'll unbundle those revenues from the company 's news division because Web users go to classifieds as a separate task , not a side effect of reading the news .
Classified revenues will thus be unavailable to underwrite news in the future .
In comparison , whether people decide to read some articles on individually operated websites -- which is really all that blogs are , in a business context -- is a much smaller problem .
For coverage best suited to a first - in / first - out linear listing of stories , mainstream media can ( and do ) run their own blog - like subsites .
For businesses other than newspapers , the " bloggers vs. MSM " hype is of even less importance .
If a blog has a big readership and covers your field seriously , then of course you should treat it like an equivalently sized print publication .
You should grant such bloggers interviews , give them new product previews , and engage them with any other PR activity .
Conversely , you should treat small blogs ( i.e. , most weblogs ) like a tiny community newspaper in a town where you do n't do business .
Sure , you 'll be nice to them , but you wo n't give them an hour of your CEO 's time for an exclusive interview .
From a business perspective , it simply comes down to readership , not media type or whether a publication is owned by a corporation or run by an individual in their pajamas .
Finally , the properties of online media give rise to two related opportunities :
Because you can use your website for PR , it 's feasible to reach out to a broader segment of writers than those on staff at major newspapers and magazines .
While doing individual interviews with small blogs is n't cost effective , you can give them access to your online PR information .
Online media ( whether blogs or MSM - owned websites ) can link to your website when they cover you .
This increases your search engine ranking and makes online coverage more valuable than coverage in a print publication with the same readership .
Readers are more likely to follow the call to action a hyperlink implies than they are to track you down after reading an equivalent story about you in print .
Thus , a blog with 100,000 readers is equivalent to a newspaper with 200,000 readers or more , assuming both are equally targeted to your preferred customer segments .
Google Stock Price ( Hype Level : Red )
The number of column inches spilled over this topic is the most excessive of any over - hyped stories I discuss here .
The price of GOOG is irrelevant for two reasons :
If you work in an Internet profession , you should n't own Google stock in the first place .
Diversification is the number one rule of investing : you should n't put your money into something highly correlated with your own job prospects .
The month you 're laid off is likely to be the same month that Google drops to a quarter of its current price -- that is , whenever the next big Internet recession hits .
Think of somebody working at DoubleClick and investing in Excite in January 2000 .
Not a happy nest egg .
Momentum - driven stock prices have little to do with underlying facts .
Google announced record profits for Q4 , and the stock dropped .
Google lost $ 10B market cap the day its CFO said something that any fool would have known already : there are limits to growth , and the bigger a company gets , any given increment will amount to a smaller growth percentage .
Consider an analogy : if you worked in a tire company , should you obsess over Chevron 's stock price ?
No .
If Chevron went out of business , drivers would simply fill up their tanks at other gas stations .
They 'd drive just as much and put just as many miles on your tires .
In any case , do n't worry about Google : running a search engine is a license to print money .
Google can achieve any desired profitability level by closing down enough non-search projects .
Google 's search engine is not going away , no matter how much its stock rises or falls .
Even if it did , the only impact on other sites would be to replace the GYM acronym with the less - sightly YMA .
Users will still want to search , and they 'll use whatever search engine is the best and fastest in any given year .
That 's all you need to know to plan your own Internet strategy .
Practical Websites ( Not Hyped : Level Green )
The most important story of them all gets almost no hype : we 're seeing more and more simple websites that meet customers ' needs and thus generate substantial business value .
Often the sites that do nothing special are the best : it 's more important to focus on doing basic things right than to chase the latest fad .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday January 28 2006
In the article below we described Falun Gong as a cult .
In doing so , we should have made clear that we were giving the Chinese government 's official view of the movement .
Google , the world 's biggest search engine , will team up with the world 's biggest censor , China , today with a service that it hopes will make it more attractive to the country 's 110 million online users .
After holding out longer than any other major internet company , Google will effectively become another brick in the great firewall of China when it starts filtering out information that it believes the government will not approve of .
Despite a year of soul - searching , the American company will join Microsoft and Yahoo !
in helping the communist government block access to websites containing politically sensitive content , such as references to the Tiananmen Square massacre and criticism of the politburo .
Executives have grudgingly accepted that this is the ethical price they have to pay to base servers in mainland China , which will improve the speed - and attractiveness - of their service in a country where they face strong competition from the leading mandarin search engine , Baidu .
But Google faces a backlash from free speech advocates , internet activists and politicians , some of whom are already asking how the company 's policy in China accords with its mission statement : to make all possible information available to everyone who has a computer or mobile phone .
The new interface - google .cn - started at midnight last night and will be slowly phased in over the coming months .
Although users will have the option of continuing to search via the original US - based google .com website , it is expected that the vast majority of Chinese search enquiries will go through mainland - based servers .
This will require the company to abide by the rules of the world 's most restricted internet environment .
China is thought to have 30,000 online police monitoring blogs , chatrooms and news portals .
The propaganda department is thought to employ even more people , a small but increasing number of whom are paid to anonymously post pro-government comments online .
Sophisticated filters have been developed to block or limit access to " unhealthy information " , which includes human rights websites , such as Amnesty , foreign news outlets , such as the BBC , as well as pornography .
Of the 64 internet dissidents in prison worldwide , 54 are from China .
Google has remained outside this system until now .
But its search results are still filtered and delayed by the giant banks of government servers , known as the great firewall of China .
Type " Falun Gong " in the search engine from a Beijing computer and the only results that can be accessed are official condemnations .
Now , however , Google will actively assist the government to limit content .
There are technical precedents .
In Germany , Google follows government orders by restricting references to sites that deny the Holocaust .
In France , it obeys local rules prohibiting sites that stir up racial hatred .
And in the US , it assists the authorities ' crackdown on copyright infringements .
The scale of censorship in China is likely to dwarf anything the company has done before .
According to one internet media insider , the main taboos are the three Ts : Tibet , Taiwan and the Tiananmen massacre , and the two Cs : cults such as Falun Gong and criticism of the Communist party .
But this list is frequently updated .
In a statement , Google said it had little choice : " To date , our search service has been offered exclusively from outside China , resulting in latency and access issues that have been unsatisfying to our Chinese users and , therefore , unacceptable to Google .
With google .cn , Chinese users will ultimately receive a search service that is fast , always accessible , and helps them find information both in China and from around the world . "
It acknowledged that this ran contrary to its corporate ethics , but said a greater good was served by providing information in China .
" In order to operate from China , we have removed some content from the search results available on google.cn , in response to local law , regulation or policy .
While removing search results is inconsistent with Google 's mission , providing no information ( or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information ) is more inconsistent with our mission . "
Initially , Google will not use Chinese servers for two of its most popular services : Gmail and blogger .
This is a reflection of the company 's discomfort with the harsh media environment - and the subsequent risks to its corporate image .
In an attempt to be more transparent than its rivals , Google said it would inform users that certain web pages had been removed from the list of results on the orders of the government .
But its motivation is economic : a chunk of the fast - growing Chinese search market , estimated to be worth $ 151 m ( £ 84 m ) in 2004 .
This is still small by US standards , but with the number of web users increasing at the rate of more than 20 million a year , the online population is on course to overtake the US within the next decade .
Julian Pain of Reporters Without Borders - a freedom of expression advocacy group that also has its website blocked in China - accused Google of hypocrisy .
" This is very bad news for the internet in China .
Google were the only ones who held out .
So the Chinese government had to block information themselves .
But now Google will do it for them , " he said .
" They have two standards .
One for the US , where they resist government demands for personal information , and one for China , where they are helping the authorities block thousands of websites . "
Local bloggers were already wearily resigned to the change .
" What Google are doing is targeting commercial interests and skirting political issues , " said one of the country 's most prominent , who writes under the name Black Hearted Killer .
" That by itself is no cause for criticism , but there is no doubt they are cowards . "

post # 260 — December 13 , 2006 — a General post
Today marks the official launch of my wife Kathy ’s website , startcooking .com .
Almost exactly one year ago , she came up with the observation that while there are many cooking shows and books , there was little around for the absolute beginner .
Yet many otherwise smart people ( including her husband ) never learned even the basics .
She also saw the opportunity to present cooking guidance in a new way : using the net , iPods and mobile phones .
After a year of much experimentation , many false starts and resolute determination to continue , the site is now live .
StressLimitDesign , who are responsible for my web activities , also designed and run her site .
Here ’s one of her videos :
We ’re off to a good start : iTunes has featured the startcooking .com videocast as a ‘ New and Notable ‘ food podcast , and the startcooking .com blog has been invited to join the 9rules Network , a community of the world ’s best weblogs .
The editorial group of cell phone manufacturer Nokia has chosen to feature startcooking .com in their video podcast directory preloaded on the new N - series phones , alongside elite videocasts including Ricky Gervais , Rocketboom , and Ask a Ninja .
The Men in Aprons blog has said of her site : “ This is where the future lies in food publishing on the web . ”
Take a look .
I ’m incredibly proud of what she has accomplished â€ ” and this is only the beginning !
The key cells are shown in red
The migration of progenitor cells is controlled by a protein called thymosin beta 4 , already known to help reduce muscle cell loss after a heart attack .
The discovery opens up the possibility of using the protein to develop more effective treatments for heart disease .
The University College London ( UCL ) study appears in the journal Nature .
Finding out how this protein helps to heal the heart offers enormous potential in fighting heart disease
Professor Colin Blakemore
Medical Research Council
Progenitor cells are similar to stem cells , in that they have the potential to turn into different types of adult tissue .
However , it had been thought there was no ready source of these cells in the heart , and to carry out repairs they had to be summoned up from the bone marrow .
The latest research is the first to show that they actually reside within the heart tissue itself .
New vessels
The UCL team discovered that under the influence of thymosin ß4 , progenitor cells in the outermost layer of the heart can be stimulated to form new blood vessels .
The researchers bred mice lacking thymosin ß4 in their hearts .
They found the hearts of these mice did not develop normally , the heart muscle showed early signs of tissue loss and blood vessel development was poor .
Closer examination revealed that without thymosin ß4 , the progenitor cells failed to move deeper into the heart and change into the cells needed to build healthy blood vessels and sustain muscle tissue .
To investigate whether the protein could also help mend damaged adult hearts , the researchers took cells from the outer layer of adult mouse hearts and grew them in the lab .
Lead researcher Dr Paul Riley said : " We found that , when treated with thymosin ß4 , these adult cells have as much potential as embryonic cells to create healthy heart tissue . "
Dr Riley said using thymosin ß4 could lead to a more effective way to repair damaged hearts .
He said : " Our research has shown that blood vessel regeneration is still possible in the adult heart .
" In the future if we can figure out how to direct the progenitor cells using thymosin ß 4 , there could be potential for therapy based on the patients ' own heart cells .
" This approach would bypass the risk of immune system rejection , a major problem with the use of stem cell transplants from another source .
" And , it has the added benefit that the cells are already located in the right place - within the heart itself . "
The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation ( BHF ) and the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) .
Professor Jeremy Pearson , BHF associate medical director , said : " These results are important and exciting .
" By identifying for the first time a molecule that can cause cells in the adult heart to form new blood vessels , Dr Riley 's group have taken a large step towards practical therapy to encourage damaged hearts to repair themselves , a goal that researchers are urgently aiming for . "
Professor Colin Blakemore , MRC chief executive , said : '' Finding out how this protein helps to heal the heart offers enormous potential in fighting heart disease , which kills more than 105,000 people in the UK every year . "

Industry experts talk of a ' backlash ' and of the iPod ' wilting away before our eyes ' .
Most disastrously , Apple 's signature pocket device with white earphones may simply have become too common to be cool .
On Tuesday the eyes of iPod - lovers the world over will be on Steve Jobs , the co-founder and chief executive of Apple , when he seeks to allay fears that it could follow Sony 's tape - playing Walkman into the recycling bin of history .
Jobs is widely expected to announce the most ambitious iPod service yet - the sale of feature - length films via the internet for viewing on the devices , which may receive an expanded ' widescreen ' and improved storage capacity .
If downloading movies from a computer to an iPod proves even half as revolutionary as it did for music , the multibillion - pound DVD industry could be quaking .
There are rumours that Jobs will also announce a long expected ' iPhone ' , combining the music function and sleek style of an iPod with a mobile phone .
Industry - watchers warn that the iPod could soon be regarded by teenage cynics as their ' parents ' player ' because a mass - market product rarely equates with edgy fashionability .
Although it has sold nearly 60 million actual iPods and a billion downloaded songs worldwide , cracks have begun to appear in the edifice .
The Zandl Group , a New York - based trends forecaster which regularly interviews a panel of 3,000 consumers aged 25 - 35 , recently picked up its first significant criticisms .
' The iPod is far and away the most popular tech gadget with our panellists - however , for the first time we are hearing negative feedback about the iPod from some panellists , ' said the organisation 's spokeswoman , Carla Avruch .
' Panellists cite that the batteries are not replaceable , so when they die the entire player must be replaced , ' she said .
' We have heard from some conspiracy theorists that the batteries are made to die soon after the warranty ends .
' Other complaints are that iTunes [ Apple 's online music store ] is overpriced and the format is not easily transferred on to other players .
In our ethnography interviews , some long - time iPod-users told us that they have stopped updating their iPods because it's too much work , while other consumers who had bought iPods more recently had not even taken theirs out of the package to set it up . '
She added that the iPod is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success : ' Some backlash is against the ubiquity of the iPod - everyone has those white headphones on the train . '
Analysts warn that the iPod has passed its peak .
From its launch five years ago its sales graph showed a consistent upward curve , culminating in a period around last Christmas that saw a record 14 million sold .
But sales fell to 8.5 million in the following quarter , and down to 8.1 million in the most recent three - month period .
Wall Street is reportedly starting to worry that the bubble will burst .
Tomi Ahonen , a technology brand expert and author , said : ' For the first time the iPod has had two consecutive falls after 17 quarters of growth .
If I were the manager , I would be wanting my people to explain what is going on .
The iPod is wilting away before our eyes . '
He cited new mobile phones with improved MP3 players as the cause of the iPod 's dwindling appeal .
' In 2005 all the big phone manufacturers released phones that play music .
Phones are outselling dedicated MP3 players by six to one .
Apple had the market for MP3 , but they lost it .'
Ahonen , author of Communities Dominate Brands , predicted that in the long term the iPod will have only a narrow audience .
' It will continue to dominate a niche at the top end : if you 're a musician or a DJ you 'll use it because it 's the best , like a photographer with his Nikon camera .
But the average mobile phone user gets a new handset every 18 months , and a quarter of mobile phones sold this year will have an MP3 player .
In the same way as camera phones have pushed cameras to one side , this is an automatic replacement . '
Apple is famously tight - lipped about plans , but its invitations to Tuesday 's event show an Apple logo in front of crossed searchlights and the slogan ' It 's Showtime ' .
Sources in Hollywood , where Jobs sits on the board of Walt Disney , suggest Apple has been trying to secure deals to sell films through iTunes for around £ 8 each .
Apple added video downloads of television shows such as Lost and sporting events to its iTunes service last October .
The company is facing growing competition on every front .
Last week Amazon launched a digital TV and film download service in the US , and the supermarket giant Wal - Mart is in talks with Hollywood studios about a similar website .
Later this year a new online music store , SpiralFrog , will undercut iTunes by offering a huge catalogue of music for free while relying on advertising for its income .
MySpace , the immensely popular social networking site , also poses a threat .
Three out of every four MP3 players sold are iPods , but the device could be challenged later this year by Zune , the contender from Microsoft , whose billionaire founder Bill Gates is not used to losing .
Samsung is also betting heavily on its new K5 , which has the option of built - in loudspeakers .
But commentators argue that the iPod 's status as a 21st - century fashion symbol is assured .
Leander Kahney , author of The Cult of Mac , said : ' I thought they would become passé last year but they have n't , and I do n't see much sign that they will . "
James Beechinor - Collins , editor - in - chief of T3 consumer gadgets magazine , added : ' It 's cool across the board : everyone from my seven - year - old niece to my 60 - year - old uncle has one .
But as the leader Apple needs to keep innovating , not resting on its laurels .
We have n't seen a new product for a year , so Tuesday 's announcement had better be bloody good . '

Eclipsed Sony 's short - lived Betamax video format in the Eighties but , since DVDs were launched in the late Nineties , sales have collapsed .
It would be only a year before anything resembling socialism in power vanished from Westminster .
Yet to the guests gathered for the farewell garden party at 12 Kensington Palace Gardens , London , one day in 1978 , such an outcome must have seemed unlikely .
The aristocratic residents , the Cholmondeley family , hereditary Lord Great Chamberlains , were selling up and moving out after six decades .
The future seemed to belong to the trade unions , to the Soviets - who had begun acquiring diplomatic premises in the street in the 1930s - to the Arabs and Iranians , squelching with money after the 1973 surge in oil prices , and to a horde of spotty , uppity , lefty graduates contemplating the staid notion of a mortgage in the dingy enclaves of Notting Hill , Camden and Islington .
A generation later , the fact that the aristocrats had nothing to worry about is the least surprising aspect of what we know .
What is remarkable is that the very manifestations of upper - class anxieties turned out to be the means which would not only secure the private possession of wealth in Britain but inflate it , in the early years of the 21st century , to staggering new levels .
The trade unions , arguably , paved the way for Margaret Thatcher 's wealth - friendly government in 1979 .
The oil money that began pouring out of Britain into Iran and the Gulf in 1973 began almost immediately to tip straight back : the buyers of 12 Kensington Palace Gardens from the Lord Great Chamberlain were the Saudi royal family , who still own it .
The scary Soviets turned into free - spending Russians who , like the Arabs before them , are bringing the billions they earned from the west for their raw materials , back to the west .
Those graduates turned into Blairites and Cameroons , stars of the bar , the arts and the media , with school fees and million - pound houses .
As for the Marquess of Cholmondeley , he 's still up there : number 666 on the Sunday Times Rich List last year .
In other words , he 's only borderline super - rich .
London has attracted the extremely rich from all over the world as a place to live and tend money at least since the 19th century .
Today , the impression is growing - subjective , anecdotal , hard to pin down yet confirmed by those who deal regularly with the very wealthy - that gigantic fresh waves of private wealth are breaking on Threadneedle Street and Kensington .
The wealth may ebb and flow , but it always leaves something behind for those many , many Londoners whose business it is to make money out of money .
" It 's very difficult , objectively , to say how much bigger the wealth management market in London is , because of privacy .
But it certainly is bigger , " says David Harvey of Step , the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners , a London - based global association of tax lawyers and financial advisers whose members , scattered across the business centres and tax havens of the world , are unashamedly dedicated to helping wealthy families keep their riches from the taxman .
" New York is obviously very stable , but most of the other big centres would have questions over them , " says Harvey .
" Tokyo's gone through a period of depression .
Singapore is relatively new .
Shanghai , you would question that , and Germany was until recently seen as a tax - heavy jurisdiction .
If you 're looking to avoid tax legally , you 're as well going to London as anywhere else . "
The government does n't issue figures on the movements of private wealth in and out of Britain , let alone offer guidance on how much is here already .
The most recent numbers ( from 2003 ) show Britain owning about £ 3.5 trn worth of abroad , and abroad owning about £ 3.5 trn worth of Britain .
The figures have n't changed much from two years earlier ; nor do they distinguish between businesses and individuals .
London 's most expensive residential streets , such as Kensington Palace Gardens , offer a better guide to the changing nature of the private money flooding into the capital .
Even 10 years ago it seemed likely that private residents would vanish from these gigantic , early - Victorian villas , unless they were turned into flats .
They were seen by estate agents as too expensive to sell .
Now at least three , and possibly four , super - rich millionaires , including the world 's third richest man , Lakshmi Mittal , have private residences on the street .
" There was a time when huge houses in somewhere like Kensington Palace Gardens would have been inconceivable as private homes , because they were too big , " says Dick Ford , head of London residential sales for the elite Mayfair - based estate agency Knight Frank .
" Only an embassy or some kind of institution would take them .
Now everybody wants them as private houses . "
Kensington Palace Gardens , sometimes known as KPG to its residents , has never been a street for the poor .
The former kitchen gardens for Kensington Palace were sold off by the royal family for housing in the early 1840s - the freehold still belongs to the Crown Estate , which passes the proceeds of lease sales on to the government - and by 1854 , almost all the houses were complete .
It was always a home of new money , of financiers and traders , alongside the procession of dukes and earls .
But by the 1970s , when the London property market went through the floor - a house on Regent 's Park that Knight Frank sold in 1973 for £ 200,000 was sold a year later for £ 97,000 - it seemed likely that the street would be embassies - only for ever more .
It is still home to the embassies of Russia , Nepal , Lebanon , Kuwait , Japan , Saudi Arabia , Slovakia and the Czech Republic , to the Sultan of Brunei and the Saudi royals , to the French and Finnish ambassadors and the Indian High Commissioner .
But Mittal , estimated by Forbes magazine to have a personal fortune of £ 14.8 bn , now lives there too , in the house once occupied by Baron de Reuter , founder of the Reuters news agency .
According to the Land Registry , he paid just over £ 57 m for the house in 2004 - the same year he blew a reported £ 31 m on a six - day wedding party for his daughter and 1,000 guests in Paris that involved Versailles , a specially built wooden castle , a private performance by Kylie Minogue and 5,000 bottles of vintage champagne .
Mittal 's next - richest neighbour is Len Blavatnik , the Russian - American tycoon , who moved in last year .
One of the most private rich Russians , nobody outside his circle knows exactly how much liquid wealth he owns , but figures of multiple billions are bandied about by the guesstimators and his ownership of stakes in Russian oil and aluminium companies makes this plausible .
He emigrated from the USSR to the US in 1978 ; he did n't begin to investigate the new Russia until 1990 , when he returned from New York with a few million dollars in the bank and a Harvard business degree .
Jonathan
Hunt 's presence as a KPG homeowner is a reminder that far from all the big new private wealth in London being from overseas , the number of extremely rich Britons , and the size of their fortunes , is on the up .
Hunt founded the Foxtons chain of estate agents ; he paid £ 14 m for his house in Kensington Palace Gardens in November , a town house to go with his stately home in Suffolk .
There may be another mega -rich private resident on this street .
A document filed with the authorities in Luxembourg , setting up a trust and available on the internet , gives a house address in Kensington Park Gardens as the home of a fabulously wealthy art collector , the former CEO of an Israeli insurance company .
Unlike Hunt , Blavatnik and Mittal , his suspected purchase has n't previously been made public .
It would be good to be certain ; it would be nice to say that , for this article , I was able to charm billionaires and hundred - millionaires to their doorsteps to tell me why they chose to live in Britain .
But the thing about fantastically wealthy people is that they never need to speak to a journalist .
For every gabby tycoon , every Richard Branson , there are a handful more whose faces will be seen at parties and post - deal press conferences but are otherwise private ; and many more who are , to the public , completely invisible .
I sent registered letters to all the private residents of KPG , asking them why they lived in London when they could live anywhere .
The letter to the Hunts was returned without comment ; the letter to Blavatnik triggered a phone message from an assistant , John Stoneborough .
" He 's a very private chap , " said Stoneborough .
Mittal and the art collector did n't reply .
The government may not track the increasing wealth of British richest residents , but others try to .
Newspaper rich lists go some way towards penetrating the veil .
Yet they often quote , as wealth , shareholdings in companies that cannot be sold without destroying confidence in the company .
There is also the temptation to characterise someone as living in Britain just because they have a house here .
Roman Abramovich , the owner of Chelsea FC , does own homes in Britain and is often described as Britain 's second - richest man after Mittal ; yet he owns residences in Russia and France , too , and his official position , stated by his assistants in Moscow , is that he lives in Russia and only visits the UK for matches .
A firm specialising in studying the spending habits of the very wealthy in Britain , Tulip Financial Research , employs a different approach .
Using a computer model , it looks not at overall wealth but liquid assets - cash and the things people own that could quickly be turned into cash .
The firm 's most recent survey suggests that , in the five years since 2000 , Britons ' liquid assets have increased by more than 50 % , far ahead of inflation , from £ 1trn ( that 's £ 1,000 bn ) to £ 1.6trn .
Tulip follows the standard division of the rich into four classes .
First is the " mass affluent " , 4 % of the population , who now have average liquid assets of £ 144,000 .
Then comes the High Net Worth ( HNW ) individuals , 0.7 % of the population , with average liquid assets of £ 665,000 .
There are 135,000 people in the third class , the ultra-HNWs .
What this means is that Britain contains a community the size of Peterborough whose average liquid assets ( which does n't include their first or second home ) average £ 6.4 m .
This one group , 0.3 % of the population , owns almost half the liquid assets in Britain , and they are on average 66 % richer than they were five years ago .
The last group , the super - rich - the thousand richest individuals in Britain - have seen their liquid assets increase by 79 % in five years , to an average £ 70 m each .
" Of course , " says John Clemens , managing partner of Tulip , " You have to remember that 30 % of the population owns no liquid assets at all . "
If there is more private wealth in Britain , and in London in particular , than ever before , where is it coming from ?
One explanation is that in the past few years London has become , even more than in the 1990s , the world 's conduit of choice for private wealth .
Its generous tax treatment of the mega-rich , particularly those born abroad , makes it in some ways a virtual tax haven .
The old snobberies of race and class have partly yielded to new snobberies of money and beauty .
That , and its combination of attractions - political stability , relatively honest officials , a host of ingenious tax - avoidance specialists , an army of cheap immigrant labour , the luxury shops , restaurants and clubs that charge prices high enough to reassure the wealthy that they are special , the resident celebrities , the cultural energy , the existence of a vast City within the city dedicated to money - mean only New York is London 's peer .
And there , despite the Bush administration 's income tax cuts that have gone disproportionately to the very wealthy , the US Inland Revenue Service and Wall Street regulators have a reputation for being fastidious with the rules .
" The IRS is perceived to be a much more burdensome tax regulator than the UK Revenue , " says David Harvey .
" The UK tax authorities take the approach that it 's much better to fight over a small piece of a very large cake . "
Seb Dovey , of the London - based wealth management consultancy Scorpio Partnership , says : " I would n't say as a professional centre for private banking London overtakes Switzerland , but it does punch higher than any of the other European countries ... if you 're an emerging rich person or a multi- billionaire , London is the place to be .
Those from the Middle East and India would use Switzerland as a bank - deposit location , and their active money in play would be managed out of the UK . "
" I think the super - rich want to have two homes , one in New York and one in London , " says a British hedge fund manager .
" The bulk of the super - rich want to spend their lives in these two cities , but if they 're based in New York , they would pay a lot more tax than here . "
" The great problem with the US is it 's very self - sufficient , " says Caroline Garnham , a tax lawyer with the City firm Simmons & Simmons .
" Great wealth has been made in the US , but people from elsewhere do n't go there for investment management because the US does n't understand the rest of the world or different cultures .
" It 's recognised that we have the leading investment managers in this city , leading not only in ability but in innovation .
Although Switzerland has a huge amount of wealth sitting in bank accounts , usually they 're just put in bonds , and have n't really moved into the equity market , let alone all the other fun stuff we put it into . "
One of the big tax advantages for super - rich British residents who are n't British - born is this country 's unique " non-domiciled " tax rule , which allows tens of thousands of wealthy people to avoid paying tax on income earned overseas .
Almost four years after an investigation by Nick Davies in this newspaper showed how the Swedish billionaire Hans Rausing , then described as " the richest man in Britain " , had in one year received more from the Treasury in refunds and grants than it was getting from him in tax , the government shows no sign of closing the loophole .
" Non -domicile is much bigger than people think .
It 's massively important , " says the hedge fund manager .
The rise in the price of oil since 1998 has given the Gulf countries an extra $ 1trn in revenue , he points out , but since 2001 , Arabs benefiting from that windfall are less likely to manage their wealth from the US .
" I know this bloke who runs a $ 50 bn fund of Arab money .
He 's been investing in America for 30 years , but every time he goes there now , he 's treated like a convict .
He has to show his passport at every meeting . "
The hedge fund manager 's Arab story chimes with another explanation of the London private wealth phenomenon - that , worldwide , there is simply more money sloshing around in the pockets of private individuals .
Until recently , most of the globe ( the US was the main exception ) functioned according to three assumptions of what was " normal " .
One was that large chunks of the economy would be owned by the state and run by civil servants on modest salaries .
A second was that the exceptionally wealthy should pay much higher taxes than other people ; third , that governments would stop individuals moving their money freely from one country to another .
These assumptions have been challenged or rejected across great swathes of the planet , including Britain , China , the former Soviet bloc , India , south - east Asia , Africa and Latin America .
State enterprises have been privatised and the civil servants who ran them turned , in many cases , into millionaires .
Economic orthodoxy sees high taxes on the rich as an evil - in Russia and other former Soviet - bloc countries , the rich and the poor now pay exactly the same income tax .
Company bosses are not embarrassed to take millions , even billions , out of firms in salaries , dividends , bonuses and stock options , while big money flies across most state borders as lightly as birds .
The Thatcher government pioneered the change in Britain in the 1980s , privatising industries , cutting taxes and abolishing controls on the movement of money in and out of the country .
The rest of the world followed ; the tighter the state 's grip on the economy in the first place , the faster wealth flowed into fewer private pockets .
Russia was , and remains , the most extreme example .
Until 1986 , the number of legally rich Russians in Russia was , in effect , zero .
In a recent article in the British magazine Wealth , Andrei Movchan of the Moscow firm Renaissance Capital Management estimated that there are 500 super - rich Russians with assets of more than $ 300 m , another 5,000 with upwards of $ 30 m , most of it already moved abroad , and as many as 115,000 million - dollar households .
For a country which is only spending $ 85 a year per person on health care , it is a staggering concentration of wealth in a few hands in the space of a single generation .
And while much of that money is stashed in Switzerland , Cyprus or Delaware , a good proportion has flowed into the UK .
But there is a third possible analysis , which suggests it 's not so much that private wealth in London is greater than it was 10 or 20 years ago - it 's just that those who have it are more inclined to flaunt it .
Tatler , the 300 - year - old magazine that documents the social doings of Britain 's high - visibility rich and which has , according to its editor Geordie Greig , the richest readership in Europe , recently ran a spread headlined Party Awards 2005 .
The party narratives were replete with artificial snow in midsummer , a private tour of the Sistine chapel , caviar by the kilo , synchronised swimmers and naked women on white horses , foie gras risotto covered in gold leaf , a masked ball in a St Petersburg palace and live black fish flown in from the Caribbean to swim in the bottom of flower vases .
The last award reads : " Best effort in the face of adversity - Bettina Bonnefoy , for going ahead with her Peter Sellers - themed party on the day of the London bombs . "
" I think we are in an age of staggering riches being spent and earned , " Greig told me .
" People will pay £ 250,000 at a charity auction for their son to escort David Beckham on to the pitch at a football match . "
When you 're a billionaire , you do n't live anywhere , and neither does your money .
Or rather you live everywhere , and so does your money .
" I think the wealthy house their money everywhere , and London seems a logical place , " says Rory Sherman , of the US magazine Trusts & Estates .
To the modern super - rich , she says , anyone with a mere $ 5 - 10 m is " trailer trash " .
" I think the fabulously wealthy have become more fabulously wealthy , and they have lots of places to put their money . "
There are no billionaires sitting in a room staring at their wealth stacked , liquid , in bundles of dollars around them .
The bulk of their wealth is always in motion , breathing , expanding and contracting .
Only by the sparkly feathers that flutter to the forest floor , the golden spoor on the trail and the remnants of its prey can you tell that there was a billion and that it passed this way .
The billions never stand still for long .
Those who hope to catch a piece of them as they race by have to be adept at slicing bits off them as they pass , or by helping them to pause and feed , or by providing a nice rough bit of bark for them to scratch on .
And London is very good at that .
The fact that many of the wealthiest " British " residents actually reside everywhere and nowhere , between London and Moscow or Monaco or countless other cities and islands around the world , deflects attention from a deeper truth - that often the thing which most concerns the very rich is time , rather than geography .
Their only true domicile is their own family , and the most obsessively fretted - over question is how to pass wealth from generation to generation without it being eaten away by taxes or thrown away in casinos and divorces by children and grandchildren .
The ultimate symbol of true wealth in 2006 is not a Bentley or a house in Kensington Park Gardens , or a diamond as big as the Ritz .
It 's something called a " family office " - a full - time team of lawyers and accountants dedicated to the sole aim of protecting and cultivating one family 's wealth further into the future than most governments , let alone ordinary people , would ever dream of planning .
David Harvey of Step suggested that a sensible rich family would be advised to think 100 years ahead .
" For a lot of families , the question is : can we take it as far as generation three ? " he says .
For the Benzon family , which in the 19th century occupied the Kensington Palace Gardens house now owned by Jonathan Hunt , the answer was " no " .
Great wealth can , and does , vanish swiftly if heirs prove incapable of bearing its weight .
The iron merchant Ernest Benzon drew guests as notable as Felix Mendelssohn , George Eliot and Robert Browning to his lavish salon .
In 1889 , Benzon 's grandson , also called Ernest , described what then happened to the family fortune in his book , How I Lost £ 250,000 in Two Years .
The chapter headings chronicle the dissolving of a fortune worth between £ 20 m and £ 110 m in today 's money : Coming of Age , Racing Experiences , Gambling Experiences , The Ring , Money Lenders , Monte Carlo and Pigeon Shooting , London Tradesmen .
Before losing his last shilling on the roulette wheels of the riviera , Benzon once gambled away £ 10,000 at chemin - de - fer during a 10 - minute wait for a train .
Seb Dovey says there are about 2,500 active family offices across Europe , three times that number in the US - worldwide , perhaps 11,000 family offices , each with more than $ 100 m to invest .
" It 's significant that the rate of new family offices opening up has increased , " he says .
" We now estimate about 20 new family offices are being set up across Europe every month .
In the UK , that means two or three offices a month . "
When you talk to someone such as Caroline Garnham , an expert in setting up family offices with the City law firm Simmons & Simmons , you realise that the notion of the very rich being citizens of their own family , rather than citizens of any one country , is n't entirely conceptual .
Garnham , whose firm dominates one of the City 's newer , larger steel - and - glass skyscrapers , talks about " family governance " .
Her advice to a super - rich family involves them moving from what she calls " dictatorship " and setting up a kind of family parliament .
The tedious , ultra - specialised task of setting up a legally watertight constitution for a family democracy is one in which London excels , Garnham says .
" A lot of this wealth structuring on a global basis happens out of London and this can often be with someone who has no connection with England whatsoever ...
They wo n't keep their money here , because of our inheritance - tax regime , but they will have it managed here . "
A rare academic study of the changes in wealth and income in London in the past few decades , Unequal City : London in the Global Arena , by Chris Hamnett , points out that as it has grown wealthier , the capital has gained population .
In 15 years , London has grown by the equivalent of a city the size of Frankfurt .
It has also grown more unequal .
The gap between the richest and the poorest citizens has increased radically .
At the same time , the direst Marxist predictions of the consequences of rampant capitalism have not come about - inequality , says Hamnett , is n't the same as polarisation .
There are n't more poor Londoners now than there were 30 years ago ; but most Londoners are poorer relative to the very richest residents .
In this , London , and Britain as a whole , could be seen to be following in the footsteps of the US - an economic paradigm for Thatcher and for Gordon Brown .
Across the Atlantic , even some conservative commentators are uneasy about the degree to which the wealth of the very richest has grown , while the wealth of the middle classes has stagnated or shrunk .
Yet London and the country of which it is capital may be trapped , hooked on the world 's money to a degree that would be difficult to replace .
A million Britons work in the money management business ; Britain has a trade surplus of more than $ 25bn in financial services .
For every campaigner and journalist pointing out the apparent inequity of the non-domiciled rule and other tax - avoidance schemes , there is a lobbyist or three arguing that , far from being too much like an offshore tax haven , Britain should be more like one , a sort of extra-large Grand Cayman , because that 's what we 're good at in a competitive world , working the game of fees and percentages with the planet 's rich .
" I 've always thought that England would benefit a lot by becoming an ' offshore haven ' , " says Garnham .
" It 's already halfway there .
Why not make more of it ?
We 're only a tiny little island " .
When Guy Colombier pulls his economy car up to a Paris pump , he allows himself just 15 Euros ( $ 18 ) worth of gas - barely enough for three gallons .
Since prices started rising rapidly earlier this year , says Mr. Colombier , a printing press worker , " I drive a lot more slowly ... and I 'm looking for a place to live closer to where I work . "
Colombier 's pain is shared by drivers all over Europe , where fuel prices are the highest in the world : a gallon of gas in Amsterdam now costs $ 7.13 , compared with just $ 2.61 in America .
The contrast in prices and environmental policies - and the dramatically different behaviors they inspire - signals a widening transatlantic energy gap .
And it raises the question : Does Europe offer America a glimpse of its future ?
Indeed , while Europeans have learned to cope with expensive fuel ( mostly due to taxes ) , there 's scant evidence yet that US drivers are adopting their conservation tactics .
" Societies adjust over decades to higher fuel prices , " says Jos Dings , head of Transport and Energy , a coalition of European environmental NGOs .
" They find many mechanisms . "
Chief among them , say experts , is the habit of driving smaller and more fuel - efficient cars .
While the average light duty vehicle on US highways gets 21.6 miles per gallon ( m.p.g. ) , according to a study by the Paris based International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , in Paris , its European counterpart manages 32.1 m.p.g .
" European consumers are very sensitive to fuel economy and sophisticated about engine options , " says Lew Fulton , a transport analyst with the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) .
" European car magazines are full of comparisons of fuel costs over the life of a vehicle . "
Europe 's cars : 40 percent are diesel
That approach has given a special boost to diesel cars , which make up more than 40 percent of European car sales , compared with just 4 percent in the US .
Just ahead of Colombier in the line at the gas station Thursday was Nicole Marie , a high school teacher , who was using her husband 's diesel Audi , rather than her own gasoline - powered car , to take her daughter to Normandy for a final week of vacation by the sea .
" I only use my car in town , " she says .
" We bought a diesel car deliberately because it is cheaper to run . "
That is partly because the French government encourages the use of more - efficient diesel fuel by taxing it less heavily .
Only in four European countries is diesel more expensive than gasoline , the way it is in America .
But efficiency alone does not explain the huge disparity between fuel - use figures on either side of the Atlantic : European per capita consumption of gas and diesel stood at 286 liters a year in 2001 , compared to 1,624 in the US , according to IEA figures .
The nature of cities plays a role , too .
" America has built its entire society around the car , which enabled suburbs , " points out Mr. Dings .
" European cities have denser centers where cars are often not practical . "
In Paris , for example , about half the trips people make are by foot , by bicycle , or on public transport , says UNEP's Mr. Fulton .
In America , that figure is more like 20 percent .
Impact of fuel tax
" The single most effective measure " that has brought down motorists ' fuel use in Europe , however , is taxation , says Dings .
On average , 60 percent of the price European drivers pay at the pump goes to their governments in taxes .
In Britain , the government takes 75 percent , and raises taxes by 5 percent above inflation every year ( though it has forgone this year 's rise in view of rocketing oil prices , and the French government has promised tax rebates this year to taxi drivers , truckers , fishermen , and others who depend heavily on gasoline . )
On August 8 , for example , the price of gas in the US , without taxes , would be $ 2.17 , instead of $ 2.56 ; in Britain , it would be $ 1.97 , instead of $ 6.06 .
" There is really good evidence that higher prices reduce traffic , " says Stephen Glaister , a professor of transportation at London 's Imperial College .
" If fuel prices go up 10 percent ... fuel consumed goes down by about 7 percent , as people start to use fuel more efficiently , not accelerating so aggressively and switching to more fuel - efficient cars .
It does change people 's behavior . "
The US authorities , however , " are unwilling to use resource price as part of their strategy " to conserve oil , says Lee Schipper , head of transportation research at the Washington - based World Resources Institute , an environmental think tank .
" The biggest hole in our policy today is fuel taxation , " he adds .
" Tax increases are something Americans should do but do n't know how to do , and I wonder if they will ever be able to .
" Consumers want muscle cars , manufacturers say they make what the consumer wants , and the government panders to both constituencies , " Mr. Schipper continues .
" It 's a vicious cycle . "
Europeans may drive smaller cars , but there are few signs that the current record gas prices are making them drive less .
Germans who live close to the Czech Republic can drive across the border to take advantage of the lowest prices in Europe , but most people " cannot react to [ the prices ] because they still need to drive a lot , " says Jürgen Albrecht , an official with Germany 's largest auto club , the ADAC .
" I ca n't say I 'm not going to drive the 50 kilometers [ 31 miles ] to work because of the high gas prices .
It does n't work that way . "
" Most people have no alternative , particularly those who live in rural areas , " says Paul Hodgson of the RAC , the British motoring association .
" A lot of motorists tell us that if there was a decent and affordable public transport system they would use that ... but we are still a long way from having an alternative . "
Prices vary widely across Europe .
The Greeks , for example , are getting off comparatively lightly , with just $ 4.32 a gallon .
But they 're not exactly celebrating .
On the Greek isles , where almost everything comes in by boat , residents are hit even harder by rising fuel prices .
" Whatever you do , it all comes back to gasoline , " huffs Dimitra Vogiatzi , who sells produce on the far - flung island of Patmos , as she slams closed her massive ledger .
Ms. Vogiatzi has been obliged to raise her prices , and more and more of her customers are buying on credit , she complains .
" Imagine if we need a doctor , or someone has to have a baby , " she adds .
" All the boat fares , coming and going - is n't that gasoline ? "
Though shipping costs in the Aegean may remain high , European Union regulations are forcing vehicle manufacturers to make their products even more efficient than they already are .
Though their primary motivation is to reduce CO2 emissions , in line with targets set by the Kyoto Protocol , bio - fuel and hybrid cars are still so rare that increased fuel efficiency is the fastest route to lower emissions , says Dolf Gielen , an expert at the IEA .
CO2 emissions from new European cars fell by 12 percent from 1995 to 2003 , according to Mr. Gielen , and manufacturers have voluntarily pledged to reduce them by a further 14 per cent by 2008 , he adds .
European governments are proposing tax breaks to encourage motorists to take advantage of these possibilities .
Belgian drivers who buy a low - emissions vehicle get a 15 percent price rebate ; Spain cuts $ 865 from the cost of registering a car if it replaces a car using leaded gas more than 10 years old ; Hungary waives registration tax for hybrid cars .
End of the road for SUVs ?
Though US vehicles ' fuel efficiency has improved greatly over the past 30 years , overall consumption has risen in the past decade because consumers and manufacturers have used the leeway offered by the new technology to buy and build bigger and more powerful vehicles , experts say .
Environmentalists wonder whether the current price spike in gas prices might lead to a lasting change in US behavior .
" The exciting thing now is that we are almost at the real high point of prices in 1981 , " says Mr. Schipper .
" We 'll see if American manufacturers , authorities , and drivers realize that these prices may now be locked in . "
" Sales of big SUVs have been dropping in the last few months , " points out Fulton .
" We are now at the point where people believe this is real and they are reacting .
The longer it goes on , the more they will react . "

Cell phones are capable of providing more information about us and our whereabouts than we usually realize .
We familiar with the ability of cell phones to be used to track users ' locations , but now the FBI has begun using them for eavesdropping even when they are turned off .
The FBI 's activities came to light in the course of the prosecution of two alleged members of the Genovese crime family .
John Ardito and Peter Peluso had their Sprint Nextel phones tapped by the FBI in the course of their investigations , which itself is not unusual .
The government went a step further in their case : not only were their phone calls recordded , but so were all conversations carried out in the presence of the defendants ' cell phones .
US District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled last week that such " roving bugs " were legal under US wiretap laws .
Investigators had asked for judicial approval for a roving bug during their investigation because the meetings allegedly conducted by the defendants took place in 12 different restaurants , in automobiles , on a boat , and a number of other places .
Given the degree of difficulty involved in bugging the numerous locations , another federal judge overseeing the case approved the roving bug .
In his memorandum opinion , Judge Kaplan described the roving bug as a " listening device " installed in the defendants ' cellular phones that functioned regardless of whether the phone was powered on .
Many models of cellular phones , however , can have their microphones remotely activated via a downloadeven without the knowledge of the owners .
That could be what happened with Ardito and Peluso 's cell phones .
It is also possible that the FBI installed a bug directly on the phones .
We have known for some time that anyone carrying a powered - on cell phone can have their physical location easily tracked .
Last year , a federal judge ruled that the government could use that ability to track US residents with minimal judicial oversight .
Now we are reminded that carrying a cell phone enables the government and others to listen to your conversations , even when you 're not using your phone .

Protecting Data Privacy through Hard - to - Reverse Negative Databases is an entertaining paper .
Here 's the problem it tries to solve :
You want to store personal details but you do n't want people to be able to mine the database .
For example you might want to store brief personal details with a social security number so you can verify that someone is a member of some organisation , but for security reasons you do n't want a hacker to be able to get a list of members even if they steal the entire database .
That sounds like an impossible set of requirements .
But the trick is this : instead of storing the personal details you store a list of all possible bitstrings representing personal details that members do n't have .
Insane right ?
If the personal details are just 256 bits long , say , then to store details for 100 people , say , the database needs 2256 - 100 entries .
That 's vast .
But the database of non-members is highly compressible .
Let me lift an example directly from the papers .
Suppose the personal information is three bits long and we wish to store the entries { 000,100,101} .
Then the non-entries are { 001,010,011,110,111} .
The non-entries can now be compressed using a wildcard scheme { 001 , * 1*} .
The * 1 * represents all of the entries fitting that pattern from 010 to 111 .
This turns out to be quite a compact representation .
It 's beginning to look plausible .
And here 's the neat bit : SAT can be translated into the problem of finding valid database entries from the wildcard representation .
So extracting entries is provably NP - complete , despite the fact that we can check entries in a reasonable amount of time ( for suitable definitions of ' reasonable ' ) .
Anyway , I still have a whole slew of objections , and the actual compression scheme proposed has holes in it that can result in false positives .
But what initially sounded implausible is beginning to look workable .
PS
You can also read about this at the Economist but I 've tried to spare you the irrelevant fluff :-)
The New York Public Library is taking part in the project
In its blog , the search giant said it would temporarily stop scanning copyrighted texts until November to allay concerns about the plan .
The company 's library project aims to put millions of volumes online and accessible everywhere via the web .
Google 's plan has come under fire from several groups who object to what they say are violations of copyright .
Google is pumping $ 200 m ( £ 110 m ) into creating a digital archive of millions of books from four top US libraries - the libraries of Stanford , Michigan and Harvard universities , and of the New York Public Library - by 2015 .
It is also digitising out - of - copyright books from the UK's Oxford University .
' Grave misgivings '
Google says the aim is to make the text of the world 's books searchable by anyone in the world , especially when it comes to out of print and obscure texts .
Google 's procedure shifts the responsibility for preventing infringement to the copyright owner rather than the user , turning every principle of copyright law on its ear
Patricia Schroeder , Association of American Publishers
" But we know that not everyone agrees , and we want to do our best to respect their views too . "
In an attempt to assuage concerns about copyright , Google has stopped scanning books which are in copyright until November .
The pause is designed to allow publishers to tell Google which books should not be included in the scanning programme .
But the changes do not seem to go far enough for leading publishers .
The trade body of the US publishing industry , the Association of American Publishers ( AAP ) , said it still has " grave misgivings " about the project .
" Google 's announcement does nothing to relieve the publishing industry 's concerns , " said AAP president Patricia Schroeder in a statement .
" Google 's procedure shifts the responsibility for preventing infringement to the copyright owner rather than the user , turning every principle of copyright law on its ear , " she added .

The Drug War as a Socialist Enterprise by Milton Friedman From : Friedman & Szasz on Liberty and Drugs , edited and with a Preface by Arnold S. Trebach and Kevin B. Zeese .
Washington , D.C. : The Drug Policy Foundation , 1992 .
Chapter Seven ' I 'his chapter is adapted from Prof. Friedman 's keynote address presented at the Fifth International Confcrcnce on Drug Policy Reform in Washington , D.C. , on Nov. 16 , 1991 .
In 1972 , almost twenty years ago , President Nixon started a war on drugs - the first intensive effort to enforce the prohibition of drugs since the original Harrison Act .
In preparation for this talk today , I re-read the column that I published in Newsweek criticizing his action .
Very few words in that column would have to be changed for it to be publishable today .
The problem then was primarily heroin and the chief source of the heroin was Marseilles .
Today , the problem is cocaine from Latin America .
Aside from that , nothing would have to be changed .
Here it is almost twenty years later .
What were then predictions are now observable results .
As I predicted in that column , on the basis primarily of our experience with Prohibition , drug prohibition has not reduced the number of addicts appreciably if at all and has promoted crime and corruption .
Why is it that the only observable effect on policy of the conversion of predictions into results has been that the government digs itself deeper and deeper into a bigger and bigger hole and spends more and more of your and my money doing harm ?
Why is it ?
That 's both the most discouraging feature of our experience and also the most intriguing intellectual puzzle .
In our private lives , if we try something and it goes awry , we do n't just continue and do it on a bigger and bigger scale .
We may for a while , but sooner or later we stop and change .
Why does not the same thing happen in governments policy ?
There is little point to my discussing in detail before this group the case for the legalization of drugs .
Everyone in this room knows it .
You have had numerous workshops featuring discussions by people who are more intimately familiar with the details than I am .
I want rather to examine the puzzle that I raised .
And in doing so , I 'm going to rely on an adage that Bardett traces back to 325 B.c. : " Cobbler , stick to your last . "
My last is economics , the study of how society organizes its limited resources to meet the many and varied wants of its members .
Fundamentally , society 's resources can be organized in only one of two ways , or by some mixture of them .
One way is by market mechanisms : from the bottom up .
The other way is by command : from the top down .
The market is one mechanism .
Authoritarian organization - the military is a clear exarnple -- is the other .
The general gives the order , the colonel passes it on to the captain , and so on down the fine .
In the market , the orders come the other way .
The consumer walks into a store and gives the order and the orders go up .
These two mechanisms have very different characteristics and are suited to handle very different problems .
Some element of both mechanisms is needed in any society .
And every society has some mixture of both .
We know the extreme cases in which authoritarianism predominates and we know what happened in those extreme cases , particularly since the fall of the Berlin WaIl .
But we also have large elements of both mechanisms in our own society .
During the many years that I 've been peripherally engaged in discussing the issue of drugs - I should emphasize that 's not a vocation of mine ; it 's an avocation - I 've been impressed by two things .
First , most literature that I have read on drugs takes it for granted that the drug problem is a special case to be discussed in terrns of specific issues associated with drugs -- the substances involved and so on rather than a special instance of a more general phenomenon .
It is taken for granted that the drug problem has to be discussed in terms of its own merits and requires an extensive knowledge of the details .
From my point of view , it 's as if one were to discuss the problem of theft in terms of the object stolen .
So , theft of automobiles is one problem .
Theft of hand bags is another .
In the same way , people treat the prohibition of drugs as if it were a problem to itself .
Second , one consequence of that approach to the drug problem is that many opponents of the war on drugs propose alternatives that would be just as bad .
They believe that the problem is not the basic mechanism being used , but simply that the government has n't done it right .
Most of these alternatives would involve going from the frying pan to the fire .
Such reformers believe that if they could write the law , the law would be enforced the way they wrote it .
That is an illusion .
What happens to a law has little relation , in general , to the intentions of the people who wrote it .
The people who wrote the law on drugs did not intend to kill hundreds of thousands of people in the process .
They did not intend to have a system under which prisons and prisoners would grow like Topsy .
In general , the actual effects of any law are often , if not usually , the opposite of the intentions of the people who wrote it , a phenomenon that Congressman Richard Anncy [ R - Texas ] , in an earlier guise when he was a simple professor , termed the " invisible foot of government . '
Let me illustrate with a few quotations from letters that I have received .
First : " Instead of merely decriminalizing drugs , let 's have the government make available drugs free to every user . "
That would obviously take the profit out of the business .
The idea is that somehow or other we ought to treat drugs as a free good .
But there are no free goods ; there 's no free lunch .
It 's not free ; somebody would have to pay for it .
So , we ought to tax the taxpayer to subsidize people who use drugs !
More important , it seems obvious that if those " free " drugs were really available , they would be distributed in Europe and elsewhere where there 's a paying market .
How can you restrict the quantity demanded of free drugs ?
The only way to do so is to have strict rules for distributing it .
That leads to an authoritarian system determining who gets the drugs and how much - as open to abuse and corruption as our present system .
Second - I promise you , these are honest - to - God quotes from letters I have received ; I have n't made them up - " Legalize all drugs now illegal to be available in state stores . "
We have a lot of experience with state stores in the liquor area .
The Twenty - First Amendment repealing the Prohibition Amendment repeated only federal prohibition ; states were left free to engage in any measures they wanted to control alcohol .
Indeed , the Twenty - First Amendment specifies that transporting alcohol or liquor from a dry state to a wet state shall be regarded as a federal offense and shall be prevented by the federal government .
Some states stayed dry , at least for a while ; others set up state liquor stores ; and still others left it to the market .
The people who say drugs should be distributed only in state stores argue that that would facilitate control of distribution to minors , to ensure that drugs were n't abused , and so on .
Has that been the effect of state liquor stores ?
Hardly .
I know about the state of New Hampshire best because we used to have a second home there .
Some New Hampshire stores are located right on the border of Massachusetts in order to attract as many customers from Massachusetts as possible .
As that indicates , state stores give government an incentive to promote , not discourage , the consumption of alcohol .
In addition , many states have now discovered that they are not really doing very well with the state stores and there is a movement on to sell them off and privatize them .
Again , it 's a silly idea .
Third : " Abolish the critninality of the use of drugs ; establish a federal monopoly to sell drugs . "
That is , you are going to have the Post Office handle the distribution of drugs .
What do these solutions have in common ?
They propose to cure a problem caused by socialism by some more socialism .
It 's the standard recourse of the alcoholic : more of the hair of the dog that bit you to get over the inevitable hangover .
The fundamental problem we face is not the war on drugs - although some of us are most interested in that issue .
The war on drugs and the harm which it does are simply manifestations of a much broader problem : the substitution of political mechanisms for market mechanisms in a wide variety of areas .
To illustrate , I want to go beyond the war on drugs .
We all recognize that the war on drugs is destroying our inner cities .
But if I were to ask any one of you what is the next most important factor that is destroying the inner cities , I suspect a great many would agree with me that the next most important factor is our defective educational system , the terrible schools in our inner cities , schools which do not teach , but which are essentially places to keep kids off the streets for a certain number of hours a day .
Both failures have the same source .
The war on drugs is a failure because it is a socialist enterprise .
Our schooling is deteriorating because it is a socialist enterprise .
Except possibly for the military , education is the largest socialist enterprise in the United States .
There are a few loopholes : private schools to which parents can send their children if they can afford to pay or , in the case of parochial schools , if they have certain religious views .
However , ninety percent of all kids are in government schools .
And that socialist institution performs the same as most other socialist institutions .
There are some general features of a socialist enterprise , whether it's the Post Office , schools , or the war on drugs .
The enterprise is inefficicnt , expensive , very advantageous to a small group of people , and harmful to a lot of people .
That was true of socialism in Russia , it was true of socialism in Poland , and it 's true of socialism in the United States .
You all know Adam Smith 's famous invisible hand , in which people who intend to promote their own interest arr led by an invisible hand to promote a public interest which it was no part of their intention to promote .
I have for many years argued that an inversion of that maxim is also true :
People who intend only to pursue the public interest are led by an invisible hand to promote private interests which it was no part of their intention to pursue .
That is the case regarding drugs .
Whose interests are served by the drug war ?
The U.S. government enforces a drug cartel .
The major beneficiaries from drug prohibition are the drug lords , who can maintain a cartel that they would be unable to maintain without current government policy .
In education , one major set of beneficiaries from the socialized educational system are high - income people , living in affluent suburbs , who are able to have good public schools .
Those government schools serve as a tax shelter for them .
If they send their children to private schools , the tuition they pay is not deductible in computing their federal income tax ; but local taxes are deductible .
Another set of beneficiaties are the educational bureaucracy , including officers and employees of teachers ' unions , and politicians who are able to use the educational system as a source of patronage .
On the other hand , a great mass of people are harmed by the low and declining quality of our schooling system .
And the people who are harmed worst of all are the people who live in the inner cities .
They know it .
In public opinion polls on privatizing the school system through vouchers that give parents freedom to choose , blacks are the most supportive group , with two - thirds or more favoring a voucher system .
Yet , with the exception of Polly Williams of Wisconsin , not a single important black political leader has come out in favor of vouchers !
These are by no means the only examples .
Go down the list of our major national concerns , of which the crime and lawlessness spawned by drug prohibition is certainly one and poor educational performance another .
We have major problems in medical care .
Total costs for medical care have risen from four percent of the national income to thirteen percent in forty years .
Why ?
Again , because the government has increasingly socialized medical care and there is a very strong movement to go all the way to a complete socialization of medical care .
Largely as a result of greater government involvement , the cost of a day spent in the hospital , cost per patient day , was twenty - six times as high in 1989 , after adjustment for inflation , as it was in 1946 .
Another example is housing .
Why does the Bronx in New York look like a war zone that 's just been bombed ?
Primarily because of rent control .
Again , an attempt by the government to socialize the housing industry .
We have had extensive and expensive public housing programs .
In the course of those public housing programs , more dwelling units have been destroyed than have been built .
I challenge you to find any major problem in the United States that you cannot trace back to the misuse of political mechanisms as opposed to market mechanisms .
By any reasonable measure , the United States today is a little over fifty percent socialist .
That is to say , more than fifty percent of the total resources in the country , of the total input , is directly or indirectly controlled by governmental institutions at all levels - federal , state , and local .
Yet we in the United States have the highest standard of living of any country in the world .
We are a very rich and prosperous country .
It is an extraordinary tribute to the productivity of the market system that , with less than fifty percent of the resources , it can produce the kind of standard of living and the kind of society we have .
You are working from January 1 to close to June 30 , or maybe somewhere after June 30 , to pay for the direct and indirect cost of government .
What fraction of your well - being comes from those government - controlled expenditures ?
Is it anything like fifty percent ?
I doubt very much that many of you would say it is .
The question that my puzzle raises is why is it that private enterprises are successful and government enterprises are not ?
One common answer is that the difference is in the incentive , that somehow the incentive of profit is stronger than the incentive of public service .
In one sense , that 's night ; but in another , it 's wrong .
The people who run our private enterprises and the people who run our government enterprises have exactly the same incentive .
In both cases , they want to promote their private interests .
The people who go into our government , who operate our government , are the same kind of people as those who are in the private sector .
They are just as smart , in general .
They have just as much integrity .
They have just as many altruistic and selfless interests .
There is no difference in that way .
But as Armen Alchian , an economist at UCLA , once put it , " The one thing you can depend on everybody to do is to put his interest above yours . "
That is a very insightful comment .
The Chinese who are on the mainland are not different people from the Chinese who are in Hong Kong .
Yet , the Mainland is a morass of poverty and Hong Kong has been an oasis of relative well being .
The people who occupied West Germany and East Germany before they were reunited had the same background , the same culture .
They were the same people , but the results were drastically different .
The problem is not in the kind of people who run our governmental institutions versus those who run our private institutions .
The trouble , as the Marxists used to say , is in the system .
The system is what is at fault .
The difference is that the private interest of people is served in a different way in the private and the governmental spheres .
Consider the bottom line they face .
Here 's a project that might be suggested , to begin with , by somebody in the private sector or by somebody in the government sphere , and appears equally promising in either case .
However , all good ideas are conjectures ; they are experiments .
Most are going to fail .
What happens ?
Suppose a private group undertakes the project .
Suppose it starts to lose money .
The only way that they can keep it going is by digging into their own pockets .
They have to bear the costs .
That enterprise will not last long ; people will shut it down .
They will go on to something else .
Suppose government undertakes the same project and its initial experience is the same : it starts to lose money .
What happens ?
The government officials could shut it down , but they have a very different alternative .
With the best of intentions , they can believe that the only reason it has not done well is because it has not been operating on a large enough scale .
They do not have to dig into their own pockets to finance an expansion .
They can dig into the pockets of the taxpayers .
Indeed , financing an expansion will enable them to keep lucrative jobs .
All they need to do is to persuade the taxpayer , or the legislators who control the purse that their project is a good one .
And they are generally able to do so because , in turn , the people who vote on the expansion are not voting their own money ; they are spending somebody else 's money .
And nobody spends somebody else 's money as carefully as he spends his own .
The end result is that when a private enterprise fails , it is closed down ; when a government enterprise fails , it is expanded .
Is n't that exactly what has been happening with drugs ?
With schooling ?
With medical care ?
We are all aware of the deterioration in schooling .
But are you aware that we are now spending per pupil , on the average , three times as much as we were thirty years ago , after adjustment for inflation ?
There 's a general rule in government and bureaucratic enterprises : the more you put in , the less you get out .
As these socialized enterprises have broadened their reach , it has become more and more difficult for the public to control them .
That 's the fundamental problem we face in respect of drugs .
How do we make the vested interests of the government change their policy ?
As we have all discovered , that is not an easy job .
The people running the drug program have a great deal more resources than we have .
They can command the attention of the media to make reform or repeal seem not respectable , not reasonable .
After all , they will say over and over , the people who urge the legalization of drugs are simply ignorant or naive or do n't understand what 's going on .
We , they will say , are the experts and know what works and what does n't .
One way that has been effective in eliminating or reducing bad government programs is private competition .
The Post Office used to be just as inefficient in delivering parcels as it is in delivering first - class mail .
But because the postal statutes gave it a monopoly only on first class mail , UPS was able to take away their business .
Then Federal Express and similar enterprises took away much of their first - class business , and substitutes for mail such as fax emerged .
The same process is underway in drugs .
Unfortunately , however , private competition is not an effective solution as long as the government completely prohibits some drugs - just as first - class Postage proper is still a government monopoly , because it is illegal for private enterprises to offer similar general carrierservices .
In such areas , we do need to change the law .
My thesis can be expressed in two main points , and that is where I want to close and open up to questions from you .
First , do not fool yourself into thinking that solutions will in fact work that simply involve changing the way the political mechanism is used .
They will not escape the defects common to the political mechanism wherever it is used .
Let me emphasize , I am a limited - goverriment libertarian , not an anarchist libertarian , though I have a great deal of sympathy for anarchist libertarians , including the fact that my son is one .
However , the role I assign to the government is limited to defending the country , providing law and order , helping us to determine the rules under which we operate , and adjudicating disputes .
This is a very limited range of responsibilities .
A major cost of the broader extension of governmental activity is that it prevents government from doing well those things that I believe only it can do effectively .
When people talk about innocent victims of the war on drugs , they very often forget the people who suffer robberies , theft , murder - not because they are caught in the crossfires of drug battles , not because they are the victims of addicts who are trying to support their habit , but simply because so large a fraction of law enforcement resources are being used to try to control drugs that there are not enough resources left to prevent theft , burglary , and the rest in the community at large .
The second lesson I believe that we should learn , and it 's probably the more important lesson , is that we are likely to make more progress against the war on drugs if we recognize that repealing drug prohibition is part of the broader problem of cutting down the scope and power of the government and restoring power to the people .
If we treat drug prohibition as an isolated instance , maybe the effort to repeal it will be successful , as the effort to repeal alcohol prohibition was in the 1920s .
But I believe that our chances of success are greater if we recognize that the failure of the war on drugs is part of a much broader problem , that the reason to end the war on drugs is also the reason to end the socialization of medicine , the socialization of schools , and so on down the list .
Questions and Answers Arnold S. Trebach : I have a two - part question , one from the floor and one with a bit of my own amendment .
Should every produced good be subject to the free market ?
And the second part of the question was , if I look back at Adam Smith and once , with great foreboding , I read the book , I think Adam Smith accepted the idea of , as you say , a limited role fbr government , including the administration of justice and I think the phrase was " the common defense . "
Many drug warriors would claim that because of the unique nature of drugs , they fit properly within the administration of justice and the common defense .
Professor Friedman :
On the first half of the question , I believe that there is a case for keeping certain things out of the rnarkct .
I believe it 's not desirable to have a market in atomic bombs .
But the number and the list of things for which you can really justify prohibition is very limited .
And the only justification is always in terms of the existence of innocent victims , not in terms of paternalistic concern .
The major effect of drug prohibition is to multiply the number of innocent victims , not to reduce them .
That 's why I do n't think that any general rule you might have that some products , such as atomic bombs , hydrogen bombs , and a few things like that , should not be traded in the market applies to the case of drugs .
On the second question , I do n't believe that if Adam Smith were here today he would agree with that interpretation you gave to his strictures .
The reason why the prohibition of drugs is not a case of the administration of justice is because the drug user , whether he 's smart or foolish or not , harms primarily himself .
There is a case for doing something when the drug user harms other people , and we do .
The case of alcohol is very simple .
The person who drives when he 's drunk clearly should be prosecuted fbr that .
It 's the act of driving while drunk , not the act of drinking , for which he should be prosecuted .
Similarly , if people under the influence of drugs do a similar thing , the act of doing that is what should be prosecuted , not the ingestion of drugs .
I 've always argued that there are two arguments against drug prohibition .
One is from principle : that people ought to be responsible for themselves and the government has no business tclling me what to ingest .
I 'm sure this is the argument you 've heard very effectively from Dr. Szasz .
The other is the question of expediency .
For a moment , waive the question of principle .
are you doing more harm than good ?
The evidence that you are seems to me so overwhelming that it appeals to people who will not join you on matters of principle .
I give you some examples .
My fundamental attitude toward drug prohibition initially developed out of the issue of principle .
My good friend Bill Buckley was initially in favor of drug prohibition .
In fact , my son David once wrote an article attacking Bill 's views on prohibition under the title " Is Bill Buckley a Communicable Disease ? "
Bill had argued in favor of drug prohibition on the ground that one drug user would transmit his addiction to others , and in that way infect them .
David said in his piece that Bill 's ideas infect others .
To take that to an extreme case - I do n't think this was David 's example ; it 's mine - Karl Marx 's Das Kapital surely has ended up killing more people than have ever been killed by alcohol , tobacco , and so - called illegal drugs combined .
But our principles of free speech say people ought to be free to read Marx .
And that was what David meant by his " Is Bill Buckley a Communicable Disease ? "
Well , Bill has switched and he is now a very strong proponent of drug legalization , not on grounds of principle but on grounds of expediency , on the ground that the eflbrt has faded and ought to be terminated .
I do n't believe there 's any way in which you can say that the prohibition of drugs is administering justice .
Justice to whom ?
Is it justice to the people of Colombia who are being murdered because we can't enforce our own laws ?
That 's hardly justice .
Trebach : I was n't saying that .
I was wondering if Adam Smith would .
I know how you feel about ...
Friedman : [ Simultaneously ]
I know .
No , I do n't think Adam Smith would .
Adam Smith was a very great man , a very smart man .
Trebach :
This question says you supported Pinochet or advised Pinochet .
Friedman : I never advised Pinochet .
I never supported Pinochet .
Trebach :
We 'll throw that one away .
Friedman : But hold on .
No , I do n't want to evade the question .
Trebachi :
All right .
Friedman : Chile was a case in which a military regime , headed by Pinochet , was willing to switch the organization of the economy from a top - down to a bottom - up mode .
In that process , a group of people who had been trained at the University of Chicago in the Department of Economics , who came to be called the Chicago Boys , played a major role in designing and implementing the economic reforrns .
The real miracle in Chile was not that those economic reforms worked so well , because that 's what Adam Smith said they would do .
Chile is by all odds the best economic success story in Latin America today .
The real miracle is that a military junta was willing to let them do it .
As I said to begin with , the principle of the military is from the top down .
The principle of a market is from the bottom up .
It 's a real miracle that a mititary group was willing to let a bottom - up approach take over .
I did make a trip to Chile and I gave talks in Chile .
In fact , I did meet with Mr. Pinochet , but I never was an adviser to him , and I never got a penny from the Chdean government .
But I will say that that process led to a situation in which you were able to get an election which ended the military junta .
You now have a democratic government in Chile .
There is as yet no similar example from the world of entirely socialist states .
So , I was not an adviser to Pinochet .
I was not an adviser to the Chilean government , but I am more thanwifling to share in the credit for the extraordinary job that our students did down there .
Trebach : I believe you were a supporter of Ronald Reagan .
Friedman : I still am , but not of everything that he did .
Trebach : OK
The real question is - as I say , I was grouping these togcther - How do you feel about his drug war ?
I think I know the answer , or we know the answer .
Friedman :
The answer is clear .
I think that the drug war was a mistake .
There are two areas in which I think the Reagan administration performed very badly .
One was the drug war and the other was foreign trade .
In the case of foreign trade , he laid the groundwork , unfortunately , for what has become a protectionist drive and movement by agreeing to the so - called voluntary import quotas on Japanese cars .
That was an enormous mistake , went against all of his stated principles .
As I once said to a Republican Club of students at Stanford , I am a libertarian with a small l and a Republican with a capital R . And I am a Republican with a capital R on grounds of expediency , not on principle .
I believe that I can do more good by having influence with the Republican Party than I can by joining the Libertarian Party , although I have great sympathy with the Libertarian Party .
I believe it 's very desirable that they do well .
Ronald Reagan was a man of principle .
He is the first president in my life who was elected because the people had come around to agreeing with him , rather than because he was looking at polls and saying what the people wanted to hear .
He was saying exactly the same thing in 1980 when he was nominated , as he was in 1964 when he supported Mr. Goldwater .
What changed was not what he was saying , but what the public had come to believe .
His fundamental principle - that government is too big , that government is a problem - is correct .
Unfortunately , the war on drugs was inconsistent with that fundamental principle and he should not have departed from it by supporting the war on drugs .
I may say to you also that I would have no hesitancy to say that to Ronald Reagan .
You know , people have a great misconception about Mr. Reagan .
They think that somehow he only listens to what he wants to hear , but that 's not true .
Trebach :
There are several questions along this line .
In light of the objective standing of the U.S. below the EEC by every standard that is , the European countries - that measures quality of life and the reality that every EEC country is socialist , how can you argue for laissez - faire capitalism or , this says , robber baron - - robber bandit , free market capitalism as a path , you know , for a better life for Americans ?
Friedman : I understand it .
Well , I 'm delighted that you have some socialists in this organization .
Trebach :
We have a few .
Friedman :
When I talk to you about dnig legalization , I 'm talking to the converted .
But when I 'm talking to you about socialism , I 'm not talking to the converted , so I 'm being more useful .
In the first place , I do not agree with the factual statement in that remark .
I do not agree that the EEC countries have a better quality of life in general .
The typical difference between the EEC countries and the United States is that the United States is a country of much greater diversity and most of the EEC countries have relatively homogeneous populations .
In almost all cases , the few immigrants they have are a great cause of trouble .
You wo n't find a Turk in Germany or a Moroccan in France who will subscribe to the view that life is better in the EEC countries than it is in the United States , while we in the United States have a much greater variety and have been much more open and welcome to people .
In the second place , when you come to measure socialism , there 's little more than a dime 's worth of difference between the degree of socialism in those countries and in this .
The major difference is that those countries , some of them , have more government - owned and operated enterprises .
That 's the major difference .
Our only government - owned and operated enterprise is the Post Office .
On the other hand , our government has extended its influence in considerable measure primarily by regulation and rules and restrictive arrangements .
And in that case , far more so than most of the European countries .
In an issue that 's very closely related to the drug issue , our Food and Drug Administration is a much more restrictive and socialist enterprise than its counterparts in England and other countries , as is evidenced by the drug lag .
In general , it takes a good deal longer to get a drug approved for use in the United States than it does in Britain or Canada or Germany .
Indeed , that 's another case in which what 's intended to save people 's lives is killing far more people than it is saving , namely , our Food and Drug Administration , which I am in favor of abolishing .
So , I do n't agree that those countries are very much more socialist .
What I do think is a very different thing , and I 'll go back to Adam Smith for this .
Trebach : Good idea .
Friedman :
When Cornwallis was defeated at Yorktown in the Revolutionary War , a young man came to Adam Smith and said that it was going to be the ruination of Britain .
Adam Smith replied , " Young man , there 's a deal of ruin in a nation " Now what do I mean by that ?
I mean that we have the highest standard of living , in reality , of any country in the world .
Audience member : For the few .
Friedman :
Not for the few , for the many .
I beg your pardon .
We have a more equal distribution of income , in general , than most of the countries you 're talking about .
The distribution of income ...
[ Audience members making inaudible statements ]
I 'm sorry , I could n't hear most of it .
Trebach : Excuse me .
Would you mind sending your questions up ?
The mike is n't picking it up , so please cool it .
Friedman : Somebody shouted out , " For the few , not for the many . "
It is true that there are a few who have enormously high incomes .
Too many of them .
But the fact is that when I speak about the level of living , I am speaking about the level of living of the great majority of the people in the country .
There 's inequality of income in every country .
Those inequalities am far greater in socialist countries than they are in capitalist countries .
If you compare the level of living of people at the top and people at the bottom , the difference was much wider , for example , in the precollapsed Soviet Union than it is in the United States .
The issue of distribution of income is a very serious and important issue and it's worth discussing ; I do n't mean it is n't .
But I think that the statement I have made is correct for the great bulk of the American people .
The evidence is simple .
How do people best vote ?
With their feet .
Where do people try to immigrate ?
Some people do try to get into the European countries .
In particular , the people from the former communist countries try to get into the less socialist countries of Western Europe .
But so far as the United States is concerned , people from all over the world seek to immigrate here .
They are n't coming here to be made miserable .
They are n't coming here to be exploited .
And you can't say that they 're all fools ; they know what they 're getting into .
So , I reject the idea that this is a country in which a few stand on the backs of the multitudes , which is a standard argument of the Marxists .
Well , I 'm glad to see there are a few non-socialists here , too .
Trebach :
It 's very clear , simply from the applause , that the Drug Policy Foundation attracts a very wide range of opinions on all manners of things .
Friedman :
And so you should .
Trebach :
Thank you .
This may well be the last question , sir .
There have been several like this .
Looking at the future , in a market of retail sales , of re-legalized drugs , what do you think of the suggestions that have been made about how you model those reforrns ?
For example , one of our board of directors members , Lester Grinspoon of Harvard , has suggested a harmfulness tax based upon the relative harmfulness of the drugs .
Senator Galiber of the New York State Senate , who is here , put in a bill that would have made all the illegal drugs - all of them - available legally , but would have regulated them like alcohol .
They 've used precisely the alcohol model .
For example , you could get the drug if you were an adult ; you could n't have the retail store near a school , etc .
What thoughts do you have on the future ?
Friedman :
There is no chance whatsoever in the near future or the distant future of getting what I would really like , which is a free market .
As a first step on the right road , I believe the right thing to do is to treat drugs , currently illegal drugs , exactly the same way you treat alcohol and tobacco .
Not because that 's the best way , not because that 's the ideal arrangement , but because it's an arrangement that people know , that is in existence .
It involves , in a certain sense , the least kind of change , so that the law you 've described by Senator Galiber seems to me the right direction in which to go - night direction in the sense again of a practical compromise , not of ultimate principle .
It dramatises the dilemmas faced by the young Joseph and Mary after the latter became pregnant out of wedlock .
And in a case of life imitating art , the star of Catherine Hardwicke 's The Nativity Story is also finding her own impending motherhood to be a source of woe .
According to reports , Pope Benedict XVI is to boycott this weekend 's Vatican premiere of Hardwicke 's retelling of the events leading up to the virgin birth because 16 - year - old Keisha Castle - Hughes , who plays Mary , has herself become pregnant outside of marriage .
The new film from the director of Thirteen and Lords of Dogtown had been expected to receive the Pope 's blessing at the special screening , but it is understood the Catholic church disapproved of Castle - Hughes ' " situation " .
However a spokesperson for the Vatican said the Pontiff had previously committed to another function in Turkey and would never have been able to attend the premiere .
" The surprise would have been if he had [ attended ] , " the spokesperson added .
Hardwicke is due to arrive alongside fellow cast member Shohreh Aghdashloo .

Neue Studien Erde erhitzt sich schneller als befürchtet
Forscher kommen in neuen Studien zu alarmierenden Ergebnissen : Die Rückkopplungseffekte , mit denen sich die Erwärmung automatisch verstärkt , seien bisher unterschätzt worden .
Der Anstieg der globalen Temperaturen müsse um 15 bis 78 Prozent nach oben korrigiert werden .
Pop , soda , coke , whatever you call it there are three reasons why we should stop drinking it : Caffeine , Aspartame , and High - Fructose Corn Syrup .
Never having been a coffee drinker , I used to pride myself in not joining the flocking masses waiting in line for their morning fix at the nearest Dunkin ’ Donuts .
It was n’t until I started working at one of my clients where they provided all - you - can - drink free soda of your choice that I began my own hook .
It was Coke .
At first I drank one a day .
It was a nice way to get me over that afternoon slump .
Soon after , I added one more in the morning .
This felt great for a little while and continued to be the pattern until I switched clients .
Unfortunately , I could n’t carry the free soda machine with me to the new client .
My habits , however , did not get left behind .
High - Fructose Corn Syrup
At that time I started reading about the effects of high - fructose corn syrup .
High - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is produced by processing corn starch to yield glucose , and then in turn processing the glucose to produce a high percentage of fructose .
It ’s essentially a cheap substitute to beet and cane sugar .
Here are some of the side - effects of a diet high in fructose :
Converts to fat more than any other sugar .
This may be one of the reasons Americans are continually gaining more weight not less weight .
Dr. George Bray , principal investigator of the Diabetes Prevention Program at Louisiana State University Medical Center told the International Congress on Obesity that in 1980 , just after high fructose corn syrup was introduced in mass quantities , relatively stable obesity rates began to climb .
By 2000 , they had doubled .
This may be one of the reasons Americans are continually gaining more weight not less weight .
Inhibits copper metabolism .
Copper deficiency leads to defects in the connective tissues and arteries , and bone fragility .
As one chiropractor observed , “ the bodies of the children I see today are mush . ”
The culprit is the modern diet high in fructose and low in copper containing foods , resulting in inadequate formation of elastin and collagen , the proteins that help hold our bodies together .
After reading about these side effects I stopped drinking coke altogether , but replaced it with something probably worse : Diet Mountain Dew .
Caffeine
About 2 months had passed since I cut out any intake of high - fructose corn syrup .
But I noticed something … I had become an addict .
It now took about three Diet Mountain Dews spread strategically throughout the day to continue having the same mental benefits I had had before .
Anytime I had missed one , I got these nagging headaches and became fatigued .
Although I felt alert , it was more difficult to concentrate and the energy I felt was more akin to an unnatural buzz than a true feeling of energy .
Again I started to do some research on some of the ill - effects of caffeine .
Here is a list of the top 10 caffeine - related health effects from teecino.com ( where you can read more details surrounding these 10 points ) :
Cardiovascular Problems Stress Emotional Disturbances Blood Sugar Swings Gastrointestinal Problems Nutritional Deficiencies Male Health Problems Female Health Problems Adrenal Exhaustion Aging
So with this new - found knowledge I went cold turkey on caffeine and replaced it with my third and final soft drink : Fresca .
Aspartame
Initially Fresca seemed like a great segue to becoming free of the caffeine addiction .
There was no high - fructose nastiness to make myself fat or my bones weak , the caffeine was non-existent and best of all there were no calories thanks to a wonder - drug called aspartame .
Things could n’t have been better .
I even found that I enjoyed drinking Fresca more than any of the other previous sodas .
I liked it so much I drank 2 - 3 a day .
But after two months , I felt worse than when I was addicted to caffeine .
Weird symptoms began to pop up such as blurriness of eyesight and random headaches .
I began feeling depressed , listless and was constantly fatigued .
It was so bad that I wondered if I had developed Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Depression .
My wife , knowing that I ’m normally a very happy and energetic person , noticed that I was becoming irritable and argumentative .
It just was n’t me anymore and I could n’t understand why I was feeling this way .
Pulling out a notepad I began to do a personal inventory .
It seemed that all of my areas of life were generally balanced except for diet .
It was then that I questioned some of the ingredients in Fresca and began to study the side effects of Aspartame .
There are over 92 different health side effects associated with consuming Aspartame !

Wall Street Journal has more details on what I had exclusively reported yesterday , Google ’s new improved video plans .
Ironically , WSJ flubs the biggest piece of news in the story , which is buried at the very end of the story …
Google has developed its own digital - rights - management software to protect downloaded videos from piracy .
….. Excuse me , but this is yet another DRM system , that will now duke it out with Microsoft ’s DRM and Apple ’s DRM , amongst scores of pretenders .
Techdirt Mike , vigilant as ever caught this and points out that AP and Reuters did not even mention this in their reports on the pending news .
And he sums it up nicely , “ we now have yet another incompatible copy protection system that is likely to lock people in ( while also opening up new security holes ) . ”
Buried .
Back at the start - up , we were shifting gears .
After six months of talking about shipping a product , we needed to ship a product and nothing gets everyone ’s attention like a deadline .
The good news was that QA had been doing its job and there was a pile of work in our bug database .
The bad news was that no one had looked at the database in months .
We had a Rent - a- VP at the time , and as temporary executives go , he was sharp .
He quickly deduced our goal — “ Ship a Quality Beta ” — but he also quickly discerned that we had no idea about the quality of the product because of our pile of untriaged bugs .
He called a meeting with me , the QA manager , and the tech support manager .
His advice : “ Triage every single bug in this fashion and tell me how many bugs we ’ve got to fix in order to ship this Beta . ”
And then he left .
Every single bug .
537 bugs .
You gotta read the bug , possibly reproduce it , and then make an educated team decision .
Let ’s assume an average of five minutes per and you ’re talking about … crap … 45 hours of bug triage .
It ’s an impossible task .
I ’ve got features to fix , people to manage , and I have n’t seen the sun on a Saturday in two weeks .
Let ’s take a brief segue and talk about the huge value that exists in a bug database .
In just about every company I ’ve worked at , the only source of measurable truth regarding the product is the bug database .
Marketing documents get stale .
Test plans become decrepit .
Test case databases slowly mutate into the unusable personal to do list of QA .
The bug database is the only source of data regarding your product .
I know this .
I know that once I ’ve effectively scrubbed the bug database , I ’ve got the single most informed opinion regarding the product .
But .
537 unscrubbed bugs ?
40 + hours of bug drudgery ?
Please .
I ’ve got a product to ship .
My normal approach when faced with an impossible task is analysis because analysis gives you data , which in turn allows you to make a confident decision .
So , I do what I did above : carefully estimate how long it will take to complete … 5 minutes x 537 = impossible .
This fair estimate freezes me with fear .
How in the world am I going to get my other five jobs done whilst scrubbing 40 hours of bugs ?
Once I ’m good and lost in that fear , the impossible task , I ’m no longer thinking abut getting the task done , I ’m thinking about the fear .
My advice is : START .
“ But Rands … I ’ve got three hundred tests to run and one day to … ”
Stop .
Go run one test .
Now .
“ Wait , wait , wait .
Rands .
Listen .
They need this spec tomorrow @ 9 am … ”
Shush .
Quiet .
Go write .
Just a paragraph .
Now .
Welcome to Trickle Theory .
Our Villain
My traditional first move when managing impossible tasks is to put the task on a to - do list .
“ There !
It ’s on the list .
AaAaaaaaah … did n’t that feel good ?
It ’s on the to - do list , which must mean it will be done at some point , right ? ” Wrong .
Putting the task on the to - do list does one thing : it avoids The Critic .
Every story needs a villain and in this piece our villain is The Critic .
This is your internal voice which does careful and critical analysis of your life and he ’s gained a powerful place in your head because he ’s saved your butt more than once .
He ’s the one who told you that offer from the start - up smelled too good to be true .
You remember that company , right ?
The one that simply vanished three months after you declined that stunning offer letter .
It was The Critic who said , “ How in the world can they afford to give anyone this type of offer when I do n’t even understand their business model ? ”
The Critic was the one who calmed you inner nerd and convinced you to not buy HDTV three years ago and he told you not to trust that fast talking engineering manager who emphatically guaranteed his team would be done on schedule .
The Critic said , “ People who talk fast are moving quickly to cover up the gaps in their knowledge . ”
The Critic was right .
The Critic gained credibility , but for this piece , he ’s still the villain .
I know it feels great to get that impossible task on the to - do list .
I know it feels like you actually did something , but what you ’ve done is avoid conflict .
You know that if you start considering the impossible task , The Critic is going to chime in with his booming voice of practicality , “ RANDS , what are you THINKING ?
NO ONE ADDS FEATURES TWO WEEKS BEFORE A SHIP DATE ! ”
“ Ok , alright , you ’re right , but the boss wants it and when the boss gets something in his head it takes a lot of work to blah blah blah … ”
Now , you ’re justifying , you ’re worrying , and you ’re arguing with The Critic when what you should be doing is starting .
Nothing Happens Until You Start
Let ’s first break down impossibleness .
For the sake of this article , there are two types of impossible tasks .
First , there are impossibly dull tasks .
This is work which requires no mental effort , but is vast in size .
Bug scrubbing is a great example of this .
At the other end of the spectrum are impossibly hard tasks .
These are tasks like , “ Hey Rands , we need a new product by Christmas .
Yes , I know it ’s October .
Ready .
Go ! ”
Oddly , attacking both boring and hard tasks involve the same mental kung - fu where your first move is starting .
Such silly , trivial advice … start .
Still , take a moment and examine your mental to - do list or just look at your written one .
How many terribly important tasks have been there more than a month ?
More than a year ?
Embarrassing , huh ?
It ’s not that they ’re not important ; it ’s just that you did n’t begin and you did n’t begin because the moment you think about starting , The Critic weighs in , “ How will even start ?
You ’ll never finish !
You don ’ t even know where to start . ”
Begin .
Go read the first bug .
Do n’t think about how many are left .
Go to the next one and watch what happens .
In just a few minutes , you ’ll have made something resembling progress .
Two more bugs and it ’ll start to feel like momentum .
Progress + momentum = confidence .
The moment you see yourself tackle the smallest part of the impossible task , the quieter The Critic becomes because you ’re slowly proving him wrong .
Iterate
The second piece of advice is simpler than the first , which is hard to imagine .
Iterate .
Once you ’ve kicked yourself out of stop , iterate becomes a little easier , but if you ’re truly tackling an impossible task , The Critic simply is n’t going to shut up .
“ Wow , you ’ve closed five bugs …
Only 532 more to go , sport ! ”
Iteration and repetition are n’t going to silence The Critic .
Progress will .
A beautiful thing happens when you point your brain at an impossible task .
Once you ’ve begun and start chewing on whatever the task is , you ’ll start to see inefficiencies and begin to fine - tune your process .
This is how an engineer who tells you , “ It ’s going to take two weeks to write that code ” comes back after the weekend and says , “ It ’s done ” .
He honestly believed that it was a two week task , but as soon as he started chewing on the problem , he realized he ’d written similar code a year ago , which , with a half a Saturday of tweaking , provided the same functionality .
The same applies to small , duller impossible tasks .
Above where I estimated it ’d take 5 minutes of triage for each bug , I did n’t take into consideration that after about 50 bugs , I was going to be really good at scrubbing bugs .
I ’d start to identify people who generally wrote good bugs versus those who did n’t have a clue .
I ’d learn the problematic areas of the product and learn where I could make snap judgments regarding bug viability .
What was a five - minute triage window for the first 50 bugs was one minute for the next 50 and that turned into an average of 15 seconds per bug for the second hundred when I really got rolling .
This means that my original estimate of needing 45 hours for bug scrubbage turned out to be roughly 7 hours .
What I thought would take a week is actually going to take one solid day .
Do not believe that this gives you the authority to slice every single estimate by 5 .
Turns out that impossible tasks , upon consideration , actually are terrifically hard .
Believe this ; an individual tends to be very bad at work estimates until they ’ve begun the work .
Mix -it- Up
Crap .
You ’ve been saddled with an impossible task and after a weekend of no sleep you have confirmed , yes , the task is impossible .
In fact , you ’ve started , you ’ve iterated , and you still have no clue how to actually complete the task .
Story time .
This spring I had a crew come up to clear some brush on the property .
Now , the property is a pleasant combination of oaks , bays , and redwoods , but much of it had become overgrown and inaccessible .
My first thought when I moved in was , “ Hell yes , I ’ve got clearing mojo ! ”
My thought after one weekend of clearing , when I was partially successful at clearing up 50 square feet of 5 ACRES OF FOREST was , “ Impossibly boring ” .
This attitude gave me a unique curiosity when the crew of three men showed up , chain - saws in hand , to clear the land .
They had no issue starting and they clearly had the iteration thing down , but they also demonstrated the last and most component to Trickle Theory : mix - it - up .
It went like this : one guy would cut and drag brush into the fire , another would cut trees down , and the third would trim fallen trees .
This went on for a while and then they ’d all switch .
Now , drag guy was cut guy , cut guy was hauling wood guy and trim guy was stack guy .
During lunch , I sat down and asked , “ When do you guys switch jobs ? ”
“ When we ’re bored . ”
Beautiful , beautiful Trickle Theory .
How cool is this ?
If you ’re working on an impossibly hard or impossibly dull task and you find yourself mentally blocked by boredom or confusion , stop and do something else .
The benefits of stopping are stunning .
First , stopping smacks
The Critic squarely across the face .
See , he ’s also the voice in your head saying , “ Uh , if we do n’t work hard on this , we ’re screwed ” .
And the longer you sit there grinding out the impossible task when you do n’t want to , the louder he gets .
Second , stopping to do something else is fun for you and your brain .
It breaks the cycle of whatever tasks you ’re doing and points your grey matter at a whole new problem and your brain loves new , it consumes new with vim and vigor , and that puts spring in your proverbial mental step .
Third , and most important , even though you are stopping , your brain is bright enough to keep background processing the impossible task .
This is why we find so much inspiration in the shower ; you ’re stopping and letting your brain wander , and your brain is smart .
Your brain knows how important it is to rewrite that feature in two days and your brain is always working on that feature whether you know it or not .
“ Wait , wait , wait .
Rands , let me get this straight .
Your suggestion when I ’ve got a looming impossible deadline is to stop working on my deliverables ? ”
What I ’m saying is , when you ’re facing an uphill mental battle with yourself regarding the impossible task , it ’s time to choose another battle … that is n’t a battle .
Entropy Always Wins
My life appears to be an endless series of tasks which are geared to slightly tidy up my world .
Viewed as a whole these tasks represent a lot of work .
Viewed against the actual amount of entropy in play in my small part of the world , these tasks represent a futile effort .
Fact is , your world is changing faster than you ’ll ever be able to keep up with and you can view that fact from two different perspectives :
1 ) I believe I can control my world and through an aggressive campaign of task management , personal goals , and a CAN DO attitude , I will succeed in doing the impossible .
Go me !
- or-
2 ) I know there is no controlling the world , but I will fluidly surf the entropy by constantly changing myself .
Surfing entropy takes confidence .
This is n’t Tony Robbins confidence , this is a personal confidence you earn by constantly adapting yourself to the impossible .
Sweden has a head start on many countries in its use of renewables
The attempt is being planned by a committee of industrialists , academics , car manufacturers , farmers and others .
The country aims to replace all fossil fuels with renewables before climate change damages economies and growing oil scarcity leads to price rises .
According to the Guardian newspaper , a Swedish minister said oil dependency could be broken by 2020 .
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is worried that oil supplies are peaking , shortly to dwindle , and that high oil prices could cause global economic recession .
" Our dependency on oil should be broken by 2020 , " said Mona Sahlin , Sweden 's minister of sustainable development .
" There shall always be better alternatives to oil , which means no house should need oil for heating , and no driver should need to turn solely to gasoline . "
The Scandinavian country , which was hard hit by oil price rises in the 1970s , now gets the majority of its electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric power .
In 2003 , 26 % of all energy consumed came from renewables , compared with an EU average of 6 % .
The oil committee is to report to parliament in several months .
Swedish energy ministry officials said they expected the panel to recommend further development of biofuels derived from its substantial forests .
It was also expected to expand other renewable energies such as wind and wave power .
Alittle - noted provision of the recently passed Defense Authorization Act allows President Bush to send in the military to police any trouble spot in this country regardless of the wishes of state governors .
On Oct. 17 , President Bush signed the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 .
The act grants the military the authority to seek from Congress $ 462.8 billion .
In addition , Senate and House conferees added another $ 70 billion in supplemental defense spending bringing the overall total of the act to an unprecedented $ 532.8 billion .
The supplemental funding provides billions of dollars to help “ reset ” Army and Marine Corps equipment , which is wearing out faster than planned because of the war in Afghanistan and the occupation of Iraq .
A highly controversial and little - known aspect of the act “ contains a widely opposed provision to allow the president more control over the National Guard [ by adopting ] changes to the Insurrection Act , which will make it easier for this or any future president to use the military to restore order without the consent of the nation ’s governors , ” Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Ver. ) said .
Americans “ certainly do not need to make it easier for presidents to declare martial law , ” Leahy said .
“ Invoking the Insurrection Act and using the military for law enforcement activities goes against some of the central tenets of our democracy .
One can easily envision governors and mayors in charge of an emergency having to constantly look over their shoulders while someone who has never visited their communities gives the orders . ”
The act “ subverts solid , long - standing Posse Comitatus statutes that limit the military ’s involvement in law enforcement , thereby making it easier for the president to declare martial law , ” Leahy said .
This had been “ slipped in as a rider with little study ” while “ other congressional committees with jurisdiction over these matters had no chance to comment , let alone hold hearings on these proposals . ”
There is good reason , Leahy said , “ for the constructive friction in existing law when it comes to martial law declarations .
Using the military for law enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of our democracy .
We fail our Constitution , neglecting the rights of the states , when we make it easier for the president to declare martial law and trample on local and state sovereignty . ”
The law allows the president to “ employ the armed forces , including the National Guard in federal service , to restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when , as a result of a natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition in any state or possession of the United States , that the president determines that domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the state or possession are incapable of maintaining public order to suppress in any state , any insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination or conspiracy . ”
“ Or other condition ” is a critical line in the new law , skeptics say .
The president can send the National Guard into any community for any — even frivolous — reasons , they argue .
The Founders , as expressed in the written history of the times — published speeches and letters — were anxious to never have a national police force for fear it would be used to centralize power at the federal level and weaken the role of states .
The president can now , effectively , deploy a national police force to any location in the country on a whim .
The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act reads : “ Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or act of Congress , willfully uses any part ” of the military “ as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than two years or both . ”

I 've got sudoku fever !
Actually , no , I do n't , I do n't really like sudoku at all but I decided to write a solver in erlang .
It was pretty trivial .
The basic algorithm is as follows :1 ) Create a list of every blank square and the possible values that can go into that square2 )
Find the square with the least number of possible values3 )
Iterate over the list of possible numbers that can be in that square , create a new board with that value in it and recurse on the new board4 )
Continue until there are no more possible values ( in which case it failed ) or the puzzle is solved .
The code is not the prettiest stuff in the world but it appears to solve the problem ( specifically the remove_* functions ) .
Usage looks like : Code ( can be downloaded here ) :

Free papers or a free press
The press is in crisis ; the worst crisis in its history .
For the past three years newspapers and news magazines in France , including Le Monde diplomatique , and almost everywhere in the world have been steadily losing readers .
Their delicate economic balance is upset , their survival threatened and , with it , the democratic right to express a range of opinions .
What is to blame for this depressing state of the press ?
First , the rise and rise of “ free ” newspapers .
The “ free ” is a lie since it leads some readers to believe that news costs nothing , whereas “ free ” papers are paid for by an advertising levy that is incorporated in the price of everything else they buy .
In just a few years these publications have shot to the top of the circulation tables .
As a result many people have stopped buying daily papers and advertisers are turning to the “ free ” papers instead .
Sales on the newsstands and advertising are the two main sources of a newspaper ’s revenue ; the third is subscriptions .
Then there is the internet , which is revolutionising every aspect of cultural life — music , publishing , cinema , television — as well as the media .
It is significant that the international news channel France 24 was launched first on the web and only later on cable and satellite .
People turn more and more to the internet for news and information and some have stopped buying newspapers .
They too , like those who read the “ free ” papers , have deserted the newsstands , many of which have then been forced to close down with a corresponding reduction in sales of all newspapers and periodicals ( 1 ) .
The internet is attractive , access to many sites is free , people can express their own opinions in their own way on blogs and it is easy to exchange ideas on everything under the sun .
But this increase in freedom must be weighed against some contrary considerations .
There is the disturbing fact that many groups that have engaged through the internet in intense , internal debate in a spirit of democratic participation , have been crushed , reduced to impotence or self - destruction .
The researcher Eric Klinenberg in the United States has noted that the internet used to be remarkable for many new sites expressing a wide range of political opinions , yet the most popular sites are now controlled by the most powerful media groups .
This means that , as always in the history of communications , whenever a new medium appears — from newspapers in 18th century to the independent radio stations of the 1970s and the internet today — it begins by extending the boundaries of free speech , only to be taken over and tamed by the money men .
Reader profiles based on search engine utilisation are now being sold to businesses keen to target potential consumers more effectively .
In France , control of the mass media is concentrated in the hands of a few industrial and financial groups , including two arms manufacturers , Lagardère ( via Hachette ) and Dassault ( via Socpresse ) .
This disturbing fact should prompt members of the public to rally round and support the independent press , including Le Monde diplomatique .
You will recall that our magazine is owned jointly by the Le Monde group ( 51 % ) and by our readers and production team ( 49 % ) .
This is extremely rare in the press , not only in France but in the world , and it guarantees complete independence from all the powers that be , political , media or financial .
This peculiar feature is highly prized in other countries and has been instrumental in allowing us to expand our international editions , of which there are now some 60 in more than 30 languages .
This is unique in the world press but it has not prevented a decline in sales in France itself , sales on which the financial balance of the paper depends .
In the media battle ahead Le Monde diplomatique is counting on the loyalty of its readers and a large association of readers ’ groups ( the Friends of Le Monde diplomatique ) .
But it is also taking a number of initiatives , starting in February : while it remains more than ever committed to fact - based journalism , the editorial content will contain substantial innovations .
This is meant as a signal to readers , a call to rally round and take action .
To subscribe to Le Monde diplomatique is the best way to show your support for a free press , free speech and independent journalism .
" Noise really is one of the major barriers to airport expansion and the expansion of flights , " said Edward Greitzer , an MIT professor who helped run the project .
" It gets a lot of complaints . "
The breakthrough could bring a welcome change to aviation , industry experts said .
" People are still willing to pay more for the convenience of a closer - in airport , " said Richard Aboulafia , vice president at Teal Group , an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax , Virginia .
" There is an economic value to being able to keep your air transport close in town , which means you 've got to be quiet . "
REDESIGNED BODY , ENGINES
Reducing noise in recent years has been a focus of makers of planes , such as Boeing Co. and Airbus , and jet engines , including General Electric Co. United Technologies Corp. and Rolls - Royce Plc .
While their efforts have mainly involved tweaks to existing technologies , the MIT - Cambridge team set out to redesign the plane from the ground up , with a focus on quiet .
Instead of the tube - and - wing model common today , the Silent Jet is a flying wing , evoking current " stealth " military aircraft .
It lacks the central vertical stabilizer common at the tail of current passenger jets , instead using a pair of stabilizers at the wingtips .
The proposed plane has a 222 - foot ( 68 - metre ) wingspan and is 144 feet ( 44 metres ) long from nose to tail , comparable in size to a Boeing 767 .
" You take the fuselage and you squish it , and you spread it out , and it's an all - lifting body , " said Zoltan Spakovsky , an associate professor at MIT who worked on the project .
The design allows the plane to remain in the air at slower speeds , which would allow it to cruise in for a landing more quietly .
The plane does not use wing flaps , which are common on today 's passenger jets and create much of the landing noise .
The MIT - Cambridge team also designed what they said could be a quieter and more fuel efficient engine system .
Rather than placing the jets in pods suspended under the wings , the silent jet uses three engines built into the middle of the plane , at the rear .
They take in air from above the wing , which helps to insulate people on the ground from jet noise at takeoff .
Airplane makers may prove more likely to cherry - pick individual technologies developed for the new jet than to adopt the whole redesign for their products , executives said .
" In a project like this , the idea is to really focus on one goal and see what you could do in the extreme , " said Billy Glover , director of environmental performance at Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle , one of the industry experts the researchers have used as a sounding board .
" But as you go to a real design process , you have a lot of other trade - offs . "
Reuters
Impeach Alberto Gonzales for lying to Congress .
Impeach him now :
Think Progress : According to President Bush 's radio address today , as White House counsel , Alberto Gonzales personally approved Bush 's program for warrantless domestic wiretaps .
By circumventing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , those wiretaps violated federal law ....
During his confirmation hearings for Attorney General in January 2005 , Sen . Russ Feingold asked Gonzales about this precise issue :
SEN .
FEINGOLD : I -- Judge Gonzales , let me ask a broader question .
I 'm asking you whether in general the president has the constitutional authority , does he at least in theory have the authority to authorize violations of the criminal law under duly enacted statutes simply because he 's commander in chief ?
Does he -- does he have that power ?
After trying to dodge the question for a time , Gonzales issued this denial :
MR. GONZALES : Senator , this president is not -- I -- it is not the policy or the agenda of this president to authorize actions that would be in contravention of our criminal statutes .
In fact , that was precisely the policy of the President .
" We have eliminated Zarqawi , " Mr Maliki said at a news conference in Baghdad , sparking sustained applause .
Zarqawi was considered the figurehead of the Sunni insurgency .
He was leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq , blamed for killing thousands of Shias and US forces .
The US said he was killed in an air strike " approximately 8 km ( five miles ) north of Baquba " .
The head of US - led forces in Iraq , General George Casey , said the strike against an " isolated safe house " took place at 1815 ( 1415 GMT ) on Wednesday .
" Iraqi police were first on the scene after the air strike , " he said , followed shortly afterwards by coalition forces .
This is a message to those who choose the path of violence to change their direction before it is too late

In quotes : World reaction
Watch the speech
Jordanian - born Zarqawi was said to have been in a meeting with associates at the time .
Several other people were reported to have been killed in the raid .
General Casey said Zarqawi's body was identified through fingerprints , facial recognition and known scars .
He promised to give more details on the raid later on Thursday .
Reports say a statement on the internet attributed to an umbrella group for jihadi organisations including al - Qaeda in Iraq has confirmed Zarqawi 's death .
Jordanian role
Zarqawi was not a global mastermind like al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden , says the BBC 's security correspondent , Frank Gardner .
Instead he was a bloodthirsty and violent thug , who made enemies and several mistakes that might have contributed to his downfall .
These included ordering a triple suicide bombing against hotels in Amman , Jordan , last November , that killed 60 people , our correspondent says .
ABU MUSAB AL - ZARQAWI US $ 25 m bounty on head Linked to Iraqi bombings , assassinations and beheadings Merged Iraqi insurgent group with Bin Laden 's al - Qaeda network in 2004 Emerged in Iraq as Tawhid and Jihad group chief Linked to Casablanca and Istanbul blasts , in 2003 Foreign fighter against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in 1980s Jordan petty criminal in youth
Obituary : Zarqawi Zarqawi in his own words
A Jordanian official told the Associated Press that Jordanian agents had contributed to the operation against Zarqawi .
The US ambassador to Iraq , Zalmay Khalilzad , said Zarqawi's death marked " a great success for Iraq and the global war on terror ...
Zarqawi was the godfather of sectarian killing and terror in Iraq " .
But he cautioned that it would not end bloodshed in the country .
Violence continued on Thursday as 13 people were killed and 28 injured in a bomb on a Baghdad market , police said .
Millon - dollar bounty
Zarqawi was accused of leading the rash of kidnappings and beheadings of foreign workers .
It is thought US hostage Nick Berg may have been killed by Zarqawi
A video released in April showed Zarqawi shooting an automatic rifle and berating the US for its " arrogance " .
The video provided the most up - to - date picture of the fugitive .
Mr Maliki said intelligence from Iraqi people had helped track down Zarqawi , who had a $ 25 m ( £ 13 m ) price on his head - the same bounty as that offered by the US for Bin Laden .
" What happened today is a result of co-operation for which we have been asking from our masses and the citizens of our country , " he said .
Shortly after the Zarqawi announcement , the Iraqi parliament approved Mr Maliki 's nominees for the key posts of defence and interior ministers .
The two crucial roles had remained unfilled despite the formation of a coalition government last month .

The environment is Canada ’s most pressing issue , according to a just - released poll of Canadians .
The same poll reports that 74 percent of Canadians believe Canada ’s Conservative government is doing a poor job on the environment .
Prime Minister Harper knows he is vulnerable on the issue , which spurred him to shuffle his cabinet , booting Rona Ambrose as Minister of the Environment and replacing her with trusted lieutenant John Baird .
Newspaper headlines ran from “ PM charts a greener course ” ( The Globe and Mail ) to “ Harper goes green ” ( The National Post ) .
But if Harper really wants to go green , he should start by legalizing it .
Green , that is .
Yup , I ’m talking about marijuana .
Year of the CFL
Canada ’s unique brand of football is increasingly popular .
As temperatures continue to rise , football is only going to get more popular : after all , winter sports require winter , which bodes ill for hockey .
But there ’s a different CFL on the block , and this is its year .
Compact fluorescent lamps have finally hit their stride and they ’re illuminating more homes than ever .
Even Wal - Mart has stepped into the fray , with the goal of single - handedly doubling sales of the bulbs in one year .
CFLs are popular because they last far longer than regular bulbs , they use far less electricity ( the 23 - watt CFLs I bought today put out the same amount of light as a 100 - watt incandescent bulb ) , and they no longer produce the harsh light normally associated with fluorescent lamps .
Using them is one of the easiest and most effective ways we can tackle global warming .
Every time I stop by Canadian Tire I see somebody in the lights aisle , mulling over which CFL to buy .
Lightin’ Up the Basement
Canadian
Tire , however , is not the only store in Hamilton where you can buy lights .
The local hydroponics store also has a fine selection , but they ’re not selling energy - efficient CFLs .
Instead , you ’ll find high pressure sodium and metal halide lamps that range in power from 400 to 1000 watts apiece .
Weed growers know that fluorescent lights might be useful for germinating seeds but to grow the fine bud , you need some proper lights .
It ’s these lights that make hydroponic grow - ops such massive hydro users .
Four 600 - watt high pressure sodium lamps – about what ’s necessary to grow pot in a large basement room – use as much electricity as it would take to light up 50 living rooms using 100 - watt equivalent CFL bulbs .
It ’s unknown how many marijuana grow operations there are in Canada , but there at least tens of thousands .
The marijuana industry is thought to be worth $ 7 billion in British Columbia alone .
With all those lights burning to keep the pot growing , we ’re talking about vast amounts of electricity and that means vast amounts of greenhouse gas emissions .
All to grow a crop that grows even better outside in Canada ’s warm summer months .
Mr. Harper , do the planet a favour and go green on the green .

Stories like the one below , from the BBC , reinforce the nagging fear I have that Peak Oil just is n’t going to be the kill shot that many of us think it ’s going to be .
Do n’t get me wrong , Peak Oil seems real to me ( if engineered to happen ) , and , in preparation , my wife and I are using hand tools to accomplish as much of the work that we do as possible on our farm .
But , more and more , it ’s going to be clean , green fascism , with the alternative energy buildouts taking on maco scale proportions , “ sustainable ” Walmarts and industrial - organic pHood .
And we wo n’t even have to put microchips in our chickens , for now !
Ahh , freedom !
Oh yes , if the band plays on , it will be a weird , organic hemp hacky sack , zero emission SUV and fair - trade espresso tinged tune .
The “ environmentalists ” will be making free love with the diabolical , earth murdering criminals at Shell Oil – Renewables Division .
The jittery savants at Google will marvel at their solar powered propeller beanies ; proof of their Earth - friendly credentials .
Can you feel the love ?
Hillary 2008 , man !
Meet the clean , green fascists .
Same as the old , polluting fascists .
There will be viable alternative power , as long as it ’s centralized and benefits the usual suspects .
If you think this is a bunch of crap about a few barefoot hippies with some solar panels and all the dope they can smoke somewhere in Northern California , friend , think again .
How does a wind farm , capable of powering one million British households , grab ya ?
Where will all the disposable diapers , plastic tampon applicators , and mostly empty insect poison canisters go , from these clean , green powered homes ?
Who knows ?
Dump it all into the sea , around the wind farm , maybe …
Collapse via Peak Oil ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
This wind development will supply only 1 % of total electricity used in the UK , but it demonstrates the type ( and scale ) of things the Megamachine can do to survive .
AND it ’s not even really against the wall yet .
AND they ’re only using decades old technology so far .
This is the problem with all the Peak Oil theories about how “ renewables ” will never be able to make much a difference to the energy situation .
I ’d ask the people pushing those theories to consider the stuff in the secret government crypts and quasi covert , corporate labs — with connections to the Pentagon — that are just starting to unfurl …
Is Peak Oil just another faith - based collapse theory ?
Look , there ’s no shortage of energy .
Even assuming no decades - old , taxpayer - funded .mil innovations , energy generation is a no brainer .
Take your pick .
Individuals are building their own wave power generators for Christ ’s sake .
That thing scales to megawatt class systems and is based on nothing more complicated than permanent magnets and copper coils .
( And it ’s a continuous power source , unlike wind and solar , which are intermittent sources . )
While there ’s plenty of energy available from ocean / tidal , solar and wind sources , what we do n’t have is a way of storing the energy in any form that approaches the energy density of hydrocarbon based fuels .
Technologies like that eeStor thing , however , have the potential to change the whole damn show .
Even assuming an energy storage solution , Peak Oil fundamentalists will smile ( smugly ) and say , “ Plastics , my son .
What about plastics ? ”
First of all , how much plastic can you keep choking the oceans with if the Hummers started running on super capacitors ?
A lot .
I do n’t know how many decades worth .
Besides , if you have the energy , which is clearly available from the braindead simple approach of bobbing those magnets up and down through induction coils , for example , just about anything can be turned into oil ( for plastics or anything else ) with a process called thermal depolymerization .
So , is Peak Oil going to be a crisis ?
Only if They want it to be .
Via : BBC :
The green light has been given for two offshore wind farms in the Thames Estuary , one of which will be the world ’s biggest when it is completed .
The government said the schemes would produce enough renewable electricity to power about one million households .
The larger London Array project covers 90 sq miles ( 232 sq km ) between Margate in Kent and Clacton , Essex .
The second wind farm , called the Thanet scheme , will cover 13.5 sq miles ( 35 sq km ) off the north Kent coast .
The Â£ 1.5bn London Array scheme will have 341 turbines rising from the sea about 12 miles ( 20 km ) off the Kent and Essex coasts , as well as five offshore substations and four meteorological masts .
The consortium behind it is made up of Shell WindEnergy Ltd , E.ON UK Renewables and Core Ltd .
Self - interest goes a very long way to explaining human behavior .
Yet when we educate our young , we prefer to bias them , focusing their attention on the virtues of undiscriminate altruism .
Why ?
In Friday ’s issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education David Barash accepted ( temporarily un - gated version here )
Nietzsche ’s claim that “ society encourages self - sacrifice because the unselfish sucker is an asset to others , ” and Freud ’s complaint that
[ Education ] does not prepare [ children ] for the aggressiveness of which they are destined to become the objects .
In sending the young into life with such a false psychological orientation , education is behaving as though one were to equip people starting on a Polar expedition with summer clothing and maps of the Italian Lakes .
Nevertheless , Barash prefers that we discuss self - interest as we do sex : too little too late :
The teaching of sociobiology ( or evolutionary psychology ) should be undertaken only with great caution .
The renowned primatologist Sarah Hrdy … questioned " whether sociobiology should be taught at the high - school level … …
The whole message of sociobiology is oriented toward the success of the individual .
…
Unless a student has a moral framework already in place , we could be producing social monsters by teaching this . " …
Preferable , I submit , is to structure the teaching of sociobiology along the lines of sex education : Teach what we know , but do so in age - appropriate stages .
Just as we would not bombard kindergartners with the details of condom use , we probably ought not instruct preteens in the finer points of sociobiology .
What reason does Barash give ?
There is an altruistic as well as a selfish side to the evolutionary coin .
A half - baked introduction to the discipline , which pointed only to the latter , would therefore do students a substantial disservice .
…
Writes the gene theorist David Haig , " … even though genes may cajole , deceive , cheat , swindle , or steal , … this does not mean that people must be similarly self - interested . " …
The real test of our humanity might be whether we are willing , at least on occasion , to say no to our " natural " inclinations , thereby refusing go along with our selfish genes .
To my knowledge , no other animal species is capable of doing that .
I ’m skeptical that humans are special in this way .
But more important , Barash fails to say why the possibility of such a special ability suggests that we should wait to teach children about self - interest .
It seems to me that Barash has failed here to otherwise rationalize his own apparently self - interested behavior in encouraging others to be “ unselfish suckers . ”
Nevertheless , the key question remains : what price do we pay , individually and socially , for overcoming bias ?
Hat tip to Keith Henson .
Addendum : I ’ve fixed the Freud quote , which was completely wrong .
Sigh .

SQLite Keynote
D. Richard Hipp , author of SQLite presented this years keynote .
A fascinating jaunt from the civilized realms into barbarian territory and back .
Here are some of the notes I took —
( Incidentally I noted that Richard pronounces SQLite S - Q - L-ite , not Sequel - Lite . )
Non-Comment Source Lines in SQLite 3.3.7 tree
Tcl 54.28 %
Tcl Bindings 8.55 %

Application File Format
File / Open reads and parses the entire application file
Error prone
Lots of code to maintain

File / Save requires the user to remember to save , possible to overwrite of independent changes , corruption if file generator and parser do not match
What if ...
No need to read and parse file content
updates are atomic , consistent , isolated and durable
automatic concurrency control
Changes are written to disk immediately
No data loss after unexpected power failure
The save and save as options are obsolete -- remove them
Key concept : SQLite wants to replace fopen ( ) / [ open ] not Oracle / Oratcl .
Useful example code / utilities
SQLite Console for Tcl / Tk
Email Client that uses SQLite as a back - end store
Database Editor ( define a new SQL function in Tcl , allowing you to write update changelog set message = edit ( message ) where change=2782 ; and be able to edit the message in a text widget that 'll pop up instead of copying and pasting or re-typing manually )

Q : What is Full Text Search ?
A : In brief : what Google does .
Q : Why is full text search important ?
A : Internet search enginges have users spoiled .
Modern applications need to support full text search in order to be competitive .
Q : Is it difficult to implement ?
A : It is tricky for large data sets to get it right .
Basic approach
tokenize into words case folding stemming ( convert each word into its root form ; porter stemmer very popular stemmer for English ; recommended -> recommend ; books -> book ) remove stop words for each word left create posting list per word
OR queries do an intersection .
AND queries do a union .
Phrase Queries : naive method : do an AND query , then examine every document in the result set in a second pass and eliminate those that lack the phrase .
Very bad performance in pathalogical cases .
Instead update posting list to store document : position ( multiple occurances included multiple times ) .
Basic Operations
Insert a new document : Break the document into words ;
Append the document ID to the posting list for each word
Perform a query : Lookup the posting list for each word in the query ; Combine posting lists
Keeping the Working Set Small
Limit size of the lexicon ( stemming , stop words )
Compress the posting list aggressively
Spill stationary parts of posting list into a separate table that is not cached
Full Text Search ( version 1 ) built into SQLite 3.3.8 released Monday
As of SQLite 3.3.8 ( released Monday ! ) full text search support in SQLite .
Ricahrd 's authorized to announce help from engineers at Google .
Later question elicited that roughly half of the FTS code was written by him & Dan , the other half by four engineers [ did n't have time to write down their names ] from Google .
He is n't able / ca n't comment on their motivations / plans / internal usage .
( Obviouslyy wo n't be replacing their search engine with SQLite . )
Some example usage
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE email USING fts1 ( content ) ;
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE email USING fts1 ( " from " TEXT , " to " TEXT , subject TEXT , body TEXT , tokenize porter ) ;
SELECT rowid , subject FROM email WHERE email MATCH ' wyrick sqlite ' ;
SELECT rowid , subject FROM email WHERE email MATCH $ :: querytext ;
MATCH : when left operand is the name of the table match against any column can specify a particular column $ :: querytext can specify columns i.e. , " from : wyrick "
Built in snippet generator : SELECR rowid , snippet ( email ) FROM email WHERE email MATCH ...
FTS1 comes standard with Tcl bindings for SQLite ( >= 3.3.8 ) .
FTS1 permanent - beta
FTS2 will ship before Christmas
Potential uses :
Search for private websites
Email clients
Online documentation search
Searchable history in web browsers ( like a Google search but instead of searching the whole corpus of the web search only those sites I 've browsed to in the last x months )
months )
Chatroom archive search
Search version diffs in a configuration management system
Text editors and IDEs
Pervasive Full - Text Search ( users want it ; made easy using Tcl and SQLite ) .

NSA Helps Microsoft with Windows Vista
Is this a good idea or not ?
For the first time , the giant software maker is acknowledging the help of the secretive agency , better known for eavesdropping on foreign officials and , more recently , U.S. citizens as part of the Bush administration ’s effort to combat terrorism .
The agency said it has helped in the development of the security of Microsoft ’s new operating system — the brains of a computer — to protect it from worms , Trojan horses and other insidious computer attackers . [ … ]
The NSA declined to comment on its security work with other software firms , but Sager said Microsoft is the only one “ with this kind of relationship at this point where there ’s an acknowledgment publicly . ”
The NSA , which provided its service free , said it was Microsoft ’s idea to acknowledge the spy agency ’s role .
It ’s called the “ equities issue . ”
Basically , the NSA has two roles : eavesdrop on their stuff , and protect our stuff .
When both sides use the same stuff — Windows Vista , for example — the agency has to decide whether to exploit vulnerabilities to eavesdrop on their stuff or close the same vulnerabilities to protect our stuff .
In its partnership with Microsoft , it could have decided to go either way : to deliberately introduce vulnerabilities that it could exploit , or deliberately harden the OS to protect its own interests .
A few years ago I was ready to believe the NSA recognized we ’re all safer with more secure general - purpose computers and networks , but in the post - 9/11 take - the - gloves - off eavesdrop - on - everybody environment , I simply do n’t trust the NSA to do the right thing .
“ I kind of call it a Good Housekeeping seal ” of approval , said Michael Cherry , a former Windows program manager who now analyzes the product for Directions on Microsoft , a firm that tracks the software maker .
Cherry says the NSA ’s involvement can help counter the perception that Windows is not entirely secure and help create a perception that Microsoft has solved the security problems that have plagued it in the past .
“ Microsoft also wants to make the case that [ the new Windows ] more secure than its earlier versions , ” he said .
For some of us , the result is the exact opposite .
EDITED TO ADD ( 1/11 ) : Another opinion .

WASHINGTON , July 25  Saying the security situation in Baghdad remained “ terrible , ” President Bush announced an agreement with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki on Tuesday to significantly strengthen the United States military presence in the city .
The announcement , presented at a joint news conference during Mr. Maliki ’s first visit to the White House since taking office in May , was a tacit admission that the Iraqi government had not succeeded in bringing stability to the capital , and that any major withdrawal of American troops soon remained unlikely .
Under the new security plan , devised by American military commanders in consultation with the Iraqis , some 4,000 United States troops would move into Baghdad , to join the same number of Iraqi counterparts .
The United States has about 128,000 troops in Iraq , approximately 7,200 of them in Baghdad , according to military officials there .
“ Obviously , the violence in Baghdad is still terrible , and therefore there needs to be more troops , ” Mr. Bush said at the news conference , held in the East Room after a morning meeting with Mr. Maliki in the Oval Office .
“ Our military commanders tell me that this deployment will better reflect the current conditions on the ground in Iraq . ”
Behaviour - Driven Development has been percolating around in the collective consciousnesses of some of the communities I 'm involved in .
It 's basically a methodology that has grown out of some of the weaknesses people have observed in test - driven development .
Here 's the thing : TDD is about design .
Forcing yourself to think about tests before the code is actually written helps you think about design in new ways .
Beginners to TDD often think it 's all about the tests instead .
The main issue that BDD tackles is one of terminology — when you are constantly referring to tests in TDD , it 's easy to forget that what you really care about is behaviour .
It 's not really about tests , ( in fact , Dave Astels 's book on TDD begins with the sentence , " This is not a book about testing . " ) those just happen to be the most obvious way to get check behaviour .
So BDD tries to come in with a new vocabulary focusing on contexts and specifications and the word " should " that starts you off thinking in the right direction .
The common criticism here is that it's " just terminology " .
It 's not really that revolutionary , it 's just a new set of names .
Now to be honest , I agree with that except for the word just .
When people talk about coding styles and things to always be mindful of , one of the things that repeatedly comes up is how important good names are .
Not to get all Sapir - Whorf on you , but the words you use really affect the way you think in an inescapable way .
In fact , there 's an excellent essay on Confucianism and Technical standards which states :
In a famous passage , Analects 13.3 , Confucius was asked by a disciple what his first order of business would be if he were to govern a state .
He replied , 正名 , meaning roughly [...] " rectify the names . "
His disciple was somewhat incredulous and asked , " Would you be as impractical as that ? "
Confucius strongly rebuked his disciple and explained that proper nomenclature is the basis of language and that language is central to taking care of things .
In the words of the Master :
If language is not correct , then what is said is not what is meant ; if what is said is not what is meant , then what must be done remains undone ; if this remains undone , morals and art will deteriorate ; if justice goes astray , the people will stand about in helpless confusion .
Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said .
This matters above everything .
All that to say : yes , BDD is ( mostly ) new words .
But that 's a big deal .
Oh yes ; the point ... I had one about here somewhere .
Right — behave.el , my latest hackery :
( context " A list with three items " ( tag list example ) ( lexical - let ( ( list ( list " a " " b " " c " ) ) ) ( specify " should contain the first item " ( expect ( first list ) equal " a " ) ) ( specify " should push new values onto the front " ( push " d " list ) ( expect ( first list ) equal " d " ) ) ( specify " should NOT remove the top item when reading the car " ( expect ( first list ) equal " d " ) ( expect ( first list ) equal " d " ) ) ( specify " should return the top item when popped " ( expect ( pop list ) equal " d " ) ) ( specify " should remove the top item when popped " ( expect ( pop list ) equal " a " ) ( expect ( pop list ) equal " b " ) ) ) )
It 's BDD .
In Emacs Lisp .
( And it 's only 89 lines of code . </ brag >)
The most obvious difference it has from other libraries like RSpec ( well , apart from Lisp ) is that behave.el meant to run in an interactive environment rather than from the command line .
You could certainly script it , but the tagging functionality is designed with interactivity in mind .
The other thing is that you can't structure things in terms of " X should PREDICATE Y " since Lisp requires that the function go first .
I suppose technically you could write a macro that would mangle things to the point where that would be feasible , but it definitely goes against the grain of Lisp and would require a lot of context switching .
behave.el instead uses the expect macro to state expectations which the code should fulfill .
Being a first release , it 's missing a few things .
For starters , you can only expect either that a form is non-nil or that it is equal something .
More flexibility in the expect macro is certainly to be desired .
The other big thing is that each specify form does not start with a fresh binding of variables .
( The setup methods in both Ruby 's Test : : Unit and rSpec both provide this , and it often proves to be handy . )
I 've been battling the CL - emulation libraries in elisp and so far losing , but I 'm sure I can provide such a thing in a future release .
behave.el supercedes ElUnit , my previous unit - testing framework for Emacs Lisp .
Anyway , real point here is that now that I 've got a BDD framework in Emacs Lisp , I can port it to Common Lisp and then use it to hack on Darjeeling .
Woo hoo !
Grab it from my repository .
There 's also a Trac page .

Programming with Contracts ( PwC ) is a method of developing software using contracts to explicitly state and test design requirements .
The contract is used to define the obligations and benefits of program elements such as subroutines and classes .
In this article , I explain contracts and present a technique for defining contracts in separate classes safely hidden away from implementation details .
Design by Contract ( DbC ) is often confused with PwC .
Conceived by Bertrand Meyer , DbC is a formal software - design methodology , whereas PwC is the programming technique of using a contractual representation in code to verify that preconditions , postconditions , and invariants are satisfied .
The differences can be equated to the relationship between object - oriented programming and object - oriented design .
( For more information , http://www.artima.com/intv/contracts.html.)
Contracts
Contracts are made up of three major elements , referred to as " clauses " : preconditions , postconditions , and class invariants .
Preconditions and postconditions are clauses that are evaluated at the beginning and end of specific routines , respectively .
From a design standpoint , a precondition represents the obligations on the context invoking the routine .
An example can be found using the C file reading function fscanf :
int fscanf ( FILE * stream , const char * format [ , argument , ... ] ) ;< br>
The function fscanf operates with the precondition that stream must be a pointer to an open file .
There is also another precondition that there must be the same number of type specifiers in the format string as the number of arguments passed .
Postconditions , however , represent both the obligations and benefits of a given subroutine .
In the case of fscanf , the implicit postconditions are :
The return value is EOF if an error occurs ; otherwise , it is the number of items successfully read not including any ignored fields .
if an error occurs ; otherwise , it is the number of items successfully read not including any ignored fields .
The FILE * argument is updated .
From a theoretical standpoint a pre/ postcondition should be evaluated at compile time when appropriate .
This can be done using BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT found in the Boost C++ library ( http://boost/static_assert.hpp ) .
Pre / postconditions conceptually are also language independent .
In fact , some pre/postconditions are difficult and even impossible to express in a formal language .
In these cases , the pre/postcondition is best expressed as a natural language comment .
A class invariant is a property of each instance of a class that is required to evaluate to True before and after every external call to a public function .
One way to think of a class invariant is as a clause that is ANDed with the pre- and postcondition of each public method .
Checking class invariants in C++ is beyond the scope of this article , but the same effect can be achieved more verbosely with pre/ postconditions .
Peppering Code with Assertions : Good , but Good Enough ?
Most modern C++ programmers have adopted the good habit of ( usually ) checking their preconditions and postconditions in their code by placing assertions throughout their routines .
This is fine for simple single - expression assertions , as the code generated can be completely removed by turning off assertion compilation .
Simply using assertions is somewhat unsatisfying as the set of preconditions and postconditions is buried deep in the code and is hard to extract .
Automated tools can extract preconditions and postconditions , assuming they follow a consistent naming convention , but for a human perusing the code , the contracts of nontrivial functions and classes are not easily parsed .
The other drawback of assertions is that they only apply to code if you have nontrivial clauses , then this approach starts to spill into noncontract code .
Consider this example :
template < typename T > < br > class Stack { < br > void Push ( T x ) { < br > int nOldCount = Count ( ) < br > // implementation here < br> assert ( Count ( ) == nOldCount + 1 ) ;< br > }< br > ...< br > }< br >
Notice that the code for allocating space and initializing nOldCount will possibly remain in your executable , regardless of whether assertions are turned off .
Perhaps in this case , a compiler might optimize it away , but for nontrivial examples , it is virtually impossible for optimizers to remove all unreachable code .
In this case , the simplest thing to do would be to wrap the nOldCount declaration in a # ifdef / #endif pair .
template < typename T > < br > class Stack { < br > void Push ( T x ) { < br > #ifdef CONTRACT_CHECKING_ON<br> int nOldCount = Count ( ) < br > #endif // CONTRACT_CHECKING_ON<br> // implementation here < br> assert ( Count ( ) == nOldCount + 1 ) ;< br > }< br > ...< br > }< br >
This may appear verbose , but the advantage that this code is effectively embedded with a test case that disappears entirely during release builds should be quite clear .
Writing code in this manner assures that the code is continually tested every time the code is executed .
Retrofitting comparable test cases after code is already written is harder and almost invariably not as effective .
However , I have good news if you find this overly complex there is a better way .
Using Contract Classes
The contract clearly needs to be separated from the implementation details .
To separate it , you can define it in its own class .
This makes the contract more easily parsed , and makes it reusable .
The way I implement PwC in Heron and which applies equally well to C++ is to define the contract as a template class that inherits from its primary type parameter , which you then use to wrap an implementation class .
Consider this implementation class :
struct SortableIntArray_impl { < br > bool SortRange ( int i , int j ) ; < br > int GetAt ( int i ) ; < br > void SetAt ( int i , int x ) ; < br > };< br >
You can define the contract of the three public functions in code as in Listing One .
Despite being conceptually simple , this contract required a significant amount of code to express .
If this had been embedded directly in the implementation itself , it would become messy and confusing .
Listing One
template < typename T > struct SortableIntArray_contract : public T { bool SortRange ( int i , int j ) { // preconditions assert( i >= 0 ) ; assert ( i < size ( ) ) ; assert(j >= i ) ; assert (j < size ( ) ) ; // implementation T:: SortRange( i , j ) ; // postconditions // in essence , is this array sorted for ( int n=i ; n < j ; n++ ) { assert ( get_at ( n ) <= get_at ( n=1 ) ) ; } } int GetAt ( int i ) { // preconditions assert( i >= 0 ) ; assert ( i <= size ( ) ) ; return T:: GetAt( i ) ; } void SetAt ( int i , int x ) ; // preconditions assert( i >= 0 ) ; assert ( i <= size ( ) ) ; T:: SetAt( i , x ) ; // postcondition assert ( T:: GetAt( i ) == x ) ; } } ;
The contract can now be applied easily to the object conditionally as in Listing Two .
The same effect can also be achieved using metatemplate programming techniques involving type selectors such as the STLSoft library compile - time function stlsoft :: select_first_type or the Boost library compile - time function mpl : :if_c .
Listing Two
#ifdef CONTRACT_CHECKING_ON typedef SortableIntArray_contract<SortableIntArray_impl >
SortableIntArray ; #else typedef SortableIntArray_impl SortableIntArray ; #endif
Conclusion
Using assertions does allow the implementation of PwC , but using contract classes is better .
Contract classes express and validate significantly complex contracts without obfuscating the implementation .
Contract classes make design intentions explicit and improve the readability of code .
Contract classes can also often be reused for classes with different implementations but with similar interfaces .

Ed : This piece is long .
Really long .
Like 16 pages long .
For the original publishing , I ’ll be serializing this piece into six days of management deconstruction .
Enjoy .
Back in February , I asked the question “ Who is the worst person you worked for ? ”
If you print out the responses in a smallish font , you end up with 27 pages full of some of the worst possible management situations .
I ’ve read those 27 pages several times and it ’s now time to turn the tables and get inside the heads of these horrible managers to figure out what makes them tick .
Before I start , I ’ve got one ground rule .
You ca n’t be actively hating your manager when you read this .
If you completely despise your manager right now , this article is n’t going to help you because you have lost your objectivity .
If you ’re halfway through this piece , yelling at your screen that RANDS YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND , HE TOTALLY SCREWED ME , I would suggest a couple walks around building before you finish with this article .
A level head is required before we proceed .
There is evil
My background .
I ’ve worked at six different companies in the past 15 years .
In those years , I ’ve had 10 different jobs ranging from QA engineer to Director of Engineering .
Similarly , I ’ve worked for a variety managers from first line managers to CEOs .
I ’ve never worked outside of engineering , but , especially in the senior management roles , I ’ve been exposed to the inner workings of the vastly different functional groups that make up a company .
I ’ve seen a lot of varieties of organizational pride and panic .
At both Borland and Netscape , I experienced the company vibe as it shifted from “ We ’re the Microsoft killer ! ” to “ We ’re screwed ! ” .
At the start - up , I showed up as employee number 20 and it watched it grow to 250 employees before the Internet bust eroded the company to 50 folks wondering what to do with all the extra hardware .
These drastic shifts in organization perceptions showed me managers who were great at the pride part , but turned into jerks when the panic started .
Likewise , new leaders and lessons showed up during the panic .
Leaders who were quietly getting their work done during the pride .
In all of this , I can count the number of truly evil people I worked with on one hand .
There are evil managers out there .
I apologize , I lied .
These are genuinely evil and mean people .
There are less than you think , but they are out there and my only advice is , upon detection , to run away as quickly as possible .
Your Manager ’s Job
A key frustration from the Managers Are Not Evil piece is the easiest to explain .
You are frustrated because you ’re busting your ass , but each time you walk by your boss ’s offices he ’s got his feet kicked up on the table , coffee in one hand , the other hand jumping hither ’n’ fro , and he ’s talking to some guy you do n’t know .
How in the world could this be work ?
Here ’s the deal : Your manager ’s job is not your job .
Ever had a meeting with a completely different part of your company ?
Maybe it ’s engineering and facilities and you ’re talking about getting additional space for your team .
Your goal is clear , “ I need more space ” , but once the meeting kicks off , you realize that you and facilities are speaking a different language .
It ’s English , but the context is wildly different .
Those facilities guys are rambling about lease agreements , safety codes , and scads of unfamiliar acronyms .
In five minutes , it ’s clear that you have no idea what they really do .
Before that meeting , if I asked you what the role of facilities was in your company , you would ’ve scrunched your face and mumbled something about cube construction .
I trust that , like me , you ’re an optimist and you believe that everyone in your company is busily working on whatever they do .
I also believe the fact that you do n’t understand what they do automatically biases you .
You believe that because you understand your job intimately , it is more important than anyone else’s .
In your head , you are king .
It ’s clear what you do ; it ’s clear what is expected of you .
There is no person who rules you better than yourself because you know exactly what you ’re about .
Anyone outside of your head is a mystery because they are not you .
In a social situation , it ’s entertaining to figure out what another person is about , but in an employee / manager situation , there ’s more at stake .
Who is this guy who decides whether or not I get a raise ?
What ’s he saying to my VP about me ?
Does he see me as a success or a failure ?
Who is that guy in his office anyway ?
WHAT DOES HE DO ALL DAY ?
Next :
Your manager was n’t always a manager .
Plus , Rands lies .
Dangermouse lived inside a postbox on Baker Street in London
This month marks the 25th anniversary of the character and his bumbling sidekick Penfold , who joined forces to defeat evil Baron Greenback in 1981 .
Last year the show was third in Channel 4's poll of the best children 's TV .
The show has been seen in more than 80 countries , according to Fremantle Media , which owns distribution rights .
The secret of the programme 's success was the bizarre scenarios in which the pair found themselves , said Mark Hall , co-founder of production company Cosgrove Hall , which produced the show for Thames TV .
" The adults watched because of that kind of anarchy , " he told the BBC earlier this year .
" The kids watched it because they just loved the stories and the absolutely stupid gags . "
Sir David Jason and Terry Scott provided the voices for the pair
He also praised the actors who had voiced the characters .
Sir David Jason was " fantastic " as Dangermouse , he said , while the late Terry Scott provided a " wonderful " Penfold .
" Dangermouse was a sort of cross between Bond and all sorts of things , " Mr Hall said .
" He was supposed to be suave but he was a mouse with big ears . "
The cartoon was first aired on ITV in the UK and attracted an average audience of 3.5 million , Fremantle Media said .
In recent years it has appeared on pay - TV channels , but it has not had a regular slot on mainstream TV since 1992 .
No transmission date has yet been set for the re-runs on the BBC .
Upgrades to Beaches
The first of the short term loans that we accepted will be used to upgrade some of the surrounding beaches .
Perth has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world and we intend to keep them this way !
We have invested in a beach comber which will run down the shoreline daily to pick up any trash or debris .
Several new jetties were built to help regulate the tides and also give a fun place for families to walk , fish from and enjoy .
We also are now offering complimentary towels for all the guests who visit the beach house stations .
Get a nice clean towel to use while you enjoy your day at the beach !
We know these updates will be welcomed by all and help up keep our beaches the way we love them - perfectly clean and relaxing .
There 's so much talk lately about Ruby being so great for writing domain specific languages , but this is only partially true , Ruby 's not all it 's cracked up to be .
Too much hype and not enough substance , if one looks a little deeper .
Every programmer knows one domain specific languages that is so common , it 's built into most languages , predicate logic .
The good old if , if / else , and while forms , and several variations of them like do , unless , etc .
So please forgive me while I state the obvious .
Each form works using true / false as the input , and a block of code to be conditionally or repeatedly executed depending upon the value of the input .
In a C'ish form , these look like so ...
if( aBooleanCondition ) { someCodeToCall ( ) ; } else { someOtherCodeToCall ( ) ; } while ( aBooleanCondition ) { someCodeToCall ( ) ; }
There 's nothing new here , every programmer knows this .
What 's interesting is that Ruby , like most languages , uses special forms for predicate logic .
If Ruby is so great at writing domain specific languages , why not implement the most common domain specific language , predicates , just like any other embedded domain specific language ?
This might sound crazy , but there 's no reason that if / else and while need be part of the language , they can be moved into the library , given a language sufficiently powerful enough .
When I first learned Smalltalk , the piece of code that blew my mind the most , was exactly this .
Smalltalk the language , has no if / else or while statement , instead the domain specific language of predicates is implemented with simple objects and method calls , no compiler voodoo " required " ( this is actually optimized by the compiler , I speaking conceptually here ) .
Here 's the most interesting bits .
True >> ifFalse : alternativeBlock ^nil True >> ifFalse : falseAlternativeBlock ifTrue : trueAlternativeBlock ^trueAlternativeBlock value True >> ifTrue : alternativeBlock ^alternativeBlock value True >> ifTrue : trueAlternativeBlock if False : falseAlternativeBlock ^trueAlternativeBlock value False >> ifFalse : alternativeBlock ^alternativeBlock value False >> ifFalse : falseAlternativeBlock ifTrue : trueAlternativeBlock ^falseAlternativeBlock value False >>ifTrue : alternativeBlock ^nil False >> ifTrue : trueAlternativeBlock if False : falseAlternativeBlock ^falseAlternativeBlock value BlockContext >> whileTrue : aBlock ^ [ self value ] while True : [ aBlock value ]
And here 's how this DSL is used in Smalltalk ...
aBooleanCondition ifTrue : [ self someCodeToCall ] if False : [ self someOtherCodeToCall ] [ aBooleanCondition ] whileTrue : [ self someCodeToCall ]
The main thing to note here , beside the beauty of Smalltalk , is that blocks , objects , and methods calls are the necessary building blocks of " language " itself , any language .
Having a succinct notation for the delayed evaluation of code , and allowing that code to be placed into variables and passed around , is all one needs to build virtually any domain specific language they can dream up .
Ruby at first glance , appears to have this trait .
Ruby has blocks , but it did n't do them right .
Ruby introduced an ugly hack called yield for pretending to pass a block with a terse form {} , but it only works for the last argument to a method , you can't pass two blocks to a method with this same terse syntax .
The above predicate domain specific language can't be implemented in Ruby in exactly the same way , because Ruby can't pass both blocks cleanly , and even has two forms for specifying a block , the short and sweet { } and the longer " do end " .
This simple case works ...
aBooleanCondition.ifTrue { someCodeToCall }
But the two block case wo n't , at least not in a single method call , you 'd have to chain two calls together .
aBooleanCondition .ifTrue { someCodeToCall } .ifFalse { self someOtherCodeToCall }
Having keyword message syntax , is another vital piece of the puzzle .
You see Ruby code faking this all the time by passing around associations to avoid the ugliness of positional nameless arguments , or as above , chaining multiple call together to fake the keyword style .
But this does n't look like idiomatic Ruby , and Ruby wo n't allow you to build forms that look like the built in if / else / while .
Rather than suffer this ugliness , Ruby simply provided a procedural syntax for predicate logic , with reserved words at the language level .
Ruby , as nice as it is , is still a language that " can " build limited domain specific languages , but not necessarily with a syntax on par with what the language itself provides .
Smalltalk seems much more a notation , that can do nothing but build domain specific languages .
Ruby is n't object oriented at the level Smalltalk is , is still falls back to procedural constructs and special syntax for many things .
Smalltalk , is pure , objects all the way down , at every level , even the simplest and most common domain specific language of all , predicate logic .
When you create a domain specific language in Smalltalk , your code never looks different than code provided by the compiler writer himself , it 's one syntax to rule them all .
Smalltalk shares this trait with languages such as Lisp and Scheme , truly growable languages that put you , the programmer , in charge of what language you want , not some compiler writer who might take six more years to add some feature you just got to have now .
When you need a new language feature in Smalltalk , you simply add it .
It 's a feeling that once you 've become accustomed to , you can't live without , and one you do n't quite get with Ruby .
There 's been a lot of fuss lately about the next Ruby not supporting continuations , a feature vital in building a framework as elegant as Seaside .
Yet , continuations were added to Squeak in about 39 lines of code , no big fuss necessary .
This is that feeling I 'm talking about , no waiting for the next official VM to support them , it 's just a Smalltalk class , like any other .
Ruby is terse , nice looking , and even massively productive , but elegant it is not .
And maybe that does n't matter to most , but for those like me , elegance is real power , power that Ruby does n't have .
Ruby 's an interesting sign post on the way from mainstream languages like Java and C# , but it 's not the destination , it 's just a good warm up for learning Smalltalk .

This Week 's Finds in Mathematical Physics ( Week 244 )
John Baez
In January I spent a week at this workshop at the Fields Institute in Toronto :
1 ) Higher Categories and Their Applications , http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/fields/
It was really fun - lots of people working on n-categories were there .
I 'll talk about it next time .
But as usual , more happens at a fun conference than can possibly be reported .
So , this time I 'll only talk about a conversation I had in a café before the conference started !
But first , here 's a fun way to challenge your math pals :
Q : When the first calculus textbook was written - and in what language ?
A : In 1530 , in Malayalam - a south Indian language !
This book is called the Ganita Yuktibhasa , or " compendium of astronomical rationales " .
It was written by Jyesthadeva , an astronomer and mathematician from Kerala - a state on the southwest coast of India .
It summarizes and explains the work of many researchers of the Kerala school , which flourished from the 1400's to the 1600's .
But it 's unique for its time , since it contains proofs of many results .
For example , it has a proof that
π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...
Of course , this result is n't stated in modern notation !
It 's actually stated as a poem - a recipe for the circumference of a circle , which in translation goes something like this :
Multiply the diameter by four .
Subtract from it and add to it alternately the quotients obtained by dividing four times the diameter by the odd numbers 3 , 5 , etc .
π /4 = lim N → ∞ ( 1/N ) ∑ n=1 N 1/ ( 1 + ( n / N) 2 )
In modern terms , the right - hand side is just the integral
∫ 0 1 dx / ( 1 + x2 )
You can use geometry to see this equals π/ 4 .
Then , as far as I can tell , he writes
1/( 1 + ( n / N) 2 ) = 1 - ( n / N) 2 + ( n /N) 4 - ...
and notes that
1k + 2 k + ... + Nk ~ Nk+1/( k+1 )
for large N. This gives
π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...
Voila !
In fact , this result goes back to Madhava , an amazing mathematician from Kerala who lived much earlier , from 1350 to 1425 .
What 's even more impressive is that Madhava also knew a formula equivalent to the more general result
arctan(x ) = x - x3/3 + x5/5 - x7/7 + ...
He used this to compute π to 11 decimal places !
It 's an interesting question whether any of the results of the Kerala school found their way west and influenced the development of mathematics in Europe .
There 's been a lot of speculation , but nobody seems to know for sure .

Before the conference started , I spent a nice morning talking with Tom Leinster in a café on Bloor Street .
There 's nothing like talking about math in a nice warm café when it 's cold outside !
At some point my former grad student Toby Bartels showed up - he'd just taken a long Greyhound bus from Nebraska - and joined in the conversation .
We talked about this paper :
5 ) Tom Leinster , The Euler characteristic of a category , available as math .
CT/0610260 .
Everyone know how to measure the size of a set - by its number of elements , or " cardinality " .
But what 's the size of a category ?
That 's the question this paper tackles !
Some categories are just sets in disguise : the " discrete " categories , whose only morphisms are identity morphisms .
We 'd better define the size of such a category to be the cardinality of its set of objects .
For example , the category with just one object and its identity morphism is called 1 .
It looks sort of like this :
o
We could also have a category with just two objects and their identity morphisms .
It looks like this :
o o
But what about this ?
o--<--->--o
In other words , we have two objects that are isomorphic - and in a unique way .
How big should this category be ?
Any mathematician worth her salt knows that having two things that are isomorphic in a unique way is just like having one : you can't do anything more with them - or less .
So , the size of this category :
o--<--->--o
o
More technically , we say these categories are " equivalent " .
We 'll demand that equivalent categories have the same size .
This is a powerful principle .
If we did n't insist on this , we'd be insane .
But what about this category :
o---->----o
If we were willing to make up new kinds of numbers , we could make up a new number for the size of this category .
But let 's suppose that this is against the rules .
There 's a cute way to turn any category into a space , which I described in " week70 " - and in more detail in items J and K of " week117 " , back when I was giving a minicourse on homotopy theory .
If we do this to the category
o---->----o
We also get the unit interval if we turn this guy
o--<--->--o
In fact , let 's adopt this as a new principle !
We 'll demand that two categories have the same size whenever they give the same space .
Whenever categories are equivalent , they give the same space ( where " the same " means " homotopy equivalent " ) .
So , our new principle includes our previous principle as a special case .
But , we can say more .
If you like adjoint functors , you 'll enjoy this : whenever there 's a pair of adjoint functors going between two categories , they give the same space .
For example , these categories
o---->----o
o--<--->--o
Next , what 's the size of this category ?
---->---- / \ o o \ / ---->----
If we turn this category into the space , what do we get ?
The circle , of course !
But what 's the " size " , or " cardinality " , of a circle ?
That 's a tricky puzzle , because it's hard to know what counts as a right answer .
It turns out the right answer is zero .
Why ?
Because the " Euler characteristic " of the circle is zero !
As you may know , Euler lived in Königsberg , a city with lots of islands and bridges :
In fact , he published a paper in 1736 showing that you can't walk around Königsberg and cross each bridge exactly once , winding up where you started .
My crazy theory is that living there also helped him invent the concept of Euler characteristic .
I have no evidence for this , except for this apocryphal story I just made up :
Once upon a time , Euler was strolling along one of the bridges of Königsberg .
He looked across the river , and noticed that workers were building a bridge to a small island that had previously been unconnected to the rest .
He noticed that this reduced the number of isolated islands by one .
Of course , anyone could have seen that !
But in a burst of genius , Euler went further - he realized this meant a bridge was like a " negative island " .
And so , he invented the concept of " Euler characteristic " .
In its simplest form , it 's just the number of islands minus the number of bridges .
For example , if you have two islands in the sea :
o o
If you build a bridge :
o---------o
But now , if you build a second bridge :
--------- / \ o o \ / ---------
To understand why , you have to go further and imagine building a " bridge between bridges " - filling in the space between the bridges with an enormous deck :
--------- /xxxxxxxxx\ oxxxxxxxxxxxo \xxxxxxxxx /
---------
In short , adding a " bridge between bridges " should add 1 to the Euler characteristic .
Just as a bridge counts as a negative island , a bridge between bridges counts as a negative bridge - or an island :
-( - 1 ) = 1 .
It 's all consistent , in its own weird way .
So , Euler defined the Euler characteristic to be
V - E + F
where V is the number of islands ( or " vertices " ) , E is the number of bridges ( or " edges " ) and F is the number of bridges between bridges ( or " faces " ) .
At least that 's how the story goes .
By the way , you must have noticed that the number 1 looks like an interval , while the number 0 looks like a circle .
But did you notice that the Euler characteristic of the interval is 1 , and the Euler characteristic of the circle is 0 ?
I can never make up my mind whether this is a coincidence or not .
Anyway , we can easily generalize the Euler characteristic to higher dimensions , and define it as an alternating sum .
And that turns out to be important for us now , because it turns out that often when we turn a category into a space , we get something higher - dimensional !
This should n't be obvious , since I have n't told you the rule for turning a category into a space .
You might think we always get something 1 - dimensional , built from vertices ( objects ) and edges ( morphisms ) .
But the rule is more subtle .
Whenever we have 2 morphisms end to end , like this :
f g o--->---o--->---o X Y Z
Y o /x\ f / xxx\ g / xxxxx \ X o-------o Z fg
Simlarly , when we have 3 morphisms laid end to end we get a tetrahedron , and so on .
Using these rules , it 's not hard to find a category that gives a sphere , or a torus , or an n-holed torus , when you turn it into a space .
I 'll leave that as a puzzle .
In fact , for any manifold , you can find a category that gives you that manifold when you turn it into a space !
In fact we can get any space at all this way , up to " weak homotopy equivalence " - whatever that means .
So , let 's adopt a new principle : whenever our category gives a space whose Euler characteristic is well - defined , we should define the size of our category to be that .
I say " when it 's well - defined " , because it's also possible for a category - even one with just finitely many objects and morphisms - to give an infinite - dimensional space whose Euler characteristic is a divergent series :
n 0 - n 1 + n 2 - n 3 + n 4 - ...
Okay .
At this point it 's time for me to say what Leinster actually did : he came up with a formula that you can use to compute the size of a category , without using any topology .
Sometimes it gives divergent answers - which is no shame : after all , some categories are infinitely big .
But when it converges , it satisfies all the principles I 've mentioned .
Even better , it works for a lot of categories that give spaces whose Euler chacteristic diverges !
For example , we can take any group G and think of it as a category with one object , with the group elements as morphisms .
When we turn this category into a space , it becomes something famous called the " classifying space " of G .
This is often an infinite - dimensional monstrosity whose Euler characteristic diverges .
But , Leinster 's formula still works - and it gives
1/|G|
the reciprocal of the usual cardinality of G .
Now we 're getting fractions !
For example , suppose we take G to be the group with just 2 elements , called Z/ 2 .
If we think of it as a category , and then turn that into a space , we get a huge thing usually called " infinite - dimensional real projective space " , or RP∞ for short .
This is built from one vertex , one edge , one triangle , and so on .
So , if we try to work out its Euler characteristic , we get the divergent series
1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...
But , if we use Leinster 's formula , we get 1 / 2 .
And that 's cute , because once there were heated arguments about the value of
1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...
Some mathematicians said it was 0 :
( 1 - 1 ) + ( 1 - 1 ) + ( 1 - 1 ) + ... = 0
while others said it was 1 :
1 + ( - 1 + 1 ) + ( - 1 + 1 ) + ( - 1 + 1 ) + ... = 1
Some said " it 's divergent , so forget it ! "
But others wisely compromised and said it equals 1 / 2 .
This can be justified using " Abel summation " .
All this may seem weird - and it is ; that 's part of the fun .
But , Leinster 's answer matches what you 'd expect from the theory of " homotopy cardinality " :
6 ) John Baez ,
The mysteries of counting : Euler characteristic versus homotopy cardinality , http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/counting/
This webpage has transparencies of a talk I gave on this , and lots of links to papers that generalize the concepts of cardinality and Euler characteristic .
I 'm obsessed with this topic .
It 's really exciting to think about new ways to extend the simplest concepts of math , like counting .
That 's why I invented a way to compute the cardinality of a groupoid - a category where every morphism has an inverse , so all the morphisms describe " symmetries " .
The idea is that the more symmetries an object has , the smaller it is .
Applying this to the above example , where our category has one object , and this object has 2 symmetries , one gets 1 / 2 .
If this seems strange , try the explanation in " week147 " .
Later James
Dolan took this idea , generalized it to a large class of spaces that do n't necessarily come from groupoids , and called the result " homotopy cardinality " .
We wrote a paper about this .
What Leinster has done is generalize the idea in another direction : from groupoids to categories .
The cool thing is that his generalization matches the Euler characteristic of spaces coming from categories ( when that 's well - defined , without divergent series ) and the homotopy cardinality of spaces coming from groupoids ( when that 's well - defined ) .
Of course he does n't call his thing the " size " of a category ; he calls it the " Euler characteristic " of a category .
Our conversation over coffee was mainly about me trying to understand the formula he used to define this Euler characteristic .
One thing I learned is that the " category algebra " idea plays a key role here .
It 's a simple idea .
Given a category X , the category algebra C[ X ] consists of all formal complex linear combinations of morphisms in X .
To define the multiplication in this algebra , it 's enough to define the product fg whenever f and g are morphisms in our category .
If the composite of f and g is defined , we just let fg be this composite .
If it 's not , we set fg = 0 .
Mathematicians seem to be most familiar with the category algebra idea when our category happens to be a group ( a category with one object , all of whose morphisms are invertible ) .
Then it 's called a " group algebra " .
Category algebras are also pretty familiar when our category is a " quiver " ( a category formed from a directed graph by freely throwing in formal composites of edges ) .
Then it 's called a " quiver algebra " .
These are really cool - especially if our graph becomes a Dynkin diagram , like this :
o | o--o--o--o--o--o--o
In combinatorics , category algebras are familiar when our category is a " partially ordered set " , or " poset " for short ( a category with at most one morphism from any given object to any other ) .
These category algebras are usually called " incidence algebras " .
In physics , Alain Connes has given a nice explanation of how Heisenberg invented " matrix mechanics " when he was trying to understand how atoms jump from one state to another , emitting and absorbing radiation .
In modern language , Heisenberg took a groupoid with n objects , each one isomorphic to each other in a unique way .
He called the objects " states " of a quantum system , and he called the morphisms " transitions " .
Then , he formed its category algebra .
The result is the algebra of n × n matrices !
( This might seem like a roundabout way to get to n × n matrices , but Heisenberg did n't know about matrices at this time .
They were n't part of the math curriculum for physicists back then ! )
Connes has generalized the heck out of Heisenberg 's idea , studying the " groupoid algebras " of various groupoids .
So , category algebras are all over the place .
But for some reason , few people study all these different kinds of category algebra in a unified way - or even realize they 're all category algebras !
I feel sort of sorry for this neglected concept .
That 's one reason I was happy to see it plays a role in Leinster 's definition of the Euler characteristic for categories .
Suppose our category X is finite .
Then , we can define an element of the category algebra C[ X ] which is just the sum of all the morphisms in X .
This is called ζ , or the " zeta function " of our category .
Sometimes ζ has an inverse , and then this inverse is called μ , or the " Möbius function " of our category .
Actually , these terms are widely used only when our category is a poset , thanks to the work of Gian - Carlo Rota , who used these ideas in combinatorics :

That 's a clue !
The relation to the Riemann zeta function and its inverse ( the original " Möbius function " ) are clearer here :
9 ) Wikipedia , Möbius inversion formula , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_inversion_formula
These show up when we think of the whole numbers 1,2,3 , ... as a poset ordered by divisibility .
Anyway , Leinster has wisely generalized this terminology to more general categories .
And when ζ - 1 = μ exists , it 's really easy to define his Euler characteristic of the category X .
You just write μ as a linear combination of morphisms in your category , and sum all the coefficients in this linear combination !
Unfortunately , there are lots of important categories whose zeta function is not invertible : for example , any group other than the trivial group .
So , Leinster needs a somewhat more general definition to handle these cases .
I do n't feel I deeply understand it , but I 'll explain it , just for the record .
Besides the category algebra C[ X ] , consisting of linear combinations of morphisms in X , there 's also a vector space consisting of linear combinations of objects in X .
Heisenberg would probably call this " the space of states " , and call C[ X ] the " algebra of observables " , since that 's what they were in his applications to quantum physics .
Let 's do that .
The algebra of observables has an obvious left action on the vector space of states , where a morphism f : x → y acts on x to give y , and it acts on every other object to give 0 .
In Heisenberg 's example , this is precisely how he let the algebra of observables act on states .
The algebra of observables also has an obvious right action on the vector space of states , where f : x → y acts on y to give x , and it acts on every other object to give 0 .
Leinster defines a " weighting " on X to be an element w of the vector space of states with
ζ w = 1
Here " 1 " is the linear combination of objects where all the coefficients equal 1 .
He also defines a " coweighting " to be an element w* in the vector space of states with
w* ζ = 1
If ζ has an inverse , our category has both a weighting and a coweighting , since we can solve both these equations to find w and w* .
But often there will be a weighting and coweighting even when ζ does n't have an inverse .
When both a weighting and coweighting exist , the sum of the coefficients of w equals the sum of coefficients of w* - and this sum is what Leinster takes as the " Euler characteristic " of the category X !
This is a bit subtle , and I do n't deeply understand it .
But , Leinster proves so many nice theorems about this " Euler characteristic " that it 's clearly the right notion of the size of a category - or , with a further generalization he mentions , even an n-category !
And , it has nice relationships to other ideas , which are begging to be developed further .
We 're still just learning to count .

According to a tally kept by the Associated Press , more than 150 educators have been killed , and thousands of others have fled the country .
“ I told the M.O.I. and M.O.D. if you ca n’t protect the universities , give me 800 recruits , and I will do this mission , ” Mr. Ajili said , referring to the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense .
“ But they rejected the idea . ”
Shiite leaders have often said that kidnappers who have been linked to the interior ministry have in fact been criminal thugs , or even Sunni insurgents , who have acquired the military - style uniforms used in Tuesday ’s attack , and many others , from street markets where they are widely available .
Basil al - Khateed , a spokesman for the higher education ministry , noting that the employees taken captive were from different ethnic and religious groups , counseled against any hasty conclusions .
“ It ’s not clear if this kidnapping was sectarian or not , ” he said .
But the Shiite official who was among those released by the gunmen gave an account that appeared to leave little doubt that the abductors came from the area of eastern Baghdad that is heavily Shiite .
He said the gunmen , having blindfolded their captives , yelled at motorists to clear the road as they headed east through the traffic from the ministry building , and crossed the Canal expressway .
Beyond the expressway , in northeast Baghdad , lies Sadr City , the main stronghold of Shiiite militia groups , and to the south of it , near the bombed - out ruins of the United Nations building , one of the first targets of Sunni insurgent attacks in 2003 , the district of Baladiyat .
Wasteland between Baladiyat and Sadr City has sometimes been used to dump bodies of kidnap victims .
The official said the gunmen had taken their captives into a large hall with a concrete floor , then begun to quiz each of the men about their identities .
They were continuously shouting and menacing the captives with their weapons , he said .
“ They split us into two groups , ” he said .
“ The first group , they said , ‘ We will release you ’ .
The second group , ‘ We will keep you for additional investigation . ’
They put me in the group that would be released .
When they said that , I thought , ‘ No , they will kill me .
I was sure they would kill me .
They were shouting , ‘ We will kill everyone who does n’t listen to us . ’ ”
But the gunmen put him and the others in his group back onto the pickup trucks , and drove them elsewhere , the official said .
There , he said , they were told to sit on the ground and not to move , and warned that anyone removing a blindfold would be killed .
But after ten minutes of silence , he said , one of the men in the group mustered the courage to clear his eyes , and told the others they were safe .
They had been left in a rural area on the northern side of Baghdad , known as Sadr al - Canal .
“ We do n’t know why they took us , and why they released us , ” the official said .
“ It ’s a terrorist operation with a big criminal ring that planned this . ”
Elsewhere on Tuesday , a car bomb exploded near a busy market in the capital , killing ten people and injuring 25 others , an Interior Ministry official said .
Late Monday and into Tuesday , clashes erupted between members of the Mahdi Army militia , who claim loyalty to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr , and American troops , in Shuala neighborhood , leaving six civilians dead and 13 injuried , an Interior Ministry official said .
Police found 25 bodies dumped across the city on Tuesday , the official said .
One of the advantages ( and pretty much the only one ) of being down with the flu recently is I 've been able to hack away at Factor code , like the serialization library mentioned previously .
I 've just added simple distributed message passing support to the concurrency library .
Processes now belong to ' nodes ' .
These are individual Factor instances running on a machine .
Messages can be sent between Factor nodes using the same foramt as sending from processes within a Factor instance .
So far the support I 've added is very basic and not at all optimized but it works .
Messages can be any Factor type supported by the serialization library .
I 've extended the serialization library by added a serializer for local processes that serializes it as a ' remote - process ' .
This holds the node details ( hostname and port ) and the process identifier ( known as the pid ) .
This allows you to send a local process to a remote process , and that remote process can send a reply back to the local one by sending a message to the remote - process object it receives .
A possible future extension to this might be to serialize proxies for other types .
For example , sending a stream in a message can serialize it as a proxy stream so that writes to it from the remote system are sent back to the stream on the local system .
The current state of the system is in my repository :
darcs get http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/repos/factor
The ' start - node ' word is used to start up a TCP listener to handle requests from remote processes .
This is required for distributed message passing to work .
If you do n't use ' start - node ' only local message sends will be enabled .
Here 's a simple example that sends a message to a remote process , and it sends a reply back to the caller :
#! On Machine 1 " concurrency " require USE : concurrency " machine1.com " 9000 start - node : process1 ( -- ) receive " Message Received ! " reply process1 ; [ process1 ] spawn " process1 " swap register - process
This starts the node up with hostname ' machine1.com ' on port 9000 .
A word called ' process1 ' is defined that blocks until it receives a message ( either from another local process or a remote process ) and replies to the message sender with the string " Message Received ! " .
It then calls itself to restart the blocking on message receive .
This word is spawned as a process and registered in that nodes global register of named processes as ' process1 ' .
#! On Machine 2 " concurrency " require USE : concurrency " machine2.com " 9000 start - node [ " machine1.com " 9000 < node > " process1 " < remote - process > " test - message " swap send - synchronous . ] spawn
This code , run in a Factor instance on Machine 2 , starts a node with hostname ' machine2.com ' on port 9000 .
It spawns a process which sends a message to the process named ' process1 ' on the node at hostname machine1.com , port 9000 .
This example sends a synchronous message .
It is the equivalent of Termite Scheme 's '!? ' operator or Joe Armstrongs '!!' proposed Erlang extension - basically an RPC call .
The message is sent to process one and blocks waiting for a reply to that specific message .
On the reply it displays it ( using '. ' ) which results in ' Message Received ! ' being printed .
Asynchronous sends work too .
For example , a logger process on machine 1 :
#!
On Machine 1 : logger ( -- ) receive print logger ; [ logger ] spawn " logger " swap register - process
Messages can be sent to this process from any machine with :
#! On Machine 2 [ " machine1.com " 9000 < node > " logger " < remote - process > " Log Message ! " swap send ] spawn
After this message send ' Log Message ! ' will be printed on machine 1 .
Messages can be sent to named processes , registered in the nodes global registry , as these examples show , or they can be sent to any process given the pid - a unique identifier for that process .
They can also be sent to remote processes given a deserialized reference to the process object .
You could store on a file system or web server deserialized references to important processes that clients can send messages to .
I 'm still working on the public API and making the performance better .
Currently all message sends open and close the TCP socket to the remote server per message .
There is also no security .
The server connection for the node is accessable by anyone .
Initially I may follow the Erlang ' magic cookie ' approach to prevent unauthorised message sends but keen to look at better options .
My motivation for working on this is to add to my in - progress web framework the ability to have the server side processes distributed across Factor instances or machines .
This is one way to enable Factor to use multiple processors in a machine for example .

を読みながら、pepsi & coke の勉強をしています 。
環境の準備 idst - 5.7 に付属する jolt を使って勉強します。必要なファイル は
http://piumarta.com/pepsi/
にあります。ここでは、ソースとバイナリ両方使います。ソースだけ落としてコンパイルしても勿論大丈夫です。まずバイナリを / 以下にコピーします。windows の場合は cygwin が必要です。ソースで使うのは example / jolt ディレクトリだけなので、それを適当な場所にコピーして make しておきます。以後このディレクトリで作業を行います。なお、linux で使うためには以下を実行する必要があります。 $ execstack -s main
シェルを起動して coke 式を評価 coke の実装である jolt のシェルを起動して式を入力すると答えが返ります。基本的な計算のテストをします。ここではカーソルキー等、一般的な readline のキー操作が使えます。終了するには ctrl +
D です。 $ ./main.exe boot.k - .(+ 3 4 ) => 7 .(+ 3 (* 2 3 ) ) => 9 coke では lisp のような形式 ( 関数名 引数 ... )
でリストを評価します。引数を全て評価してから関数が呼ばれます。すると => の後に答えが表示されます。大島さんのテキストでは、ここから [ ]
を使ったメッセージ送信について解説がありますが、難しいのでもう少し () だけを使った実験をします。関数定義の define を実験してみます。scheme とよく似ています。 .( define plus ( lambda ( a b ) (+ a b ) ) ) => 10797800 .( plus 3 4 ) => 7 .( define fib ( lambda ( n ) . ( if ( == n 0 ) 1 . ( if ( == n 1 ) 1 . (+ ( fib (- n 1 ) ) ( fib (- n 2 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) => 10823464 .( fib 10 ) => 89 関数定義の時にも数字が出てきて鬱陶しいですが、これは関数のアドレスです。アドレスで直接呼び出しても同じです。
.( define minus ( lambda ( a b ) (- a b ) ) ) => 10857176 .( 10857176 100 10 ) => 90 という事は結局 coke のプログラムは整数を括弧で包んだ物と言えます 。
C の関数を呼ぶ boot .k を見ると、printf が定義されています。 .( printf " hello world
" ) hello world => 12 .( printf " 3 + 4 = %i
" (+ 3 4 ) ) 3 + 4 = 7 => 10 ( _dlsym _RTLD_DEFAULT
関数名 ) で任意の C の関数を coke の関数に出来るようです。芸が無いですが、putc を定義してみます。 .( define puts ( _dlsym _RTLD_DEFAULT " puts " ) ) => -519487552 .( puts " hage " ) hage => 10
メッセージ送信 book .k では、C の関数以外に pepsi の StdOut オブジェクトもインポートしています。pepsi とは、coke の為に用意された別の言語です。ややこしいですが、coke のソースは pepsi で書かれています。インポートされた StdOut オブジェクトを使うには send 関数を使います。send 関数を使うと、 ( send メッセージ オブジェクト 引数 ... ) の形で pepsi オブジェクトにメッセージを送信出来ます。 ???
なんだこれは ???
boot.k を見ると 、StdOut がオブジェクトとして定義されているのでこれを使ってみます。test.k がにサンプルがあります。 .( send 'nextPutAll : StdOut ' " hello world
" ) hello world => 25 ' をつける奴とつけない奴に注意が必要です。StdOut 以外には ' を付ける必要があります。 を使うとこの send 式をもう少し読みやすく表現する事が出来ます。 式では、要素の順番が変わってメッセージの ' を省略します。引数の ' は省略出来ないので注意が必要です。 .[ StdOut nextPutAll : '" hello world
" ] hello world => 25 ここで ' についてもうちょっと調べます。なにも付けない 3 は機械語の世界の 3 ですが、 ' を付けると pepsi オブジェクトになります 。pepsi オブジェクトの整数の内部表現は 、Squeak VM に習って 数字 * 2 + 1 になっているので coke シェルは 7 と答えます。 .3 => 3 .( quote 3 ) => 7 .' 3 => 7 .[ StdOut nextPutAll : [ '3 printString ] ]
3 => 3 StdOut も printf と同じく define 文で定義された物ですが、C の関数ではなく pepsi のオブジェクトです。両者の定義方法を比較してみます。 ( define printf ( _dlsym _RTLD_DEFAULT " printf " ) ) C の関数
( define StdOut ( import " StdOut " ) ) pepsi のオブジェク ト
coke ( jolt ) と pepsi ( idc ) と C 言語の関係 ややこしいですが、依存関係は次のようになっています。 pepsi 処理系 ( idc ) は Smalltalk に似た言語で、pepsi 自体によって書かれています 。
pepsi ( idc ) をコンパイルするに は C 言語を一旦経由するため 、C コンパイラが必要です 。
coke ( jolt ) は scheme に似た言語で 、pepsi によって書かれています 。coke はインタプリタなの で
C コンパイラは不要ですが 、C プログラム並みに早く動作します 。
大島さんに聞いた話では 、coke によって pepsi を実装しなおすのがとりあえず目標だそうです 。
The U.S.S. Intrepid was to leave its dock on the West Side of Manhattan today for the first time in 24 years , aided by an unusually high tide and six powerful tugboats .
A fire boat was on hand to fire off its water cannons as the aircraft carrier - turned - floating museum moved away , and dignitaries were assembled on the Forbes yacht Highlander waiting to accompany ship downriver .
With helicopters whirling overhead and boats lining the Hudson River , two former mayors , Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins , cast off the last mooring lines and stood back to watch the ship depart .
The Intrepid declined to cooperate .
With two mighty tugs pulling on the stern and four smaller ones assisting alongside , the Intrepid moved about 10 feet , and refused to go any farther .
After about an hour of fruitless pulling and with the tide falling , Susan Marenoff , the executive director of the Intrepid Sea , Air and Space Museum , announced that the attempt would be halted .
Officials said the ship ’s propellers had apparently dug into the bottom of the river and were stuck there .

Django vs. Cheetah : 1 -
0
by Guido van van Rossum
January 31 , 2006
Summary
I finally got some time to play with Cheetah and Django templates .
After maybe an hour with each , I like Django best .
Hopefully people are still watching this space ...
Advertisement
Encouraged by Fredrik Lundh , I took a look at Django templating , separate from the rest of Django .
This works fine , except there 's a mysterious environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE that is somehow required .
That may be fine for framework users , but it 's a bit harsh if all you want to do is use the templating library .
Setting it to empty did n't help .
I ended up uing this hack :
import os os.environ [ " DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
" ] = " __main__ " from django.core.template import Template
With that out of the way , I managed to run this program :
t = Template ( " < h1 > Hello {{name}} </h1 > " ) print t.render ( {" name " : " Phillip " } ) print t.render ( {" name " : " Adrian " } )
This is nice !
The output of course is :
< h1 > Hello Phillip</h1 > < h1 > Hello Adrian</h1 >
Unfortunately I had trouble installing Django for the Python 2.5 alpha that I 've got installed ; it uses the fancy new ez_install stuff , which is great when it works , but there 's no Python 2.5 download of setuptools on PyPI yet , so it does n't .
I tried the same exercise using Cheetah .
Not too different :
from Cheetah .
Template import Template names = { " name " : " Tavis " } t = Template ( " < h1 > Hello $ name < /h1 > " , searchList= [ names ] ) print t names [ " name " ] = " Ian " print t
with the following output :
< h1 > Hello Tavis </ h1 > < h1 > Hello Ian</h1 >
( Ironically , Cheetah also failed under Python 2.5 -- Python 2.5 inadvertently ( I believe ) changes the syntax that 's allowed before " from __future__ import ... " to disallow assignment to __author__ and __version__ .
That was easier to fix though -- commenting out the " from __future__ ... " line was sufficient . )
Side - by - side Comparison ( BEWARE !
I have n't used either system to build a real website yet .
I 'm just looking at the API and templating language designs . )
Django definitely feels more " modern " than Cheetah .
The templating languages are fairly similar , with Django writing {{foo. bar}} where Cheetah writes $ foo. bar or $ { foo. bar} for variable interpolation ( == substitution ) .
The biggest difference is that Cheetah allows pretty much arbitrary Python call syntax , e.g. $ { foo. bar ( ' hello ' , $ name , 42+42 ) } .
Yes , you have to prefix variable references in the argument list with another $ , and there are confusing rules about when the $ is optional .
Django only allows names separated by dots , using the old Zope trick of trying x['y ' ] , x.y and x.y ( ) when the input is {{x .
y}} .
When y looks like a number , it 'll even try a sequence index , e.g. {{x .4}} means x [ 4 ] .
( Aside : something similar is also found in web.py , but there it bothers me , because it 's invoked from normal - looking Python code .
E.g. foo [ " x " ] and foo.x are equivalent , when foo is a " Storage " object .
But this leaves me wondering , what does foo. keys mean ?
The keys method or the value stored under " keys " ?
Zope 2 was similarly confusing with implicit acquisition . )
A big difference : if Django does n't find a name , it inserts nothing ; but Cheetah raises an exception .
ISTM that Django is more user - friendly here , even if its approach could be considered error - prone ( typos are easily missed since they simply suppress a small bit of output ) .
In my experience , missing variables are very common in substitution data , and Cheetah requires you to provide explicit default values in this case .
Both templating languages also have a " statement " syntax to complement their " expression " interpolating syntax .
In Django , this is written as { % keyword %} while in Cheetah you use #keyword .
Here I initially found Cheetah a bit more readable , since it resembles C preprocessor syntax : # if $ name < h1 > Hello $ name </ h1 > #else < h1 .
Hello there </ h1 > #end if
This is written in Django as : { % if name % } < h1 > Hello {{name}} </h1 > { %else%} < h1 > Hello
There </ h1 > { %endif%} which is harder on the eyes and prints more unnecessary whitespace .
But then I stumbled upon Cheeta 's inline form , which is pretty unreadable due to the symmetric delimiters : # if $ name # < h1 > Hello $ name </ h1 > # else # < h1 > Hello There </ h1 > # end if #
Both languages have tons of other statement - level constructs , to do loops , set variables , invoke other templates , define blocks that can be used by other templates , and more .
I have n't explored this much yet , but they both seem to cover a similar terrain .
I guess this is what template authors actually need ; or perhaps it points to some common ancestor in PHP or JSP ?
If you need your variable interpolations to be HTML - escaped ( replacing " < " with " < " and so on ) , Cheetah lets you specify a default filter in the template ( # filter ) or when the template is created in Python code .
In Django you must add a pipeline to the interpolation syntax , like this : $ {foo.bar|escape} .
Both support various other filters as well , with Django really going wild .
I 'm somehow surprised that HTML - escaping is n't the default -- failing to HTML - escape data is the number one vulnerability leading to XSS attacks .
And in theory you should almost never need to provide HTML for interpolation : you 're supposed to invoke HTML fragments using #include or { %include %} .
Cheetah at least provides a way to make HTML - escaping the default filter throughout a template .
Python API
See the examples near the top .
I like Django 's version better : you pass the variable bindings in to the render ( ) method .
Cheetah lets you specify multiple dictionaries with variable bindings , which are searched one after another , but it bothers me that these all have to be passed to the Template ( ) constructor instead of to the render method ( which is called __str__ ( ) in Cheetah :-) .
Django 's template compilation is much simpler and IMO more elegant than Cheetah : Django parses the template text into nodes of various types using a big regular expression , and each node has an appropriate render ( ) method .
Rendering the template in a given context simply concatenates the results of rendering each node in that context .
I imagine this could easily be turned into a generator compatible with WSGI .
Cheetah , OTOH , compiles each template to a Python class !
This is much slower , and in my experience brittle -- on my first attempt I introduced a syntax error in the template that caused a Python syntax error in the resulting Python class , which was hard to debug .
It also seems overkill , and I worry that it might cause security problems -- given that the compiler is n't too smart ( see above ) I could see a malicious template author " breaking out " of the templating languages and invoking unauthorized Python code .
Now , I would n't let people I do n't trust edit templates on my website anyway , but it appears to be a common pattern that certain people are allowed to edit templates but not code .
Cheetah blurs the distinction a little too much for my comfort .
Other Templating Solutions
I guess we 're closer than I thought to the mix - and - match approach that I requested in my previous blog .
Cheetah is just a templating engine , and several web frameworks use or recommend it , e.g. web.py and Subway .
( Is Subway dead ?
The website is super - incomplete and it still downloads an old Cheetah version . )
Django's templates are almost usable independent from the rest of Django ; I expect the situation will improve once they release the magic - removal branch .
I did n't find too many other templating solutions .
TurboGears uses Kid which XML - based , like Nevow , TAL etc. IMO these are no contenders because they are XML - based .
As the Django folks mention , they use templates to generate non-HTML text files as well .
And even if they could be used for this , the verbosity of the XML syntax and the inability to do a proper if - then - else in XML make template writing using XML a non-starter .
Final Thought Django and Cheetah both define a ' Template ' class .
Python 's standard library also has a Template class ( in string . py ) , which serves a similar purpose ( but with only a fraction of the functionality ) .
All these have different APIs .
But are the differences important ?
It seems pretty arbitrary whether to use Template ( " ... " ).render( locals ( ) ) ( Django ) , or str( Template ( " ... " , searchList=[ locals ( ) ] ) ) ` ( Cheetah ) or ``Template ( " ... " ).substitute( locals ( ) ) ( string.py ) .
Perhaps we could attempt some standardization here similar to WSGI ?

Why do stores charge .99 cents ?

Why do stores often charge .99 cents ?
A loaf of bread selling for $ 1.99 as opposed to $ 2.00 , for example .
Is there psychological research showing that this makes the price seem cheaper somehow ?
If so , how significant is the effect ?
The shockwave bursts through the star 's surface , releasing its energy
Supernovae occur when huge , mature stars effectively run out of fuel and collapse in on themselves .
The observations , outlined in the journal Nature , offer the most detailed picture yet of these cosmic explosions .
An initial release of energy from the star was picked up by the Swift satellite in February , allowing experts to train their telescopes on the event .
This short , sharp outburst , known as an X - ray flash , amounted to an early warning signal that the star was going to turn supernova .
Energy release
Swift is a US - British - Italian mission designed to look out for gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) , intense and energetic outbursts of radiation thought to arise from the collapse of massive stars in a supernova .
However , not all supernovae generate GRBs , and it remains to be determined what causes some but not others to produce these bursts .
The stellar explosion occurred 400 million - light years away
The release of energy that occurs in the X - ray flash lasts for about 15 minutes and is followed by a day - long " breakout " phase , in which a shockwave is thought to breach the surface of the collapsing star , unleashing its energy .
This expands into space as radiation at all frequencies and lasts for a period of days to months - the classic signature of a supernova .
Four groups of astronomers gathered data on the event , and have now published separate research papers in Thursday 's issue of Nature .
Compact remnant
Mission team member Paul O'Brien , of the University of Leicester , UK , said : " The three onboard telescopes detected a slowly brightening then fading object .
" The results suggest a broad jet expanded into the surroundings but it was accompanied by a slower - moving and incredibly hot - two - million - degree - bubble of gas produced from the shockwave of the exploding star . "
Analysis of the expanding debris suggests the initial star had a lower mass than is the norm for such explosions .
Gamma -ray bursts are thought to be associated with the collapse of a star into a black hole .
But lower mass stars are believed to collapse into a compact object known as a neutron star .
" Those observations capture the time when the star collapsed , ejected its outer envelope and most of its mass and left a compact remnant behind .
And we think that compact remnant is a neutron star , " said Paolo Mazzali , one of the authors who is based at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching , Germany .
So what powered the X - ray flash and shockwave ?
The researchers think these were produced by energy supplied by the highly magnetised neutron core , or magnetar as it is known .
The following article was a piece we originally wrote for a marketing page we put up at DomainWarning.com — but we found that a lot of our customers wanted us to keep a copy right here on the website because they were constantly referring their friends and colleagues to it .
Suffice it to say , easyDNS does not engage in any of the tactics described below , but they are widely used across the industry .
General Practice Tricks
1. " Transfer - out " fees
Buried in the fine print of a registrars ’ “ Terms of Service ” will be a hidden fee authorizing them to charge your credit card a “ transfer - out ” fee if you move your domain to another registrar .
Often times , this transfer - out fee is 2 or 3 times the cost of the original registration .
This practice violates the ICANN policy on domain transfers .
In most cases if this happens to you a simple call to your credit card company will have the charge reversed , if you notice .
Registrars who use this practice play the numbers game as many will not .
2 . The fine print from hell
Most people ( read : nobody ) actually reads the long , odious Terms of Service for anything they buy online .
Some registrars bury truly chilling things in these terms like the aforementioned “ transfer - out ” fees and in one mind - boggling case a “ power - of - attorney ” .
At easyDNS , our Terms of Service are always in Plain English , and you do n't assign us the right to commit you to a mental institution by agreeing to them .
3 . “ Pay - as - you - go ”
This is where you make a multi - year interest - free loan to the registrar .
It works like this :
You register a domain with them for example , 5 years ( perhaps to obtain a discounted rate ) , you expect your domain name to be registered for 5 years .
Think again , some registrars will pay the registry for 1 year and pocket the rest of your money .
Then for the rest of your five year term they ’ll renew each year for one year .
Usually this is coupled with a strict “ no - refunds ” policy , so an odd situation occurs : they stand to make more money from your original registration if they lose you as a customer before your full 5 years are up , so providing poor service to the point where you leave actually adds to their bottom line .
You can use a Free whois lookup tool like EasyWhois to verify the real expiration date for your domain .
It should match up with the number of years you paid your registrar for .
Whois Database Gotchas
4 . Whois privacy pricing tricks , edit locks and lock - ins
Every time you register a domain name , the details of that domain registration must be published in a publicly accessible database called Whois .
Because these
Whois databases are routinely datamined by third - party marketers and the information used to send you spam , most registrars offer whois privacy or masking services .
Some registrars , especially the bargain basement outfits , register offer you " free " whois privacy , or very cheap whois privacy .
What happens next is that your Whois privacy price " resets " at a higher , much much higher price when your domain renews .
In some cases , the " free " whois privacy is only for the first month of your registration term .
Even though domain registrations come in 1 - year increments , they start automatically billing your credit card every month , starting in month two at the higher , reset rate .
Some registrars make whois privacy extremely easy to enable , in many cases providing it automatically on registration , unless you explicitly opt - out of it .
But then disabling whois privacy is very difficult , in some cases forcing you to provide photo ID in order to turn it off .
They do this because it makes it harder for you to ever transfer your domain away to a competing registrar .
5 . Who owns your domain ?
The important thing to know here is that in the eyes of the domain Registry to which all the Registrars interact , and the Registry ’s oversight body ( like ICANN , or in Canada , CIRA ) , whoever is listed in the domain whois record as the domain Registrant is the legal owner of the domain name .
Keep that in mind , if you use a service like this , they own the domain , not you , notwithstanding whatever contract or Terms of Service you enter into with them to “ own ” this name on your behalf .
If it lands in a dispute proceeding it will be an open and shut case : they own the name .
Taking it one step further , some “ privacy ” services will get you to sign up for the whois privacy service and then they turn around and happily offer to sell your true data to anybody else who cares to pay for it .
6 . Mining whois and domain slamming
Because all the data is there for the taking , spammers and marketers “ mine ” the whois database and harvest registrant data including addresses , fax numbers and email addresses .
This is a real problem , and there have been very slow moving Whois database reform processes creeping through ICANN as well as CIRA in Canada .
In the meantime though , people may wonder why is it that shortly after they register a domain name , they start getting all kinds of marketing spam in their mailbox .
This is because their email address is being harvested by robots from the Whois database .
There is a free service to protect your email address called MyPrivacy.ca .
The variation on this is some registrars ( and there is one outfit who is particularly notorious for this ) which is mining the whois database for registrant information , and then mailing out what look like renewal invoices for either those domain names or variations of them .
Unsuspecting recipients think they ’ve received a renewal invoice on their domain and then remit payment , initiating a domain transfer without realizing it .
Surprise , you ’ve been slammed .
In the worst cases your website and email comes crashing down as your DNS services terminate with your old provider .
Domain lock - in ( a.k.a
You can check out anytime you like , but you can never leave . )
7 . The registrar - lock
There has historically been a real problem with " domain slamming " ( see above ) and unauthorized domain transfers , so the " registrar - lock " was created to protect a domain against this .
If the registrar lock is set , nobody can transfer your domain away from you .
This is actually a good thing and best practices include having this set for all your domains .
The sharper registrars enable it by default when they register or transfer a domain for you .
Alas , this lock can become a real problem for you if it is turned on and the registrar will not turn it off , or give you the ability to turn it on or off yourself .
8 . The domain auth - code
Some of the Top - Level - Domains ( TLDs ) run on a protocol called “ EPP ” and to further guard against unauthorized transfers , a domain must have an 8 - character auth - code supplied before it will transfer .
Current examples are .
BIZ , .INFO and .ORG .
The current or “ losing ” registrar holds this code .
You need it if you want to move your domain away .
Hopefully they will give it to you .
Registrars should provide you this auth code in realtime or near realtime whenever you request it .
Some of them , notably one of the larger , older players , takes 3 business days to email you your auth code , making it even harder to transfer away to a competing registrar .
Traffic & monetization scams
9. Domain parking
You may not know this , but domain parking is big business .
You know , when you click on a link somewhere or make a typo entering a web address and you wind up on some crapola “ search page ” optionally throwing up a million pop - up ads ?
That is a parked domain and the larger players can park thousands of domains and make literally millions of dollars “ monetizing ” them via domain parking .
You know who has access to thousands of domains ?
Domain registrars .
Some of them offer domain registrations and rock bottom prices just so they can monetize the parked names .
This may not bother you , but some people do n’t realize they ’re paying for something their registrar then uses to generate more revenue for themselves .
( Update : since the time of writing one registrar in particular rolled out a “ Make money from your domains ’ parked pages ” initiative , which surprised me since I knew them to be one of the biggest parked page monetizers around — they make millions per month monetizing their customers ’ parked domains — until I looked at the details : Packages start at 3.99 / month .
They are actually charging their customers for domain parking monetization .
What audacity .
If you actually have a domain that ’s actually worth something parked , take it to a parking service .
They pay you to park your pages .
Not the other way around ) .
10 . Domain expiry sniping
The domain aftermarket is also a big business .
That 's when people buy and sell domains that are already registered .
Ideally , you 're the one selling when it comes to your names .
But many domain registrars actively scour their own customers ' domains for names that would fetch premium prices in the aftermarket .
If you 've registered a domain and never used it , leaving it parked at your registrars ' parking system ( see # 9 above ) , you may even see ads offering to sell your domain to whoeever is interested .
This is the registrar scouting out advance interest for your names .
When your domains near expiry , the registrar already has a decent idea how much traffic it gets , and how much interest there is in the name .
They may surmise that your domain is worth more to them if you forget and let it expire than if you actually renew it .
The Conclusion
There are many gotcha’s in the arcane and Kafkaesque world of domain name registrations .
There is no free lunch , the rock bottom priced domain registrar has other plans to boost their revenues and at the end of the day a good rule of thumb is ...
Go with an ethical registrar
So if you want to register your domain with a registrar who does n’t play any of these games , a domain registrar who :

Rent - To - Steal
Straw - man Swindle
The Million Dollar Dump
Say you 're advertising to rent your home or investment property .
A renter shows up who seems to have all the right documentation to qualify .
It 's a deal !
The monthly rental checks start coming in on time .
But behind your back , the renter ( using an alias with fake or stolen identification ) goes to the local court and files a false " satisfaction of loan " document complete with your forged signature , forged bank officers ' signatures , and bank seals .
This shows that the property is now " free and clear " - that is , there are no outstanding mortgages on it .
Now the renter / con artist is able to go to lenders and take out new loans on the property - often taking out several , practically simultaneously , in your name .
Suddenly your renter vanishes and three or four banks are claiming title to your home .
Con artists use a " straw man " or " straw buyer " to purchase a property .
A straw buyer is usually someone fairly unsophisticated who has passable credit .
Often straw buyers are told by the huckster - a mastermind who uses a false identity and typically poses as a sophisticated investor - that they 'll get a nice chunk of money if they go in on a plain - vanilla business transaction with him .
The straw buyer gets a mortgage on the property .
Then the straw buyer signs the property over to the huckster in a quitclaim deed , relinquishing all rights to the property as well as the underlying mortgage .
The straw buyer gives the huckster the mortgage proceeds , taking a small cut-usually 10 percent - for himself .
The huckster does n't make any mortgage payments and often even pockets rent from unsuspecting tenants until the property falls into foreclosure .
Usually the straw man , not the mastermind , is arrested for fraud .
A con artist looks for a low - end , rundown house for sale .
He approaches the seller and says he 's willing to pay the full asking price - but only if the seller will do him a small favor .
See , the buyer needs a bigger mortgage than the house is worth .
So if the owner agrees to relist the house at , say , triple the price , then the buyer can apply for a bigger mortgage .
The swindler often tells the homeowner not to worry - he wants to use the extra mortgage proceeds to fix up the house .
The seller usually heartily agrees :
He 's getting the full price … and besides , would n't it be nice to have the place fixed up ?
The swindler , using a false identity , takes out the supersized mortgage , pays the seller , and pockets the remainder .
The house usually ends up in foreclosure .
The boy , Ajay , strayed from the family home as his parents and other family members were having lunch .
When his mother went to look for him , she found the pigs chewing something and spotted bits of her son 's clothing .
She threw stones at the animals but they turned on her .
Her screams alerted neighbours who came to her rescue .
' Playing '
Relatives in the village of Samaipur Badli in north - west Delhi told police the boy had been carrying bread , which might have led the animals to attack him .
A senior police official , Manish Aggarwal , said a local man who owned the pigs had been detained for causing death due to negligence .
" Three children were playing outside their house when the incident took place , " Mr Aggarwal told the BBC .
" The victim , Ajay , strayed from the area but his parents or relatives were not there to save him since they were having lunch inside their house . "
DURING 2006 , according to B'tselem , an Israeli human - rights group , Israeli forces killed 660 Palestinians , almost half of them innocent bystanders , among them 141 children .
In the same period , Palestinians killed 17 Israeli civilians and six soldiers .
It is such figures , as well as events like shellings , house demolitions , arrest raids and land expropriations , that make the headlines in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
What rarely get into the media but make up the staple of Palestinian daily conversation are the countless little restrictions that slow down most people 's lives , strangle the economy and provide constant fuel for extremists .
Arbitrariness is one of the most crippling features of these rules .
No one can predict how a trip will go .
Many of the main West Bank roads , for the sake of the security of Israeli settlers in the West Bank , are off - limits to Palestinian vehicles — only one road connecting the north and south West Bank , for instance , is open to them — and these restrictions change frequently .
So do the rules on who can pass the checkpoints that in effect divide the West Bank into a number of semi-connected regions ( see map ) .
A new order due to come into force this week would have banned most West Bankers from riding in cars with Israeli licence plates , and thus from getting lifts from friends and relatives among the 1.6 m
Palestinians who live as citizens in Israel , as well as from aid workers , journalists and other foreigners .
The army decided to suspend the order after protests from human - rights groups that it would give soldiers enormous arbitrary powers — but it has not revoked it .
Large parts of the population of the northern West Bank , and of individual cities like Nablus and Jericho , simply cannot leave their home areas without special permits , which are not always forthcoming .
If they can travel , how long they spend waiting at checkpoints , from minutes to hours , depends on the time of day and the humour of the soldiers .
Several checkpoints may punctuate a journey between cities that would otherwise be less than an hour 's drive apart .
These checkpoints move and shift every day , and army jeeps add to the unpredictability and annoyance by stopping and creating ad hoc mobile checkpoints at various spots .
According to the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , the number of such obstacles had increased to 534 by mid-December from 376 in August 2005 , when OCHA and the Israeli army completed a joint count .
When Ehud Olmert , the Israeli prime minister , agreed last month to ease restrictions at a few of these checkpoints as a concession to Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , human - rights people reported that not only did many of the checkpoints go on working as before ; near the ones that had eased up , mobile ones were now operating instead , causing worse disruption and pain .
It is sometimes hard to fathom the logic of the checkpoint regime .
One route from Ramallah , the Palestinian administrative capital , to Jerusalem , involves a careful inspection of documents , while on another the soldiers — if they are at their posts — just glance at cars ' occupants to see if they look Arab .
Israeli law strictly forbids Israeli citizens from visiting the main Palestinian cities , but they can drive straight into Ramallah and Hebron without being challenged , while other cities , such as Jericho and Nablus , remain impermeable .
In many places the barrier that Israel is building through the West Bank for security purposes ( though in Palestinian eyes to grab more land ) is monitored with all the care of an international border , while around Jerusalem the army turns a blind eye to hundreds of people who slip through cracks in the wall as part of their daily commute .
Because of the internal travel restrictions , people who want to move from one Palestinian city to another for work or study must register a change of address to make sure they can stay there .
But they cannot .
Israel 's population registry , which issues Palestinian identity cards as well as Israeli ones , has issued almost no new Palestinian cards since the start of the second intifadain 2000 .
And that means no address changes either .
This also makes it virtually impossible for Palestinians from abroad to get residency in the occupied territories , which are supposed to be their future state , never mind in Israel .
No - through - roads galore
On top of that , in the past year several thousand Palestinians who had applied for residency in the West Bank and were living there on renewable six - month visitor permits have become illegal residents too , liable to be stopped and deported at any checkpoint , not because of anything they have done but because Israel has stopped renewing permits since Hamas , the Islamist movement , took control of the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) a year ago .
( Israel says it is because the PA is n't handing over the requests . )
Like Israelis , Palestinians who commit a traffic offence on the West Bank 's highways have to pay the fine at an Israeli post office or a police station .
But in the West Bank the only post offices and police stations are on Israeli settlements that most West Bank Palestinians cannot visit without a rare permit .
If they do not pay , however , they lose their driving licences the next time the police stop them .
They also get a criminal record — which then makes an Israeli entry permit quite impossible .
Some of the regulations stray into the realm of the absurd .
A year ago a military order , for no obvious reason , expanded the list of protected wild plants in the West Bank to include za'atar ( hyssop ) , an abundant herb and Palestinian staple .
For a while , soldiers at checkpoints confiscated bunches of it from bewildered Palestinians who had merely wanted something to liven up their salads .
Lately there have been no reports of za'atar confiscation , but , says Michael Sfard , the legal adviser for Yesh Din , another Israeli human - rights body , the order is still in force .
As he tells the story , he can not help laughing .
There is not much else to do .
INGREDIENTS : CORN SYRUP , HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP , WATER , CELLULOSE GUM , CARAMEL COLOR , SALT , SODIUM BENZOATE AND SORBIC ACID ( PRESERVATIVES ) , ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL FLAVORS , SODIUM HEXAMETAPHOSPHATE .

An Ode To Tabasco Sauce
I wrote a really positive post on Tabasco Sauce a few days ago , so in the interests of journalistic balance ( and so I do n’t seem like just another product flack ) , I decided to do a negative piece this time .
So today you ’re going to read a piece condemning fake “ syrup ” .
A polemic .
A denunciation , dripping with invective .
A jeremiad .
A screed , if you will .
Okay , so maybe you can tell by now that I , uh , do n’t really like fake syrup .
And it ’s not just the taste .
It ’s more the phony - ness .
The chemicals .
The fact that we already get too much “ high fructose corn syrup ” in our diets as it is .
So to convince you , and to turn your stomach a little bit today , I ’d like you to try a quick little exercise with me :
Let ’s take a quick look at a highly typical phony syrup : Aunt Jemima .
I ’d like you to take a look at their “ Original ” syrup product page .
After you go to that link , click where it says “ Ingredients . ”
Wow .
Ewww .
So this is what you are putting into your body when you eat this brownish - colored industrial goo :
Do they think they are doing a good jobthe product by putting that information on their webpage ?
I ’d call that some pretty suspect work from the marketing department .
Most people ( including me ) ca n’t even“ sodium hexametaphosphate ” much less do we want to ingest it .
PS : does anybody out there care to weigh in on what the heck that chemical actually does ?
Is it toxic ?
Maybe the hardworking webmasters at The Quaker Oats Company should just stick with simple pictures of the bottle , a smiling drawing of Aunt Jemima ’s face … and just leave out the nauseating ingredients partThis is why you should ONLY use real maple syrup in your home .
It ’s delicious , it ’s actually a real product , it keeps nearly forever , and itcontain sodium hexametawhatever .
To learn more about pure maple syrups from New York State , I encourage you to start with the New York State Maple Producers Association website .
They have a thorough list of syrup producers here
And if you want to learn about different syrup grades , take a look here .
Keep in mind that in addition to New York , Vermont and Pennsylvania are well - known and highly regarded maple syrup producing states .
PS : My personal favorite is the New York Grade A Dark Amber !
Many people working for a relatively large corporation might bristle at the prospect of speaking face to face with 500 hackers with an average age of 22 .
I had exactly that opportunity this past Saturday as an invitee to Paul Graham 's YCombinator Startup School held in Harvard 's Science Center .
Hands down , it was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my career .
The setup was simple : pull young aspiring entrepreneurs from around the world into one place and give them 36 hours of relentless exposure to tech luminaries , IP attorneys , serial entrepreneurs , VCs , and corporate sellout interlopers like me .
The speakers ranged from Woz , who gave a fantastic account of the early Apple days to Stephen Wolfram , Sergey 's first ' boss ' , who remarked that Sergey still owes him some deliverables .
( I will be sure to let him know . )
Olin Shivers gave a wonderfully ominous account of taking venture funding that contained one slide titled : " VCs – Soulless Agents of Satan , or Just Clumsy Rapists ? ”
One for the scrapbooks , to be sure .
As I entered Harvard Science Center 's Room B , where the event was held , I was instantly struck by the sheer energy of the crowd .
It was between speakers , and the ambitious gaggle of hackers was comparing screens , showing off mashups , and climbing over the seats to continue protocol preference debates in closer proximity to their combatants .
No one was running off to check in with their assistant or jump onto a mindless conference call with sales finance .
As speakers sequentially took to the podium , the students took to their seats , but by no means did the activity die down .
The glow of screens ( from a refreshingly Powerbook - dominated audience ) revealed an array of real - time collaborative note - taking fora virtually assembling the room 's minds in a concurrent recording and discussion of the event .
Rather than laptops providing an instant messaging fueled distraction from the content , as is often alleged in schools ( and in many of the meetings in which I sit at work ) and where their use is being restricted , these kids were actually using them to dive even deeper into the content of the speeches .
Every aspect of the proceedings was noted in real time and then integrated in a bevy of wikis that covered everything from speaker bios to where the parties were later that night .
I relished when it was my chance to speak .
Such open and idealistic minds looking back at me .
Having spent so many days speaking to relatively jaded trade conference attendees who half - listen to me , perking up only when my speech intersects with their pre-hardened agendas , it was a treat to be in a room of eager and ambitious geeks .
So what did I have to say ?
Well , I think that others have covered topics such as how to start a company more thoroughly and with more authenticity than I ever could .
Mark Fletcher , founder of Bloglines , is one of my favorites on this theme .
( via Andrej )
The 37 Signals guys are also getting a bit of worthy press for a recent interesting take on minimalism in entrepreneurial software efforts .
I took the opportunity to consider the underpinnings of Google 's success and describe a few potentially overlooked five cent nuggets from our experience :
Start ! - Just get going .
Do n't waste a lot of time writing business plans or strategic roadmaps .
It actually takes a lot of conceit for any of us to think we have a space so figured out so well that we know what the next five years will look like .
Instead of spinning wheels , just start coding .
Solve User Problems ! -
What to code ?
It always shocks me how meek some hackers are about determining what to build .
It seems we have created a technology culture where the MBAs and their Powerpoints somehow suck all the air out of the room and leave geeks feeling inadequate .
Actually however , no one is better suited to invent than users of technology who realize that the user experience can always be improved .
There is always the temptation to start from the money and work back to the user , but this never bears remarkable fruit .
Instead , start with what is broken today .
Fix it , and you will be richly rewarded .
Go Big ! -
While I love that the Internet has enabled the emergence and growth of niche businesses , I still believe that the most alluring opportunities for real hackers lie in building applications ( and infrastructure / platforms ) that will benefit hundreds of millions of users .
Stay Cheap through Demo ! -
I see too many entrepreneurs these days feeling they need to build an entire company to support what is essentially a feature of a larger search engine or portal .
It depresses me to see creative people wasting productive cycles on the mundane aspects of building full companies .
YCombinator gets this .
Their Summer Founders Program gives kids stipends of a few thousand dollars each to build baby companies over a two month span .
No directors of HR , no accounts payable .
Just sheer pragmatism and code intended to create working demos .
When talented people are allowed to focus on their core competency without distraction , cool things happen .
Geeks rule ! -
Echoing my earlier sentiments that we frequently confuse whoever is loudest with being the folks getting stuff done , we can't forget that is actually the geeks who rule technology .
More than ever , thanks to cheap / free development environments and powerful hardware , individual developers are empowered to have direct , scalable , and meaningful impact .
I do n't want to completely dismiss the ecosystem of those of us on the periphery of coding - businesspeople , VCs , lawyers , consultants .
However , I think all of our hand waving can often discourage the guys and girls who lie at the heart of technology .
As such , I believe that all the venture money in the world is no substitute for talent .
Food ! -
This may seem like a non-sequitur , however too often we forget about the human and collaborative nature of what we do .
There is nothing like a free breakfast / lunch / dinner to bring folks together , loosen them up , and encourage sharing , debate , and brainstorming .
Too often , I hear people remark that they expect us to cut out the free food now that we are a public company .
I do n't blame them for their shortsightedness because I think the last bubble burst ingrained in each of us a healthy skepticism .
However , food provides a cooperative , egalitarian , and participatory foundation for everything we do .
For a few thousand dollars per employee per year , a workplace can feel more like a home , or better yet , a community for the mind .
In that light , it is worth noting that Google did n't wait until the company was rolling in dough to start meals .
I believe the first chef at Google was approximately employee # 40 or # 50 .
Be Open ! -
I mean this is many senses of the word .
First off , most literally , there are few reasons not to use open source software these days .
It allows you to scale faster and leverages the collective expertise of developers around the world to advance your project .
Open source software also maximizes the chances that your code will integrate well with an eventual acquirer .
Beyond that though , openness should be a characteristic of your business at all levels .
Be transparent to your users and listen to their feedback .
Be clear with your team and employees and inspire their trust .
Following the talk , I spent the next two hours in the hallway of the auditorium answering questions , hearing pitches , and seeing demos .
With this crowd , I could have stayed all week .
Congrats to Paul , YCombinator , and to the participants themselves .
I have already heard from many of them , and I expect we will all continue to see great things from this gang .

Witnessing the launch of a blog as successful as Performancing ’s first two weeks might lead you to think that launching a successful blog is easy … well , it ’s NOT .
Thousands of new blogs are launched every day , but only a handful ever get read by more than a few hundred people , and even fewer ever make a dollar ’s profit .
While a site can survive a terrible launch ( see Instablogs ’ surprising turnaround ) the cost is high , and the truth is , most never recover .
With no money coming in , and a readership which can be counted in the dozens , it ’s no wonder that the vast majority of bloggers give up and shut down their site within a year .
The 21 points included in this checklist will cover the basics of what you need to do during those all - important first two weeks of your blog ’s life .
While there are no guarantees in the blogosphere , if you follow these launching tips closely , your chances of success are greatly improved .
The First Impression
1. Connect with your readers through an about page and welcome message .
One of the best ways to make a lasting impact is to connect on a personal level with your readers .
That means letting them know who you are and what your background is .
Darren from ProBlogger does this well by including an image of his ugly mug and an ‘ about page ’ link above the fold .
You do n’t necessarily need an author pic to relate to your readers , but you should find some way to allow readers to connect with you on a personal as well as a professional level to develop some rapport .
2 . Do n’t get seen naked :
Never launch a blog with fewer than 5 posts .
In the blogosphere you typically get just one shot at impressing a visitor or fellow blogger .
Too many new bloggers throw up two posts and then start working on promotion .
In the world of blogging , you are selling yourself and your writing .
If you ca n’t give people a fully dressed picture of what your blog is all about and what type of writing will be on it , then why should they throw a link your way , or subscribe to your RSS feed ?
When someone links to you or subscribes they ’re giving a vote of confidence that your site is worthwhile , so give them something to grab on to , and let them know your space wo n’t be “ just another abandoned blog . ”
RSS & Subscriptions
3 . Make sure a link to your RSS feed is available above the fold .
Though they wo n’t help your AdSense revenues much , subscribers are the lifeblood of any successful blog .
These devotees are often the ones providing you with regular comments , and are far more likely to be webmasters themselves ( meaning more links ) .
It should be obvious to anyone launching a blog , but its amazing how many new bloggers do not make a link to their RSS feed readily available .
New bloggers often do n’t want to devote space on their site to an RSS feed when they could squeeze in a bit more AdSense .
While this thinking is understandable , it is simply wrong .
The returns of having subscribers are much more valuable because subscribers drive long - term traffic organically , while an additional AdSense block provides at best a marginal short - term gain .
4 . Make RSS easier still : Add subscribe links to the most popular newsreaders .
Again : we want to make it easy for people to subscribe .
No one reads RSS raw .
Provide readers with above the fold access to some of the most popular newsreaders such as Bloglines , MyYahoo ! , Google Reader , and MyMSN .
5 . Offer an email version of your RSS feed .
According to Copyblogger , offering an email version of your RSS feed can as much as double your subscribers .
We have already covered the reasons why subscribers are essential to a healthy blog ( links , comments , buzz ) .
Feedblitz offers this service for free , as does Feedburner .
But beyond simply offering the email RSS feed , you need to make sure that signing up for it is easy .
A study by Marketing Experiments reveals that reducing the steps to signing up for both your RSS feed and your email subscription will increase signups by over 700 % .
That means more than 7 x the number of repeat readers and over 7 x the benefits that subscribers provide to your blog .
Social Bookmarking ( aka Going Viral )
6 . Put chicklets in your template .
Chicklets are ugly , and having too many “ If you liked this story , submit it to Delicious ” lines in a post looks plain spammy .
That said , when you have a top - notch post that you hope is going to go viral , there is no better way to boost your votes than to add the Delicious link and Digg button right onto the post .
When used correctly , chicklets can get you the coveted ‘ double vote ’ ( when visitors who came to your post via Delicious , for example , then drop you a Digg vote once they are on the site ) .
When you consider the tens of thousands of visitors that visit a good linkbait , those ‘ double votes ’ can be enough to carry you to the popular page of a second site , just by leveraging the traffic of the first .
7 . Be your own promoter : Seed your best posts .
Hundreds of thousands of content hungry readers are using social bookmarking sites every day , and many track specific keywords .
By seeding your best articles , and by using a mixture of both popular and specific keywords as tags , you can bring a new crop of readers to your site on a weekly basis .
The best way to select the tags for your article is to think of social bookmarking sites as a form of search engine .
By including both broad keywords and narrower keywords you are certain to get a blend of both low quality / high volume readers ( AdSense baby ! ) and high quality / low volume readers ( links ) .
The following is a list of the top 10 bookmarking sites which you should submit your top articles to :
Digg : Mammoth traffic ; tech - focused ; savvy users Delicious : Pretty big traffic ; somewhat tech / design - focused ; a lot of bloggers browse Delicious for “ things to link to ” Netscape : Pretty big traffic ; a mix of topics ; less savvy users Stumbleupon : Medium traffic ; weird stuff / literary articles ; normal users .
Yahoo MyWeb : Medium traffic ; general interest ; normal users Reddit : Lower traffic ; politics / random stuff ; normal users .
Furl : Lower traffic ; tech - focused / some random stuff ; normal users Newsvine : Lower traffic ; politics and news ; normal users .
Lookmarks : Low traffic ; gets spammed a lot ; less savvy users Blinklist : Low traffic ; gets spammed a lot ; less savvy users
.
Getting networked
8 . Leave highly valuable comments on other blogs in your niche .
Every niche within the blogosphere is made up of a few tightly knit communities .
Like all communities , so much of what is actually going on ( passing links , giving tips , etc. ) is all done behind the scenes through email and IM .
As a result , getting integrated into some of the communities in your niche is essential to growing your blog .
New bloggers often try to integrate themselves through email solicitations , “ Hi my name is Newbie , will you be my friend ? … ” This rarely works .
You need to first make a name for yourself and make yourself valuable to the community .
One way is to start commenting on the sites of community members within your niche .
By being an initiator of , or contributor to , good conversations on other blogs , other webmasters will come to recognize your name .
Note :
This takes a bit of finesse , so do n’t go around dropping your blog ’s URL in the comments themselves .
Rather , just type your URL in the URL field and let your ideas speak for the quality of your writing and your site .
9 . Reload quickly :
Take advantage of your initial launch buzz .
A successful blog launch will give you two or three days of buzz ( yes , that ’s all you ’ll get in the blogosphere ) .
During that window , other bloggers in your niche will be checking out your site .
Take advantage of those extra visitors by putting up some top - notch content within the first couple of days and updating your site frequently .
Many webmasters will stop by during the first week to check out the ‘ new kid on the block , ’ so make sure they see you at your best .
Launch buzz is a unique opportunity to gain easy links with no real extra marketing work , and it will not happen a second time .
So do n’t waste the opportunity by putting up garbage or sporadic content during your first week .
10 . Include tons of outbound links in your posts .
As a new blogger , your target audience is other bloggers .
They have the links that you need to get to the top of the search engines and to get in front of other readers .
So a big key is getting other bloggers in your niche to notice you .
A good trick is to use website referrals to your advantage .
Almost every blogger checks their site referrals list on a daily or weekly basis ( which tells them the last page a visitor was on before they landed on their site ) .
They use this list both to track new links and to see who is talking about their site .
By putting a lot of outbound links in your posts to other blogs in your niche , you can start to raise your profile .
When your readers click on those links your site will appear in the referrals list of the bloggers you link to .
This is free marketing for you .
When other bloggers see your site in their referrals list they will often visit your site and are also much more likely to return a link to you .
11 . If you have something to give , give it away !
Give people a reason to visit your site which goes beyond the typical content .
If you ’re a designer , give away a free HTML design or WordPress skin .
Are you a programmer ?
Make a cool FireFox plugin .
Are you an expert at XX ?
Give away a free 8 - page report , in PDF style , called “ Secrets of XX Revealed ” .
The point is , by giving away something , even something small , you can create buzz .
12 . Start real relationships with bloggers in your niche .
One of the biggest misconceptions new bloggers have is that because you are online , somehow the way business is conducted has changed .
It has n’t .
Just as in the offline business world , much of what is really going on in the blogging world takes place between colleagues .
That means that the most helpful tips , links , assistance , and so on are given on the basis of a preexisting friendship or relationship between you and another blogger .
So after spending some time getting a lay of the land within your blogging niche , send a few relevant emails out to other bloggers within your community .
Let them know that you are an avid reader of their site ( and actually be one ) , and then ask advice , suggest something , etc .
The key is to : 1 ) Not ask for a link , and 2 ) Have something interesting to say .
Networking ( which is just a fancy way of saying making friends ) is maybe the single most important difference between an average and a successful blog .
So do it .
Link Building
13 . Submit your blog to blog directories .
Incoming links help your site to get spidered , indexed and ranked better by search engines .
Conveniently , there are many blog directories that specialize in categorizing and linking to quality blogs .
You can find a comprehensive list of them at the RSSTop55 .
14 . Submit your blog to general web directories such as DMOZ and Aviva .
Links from DMOZ ( The Open Directory ) , Yahoo !
Directory , Aviva Directory and other quality general web directories provide you with what are considered “ trusted links ” by the search engines , a key to ranking well .
Search engines value links from quality web directories because it means that your site has been checked and selected by a human being .
But not all web directories are equal , and you want to be careful when submitting your site to not just throw good money after bad links .
Another nice thing about the top web directories is that they will send you relevant traffic , just like a search engine .
15 . Leave your blog ’s URL as your signature when you participate in forums .
When you make a good comment on a forum , people will not only remember your URL and begin to associate it with quality information , but also a number of forum readers looking for more information will click the link and visit your site .
16 . Use your URL in your email signature .
If you ’re like most new webmasters , you will be writing hundreds of emails in your first few months of blogging .
You can easily and subtly convert these emails into marketing efforts for your blog by simply including your URL below your name in your signature line .
The setup takes only a minute , and once it ’s done you wo n’t ever have to think about it again .
17 . Myspace or Facebook members :
Put a link in your profile .
Putting a link in your Myspace or Facebook account is a nearly effortless way to market your site .
Again , the response wo n’t be hundreds of new readers , but picking up a few dozen new readers here and there ( even just your friends ) never hurts .
Also , consider sending out a bulletin ( bulk mail ) announcing the blog to all of your Myspace and Facebook friends .
Even if just a couple of your friends drop you a free link on their own pages or blogs , it ’s worth the two minutes it takes .
18 . Submit guest posts at other blogs .
Few experienced bloggers can resist the appeal of good free content .
But most new bloggers simply do n’t take advantage of this , because the first few weeks after the launch of their blog are so hectic that they do n’t have time to write additional posts for someone else ’s blog .
With a little planning , however , you can overcome the time crunch and pick up some great links .
Save up a half dozen good posts before you launch , and submit them to related blogs as a way to introduce yourself and your blog to their audience .
( It ’s usually better to only do this when the blogger is actively seeking submissions ; you probably should n’t submit posts unasked - for . )
Of course , link back to your own blog in the “ author ’s bio ” at the bottom of the post .
It ’s not good form to submit the same article to multiple sites , so do n’t cut corners here ; instead create a good unique post for each submission you make .
Finishing touches
19 .
Ask friends for feedback on your site .
Ask some of your webmaster friends to review / critique your site a few days before its official launch .
The blogging world is largely comprised people who consider themselves somewhat entrepreneurial , and as a result , bloggers tend to respect ( and want to help ) people who are out there trying to start up their own site .
By asking other bloggers to give you feedback , you put them in the role of expert and create in them a sense of ownership in your site ( which means they will be more likely to give you a hand when you need it ) .
Not surprisingly , this technique usually does provide some valuable feedback from people who have experience , if not expertise , in running a blog .
But in addition , by putting your peers in the position of expert , you dramatically increase the chance that they will follow your launch and drop you a link once you get off the ground .
20 . Go ‘ Real - World ’ with other bloggers .
If you live in a major city ( or visit one occasionally ) , invite other bloggers to join you for a drink or dinner .
While friendships can be developed in cyberspace , the most fruitful business relationships , even in the world of blogging , tend to flourish only after face - to - face interaction .
It does n’t have to be anything fancy , just send a few individualized emails to some specific bloggers in your city asking them to meet up .
You can frame it as an opportunity to learn from their wisdom ( bloggers love to consider themselves experts ) , or simply a meeting of the minds .
Either way , having a relationship bolstered by face - to - face contact can provide countless benefits over one maintained entirely online .
21 . Dress up your comments .
Even if you do n’t have any readers , you can be assured that comment spammers will find you .
Comment spammers are the guys dropping off - topic advertisements for Viagra and weight loss pills in the comments of your blog .
Nothing kills the ability of a blog to attract new links like a spammy site .
And nothing says ‘ spammy site ’ like a comments page full of irrelevant comments and links .
So monitor and delete spammy comments on a regular basis .
In addition to deleting the garbage comments , you need to foster a positive community .
People want to participate in and link to a vibrant site .
So create one by encouraging your friends to comment on your blog .
The key is that you want to create the impression of an energetic and participatory group of readers .
Nobody wants to be the first guy to comment on a post , but everyone wants to chime in on a hot debate .
The bottom line : if you follow the preceding tips , you ’re not guaranteed to have a successful blog , but you are guaranteed to have a strong launch , and a fighting chance to make it big in the blogosphere .

A Fresh Look at Efficient Perl Sorting
Uri Guttman and Larry Rosler Uri Guttman is an independent Perl and Internet consultant ; uri@sysarch.com
Larry Rosler is at Hewlett - Packard Laboratories , Palo Alto , CA ; lr@hpl.hp.com
Abstract Sorting can be a major bottleneck in Perl programs .
Performance can vary by orders of magnitude , depending on how the sort is written .
In this paper , we examine Perl´s sort function in depth and describe how to use it with simple and complex data .
Next we analyze and compare several well - known Perl sorting optimizations ( including the Orcish Maneuver and the Schwartzian Transform ) .
We then show how to improve their performance significantly , by packing multiple sortkeys into a single string .
Finally , we present a fresh approach , using the sort function with packed sortkeys and without a sortsub .
This provides much better performance than any of the other methods , and is easy to implement directly or by using a new module we created , Sort : : Records .
NOTE : Sort :: Records died during development but five years later , Sort : : Maker was released and does all that was promised and more .
Find it on CPAN
What is sorting and why do we use it ?
Sorting is the rearrangement of a list into an order defined by a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence of sortkeys , where each sortkey is a single - valued function of the corresponding element of the list .
( We will use the term sortkeys to avoid confusion with the keys of a hash . )
Sorting is used to reorder a list into a sequence suitable for further processing or searching .
In many cases the sorted output is intended for people to read ; sorting makes it much easier to understand the data and to find a desired datum .
Sorting is used in many types of programs and on all kinds of data .
It is such a common , resource - consuming operation that sorting algorithms and the creation of optimal implementations comprise an important branch of computer science .
This paper is about creating optimal sorts using Perl .
We start with a brief overview of sorting , including basic algorithm theory and notation , some well - known sorting algorithms and their efficiencies , sortkey processing , and sorting outside of Perl .
Next we will describe Perl´s sort function [ 1 ] and basic ways to use it .
Then we cover handling complex sortkeys , which raises the question of how to optimize their processing .
Finally we introduce a relatively new method , which moves all the sortkey processing out of the sort function , and which produces the most efficient Perl sort .
A new module is also described , which implements this sorting technique and which has powerful support for sortkey extraction ( the processing of the input data to produce the sortkeys .
Algorithm and sorting theory
A complete discussion of algorithm and sorting theory is beyond the scope of this paper .
This section will cover just enough theory and terminology to explain the methods that we use to compare sort techniques .
The complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the resources needed to execute the algorithm -- typically there is a critical operation that needs to be executed many times .
Part of algorithm theory is figuring out which operation is the limiting factor , and then formulating a function that describes the number of times the operation is executed .
This complexity function is commonly written with the big- O notation -- O ( f ( N ) ) -- where ` O´ is read as `order of´ and `f ( N ) ´ is some function of N , the size of the input data set .
O( f ( N ) ) comparisons have some unusual properties .
The actual size of N is usually irrelevant to the correct execution of an algorithm , but its influence on the behavior of f( N ) is critical .
If an algorithm´s order is O ( N* logN + N ) , when N is large enough the effect of the N on the function´s value is negligible compared to the N*logN expression .
So that algorithm´s order is just O ( N*logN ) .
In many cases the calculated order function for an algorithm is a polynomial of N , but you see only the term with the highest power , and no coefficient is shown .
Similarly , if two algorithms have the same order but one does more work for each operation , they are still equivalent in order space , even though there may be a substantial difference in real - world speeds .
That last point is crucial in the techniques we will show to optimize Perl sorts , all of which have the same big - O function , O ( N*logN ) .
Here are some well - known algorithms and their order functions ( adapted from [ 2 ] ) :
Notation Name Example O( 1 ) constant array or hash index O( logN ) logarithmic binary search O ( N ) linear string comparison O ( N*logN ) n log n advanced sort O ( N * * 2 ) quadratic simple sort O ( N * * 3 ) cubic matrix multiplication O ( 2* * N ) exponential set partitioning
Sorting´s critical operation is determining in which order to put pairs of elements of the data .
The comparison can be as simple as finding whether two numbers are equal or which is greater than the other ( or doing similar operations on strings ) , or it can be quite complex .
Simple sorting algorithms ( bubble or insertion sorts ) compare each element to each of the others repeatedly , so their complexity is O ( N ** N ) .
Even with the triangle optimization ( $x is equal to $x , and $x compared to $y is the negative of $y compared to $ x ) , which reduces the function to O ( ( N * ( N - 1 ) ) / 2 ) , the complexity is still O ( N ** N ) , as explained above .
But these algorithms have their uses .
When N is very small , they can actually be faster than the other methods , because the O( 1 ) and O ( N ) overhead of the advanced sorts may outweigh the O ( N * * 2 ) behavior of the simple sorts .
" Fancy algorithms are slow when N is small , and N is usually small .
Fancy algorithms have big constants . " [ 3 ]
The really important cases , which are worth care in the coding , occur when N is large .
Advanced sorting methods repeatedly partition the records to be sorted into smaller sets , to reduce the total number of comparisons needed .
Their complexity is O ( N*logN ) , which can be much less than O ( N * * 2 ) for sufficiently large values of N .
These algorithms include `tree sort´ , `shell sort´ , and `quicksort´ . [ 4 ]
Some specialized sort algorithms ( such as `radix sort´ ) work by comparing pieces of numeric sortkeys , and can achieve linear complexity ( O( N ) ) [ 5 ] .
These methods are not general - purpose , so we will not address them further .
One property of sort algorithms is whether they are stable .
A stable sort preserves the order in the sorted data of two elements that compare equal .
Some sorting problems require stability .
The simple sorting algorithms are generally stable ; the advanced ones are not .
We will show how to make Perl´s advanced sort behave stably if required .
An important sorting variation is when the original data elements can´t conveniently be moved around by the sort algorithm´s shuffling .
So instead of sorting the elements directly , you sort their index numbers .
You then use the sorted indexes to create a list of sorted elements .
Some sort operators in other languages ( APL comes to mind ) simply return sorted indexes , and it is up to the programmer to use them correctly .
We will show how to create an efficient Perl index sort and where it is useful .
Sortkeys
If you are sorting a set of scalar - valued elements where the comparison looks at the entire element , the sortkey is simply the entire element .
More generally , the sortkey is based on some properties that are functions of all or part of the element .
Such subkeys may be extracted from internal properties of parts of the element ( fields ) or derived from external properties of the element ( such as the modification date of a file named by the element , which is quite expensive to retrieve from the file system ) .
To avoid repeated computation of the sortkeys , the sort process has to retain the association between records and their extracted or derived sortkeys .
Sorting theory and algorithms usually ignore the cost of this association , as it is typically a constant factor of the comparison operation .
But as we will see later , in the real world , removing that overhead or reducing it from O ( N* logN ) to O ( N ) is very valuable , especially as N grows .
Complex sortkeys can add tremendously to the overhead of each comparison .
This occurs where the records have to be sorted by primary , secondary , and lower - order subkeys .
This is also known as doing a subsort on the lower keys .
Extracting and comparing complex sortkeys can be costly and error - prone .
No general - purpose implementation of a sort algorithm can efficiently support extracting and comparing different types of sortkeys .
Therefore , most sort implementations provide a simple interface to call a sortsub -- a custom comparison subroutine which is passed two operands .
These operands can be the records themselves , or references to or indexes of complex records .
The comparison returns a negative , zero , or positive value , depending on the ordering of the sortkeys of the two records .
The programmer is responsible for any preprocessing of the records to generate the sortkeys and any postprocessing to retrieve the sorted data .
The generic sort function only manages the comparisons and shuffles the operands into sorted order .
As Perl´s sort function is O ( N*logN ) , efficiency must come from extracting and comparing the sortkeys using the least amount of work .
Much of this paper will be about methods to make sortkey extraction and comparison as efficient as possible .
External sorting
Every popular commercial operating system offers a sort utility .
Unix / POSIX flavors typically have a sort command which is fast and fairly flexible with regard to sortkey extraction from text files .
In some cases , the Unix / POSIX sort command may be easier to code and more efficient than using the Perl sort function .
Several vendors sell highly optimized commercial sort packages that have received decades of attention and can handle massive amounts of data .
But they are very expensive and not suitable for use inside a Perl program .
All of these are capable of dealing efficiently with very large amounts of data , using external media such as disk or tape files for intermediate storage when needed .
In contrast , the Perl sort function requires that the entire list of operands be in ( real or -- much more expensively -- virtual ) memory at the same time .
So Perl is not the appropriate tool to use for huge sorts ( where huge is defined by your system´s memory limits ) , which we shall not consider further .
Internal sorting
The Perl sort function uses an implementation of the quicksort algorithm that is similar to ( but more robust than ) the qsort function in the ANSI / ISO Standard C Library [ 6 ] .
In the simplest use , the Perl sort function requires no sortsub :
@out = sort @in ;
This default sorts the data in ascending lexicographic order , using the fast C memcmp function as the comparison operation .
If a locale is specified , it substitutes the more complicated and somewhat slower C strcoll function .
If you want any kind of ordering other than this , you must provide a custom comparison sortsub .
The sortsub can be specified either as a code block , the name of a subroutine , or a typeglob that refers to a subroutine ( a coderef ) .
In Perl 5.6 , a scalar variable that contains a coderef can also be used to specify the sortsub .
In order to optimize the calling of the sortsub , Perl bypasses the usual passing of arguments via @_ , using instead a more efficient special - purpose method .
Within the sortsub , the special global package variables $ a and $b are aliases for the two operands being compared .
The sortsub must return a number less than 0 , equal to 0 , or greater than 0 , depending on the result of comparing the sortkeys of $ a and $b .
The special variables $ a and $ b should never be used to change the values of any input data , as this may break the sort algorithm .
Even the simplest custom sort in Perl will be less efficient than using the default comparison .
The default sort runs entirely in C code in the perl core , but any sortsub must execute Perl code .
A well - known optimization is to minimize the amount of Perl code executing and to try to stay inside the perl core as much as possible .
Later we will see various optimization techniques that will reduce the amount of Perl code executed .
The primary goal of this paper is to perform all sorts using the default comparison .
Here is how an explicit ascending lexicographic would be done using a sortsub :
@out = sort { $ a cmp $ b } @in ;
For a simple measurement , compare Default and Explicit in Benchmark A1 of Appendix A .
The default method is about twice as fast as the explicit method .
Trivial sorts
We call trivial sorts those that use the entire record as the sortkey and do only a minimal amount of processing of the record .
To do trivial Perl sorts other than ascending lexicographic , you just need to create an appropriate sortsub .
Here are some common ones that perform useful functions .
The simplest such example is the ascending numeric sort , which uses the picturesquely monikered `spaceship´ operator :
@out = sort { $ a < = > $ b } @in ;
A numeric sort capability is required because the lexicographic order of , say , ( 1 , 2 , 10 ) does not correspond to the numeric order .
If you want the sort to be in descending order there are three techniques you can use .
The worst is to negate the result of the comparison in the sortsub .
Better is to reverse the order of the comparison by swapping $ a and $b .
This has the same speed as the corresponding forward sort .
# descending numeric
@out = sort { $ b < => $ a } @in ; # descending lexicographic
@out = sort { $ b cmp $ a } @in ;
The best method is to apply the reverse function to the result of a default ascending lexicographic sort .
@out = reverse sort @in ;
Note that this is faster than using the explicit descending lexicographic sort , for the reason discussed above : the default sort is faster than using a sortsub .
The reverse function is efficient because it just moves pointers around .
Another common problem is sorting with case insensitivity .
This is easily solved using the lc or uc function .
Either one will give the same results .
@out = sort { lc $ a cmp lc $b } @in ;
Benchmark A1 analyzes these examples as a function of the input size .
The O ( N* logN ) behavior is apparent , as well as the cost of using even a simple built - in function like lc in the sortsub .
Fielded and record sorts
The above trivial sorts sort the input list using as the sortkey the entire string ( for a lexicographic sort ) or the first number in each datum ( for a numeric sort ) .
More typically , the sortkey is based on some property that is a function of all or part of each datum .
Several individual subkeys may be combined into a single sortkey or may be compared in pairs individually .
A complex string may be divided into fields , some of which may serve as subkeys .
For example , the Unix / POSIX sort command provides built - in support for collation based on one or more fields of the input ; the Perl sort function does not , and the programmer must provide it .
One CPAN module focuses on fielded sorts [ 7 ] .
If your data are records which are complex strings or references to arrays or hashes , you have to perform comparisons on selected parts of the records .
This is called record sorting .
( Fielded sorts are a subset of record sorts . )
In the code examples that follow , KEY ( ) is meant to be substituted with some Perl code that performs sortkey extraction .
It is best that it not be an actual subroutine call , because subroutine calls within sortsubs can be expensive .
Calls to built - in Perl functions ( such as the calls to lc in the example above ) are like Perl operators , thus relatively less expensive .
When sorting string records , $ a and $b are set to those strings , so to extract the sortkeys you generally perform various string operations on the records .
Functions commonly used for this include split , substr , unpack , and m //.
Here is one example , sorting a list of password - file lines by user name using split .
The fields are separated by colons , and the user name is the first field .
@out = sort {
( split ' : ' , $ a , 2 ) [ 0 ] cmp
( split ' : ' , $ b , 2 ) [ 0 ]
} @pw_lines ;
Multi-subkey sorts
In some cases you need to sort records by a primary subkey , then for all the records with the same primary subkey value , you need to sort by a secondary subkey .
One horribly inefficient way to do this is to sort first by the primary subkey , then get all the records with a given subkey and sort them by the secondary subkey .
The standard method is to do a multi- key sort .
This entails extracting a subkey for each field , and comparing paired subkeys in priority order .
So if two records with the same primary subkey are compared , they will actually be compared based on the secondary subkey .
Sorting on more than two subkeys is done by extending the logic .
Perl has a very nice feature which makes multi- key sorts easy to write .
The || ( short - circuit or ) operator returns the actual value of the first logically true operand it sees .
So if you use || to concatenate a set of key comparisons , the first comparison is the primary subkey .
If a pair of primary subkeys compare equal , the sortsub´s return value will be the result of the secondary subkey comparison .
An example will illustrate this `ladder´ of comparisons better than more text .
Here is a three - subkey sort :
@out = sort {
# primary subkeys comparison
KEY1 ( $a ) cmp KEY1 ( $b )
||
# or if they are equal
# return secondary comparison
# descending numeric comparison
KEY2 ( $b ) <=> KEY2 ( $a )
||
# or if they are equal
# return tertiary comparison
# lexicographic comparison
KEY3 ( $a ) cmp KEY3 ( $b )
} @in ;
Naive multi-subkey record sorts
In the two previous examples , we showed a sort with relatively expensive sortkey extraction ( via split ) , and a multi- subkey sort .
Let ´s combine them .
For concreteness , we shall deal with a problem that has received much attention in comp.lang.perl.misc -- sorting a list of IP addresses in `dotted - quad´ form .
Each element of the list is a string of the form " nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn\tabc.xyz.com
" , where nnn represents a decimal integer between 0 and 255 , with or without leading zero - padding .
In the most naive approach , we sort on each of these four numeric fields as individual subkeys , in succession .
@out = sort {
my @a = $ a =~
/( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / ;
my @b = $ b =~
/( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / ;
$ a [ 0 ] <= > $ b [ 0 ] ||
$ a[ 1 ] <= > $ b [ 1 ] ||
$ a[ 2 ] <= > $ b [ 2 ] ||
$ a[ 3 ] <= > $ b [ 3 ]
} @in ;
Even for small lists this is very slow , because of the many Perl operations executed in the sortsub for every one of the O ( N* logN ) comparisons .
Computing a single packed - string sortkey
To improve performance , we will derive from these four subkeys a single packed - string sortkey for each IP address , which we can then use to sort the array monotonically increasing .
The following expression produces the shortest key , a string of four bytes , with the least Perl calculation :
pack ' C4 ' => $ string =~
/( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) /
This uses the fancy comma operator , => , which you can read as `applied to´ .
We then sort these sortkeys lexicographically .
The following , then , is the next approach toward achieving an efficient sort :
@out = sort {
pack ( ' C4 ' => $ a =~
/( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / )
cmp
pack ( ' C4 ' => $ b =~
/( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / )
} @in ;
Benchmark A2 shows that comparing the subkeys in pairs is less efficient than packing them and comparing the packed strings .
This observation applies to all sorting methods .
In further benchmarks of advanced sorts for this problem , we will always used packed sortkeys .
Nevertheless , naive sorting is still woefully inefficient , because both sortkeys are recomputed every time one input operand is compared against another .
What we need now is a way to compute each sortkey once only and to remember the result .
Advanced sorts
As all sorts in Perl use the builtin sort function and therefore the same quicksort algorithm , all Perl sorts are of order O ( N*logN ) .
We can´t improve upon that , so we have to address other issues to gain efficiency .
As the complexity is fixed , tackling the constant factors can be fruitful and , in the real world , can produce significant improvements in efficiency .
When a sortsub needs to generate a complex sortkey , that is normally done O ( N * LogN ) times , but there are only N records , hence N sortkeys .
What if we were to extract the sortkey only once per record , and keep track of which sortkey belonged to which record ?
Caching the sortkeys
The obvious way to associate sortkeys with the records from which they were created is to use a hash .
The hash can be created in a preprocessing pass over the data .
If the approximate size of the data set is known , preallocating the hash improves performance .
keys my % cache = @in ;
$ cache {$_} = KEY ( $_ ) for @in ;
The following sets up the cache more efficiently , using a hash slice :
keys my % cache = @in ;
@cache{@in} = map KEY ( $_ ) => @in ;
Then the sortsub simply sorts by the values of the cached sortkeys .
@out = sort {
$ cache {$a} cmp $ cache{$b )
} @in ;
In essence , we have replaced lengthy computations in the sortsub by speedy ( O ( 1 ) ) hash lookups .
If you want to do a complex multi- key comparison , you either have to use a separate cache for each subkey or combine subkeys in a similar way to the packed - sort optimizations we will describe later .
Here is an example of the former :
keys my % cache1 = @in ;
keys my % cache2 = @in ;
( $ cache1 {$_} , $ cache2 { $_} ) =
map { KEY1 ( $ _ ) , KEY2 ( $_ ) } $ _
for @in ;
@out = sort {
$ cache1 {$a} cmp $ cache1 { $b ) ||
$ cache2 { $b} < = > $ cache2 { $a} }
@in ;
Alternatively , a multi - level cache can be used , which sacrifices speed to save some space :
keys my % cache = @in ;
$ cache{@in} =
map [ KEY0 ( $ _ ) , KEY1 ( $_ ) ]
=> @in ;
@out = sort {
$ cache {$ a} [ 0 ] cmp $ cache {$ b ) [ 0 ]
||
$ cache {$ b} [ 1 ] < => $ cache{$a} [ 1 ]
} @in ;
An important point about cached sorts is that no postprocessing is needed to retrieve the sorted records .
The method sorts the actual records , but uses the cache to reduce the sortkey extraction to O ( N ) .
The Orcish Maneuver ( OM )
The Orcish Maneuver ( invented by Joseph N. Hall [ 8 ] ) eliminates the preprocessing pass over the data , which might save keeping a copy of the data if they are being read directly from a file .
It does the sortkey extraction only once per record , as it checks the hash to see if it was done before .
The test and storage of the sortkey is done with the ||= operator ( short - circuit or - assignment ) , which will evaluate and assign the expression on the right to the lvalue on the left , if the lvalue is false .
The name `orcish´ is a pun on `or -cache´ .
The full statement in the sortsub looks like this :
keys my %or_cache = @in ;
@out = sort {
( $or_cache{$a} ||= KEY ( $a ) )
cmp
( $or_cache{$b} ||= KEY ( $ b ) )
} @in ;
That sees if the sortkey for $ a is cached , and if not , extracts it and caches it .
The sortkey for $ a is then compared to the sortkey for $ b ( which is found in the same way ) .
Here is an example of a two - subkey comparison using two caches :
keys my %or_cache1 = @in ;
keys my %or_cache2 = @in ;
@out = sort {
( $or_cache1 {$a} ||= KEY1 ( $a ) )
cmp
( $or_cache1 { $b} ||= KEY1 ( $ b ) )
||
( $or_cache2 { $b} ||= KEY2 ( $ b ) )
<=>
( $or_cache2 {$a} ||= KEY2 ( $a ) )
} @in ;
The OM has some minor efficiency flaws .
An extra test is necessary after each sortkey is retrieved from the or-cache .
Furthermore , if an extracted sortkey has a false value , it will be recomputed every time .
This usually works out all right , because the extracted sortkeys are seldom false .
However , except when the need to avoid reading the data twice is critical , the explicit cached sort is always slightly faster than the OM .
( See Benchmark A3 . )
The Schwartzian Transform ( ST )
A more efficient approach to caching sortkeys , without using named temporary variables , was popularized by Randal L. Schwartz , and dubbed the Schwartzian Transform [ 9 , 10 ] .
( It should really be called the Schwartz Transform , after the model of the Fourier and Laplace Transforms , but it is too late to fix the name now . )
The significant invention in the ST is the use of anonymous arrays to store the records and their sortkeys .
The sortkeys are extracted once , during a preprocessing pass over all the data in the list to be sorted ( just as we did before in computing the cache of sortkeys ) .
@out =
map $ _ -> [ 0 ] =>
sort { $ a - > [ 1 ] cmp $ b -> [ 1 ] }
map [ $ _ , KEY ( $ _ ) ] =>
@in ;
The ST doesn´t sort the actual input data .
It sorts the references to anonymous arrays that contain the original records and the sortkeys .
So we have to postprocess to retrieve the sorted records from the anonymous arrays .
Using the ST for a multi- subkey sort is straightforward .
Just store each successive extracted subkey in the next entry in the anonymous array .
In the sortsub , do an or between comparisons of successive subkeys , as with the OM and the naive sorts .
@out =
map $ _ -> [ 0 ] =>
sort { $ a - > [ 1 ] cmp $ b -> [ 1 ] ||
$ b - > [ 2 ] <= > $ a -> [ 2 ] }
map [ $ _ , KEY1 ( $ _ ) , KEY2 ( $_ ) ]
=> @in ;
For a very illuminating deconstruction and reconstruction of the ST , see [ 11 ] .
The packed - default sort
Each of the advanced sorting techniques described above saves the operands to be sorted together with their sortkeys .
( In the cached sorts , the operands are the keys of a hash and the sortkeys are the values of the hash ; in the Schwartzian Transform , the operands are the first elements of anonymous arrays , the sortkeys are the other elements of the arrays . )
We now extend that idea to saving the operands to be sorted together with packed - string sortkeys , using concatenation .
This little - known optimization improves on the ST by eliminating the sortsub itself , relying on the default lexicographic sort , which as we showed earlier is very efficient .
This is the method used in the new Sort : : Maker module .
To accomplish this goal , we modify the ST by replacing its anonymous arrays by packed strings .
First we pack into a single string each subkey followed last by the operand to be sorted .
Then we sort lexicographically on those strings , and finally we retrieve the operands from the end of the strings .
@out =
map substr ( $_ , 4 ) =>
sort
map pack ( ' C4 ' =>
/( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / )
. $ _ => @in ;
Several methods can be used , singly or in combination , to construct the packed strings , including concatenation , pack , or sprintf .
Several methods can be used to retrieve the operands , including substr ( shown here ) , which is likely to be the fastest , split , unpack or a regex .
Multiple subkeys are simply concatenated , suitably delimited if necessary .
Techniques for computing subkeys of various types are presented in Appendix B .
Benchmarks of the packed - default sort
Benchmark A4 compares the two most advanced general - purpose sorting techniques , ST and packed - default .
These multi-stage sorts are measured both as individual stages with saved intermediate data and as single statements .
The packed - default sort is about twice as fast as the ST , which is the fastest familiar Perl sorting algorithm .
Earlier , we showed a trivial sort using the lc function .
Even for that case , the packed - default sort provides better performance when more than a few data items are being sorted .
See Benchmark A5 , which shows quasi - O ( N ) behavior for the packed - default sort ( because the sorting time is small relative to the sortkey extraction ) .
Sorting a list of arrays or hashes
Consider the common problem of sorting a two - dimensional data structure , a list of references to arrays or to hashes , where the sortkeys are functions of the values of the submembers .
If we were to use the packed - default method , the references would be converted to strings and appended to the sortkeys .
After sorting , the operands could be retrieved as strings , but would no longer be usable as references .
Instead , we must use the indexes of the list members as the operands to be sorted .
The following benchmark compares a packed - sortkey ST sort with an indexed sort that uses the packed - default approach .
The list being sorted comprises references to arrays , each of which has two elements : an IP address ( which serves as the primary sortkey ) , and a domain name ( which serves as the secondary sortkey ) .
These are the same data as used in the above benchmarks , split into two array elements .
@out =
map $ _ -> [ 0 ] =>
sort { $ a - > [ 1 ] cmp $ b -> [ 1 ] }
map [ $ _ , pack ( ' C4 A * ' =>
$ _-> [ 0 ] =~
/( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / ,
$ _- > [ 1 ] ) ] => @in ;
my $ i = 0 ;
keys my %h = @in ;
@h{ map pack ( ' C4 A* x N ' = > $ _ -> [ 0 ]
=~ /(\d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / ,
$ _-> [ 1 ] , $ i++ ) => @in } = @in ;
@out = @h{ sort keys %h } ;
The indexed sort is faster than the ST once again .
( See Benchmark A6 . )
Indexed sorts and stable sorts
In the indexed sort , the auto - incrementing index $ i ensures that no array records will have identical packed sortkeys .
It also ensures that the sort will be stable .
Any Perl sort can be stabilized by using such an index as the final tie - breaking subkey .
For an indexed sort , the index is actually the operand being sorted .
This fact offers another possible performance advantage for the indexed sort .
The actual records to be sorted ( which may be long strings ) need not be appended to the sortkeys , which would create a second copy of each record .
Using the indexed sort , the records may be recovered after the sort from the original data , using the sorted indexes .
The Sort :: Maker module
Sort :: Maker is on CPAN and implements the GRT for all types of Perl values .
Conclusions
Packing of subkeys into strings that can be compared lexicographically improves the performance of all sorting techniques , relative to the usual method of comparing the individual subkeys in pairs .
Packing the operands with the sortkeys allows the sort to be done using the default ascending lexicographic comparison ( without a sortsub ) .
This yields a markedly faster sort than the Orcish Maneuver or the Schwartzian Transform .
The sorting process may approximate O ( N ) behavior , because the O( N* logN ) time for the sort itself is small compared to the time required to extract the sortkeys .
The packed - sortkey sort may be written explicitly , or the new Sort : : Maker module may be used .

Appendix A : Benchmarks
A caveat : Useful benchmarking depends on judicious isolation of relevant variables , both in the algorithms being benchmarked and in the data sets used .
Different implementations may give different relative results even with the same algorithms and data .
Thus all such results should be verified under your own conditions .
In short , your mileage may vary .
In the following benchmarks , all data represent the time ( in microseconds ) per line in the input data , which averages 35 characters per line .
All named arrays and hashes are preallocated , which reduces the variance in the measurements due to storage allocation .

Appendix B : Explicit packed - default sorts
B1 . Creating and combining sortable string subkeys
This is the preprocessing pass ( the first map executed ) .
@sorted = map ... => sort =>
map KEY ( $ _ ) . $ _ => @data ;
To create and combine the subkeys and the operand to be sorted , any combination of concatenation , interpolation , pack , or sprintf may be used , the latter two with simple or compound formats .
Fixed - length strings ( ascending ) : simple interpolation
pack ( '...
An ...' , ...) sprintf ( '... %s ...' , ...)
Fixed - length strings ( descending ) : Bit - complement the string first .
$ subkey = $ string ^ " \xFF " x length $ string
Then handle as an ascending fixed - length string .
Null bytes ( " \0 " ) are used to terminate string subkeys of varying length , as that ensures lexicographic ordering .
If a string subkey may contain a null byte , then it must be of fixed length .
If any of the operands to be sorted may contain null bytes , then every subkey must have fixed length .
Varying - length strings ( ascending ) : Terminate the string with a null byte , to separate it from succeeding subkeys or the operand .
interpolation :
" $ string\0 " pack ( '... A* x ...' , ...) sprintf ( '... %s\0 ...' , ...)
Varying - length strings ( descending ) :
Make a prepass over the data to find the length of the longest string .
my $ len = 0 ;
$ len < length and $ len = length
for map KEY ( $_ ) => @data ;
Then null - pad each string to that length and proceed as above for fixed - length strings ( descending ) .
$ subkey = pack ( " a$ len " , $ string )
^ " \xFF " x $ len
Unsigned 32 - bit integers ( ascending ) : Pack or zero -pad to fixed length .
Preferred -- only 4 bytes :
pack ( '... N ...' , ...)
Readable -- but 10 bytes :
sprintf ( '... %.10u ...' , ...)
Signed two´s - complement 32 - bit integers ( ascending ) : Bias to unsigned by xoring the sign bit , then treat as unsigned .
$ subkey = pack ( 'N ' ,
$ number ^ ( 1 << 31 ) ) ;
Floating - point numbers ( ascending ) :
This code assumes that floating - point numbers are represented in binary using IEEE format .
Create a subroutine that packs a double in network order ( big-endian ) .
BEGIN {
my $ big_endian =
pack ( 'N ' , 1 ) eq
pack ( ' L ' , 1 ) ;
sub float_sort ( $ ) {
( $ big_endian ?
pack 'd ' , $ _ [ 0 ] :
reverse pack ' d ' , $ _ [ 0 ] ) ^
( $ _ [ 0 ] < 0 ? " \x FF " x 8 :
" \x80 " . " \x00 " x 7 )
}
$ subkey = float_sort ( $ number ) ;
Descending integers or floating - point numbers : Negate the value , then use the appropriate one of the above .
B2 .
Extracting the operands from the sorted strings
This is the postprocessing pass ( the second map executed ) .
@sorted = map RETRIEVE ($_ ) =>
sort => map ... => @data ;
If all the subkeys have known length , use the total length : Preferred for efficiency :
@sorted =
map substr ( $_ , $ length ) =>
...
TMTOWTDI :
@sorted =
map unpack ( " x$ length A* " ,
$ _ ) => ...
If any of the subkeys has varying length , make sure that the last character in the complete packed sortkey is a null byte , then search for it from the right : Preferred for efficiency :
@sorted = map substr ($_ ,
1 + rindex $ _ , " \0 " ) => ...
TMTOWTDI :
@sorted =
map ( split /\0 / ) [ - 1 ] => ...
@sorted = map /( [ ^\0 ] + ) $ / => ...

A very important part of software usability is the quality of the error messages .
When things start to go wrong , error messages can make the difference between the user realising their mistake and quickly correcting it , or getting frustrated and confused .
Unfortunately , error messages are often produced by coders rather than the user - interface designers .
Coders have other priorities than carefully wording an error message .
One short , cryptic error message in our application was causing a lot of confusion ; it was causing a large number of calls to our help - desk .
I decided it was time to fix the problem .
I sat down , and carefully reworded the error message .
The new version explained the problem that had been encountered .
It explained how it came to be that this problem had occurred .
It explained step - by - step what was required to fix the situation .
It did it in English that had been carefully written for clarity and had been peer - reviewed .
I had , in my own little way , made my users ’ world an easier place to live in .
Shortly after the release , I received an email from a user that contained a screen - shot of the brand - new easy - to - understand error message , and a short request : “ I got this error .
What do I do now ? ”
I almost started sobbing .

I read about a tail call optimization decorator .
Of course I immediately wondered if it was possible in JavaScript , and it is :
Function.prototype.tailCallOptimized = function ( ) { var g = this ; return function ( ) { for ( var caller = arguments.callee.caller ; caller ; caller = caller .caller ) if ( caller == arguments.callee ) throw {tailCallArgs : arguments , tailCallThis : this} ; var args = arguments ; var me = this ; while ( true ) { try { return g.apply ( me , args ) ; } catch(e ) { if ( !e.tailCallArgs ) throw e ; args = e.tailCallArgs ; me = e.tailCallThis ; } } } ; }
It improves somewhat on the Python example .
It allows mutual recursion and recursive methods :
Number.prototype.isEven = function ( ) { return this == 0 ? true : ( this - 1).isOdd ( ) ; } .tailCallOptimized ( ) ; Number.prototype.isOdd = function ( ) { return this == 0 ? false : ( this - 1 ) .isEven ( ) ; } ; alert ( ( 10001 ) .isEven ( ) ? " even " : " odd " ) ;
Note the ‘ decorator style ’ in Javascript , simply a method call on the function .

SAN FRANCISCO , Aug. 27 — Further extending its efforts beyond search technology , Google plans to announce Monday that it will offer software providing a range of online services for business users .
The company , which has gradually been adding to its arsenal of services , says it will offer a package of software including its e-mail , calendar and chat programs and a Web site development tool for companies and organizations looking to avoid the high cost of providing such services on their own .
Dave Girouard , vice president and general manager of Google ’s enterprise business , called the move a “ starting point ” for Google in catering to business users .
Initially , the package will be free , but later this year Google plans to begin selling a version that includes additional features as well as technical support .

I originally picked this up off USENET somewhere ; I 'm afraid I do n't recall where .
Ducks ?
Oh , right : ducks .
Yes .
Back at the tail end of the 1960s when all the ``new '' universities were being built , York decided to have a water - feature and built themselves the largest plastic - bottomed lake in Europe .
It was only a few feet deep , but it was all over the campus , and it had a large resident duck population .
Those ducks had character .
They once waited until a porter they knew was afraid of them was on duty and then staged a sit-in in the hall of residence which was on the waterside , for instance ; and there was a solitary Mandarin duck which was obviously a Maoist agitator .
Anyhow they were a feature ( possibly even a planned feature ) of life on the York campus .
You kept on encountering them .
When they were ashore , they tended to walk along just in front of people who had disturbed them , just alarmed enough to keep moving but not enough to try to take off .
This happened one day in I think 1970 when a stoned youth called Steve was wandering back from a bar : a duck got going in front of him , waddling along at high speed for a duck and looking to his befuddled eye very much like a clockwork toy .
So in a spirit of friendly wossis he decided to carry it back to the lake and save its poor flat feet , and he reached out a hand and grabbed it .
He grabbed it round the neck , and the damn ' thing said ``Squawrk ! '' and died at him .
Now , Steve was a vegetarian and and animal lover and all like that and he was truly upset by this ; and furthermore his principles required that he not waste the duck 's life ....
So he smuggled it home off the campus and plucked it , weeping as he did so , not to mention getting feathers into parts of his room which he had n't until then known existed , back in the hinterland behind the 104 milk - bottles on top of the wardrobe with the interesting mould growths and such ...
And his friends helped him cook it and there was a roast duck supper .
The trouble was that after that Steve had that duck on his conscience , and he was always trying to find ways to make it up to the other ducks for his cruel murder of one of their comrades ( did I mention that he was a convinced member of the internationalist tendency as well as a vegetarian ? ) and salve himself for it .
Then his birthday came around , and someone very kindly gave Steve an ounce of really first - rate dope , heavy black sticky stuff , and Steve worked out that this would get a large number of ducks very stoned indeed .
He put small pellets of it into pellets of white sliced bread , and he went down to the lake one fine day and he fed the ducks .
They got very stoned indeed .
One of them walked slowly round and round a tree for the best part of five hours , for instance ; and another did that classic duck - take - off - on - water bit , where they stick their necks out and flap like fury across the surface going ``splatchsplatchsplatch '' until they reach take - off velocity -- only it could n't quite make it and it went straight into the mud of the opposite bank beak - first and stuck there like a javelin and had to be rescued ( and its feet were very clammy and ubiquitous ) ; several dived and never came up as far as we could tell ; one of them decided that it was some other sort of bird altogether and wasted a vast amount of time trying to perch in a tree , luckily on a low branch or it would have broken something falling out of the tree again , repeatedly .
There must have been fifty of the poor little sods , and they were all saying ``wow look at the colours man ! '' in Duck and falling about and getting things Wrong for several hours .
That 's apart from the ones who got introspective and just sat without moving for the rest of the day with glazed expressions .
Those ones were probably seeing fractals , for all I know , or calculating the number of atoms in the universe : they certainly looked Profound about whatever it was .
Everybody else of course found the whole business hysterically funny , but poor Steve was mortified , and I think he avoided the lake for quite a long time afterwards .
Then one day he walked into the common - room of the hall of residence overhanging the lake and found that the ducks were having a sit - in there ( see earlier ) and became quite convinced that they were Out To Get Him , or else they were hallucinations , and he could n't decide which was worse , and I think shortly after that he left the university altogether and went away and became a bus conductor in London , which was where I next saw him .
And I suppose that the moral of this story ( ' cos all stories ought to have morals , right ? ) is that it 's not really a good idea , getting ducks stoned , but it 's very funny .
Also in this week 's column :
What happens when you are executed by electrocution ?
Asked by Ron Talbot of Tyler , Texas
In the late 19th century , it was widely believed that a more modern method of execution was needed to replace the three most commonly used execution methods at that time ( hanging , firing squad , and , in France , beheading ) .
The first practical electric chair was invented by Harold P Brown who worked for Thomas Edison .
The first person to die in the electric chair was executed in 1890 .
A parallel occurrence at around the same time was the scientific discovery of the precise effects upon the body of high voltages of electricity .
For example , according to Dr T Bernstein of the Wallace - Kettering Neuroscience Institute at Wright State University , writing in Medical Instrumentation in 1975 , two doctors by the name of Prevost and Battelli demonstrated in 1899 that death from electrocution was caused , not by damaging the brain , but by high voltages of electricity causing very rapid irregular contractions of the heart ( ventricular fibrillation ) eventuating in the heart stopping .
As for the execution itself , the prisoner must first be prepared for execution by shaving the head and the calf of one leg .
This permits better contact between the skin and the electrodes which must be attached to the body .
The prisoner is strapped into the electric chair at the wrists , waist , and ankles .
An electrode is attached to the head and another to the leg .
At least two jolts of an electrical current are applied for several minutes .
An initial voltage of about 2,000 volts stops the heart and induces unconsciousness .
The voltage is then lowered somewhat .
In one US state , the protocol calls for a jolt of 2,450 volts that lasts for 15 seconds .
After a 15 minute wait , the prisoner is then examined by a coroner .
After 20 seconds , the cycle is repeated .
It is repeated three more times .
The body may heat up to approximately 100 °C ( 210 °F ) , which causes severe damage to internal organs .
Often the eyeballs melt .
Taping the eyes closed is often part of the preparation for execution by electrocution .
The effects of the electricity often cause the body to twitch and gyrate uncontrollably and bodily functions may " let go " .
Prisoners are sometimes offered diapers .
Although death is supposedly instantaneous , some prisoners have been known to shriek and even shout while being executed in this way .
There have been reports of a prisoner 's head bursting into flames .
There have been reports too of a prisoner being removed from an electric chair that has malfunctioned part way through the electrocution and then being placed back in the chair once it is fixed in order for the job to be finished .
Some skin is burned off the prisoner .
The burned off skin must then be scrapped off the seat and straps of the electric chair before it may be used again .
Interesting facts
In 1991 , a recommendation was made by two Polish doctors that the thighs also be strapped in .
Warsaw Drs L Zynda and K Skiba reported in the Chirurgia Narzadow Ruchu I Ortopedia Poska on the case of a 58 - year - old executed male who whose legs were broken by the intense twitching of the legs due to the force of the deadly electric current passing through his body .
on the case of a 58 - year - old executed male who whose legs were broken by the intense twitching of the legs due to the force of the deadly electric current passing through his body .
In 1946 , an electric chair malfunctioned and failed to execute the prisoner who reported shrieked " Stop it !
Let me breathe ! " as he was being executed .
Having survived , lawyers for the prisoners argued that , although he did not die , he had been executed as defined by the law .
In 1947 , in the case of Francis vs Resweber , the US Supreme Court ruled against the prisoner .
He was returned to the electric chair and successfully executed later that year .

UNTIL recently , recalls Charlie Gay , a 30 - year veteran of the solar - power business , venture capitalists were far too busy catering to captains of the information - technology industry to waste time on “ hippy - dippy tree - huggers ” like himself .
But now the tree - huggers are in the ascendant and the IT barons are busy investing in clean - energy technology .
Among them is Vinod Khosla , a celebrated Silicon Valley financier .
He is touting ethanol as the next big thing .
Applied Materials , where Mr Gay works , has branched out from flat screens and computer chips into solar cells .
Sun Power , the solar subsidiary of Cypress Semiconductor , is now worth almost as much as its chipmaking parent company .
Investors are falling over themselves to finance start - ups in clean technology , especially in energy .
Venture Business
Research reckons that investment in the field by venture capitalists and private - equity firms has quadrupled in the past two years , from some $ 500 m in 2004 to almost $ 2 billion so far this year .
The share of venture capital going into clean energy is rising rapidly ( see chart 1 ) .
New Energy
Finance , another research firm , reckons that investment of all sorts in the business will reach $ 63 billion this year , compared with just $ 30 billion in 2004 .
The lure of big money is leading investment banks to ramp up their analysis of the latest boom industry .
Clean - energy fever is being fuelled by three things : high oil prices , fears over energy security and a growing concern about global warming .
The provision of energy , the industry 's cheerleaders say , will change radically over the coming decades .
Polluting coal - and gas - fired power stations will give way to cleaner alternatives such as solar and wind ; fuels derived from plants and waste will supplant petrol and diesel ; and small , local forms of electricity generation will replace mammoth power stations feeding far - flung grids .
Eventually , it is hoped , fuel cells running on hydrogen will take the place of the ubiquitous internal combustion engine .
It is a bold vision , but if it happens very slowly , or only to a limited extent , boosters argue that it will still prompt stupendous growth for firms in the business .
Analysts confidently predict the clean - energy business will grow by 20 - 30 % a year for a decade .
Jefferies , an investment bank that organised a recent conference on the industry in London , asked participants how soon solar power would become competitive with old - fashioned generation technologies : in 2010 , 2015 or 2020 .
More distant dates — let alone never — were not even discussed .
About three - quarters of those present , one visitor gleefully observed , were “ cheque - writers ” .
This “ megatrend ” , the keynote speaker gushed , “ may be the biggest job - and wealth - creation opportunity of the 21st century . ”
At a similar event devoted to solar power at San Jose , in the heart of Silicon Valley , registrations almost quintupled this year , to over 6,500 attendees .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's green - minded governor , made a cameo appearance in the midst of his re-election campaign .
“ I feel the energy , ” he bellowed to an elated audience , “ I feel the electricity .
Clean energy is the future . ”
Such hyperbole might seem reminiscent of the dotcom bubble .
But clean - energy advocates insist growth is sustainable because of the likes of Mr Schwarzenegger .
The Gubernator is a hero in green circles because of his enthusiasm for environmental regulation .
He easily won re-election partly because he seized on global warming as a concern and signed into law America 's first wide - ranging scheme to cap greenhouse - gas emissions .
California also boasts America 's most ambitious initiative to promote solar power , dubbed “ One Million Solar Roofs ” .
The state will pay $ 2.9 billion in rebates over ten years to households and businesses that install solar panels .
The federal government also chips in with a tax credit of 30 % of the cost of installation .
All manner of businesses in the state , from FedEx to wineries in Napa Valley , are rushing to install subsidised solar panels ( see article ) .
Renewable states
By 2010 , California aims to generate 20 % of its power from renewable sources .
No fewer than 21 of America 's 50 states have such “ renewable portfolio standards ” , which local utilities are obliged to meet within a set period .
Voters in Washington approved one in the recent elections .
Maine has the highest standard , of 30 % , although its utilities already meet it thanks to the state 's many hydroelectric dams .
Among the most ambitious is New Jersey 's , which will require 22.5 % of energy to come from renewables by 2021 .
It has already become the second - biggest solar market in America , after California .
Other government policies ensure that making ethanol from corn is a lucrative business , despite lingering concerns that the manufacturing process consumes almost as much energy as the resulting fuel provides , so that the effort does no good for the environment or the cause of energy independence .
Farmers receive subsidies for growing corn , refineries for mixing it into fuels , service stations for installing pumps to sell it and consumers for buying it .
Moreover , several states have laws requiring that a certain amount of ethanol is mixed into petrol , helping to bolster demand .
A recent study by the Global Subsidies Initiative , a pressure group , estimated that all this will cost American taxpayers at least $ 5 billion this year .
America 's incentives for clean energy , however , are relatively modest compared with Europe's .
The European Union , for example , wants 5.75 % of all transport fuel to come from non-fossil sources by 2010 .
Big refiners say the measure guarantees them a market for as much biodiesel as they can produce .
The EU also has a target for power from renewable sources of 18 % by 2010 .
Analysts at Goldman Sachs , an investment bank , calculate that solar output would have to grow by over 30 % a year to meet it .
By their count , 49 countries have policies on renewables in place that will foster rapid growth at clean - energy firms , including big emerging markets such as Brazil , China and India .
Germany is perhaps the most generous .
It has fixed the price of renewable power for the next 20 years on a sliding scale that will decline over time .
Certain solar projects will receive as much as € 0.57 ( 73 cents ) for each kilowatt - hour of electricity generated , compared with the going rate for dirtier power of around € 0.05 .
In normal circumstances , Germany would be a terrible place to install solar panels : it is not very sunny and has a good distribution grid , which solar does not require .
But thanks to its “ feed - in tariff ” , it is the biggest solar market in the world .
Around the world governments like Germany 's have pledged billions , or in some cases unlimited sums , to advance the clean - energy cause .
In the process , enthusiasts claim , they have “ pre-booked ” growth .
Supporters argue that these subsidies are reasonable , since they encourage a worthwhile cause — the fight against global warming — that markets do not seem to prize highly enough .
What is more , the subsidies are not supposed to be permanent .
Applied Materials ' Mr Gay points out the cost of generating solar power falls steadily over time .
The first cells , in satellites , cost about $ 200 per watt of generating power .
By last year the price had fallen to about $ 2.70 per watt .
That equates to a price decrease of about 18 % every time production doubles , he calculates .
Price decreases come inexorably with volume , he argues , so subsidies simply help to speed the process up by stimulating extra sales .
When subsidies go
Eventually , the proponents of clean technology maintain , renewable energy will become competitive with fossil fuels , allowing governments to end subsidies .
Mr Gay thinks solar power will be as cheap as that from big coal - fired power stations within a decade .
Something of the sort has already taken place in Japan , where last year subsidies for solar were phased out .
When these were introduced in 1994 , says Chris O'Brien of Sharp , the world 's biggest maker of solar cells , a system typically cost some $ 16,000 per kilowatt , of which the government paid half .
About 500 systems were installed in the first year .
A decade later , the cost had dropped to $ 6,000 per kilowatt and 60,000 systems were fitted .
Nowadays , he says , Japan is the first market “ where customers have continued to buy solar systems without subsidy ” .
However , all this is somewhat misleading .
Retail electricity prices in Japan are among the highest in the world , making it much easier for solar to compete .
In most places , concedes Michael Liebreich , of New Energy Finance , renewable power and fuels will be more expensive than the dirtier sort for the “ foreseeable future ” .
That leaves the clean - energy business largely dependent on government handouts .
Shares in the sector rose after George Bush 's state - of - the - union address in January , when he swore to wean America off dependence on foreign oil .
They also rallied on hopes that the newly Democratic Congress would spend more money on greenery .
Several of those elected , after all , tried to burnish their environmental credentials by running uplifting advertisements of themselves roaming the countryside amid majestic wind turbines .
But what one politician can mandate , another can terminate — and therein lies one of the biggest risks for clean energy .
American politicians have periodically allowed a tax break for wind generation to expire , for example .
This caused the industry to falter several times , before the credit was renewed again ( see chart 2 ) .
It is due to expire once more next year .
In similar fashion , the shares of European clean - energy firms fell this summer , along with the price of permits to emit carbon dioxide within the EU .
The price of permits had fallen because European governments had handed out too many of them to polluters , thus flooding the market .
Voters , too , sometimes lose heart .
In the recent elections , Californians , normally a reliably green lot , voted against a proposal to tax oil production to fund research into renewables .
Yet clean - energy investors are gambling , essentially , that governments and the taxpayers who fund them will continue to spend lavishly on the industry .
A dramatic fall in the oil price will almost certainly prompt governments to tighten purse - strings , since subsidies become relatively more expensive .
Developing new , carbon - free technologies will seem less urgent if there is plenty of cheap oil about .
When oil prices fell in the 1980s , governments quietly dropped many of the grand plans for energy independence developed during the oil shocks of the 1970s .
In Mr Liebreich 's view , oil - prices below $ 50 a barrel would undermine the momentum of clean energy .
Mr Khosla , the venture capitalist , warned delegates at the conference in San Jose that they needed technologies that are “ unconditionally cheaper ” than fossil fuels : “ If it ai n't cheaper , it does n't scale . ”
For the time being , however , keeping pace with demand is more of a worry .
Most manufacturers of wind turbines have full order books for the next few years .
Executives at Neste , a big Finnish refiner , doubt Europe 's output of biofuels can expand fast enough to meet the EU 's target .
The EU has also had to reduce its target for renewable power , since the industry could not grow fast enough to meet it .
The growth of solar firms has outpaced the supply of high - grade silicon needed to make their panels .
Investors are now rushing to finance factories to produce the necessary silicon .
Goldman Sachs expects output to double by 2010 — raising fears of an eventual crash in prices .
In the meantime , solar firms seeking financing are trying to distinguish themselves , either through contracts that assure their future supplies of silicon or through technology that reduces their consumption of it .
The potential for growth , most analysts argue , is clear .
But bottlenecks and political setbacks , not to mention technological glitches , will create many bumps in the road ahead .
Indeed , fears that the most euphoric investors were overlooking such obstacles seem to have contributed to a sharp fall in clean - energy stocks earlier this year — although they have since recovered much of the lost ground .
Such jitters caused several green - energy firms to cancel planned flotations .
“ There 's legitimate debate about a couple of segments , ” says Keith Raab , boss of Cleantech Venture Network .
In some instances , valuations accorded to firms with no profits — and little chance of making any soon — were reminiscent of the excesses of the dotcom bubble .
As Douglas Lloyd , of Venture Business Research , puts it , “ There 's too much money chasing too few opportunities .
How is it possible that this many solar companies are going to succeed ?
They 're not . ”
The DIALYZER : a DIscrepancy AnaLYZer for ERlang programs
The Dialyzer is a static analysis tool that identifies software discrepancies and bugs such as obvious type errors , code that has become unreachable due to some programming error , redundant tests , unsatisfiable conditions , etc. in single Erlang modules or entire applications .
Dialyzer analyzes either Erlang source code files or debug - compiled BEAM bytecode files and reports to its user the functions where the discrepancies occur and an indication of what the discrepancy is about .
Dialyzer is completely automatic ( in its basic mode of operation it does not require any annotations from the user ) , very easy to use , and currently supports various modes of operation .
The analysis that detects defects in the sequential part of Erlang is precise ( in particular , no false alarms are reported ) and typically also quite fast .
We are currently in the process of extending Dialyzer to also detect concurrency defects such as race conditions .
Dialyzer has been applied to large code bases , for example the entire code base of AXD301 consisting of about 2,000,000 lines of Erlang code , and has identified a significant number of software defects that have gone unnoticed after years of extensive testing .
It is also under continuous use in the Erlang / OTP system system and its reports have helped eliminate numerous bugs that the Erlang / OTP system contained in some of its standard libraries .
In addition , various commercial and open source projects have also integrated Dialyzer in their development toolkits .
We welcome user feedback !
In particular , examples of interesting discrepancies identified by Dialyzer , discrepancies that went unnoticed by it ( currently Dialyzer is conservative in order not to generate any false positives ) , and suggestions for improvements .

Download Since the Erlang / OTP R11B , dialyzer is an integrated component of the Erlang / OTP distribution ( but its development is still done by Kostis Sagonas and his students ) .
We strongly suggest that you try the dialyzer version in the latest Erlang / OTP release .
If you for some reason want to use some older versions of dialyzer these can be found below .
Important : Different dialyzer versions need the presence of specific versions of Erlang / OTP .
In fact , some Erlang / OTP releases first need to be patched in order for dialyzer to work properly .

The missile was reportedly launched near Xichang Space Centre
It is thought the Chinese used a ground - based , medium - range ballistic missile to destroy a weather satellite .
The US state department said it did not want the " militarisation of space " .
China 's foreign ministry refused to confirm or deny the report but said Beijing was opposed to " any form of arms race " .
The test , if confirmed , would be the first known satellite intercept for more than 20 years .
' Satellite - killing '
US state department spokesman Tom Casey said the Bush administration had made clear to China its opposition to such tests .
China advocates the peaceful use of space and opposes the weaponisation of space
Liu Jianchao ,
Chinese foreign ministry
Test sparks space arms fears
In space programmes , he said " small things can cause very big problems " .
Mr Casey said the tests could " produce extensive amounts of space debris [ that ] have the potential for disturbing or accidentally disrupting communications satellites " .
White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino said the Chinese had not yet responded .
" We do want co-operation on a civil space strategy , so until we hear back from them , I do n't have any more to add , " she said .
Mr Casey said the US had " no plans or intentions " to engage in space arms tests .
However , Washington has recently opposed international calls to end such tests - and the US is known to be researching such " satellite - killing " weapons .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale , in Washington , says the US has been cautious in its criticism , not least because it wants good relations with China , and has played down talk of an arms race .
International criticism
Earlier , China 's foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said : " I can't say anything about the reports .
I really do n't know . "
CHINA IN SPACE China first launched a manned space mission in 2003 - the third nation to do so after the US and Russia Chinese astronauts aim to perform a spacewalk as early as next year Until now , the US and Russia have been the only nations to shoot down space objects China insists its space programme is of no threat , but other nations are wary China says it spends $ 500 m on space projects .
NASA is due to spend $ 17bn in 2007
But he added : " China advocates the peaceful use of space and opposes the weaponisation of space , and also opposes any form of arms race . "
Australia and Japan have been among the countries joining criticism of the reported test .
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe said he had asked China for an explanation and said nations " must use space peacefully " .
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia did not want to see " some sort of spread ... of an arms race into outer space " .
The US National Security Council had confirmed an article in the magazine American Aviation Week and Space Technology , which reported that the test had taken place .
The report said a Chinese Feng Yun 1C polar orbit weather satellite was destroyed by an anti-satellite system launched from or near China 's Xichang Space Centre on 11 January .
The test is thought to have occurred at more than 537 miles ( 865 km ) above the Earth .
I found this really cool plant called the Amazing Dinosaur Plant .
Supposedly it pre-dates the dinosaurs , survived through their destruction , made it through the ice age and continues to thrive to this day in the 21st century .
What 's truly amazing about this plant is that it can dry up and hibernate for as long as 50 years at a time .
During this time it will curl up and travel around with the wind like a tumbleweed in search of water .
Once it finds moisture it can fully rejuvenate in one day .
This death and resurrection process is then repeated for hundreds of years .
Finally a plant that you can forget to water , watch it die , and not care at all .
It 's the perfect house plant !
nolalily 's comments :
We 're teetering on all out anarchy .
Seriously .
Our murder rate has soared due to many , many thugs ( teens and young adults mostly ) who have returned to the city without their parents .
Central City ( which is the area which is , well , central in the city ) has been completely empty since Katrina .
Many of these thugs are squatting in abandoned houses .
They are engaged in an all out drug war with rivals from New Orleans but worse , other parts of the country who were never here before .
Addicts and punks are robbing people in the populated parts when they need money .
This brings crime into our backyard which is a small backyard to begin with .
Yesterday morning , around 5:30 am , a doctor and his wife were shot in their home in the Marigny .
They were a young couple with a 2 - year old son .
The husband had started a clinic for the poor and his wife , a Harvard graduate , was a filmmaker .
Both were community activists , liberal and well - loved .
He played in a band .
She died .
He collapsed in the doorway , after he was shot , holding his son in his arms .
They were quite liberal and open .
Today , many of us are attending meetings concerning the city 's welfare and there is a march on city hall planned for this Thursday .
I live Uptown and , also yesterday , 3 blocks from my house , a young mother ( 2 children ) was murdered by her thug boyfriend .
I am still getting the story on this but apparently she moved to New Orleans after Katrina and met this dude who should be in jail , I was told for murder , but , since we have no legal system to speak of ( I was called for jury duty - that 's a whole other story , but we can't seem to get enough jurors , attorneys , judges nor jails to actually hold a trial - much less put somebody someplace once they have a conviction ) he was released .
I kid you not .
Our mayor has moved his wife and children to Dallas where he built a house and rarely can be found .
The national guard is here but C Ray does n't want them in populated areas where tourists will see them .
He 's afraid they 'll make them feel uneasy .
He is totally wrong .
Sorry you asked ?
I hope not .
But what I wrote is what is on every New Orleanian 's mind this morning .
My therapist says we keep being re-traumatized meaning that Katrina is no where near over .
Some of you are aware that I am a psychotherapist who has re-entered therapy myself .
I have been purposely avoiding reading local news , listening to local news programs or involving myself in controversial discussion about local issues .
However , the murder of Helen Hill and the wounding of Dr. Paul Galliunas has put this city over the top .
Just read these comments by New Orleanians regarding this murder and the state of the city .
Here are some excerpts from the Times - Picayune article chronicling their murder :
Killings bring the city to its bloodied knees
Husband , wife just two of 6 shot in 24 hours
Friday , January 05 , 2007
By Brendan McCarthy
and Laura Maggi
Staff writers
Just the headline should tell you the story .
People are organizing a march on City Hall scheduled for this Thursday .
In the sixth New Orleans murder in less than 24 hours , a woman was killed and her husband shot in their home Thursday about 5:30 a.m. , said police , who found the bleeding man kneeling at the door of the couple 's Faubourg Marigny home , clutching their 2 - year - old son .
The man is Dr. Paul Guiliunas .
Friends have reported that he and his son departed New Orleans in less than 24 hours for Canada .
They quote him as saying he will never return to the United States again .
Note : ... never return to the United States again .
The Marigny shootings -- for which police offered no motive -- capped a wave of bloodshed severe even by New Orleans standards , and came three days after Police Superintendent Warren Riley called a year - end news conference to put a positive spin on the 2006 murder total of 161 , which he called the lowest in 30 years .
On a per-capita basis , however , even the most optimistic projection of the post - Katrina city 's drastically shrunken population makes that figure an increase from previous years .
The style of the slayings -- which in at least two cases took place with police officers stationed only blocks away -- ranged from a single shot at point - blank range to a spray of 17 bullets .
Some victims " had heroin in their hand and crack in their pocket , " said New Orleans Deputy Chief Steven Nicholas at a late morning news conference Thursday .
The killings appeared to have no particular geographic pattern , with the exception of two people killed on separate days near the same spot on Josephine Street , as victims fell in neighborhoods citywide , from the Lower 9th Ward to Marigny to Central City to Bayou St. John to Desire
.
Nothing is more difficult than settling your nerves when nothing makes sense .
Patterns do n't exist .
Motive is absent .
And , if you feel you do n't know Dr. Gailiunas and his wife very well .
Here 's a little something to help you get more familiar :
By Thursday morning , news of Gailiunas ' and Hill 's shootings had reached the Esplanade Pharmacy , which abuts the former Little Doctors Neighborhood Clinic , the sliding - scale doctors ' office that Gailiunas co-founded before the storm .
Staff there talked about Gailiunas ' devotion to his patients , many of whom were indigent .
" He went out of his way for a lot of people , trying to make sure that they had their medicine , trying to find ways to pay for their medicine , and helping them get samples , " said pharmacist - in - charge Gwendolyn Charles , who has owned the corner pharmacy with her husband for 26 years .
This man is a rarity in New Orleans these days .
' We are begging '
Reports Deputy Chief Nicholas regarding the police department 's inability to get witnesses to step forward .
The city lives in fear .
We are trying so hard to keep our city together .
Some of us are rebuilding our homes , but many , many of us have n't received any help at all that would enable us to even get started .
Our friends , neighbors and families are leaving .
There are two houses to the left of us on the market and soon to be one more .
Our next door neighbor to the right of us has their house on the market .
The house kitty - cornered to ours is for sale .
Do I live in flooded Lakeview ?
Gentilly ?
St. Bernard ? or even the Lower 9th ?
No .
I live in comfortable , affluent , non-flooded Uptown ; the coveted " sliver by the river " .
If New Orleans can't keep it 's citizens here who did n't flood , what about the rest of our city ?
And , anybody in Denver even tries to compare themselves to this ; if one of yours really did write that email ?
You can go fuck yourselves .
I did n't start the pissing match .
After living through Katrina , all I can say is who , in their right minds , wants to win the award for the most traumatized anyway ?

I am writing this quick note , because today I wasted at least an hour looking for a bug in my code , when it was really a bug in the compiler .
And when I like something even less than bugs , its wasted time :x .
Therefore , I will repeat my simple advice to myself here , to make sure I remember the next time : Sometimes , it IS the compilers fault !
Huh , that felt good :) .
Perhaps a little more explanation about my background and why this is not self - evident for me is in order :
When I started programming ( yes , I still remember that time 8 ) ) and something did not work out as expected , I was very quick to blame the compiler ( the joys of youth : D ) .
I see my students doing this today as well .
There is one thing to keep in mind , though : I started programming in C ( actually , I did Pascal before that , but that ’s not the point ) in about 1994 .
By that time , the language and its compilers were quite old and well - tested already .
Therefore , most of the time , the compiler was right , and the real error - source was sitting in front of the keyboard .
I do not remember finding a single real bug in a compiler at that time , especially since I kept away from the more advanced language features , because after all I was a beginner back then .
At that time , I learned this simple lesson : the compiler is always right .
The times have obviously changed .
Since I am doing OpenMP - development with C++ now , I find bugs in the compilers from time to time .
In all of them ( I usually test my stuff on at least the Intel Compiler , the Sun Compiler , the Portland Group Compiler and sometimes on the IBM and old KAI - Compiler – and will try GCC with OpenMP - support as soon as it is officially stable ) .
If I stick to C , I am usually pretty safe .
Bring in C++ , and there are bugs .
Of course , I report them and the vendors are usually very responsive and fix them in a very reasonable time .
And of course , I have the luxury to be able to make sure it actually is a bug in the compiler just by trying out a couple of them .
If the code only breaks on one of them , I have usually found a bug .
Many programmers do not have this luxury , e.g. when their employer only uses one compiler ( which is a bad idea , for exactly this reason and for the wise saying of an ancient programmer :
More compilers find more bugs ! :P )
But still , there are times like today , when I wish I could just turn back the time to the beginning of my life as a programmer , when all the segmentation faults , stack overflows and triggered assertions of my programs could be blamed on a single point of failure : Me !
DIGG THIS
" Some would argue that the only solution would be the legalization of drugs .
By removing the criminality of drug sales , possession and usage , the United States government could devote more of its law enforcement resources on other crimes such as murder , rape , assault etc .
Furthermore , they argue that regulation of such drugs could create a revenue enhancement for federal , state and local governments . "
~ posted on the Begging To Differ Forum
This person must have read my mind !
One can find a lot of interesting insight and provocative opinion on Internet forums , and I will examine a little of it here .
I am , in fact , one of the " some " of which the poster above speaks in that first sentence .
And I 'm certainly not the first person to hold such an opinion .
Not that long ago on this very website Manuel Lora wrote :
" Possession / sale of controlled substances ; having no ID / refusing to show ID ; importing / exporting without paying taxes ; buying / carrying guns without a license ; selling services and goods without permits : what do all these things have in common ?
They are “ victimless crimes . ”
There is no crime if you hurt no one .
Nor is there a crime if you hurt yourself on purpose or by accident . "
Indeed .
And none other than the righteous Lysander Spooner opined :
" It is a maxim of the law that there can be no crime without a criminal intent ; that is , without the intent to invade the person or property of another .
But no one ever practices a vice with any such criminal intent .
He practices his vice for his own happiness solely , and not from any malice toward others . "
The Upside of Legalization — Obvious
So it seems pretty clear that logically and legally , conducting a war on a vice is misguided , but what about the other issues ?
What about all the damage illegal drugs do to our communities ?
What about all those children who would fall prey to nasty drug pushers was it not for those ever - popular " this - is - your - brain - on - drugs " commercials ?
I would still argue that most , if not all , of the problems with drugs are a direct result of the fact that they have been criminalized by the state .
If the criminality associated with " illegal " drug use was removed , the positive effects would be :
Violence concomitant to the drug trade goes away .
Incarceration of non-violent offenders is severely reduced .
Overdoses from poor quality drugs are infrequent .
People who need help to overcome addiction obtain it .
Tax revenue from the sale of drugs is funneled to the government .
( Yes , that 's a statist benefit , but hey , I 'm just sayin ' ! )
From what I ’ve read and heard from various “ experts ” , most , if not all , of the violence from the drug trade stems from people trying to facilitate the business of drugs .
In fact according to US Census Data and FBI Uniform Crime Reports :
" …each of the most violent episodes in this century coincides with the prohibition on alcohol and the escalation of the modern - day war on drugs .
In 1933 the homicide rate peaked at 9.7 per 100,000 people , which was the year that alcohol prohibition was finally repealed .
In 1980 , the homicide rate peaked again at 10 per 100,000 . "
If drugs like coke and crack were legal , this facilitation crime stops almost instantly .
The obvious example of prohibition supports this view .
Even the most ardent supporter of the state 's right to incarcerate anyone it pleases realizes that prohibition is what made losers like Al Capone household names .
Without prohibition , these thugs would likely not have even been footnotes in history .
In a true example of the irony of our " war on drugs " many , if not most , of the folks doing time for drugs are not those most responsible for the drug trade .
In my simplistic view , the folks most responsible for the drug trade have to own , or have ready access to , either a boat or a plane .
In sharp contrast , the folks swelling our prisons are similar to the guys with whom I grew up .
They sold drugs , lived in a double - wide trailer , and drove an Escalade , but they were just distributors .
They got pinched and convicted , but they were , at best , workers not thinkers .
Yet they get 25 - to - life and the drug flow proceeds unabated anyway !
That does n’t make sense if you ’re really trying to fight and win a war .
In terms of fighting the addiction , I know a few people who have “ kicked the habit ” and counseling was extremely important .
Imagine if junkies could get help like alcoholics routinely get .
Most assuredly that type of intervention does not happen now as much as it could if the criminality was removed .
We treat alcoholism like a disease for good reasons .
As an aside , I wonder if stuff like medical marijuana gets the use it could without the criminal overtones .
To the issue of tax revenue , I ’m pretty certain that the government already receives more revenue than I would like to see them get , but I still have no problem with them receiving the tax revenue from formerly illegal drugs .
Frankly , I do n’t think legalization has to mean government distribution or even regulation .
( The conspiracy theorist in me tends to believe that legalization would result in less profit for the government , but I would never say that here ! )
Still , a removal of the criminality could result in an obvious revenue stream .
Additionally , drug users currently pay extremely over - inflated prices , reflecting the risks involved in drug production and the limits to competition .
This means that the drug war actually makes drug users poorer .
The State , via its drug war , implements a pro-poverty policy : it deliberately tries to make drug use extremely expensive for the users by destroying free competition .
Ergo , the drug war fails to mitigate the usage while simultaneously keeping the costs artificially high .
The current war on drugs creates the worst of both worlds !
Of course the conventional wisdom can provide any number of supposedly meaningful arguments against wholesale legalization of illegal drugs , such as :
" By legalizing drugs , the government grants an implicit consent that drug consumption is morally acceptable . "
To this I would simply say , hopefully without being too facetious , that anyone who thinks drug consumption is not morally acceptable in the U.S. has n’t watched TV in the last 15 minutes !
Two words : " Viagra anyone ? "
People in the U.S. consume something like twice the OTC pharmaceuticals of the next nearest country .
According to " Report 9 of the Council On Medical Service ( I - 99 ) " we find :
" As a point of reference to U.S. expenditures , IMS Health data show that the total worldwide market for pharmaceuticals is $ 302 billion .
Novartis , Merck , and Glaxo Wellcome are the top three pharmaceutical companies in terms of global sales .
Within the total audited world market , the leading 20 pharmaceutical companies account for 57.3 % of all sales .
The leading 10 companies account for 36 % of total sales .
The top 10 worldwide markets represent 84 % of all global audited pharmaceutical sales .
The US , which is the largest market ( 40 % of the worldwide market ) , grew 11 % to $ 99.5 billion in 1998 . "
Yes , you read that correctly .
The U.S. market in 1998 accounted for 40 % of the worldwide market , which was $ 302 billion .
( Certainly the use of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. has not gone down since then . )
Americans love drugs !
There just happens to be a war against some of the people who use some of the drugs .
And just as important , it turns out that illegal drugs are , even given the crime , violence , and other negative factors , generally safer than many activities already common , as another poster mentioned when he said :
" Of course , per the AMA ’s data , all of these drugs combined are less deadly than a number of different common health hazards , including prescription drugs and risky sexual behaviors . "
Emphasis mine .
Exactly .
Of course he was talking about cigarettes and alcohol .
These items kill many more people than illegal drugs .
Need proof ?
Examine this chart .
We tend to vilify certain drugs while simultaneously celebrating the good clean fun of enjoying others , along with “ those twins ” ( from the Coors Lite commercials ) and whatnot .
I just do n’t see it as anything but puritanical hypocrisy .
Of course , some folks would tend to disagree .
Such a disagreement was raised by another poster when she said :
" Sure , go ahead and legalize drugs .
But can we agree that if you develop serious health issues ( i.e. cocaine induced heart attack or stroke , cirrhosis ) we do n’t have to pay for your care ?
Easily 4/10 people we admitted [ to the emergency room ] each night on call were there because of cocaine / ETOH related issues in repeat offenders . "
Emphasis mine .
Well , no , we can’t .
Is there a precedent currently in place for denial of care based upon stupidity ?
Apparently the people admitted to the ER are abusing a legal drug in combination with an illegal one .
I would also guess that they inhabit a socio- economic stratum that tends to use the ER as the doctor ’s office , although I could be wrong about that .
Unless we are suggesting that legalization would positively interact with abuse and socio- economic status , I do n’t see the point .
Unless we 're suggesting that the tendency of a person to use the ER as a doctor ’s office would positively interact with legalization , I do n’t see the point .
The Downside of Legalization — Dubious
But , certainly there might be bad consequences after wholesale legalization of heretofore - illegal drugs .
So let us look at the possible negatives .
If the criminality associated with " illegal " drug use was removed , the negative effects could be :
More people try hard drugs .
Health care costs associated with treating drug abuse skyrockets .
The moral fiber of society is further weakened .
In the case of legality leading to more use , we have two readily available examples to examine  tobacco and alcohol .
In the case of cigarettes , during their early history it was not clear nor publicized that they were bad .
In fact , the industry leaders actually said in advertisements , that cigarettes were good for you !
As ludicrous as that sounds now , that was the pervasive message in advertising and in almost all forms of public discourse .
I ca n’t imagine the CEO ’s of the six leading cocaine manufacturers ever testifying before Congress in that way !
For alcohol , the message is much different at this point .
Our entire society is built around the responsible use of alcohol to modify one ’s mood .
Alcohol consumption is rampant , and the use of such drugs is accepted and far from pejorative to one ’s character .
Illegal drug use is similar to alcohol in pervasiveness , yet carries a negative social stigma .
I find this curious .
The amount of cocaine ( and derivative products , like crack ) consumed in America is astronomical .
In fact , if the use of coke was limited only to the folks we tend to lament , ( and apparently wish to “ teach a lesson ” by denying care ) I submit that no one would give a crap .
I believe that recreational drug use by folks in similar socio-economic status to people like those who frequent Internet forums fully supports the drug trade in the U.S.
Very few , if any , of these people would ever be caught using the ER as a doctor 's office .
Fewer still would likely begin to do so after legalization .
Ergo , the problem that needs addressing in the ER example has little , if anything , to do with legalization of drugs .
I would therefore argue that the costs reflected our ER example will continue to exist regardless of legality .
Given the prevalence of drug use already occurring , the moral fiber of our society would be unlikely to even feel a tug after legalization .
Frankly , there already exists ample evidence from other countries showing less use of drugs that are illegal in the U.S. but legal in those countries !
Consider the example of The Netherlands , where marijuana use is legal , yet the prevalence is lower .
No , legality does not drive increased usage by itself .
On the other hand , I have known several couples who have been negatively impacted by the abuse of coke .
In each case , they were professionals .
In each case , they were otherwise solid citizens .
In at least a couple of cases , one or both were college graduates .
Yet , the abuse of coke tore them apart .
One might think that those examples should lead me to be a strong proponent of the drug war , but it had exactly the opposite effect .
In my mind , the illegality or legality of the substances had no effect on these folks ’ decisions .
It is one of my firmest beliefs that this is generally the case .
And the libertarian in me is reminded of one immutable truth : it was their decision to make .
People ’s behavior is relatively unaffected by laws designed to provide moral direction .
What is affected is the socio- economic stratum they may inhabit after they have made a mistake .
If we really want to address those problems , our approach must be different .
Conclusion
So why is there a war on drugs ?
In all honesty , part of me just has no idea .
( Yes , even a libertarian can find comfort in denial ! )
The other part of me agrees wholeheartedly with " Jake " , one of my colleagues over on the Freedomain Radio Forum , when he says :
" There is a war on drugs because the people who control the State do not want to be stuck answering the phone , they want an excuse to break down your door .
In other words , they do n’t want to be limited to providing dispute resolution services , they want an instrument of social control that they can extend .
Real dispute resolution has to serve the requirements of the customer ( a member of the public calls up and says that someone has stolen his car , requiring you to try and find it ) .
The state in this role is at the beck and call of the public .
If the public just goes about its own business , the state has nothing to do .
However , victimless crimes offer a whole new opportunity for actively interfering in peoples lives : now the state is truly following its own agenda and can try to arrest people without the pesky problem of needing a complainant . "
Indeed .
Clearly the U.S. market is providing substantial support for the third world 's production of cocaine , heroin , and whatever else can be manufactured in a cave in the Middle East .
Just as clearly , the consumption of prescription drugs is an accepted and — judging by the number of TV spots — suggested way of life .
If Puritan morals were at the root of this ostensible " war " , then one might expect there to be a general disdain for drug use , as opposed to a supposed hate for illegal drugs simultaneous with an open embrace of legal ones .
Let me not end this essay without re-examining the justifications for this " war " using the argument from morality .
As Spooner and Lora eloquently convey in the pieces I linked at the beginning of this essay , the ostensible offender in a drug - related crime infringes upon no one but himself .
How it is moral for the State — simply a group of people — to determine which of these self - inflicted activities is a crime and which is not ?
And how do they know ?
Upon what authority , other than force , can they justify such a decision ?
Surely , if my ingestion of a " controlled substance " justifies me being sent to prison , there are few other limits left .
What 's next , prison time for over - eating ?
How about fines for letting your children watch too much TV ?
Where exactly does it stop ?
I wonder .
Would it not be better to pursue drug peace just this once ?
And just off the top of my head , I also wonder if those " drug - free zones " near schools include Prozac , Lithium , Viagra , and for the love of all that 's holy , Ritalin ?

The Best of Wilton Alston
Sneaking into Airports
The stories keep getting better .
Here ’s someone who climbs a fence at the Raleigh - Durham Airport , boards a Delta plane , and hangs out for a bunch of hours .
Best line of the article :
“ It blows my mind that you ca n’t get 3.5 ounces of toothpaste on a plane , ” he said , “ yet somebody can sneak on a plane and take a nap . ”
Exactly .
We ’re spending millions enhancing passenger screening — new backscatter X - ray machines , confiscating liquids — and we ignore the other , less secure , paths onto airplanes .
It ’s idiotic , that ’s what it is .

This directory contains the current version of the book “ The Complete FreeBSD ” , which has also been published by O'Reilly and Associates .
The present version is a slightly updated version of the same edition .
It is provided for personal use under the Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike 2.5 license .
If you like this book , you might prefer the convenience of the paper version from O'Reilly .
Updates
The resource problems that we had shortly after the announcement are now over .
Thanks to everybody who offered mirrors .
For a couple of reasons , I 'd prefer to use only one site :
I 'm interested in how many downloads take place .
That 's easier if they 're all from one place .
This does n't restrict your freedom to distribute the book under the provisions of the license , though you should read the next point :
There have been a number of updates since the initial release , and there will be more .
Coordinating this across multiple sites is difficult
As a result of the load issues , I previously hosted these files on evilcode .
net ( thanks to Samuel J. Greear for supplying this site ) .
Unfortunately , this service is now no longer available , and the pages are now hosted on my alternate web site , which contains only a poorly defined subset of the main web site .
See the links below for the current locations .
There have also been some problems with the sources .
If you have downloaded them before 10:00 UTC on 25 February 2006 , you will need to perform some additional work to get the book to build .
As a result of the changes in the source , I 've also rebuilt the PDF .
There have been some reports of incorrect spacing round ligatures ( ' ff ' , ' fi ' , 'fl ' ) .
This appears to be a bug in ghostscript that creates different spacings from the standard when converting from PostScript to PDF .
For non-base typefaces , I can include the fonts with the PDF ( this is what I do with the Garamond fonts ) , but I have n't been able to find out how to do this with the base fonts .
If you know an answer , please contact me .
If you do n't , but are affected by the problem , keep an eye on this page .
I 'll update it as soon as I have a fix .
The problem with the ligatures does n't exist with the PostScript version .
After gzipping it's also smaller , so you may prefer to download this version .
This should n't affect books built from source .
Contents
This directory contains :
The complete book in gzipped PostScript form ( about 2.8 MB ) .
The complete book in gzipped PDF form ( about 5 MB ) .
This version has minor format problems with ligatures .
If possible , use the PostScript version .
The complete book in uncompressed PDF form ( about 10 MB ) .
This version also has minor format problems with ligatures .
If possible , use the PostScript version .
The complete sources for rebuilding the book ( about 9.5 MB ) , gzipped tar .
Note that the files are gzipped .
Many web browsers misunderstand and try to display the gzipped version , which will normally not work , though reportedly newer versions of acroread understand this format .
Other browsers , notably Microsoft , lie about the size : they first unpack the file and then claim to have transferred the size of the unpacked file .
I hope that you 'll download and build the book and send back patches for improving it .
One improvement would be to weed out the files in the sources that are no longer needed .
The history
On 14 October 1995 I received a visit from a number of people from Walnut Creek CDROM , with whom I had published a CD - ROM of ported free software .
This experience had also prompted me to write a book , “ Porting UNIX Software ” .
At the time of the visit , O'Reilly and Associates were in the course of publishing the book , and I showed the final drafts to Jack Velte and Greg Long .
They were very interested , and Jack said “ Ca n't you write a book about how to install FreeBSD ?
Does n't need to be long , just about 50 pages or so . ”
At the time I had installed FreeBSD on a couple of machines , but my operating system of choice was BSD / OS .
The idea sounded like fun , though , and so I quickly hacked together a few pages .
Jack and Greg liked what they saw , and so we went ahead .
I had gained some experience with using groff while writing “ Porting UNIX Software ” , and as the result of some production issues that I had had with that book , we agreed that I would do the entire formatting and supply the book in PostScript format .
On 24 February 1996 , little over 4 months later , I submitted the final draft of a book which I called “ Running FreeBSD 2.1 ” , and which Walnut Creek called “ Installing And Running FreeBSD ” .
That 's the way it was printed , as those of you who have this book can confirm .
The book was a great success .
Of course , it was a little more than 50 pages ; in fact , a total of 322 pages , including 54 pages of man pages from the FreeBSD distribution .
Despite this , Jack was n't happy : “ Those Linux books have over 1000 pages !
This looks like nothing .
What can you do ?
We need something yesterday ! ” .
Well , I had started the trend with the first edition .
I added many more man pages , a little more editorial content , and 5 months later , on 19 July , I submitted the next version .
We had now agreed on the title : “ The Complete FreeBSD ” , with only 844 pages still shy of the 1000 page mark .
542 of those pages were man pages .
Given the extreme time constraints , I 'm still surprised that I managed so much .
From then on , I had more time to work on the book , and the material evolved in a more orderly manner .
I formatted the second ( or was that third ? ) edition on 29 November 1997 , now with a whopping 1,766 pages ( of which only 1,108 were man pages ; that still left 658 pages of real content ) .
Jack was finally pleased .
That proved to be too much , though .
People complained that the book was unwieldy , and after all , man pages are intended to be read online .
We agreed that printing lots of man pages was also a waste of money .
When the third edition appeared , on 17 May 1999 , it was slimmer : only 808 pages , still including 126 pages of man pages chosen because they could be of use when the machine was n't running .
Changes were afoot in the industry , though .
Jack left Walnut Creek , and later Bob Bruce merged Walnut Creek CDROM with BSDI .
Shortly after that , they were taken over by Wind River Systems , who were ambivalent about the book .
Round this time I convinced Andy Oram , my editor at O'Reilly , to publish the book .
The fourth edition finally appeared in O'Reilly 's “ Community Press ” series in May 2003 .
It had 718 pages and — oh wonder !— none of them were man pages .
That 's the current status .
Looking at those dates , you 'll see that as time went on , each edition was further from its predecessor .
There are several reasons for this : the material is mainly there , there are now other books on FreeBSD out there , and I do n't have the time .
Still , I think that “ The Complete FreeBSD ” is a unique book , and it 's probably worth maintaining .
But I can't do it myself .
So : I 'm making the sources available under the “ Creative Commons ” license ( the book itself has been under this license since the O'Reilly edition ) .

Building the book
As it says on the flyleaf , this book was written in troff and formatted on 24 February 2006 with GNU groff Version 1.19 running under FreeBSD 6.0 - CURRENT .
It uses a set of macros which I derived from the groff mm macros .
I 've been working on them and the current version of the build process for more than 10 years , and it 's a mess .
I use the framework for most of my document processing , and one of the things I need to do is to fix it ; I 'm doing this in the background .
At some later date I will hopefully be able to replace the current build mechanism .
In the meantime , a few pointers :
There are two directories , tools and Book .
Their purposes should be self - evident .
Currently you need to run make in tools before building the book .
This should change .
The default Makefile target builds the entire book .
The resulting PostScript file will be located in complete / book.ps .
The build process uses Emacs .
The macros are in the file tools / tmac .
Mn .
The only documentation of the extended macros is in the comments in that file .
Please do n't bother to modify these macros , nor to document them .
If you feel like doing that , please contact me and I 'll give you the latest version , which is noticeably different .
If you do n't like the Makefile or some other aspect of the build , and you feel like fixing it , do n't bother either .
I have a vastly improved version which I can give you ; it 's just not quite up to building the book yet .
The files are maintained with RCS .
If you like , you can check out any past version , even before the first edition 10 years ago .
The RCS directory also contains some chapters which were determined to be uninteresting for the fourth edition , in particular chapters about SLIP , ISDN , UUCP and faxes .
It should be relatively trivial to re-include them in the book , and I may do so in the future .
The status of this book
This book currently has effectively the same content as the fourth edition .
I have changed the formatting somewhat : O'Reilly asked for a layout which I found ugly .
You can set this version by modifying the macro file tmac .
Mn and reverting this change :
--- tmac .

Listening to a machine made entirely from windows
[ Image : The ANS ] .
The ANS functioned through an " array of tiny chisels " that engraved " lines and points on rotating black enamelled glass discs . "
These engravings would then " regulate the brightness of light rays " that passed " through the discs onto photoelements , " like the sun streaming through carefully shaded windows .
The " level of intensity " of this light then produced specific sounds .
Elsewhere ( scroll down COILANS review ) , we read about the ANS 's unique compositional process :
" The composer inscribes his visual ' score ' onto a glass plate covered with sticky black mastic , slides it through the machine , which reads the inscribed plate and converts the etchings into sound produced by a system of 800 oscillators . "
It 's a machine that reads windows .

Light , chisels , glass plates , oscillators , enamelled surfaces , engravings on windows – with these elements it is not at all hard to imagine a kind of ANS architecture , rebuilt on the scale of a building .
Windowed lobbies and escalators ; sunlight ; entire lift shafts full of glass discs , inscribed and black - enamelled , emitting music like light .
Whole rooms of sound , angelic , the windows slightly trembling .
Moving panes of glass , washed clean at the end of the day , pass slowly behind curtains , casting shadows .

An old issue of The Wire introduces us to a synthesizer called the ANS , built in 1950s Moscow by Eugene Murzin and " constructed around a unique and incredibly intricate photoelectronic system .
" The ANS functioned through an " array of tiny chisels " that engraved " lines and points on rotating black enamelled glass discs . "
These engravings would then " regulate the brightness of light rays " that passed " through the discs onto photoelements , " like the sun streaming through carefully shaded windows .

It 's a machine that reads windows .
then explains that , in 2002 , British band Coil visited the synthesizer in Moscow and recorded nearly 4 hours of music using the machine .
Listening to what they produced , we 're told , sounds " like travelling through the Oort Cloud or the Kuiper Belt – glitting slivers of distant white light and vast , nebulous spaces populated by inchoate radioactive matter . "
As you 'll notice in these three , 3 - minute samples , the effect is certainly weird – but unbelievably mesmerizing : 1 2 , and 3 ( all MP3s ) .

Working in IT seems to be a constant game of “ two steps forward , one step back . ”
And that ’s on the good days .
On other days it ’s most definitely one step forward , two steps back , get tripped over by the person you did n’t see sneaking up behind you and have your face stepped on while lying on the ground .
Thinking about the problems faced by the IT industry , they fall into two categories that I ’ll call micro-threats and macro- threats .
Micro-threats are the problems faced by individual workers within the workplace .
This might not seem like an issue for the industry overall , but if individual workplace are held back by dysfunctional practices then ultimately the industry as a whole suffers .
Macro - threats are the big issues that , if not quite industry - wide , have the effect of stifling or even crippling whole sectors .
While it often seems impossible to do anything about these big issues on an individual level , if they are n’t recognised and addressed , we all suffer .
So here are my top five :
1 . The Stifling of Innovation – IT almost by definition is about innovation ; the only constant in this industry is change .
The industry is worth more than US $ 2.5 Trillion annually worldwide and yet faces constant attempts to thwart its continued success .
Whether it ’s the lies of the entertainment industry , cynical people building business strategies around patents rather than actual innovation ( or even work ) , Microsoft ( and others ) spreading Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt about their competitors or Apple ( and others ) pursuing increasingly spurious lawsuits to “ protect ” their businesses , it has the same effect .
Comparatively tiny vested interests are threatening the continued growth and prosperity of the vast majority .
Until we stop seeing this bullshit as “ good business ” and recognise it for what it is – a shakedown – everyone ’s future is at risk .
2 . The obsession with technologies and methodologies over results – the fundamental disconnect between a technologist and a business person often comes down to focus .
We geeks love our gadgets .
A Southern Baptist preacher aint got nothin ’ on a hardcore geek evangelising about his favourite technology .
Here ’s a hard fact for many IT people : the right technology is the one that gets the job done .
The average business person has no interest in the programming language , operating system , hardware or methodology that you believe is the one true path to the promised land .
That ’s if you ’re lucky – in my experience , there ’s nothing worse than a business person who has arbitrarily decided that one technology is better than another .
If you ’re convinced that your favoured technology and methodology is the best , prove it with results , not rhetoric .
Religious arguments are bad enough when they ’re about religion ; elevating technology to the level of religion is counter - productive and downright scary .
3. Arrogance –
Here ’s a tip : if you ’re trying to explain technology to someone and they do n’t seem to understand , treating them like they ’re stupid is n’t going to help anyone , you least of all .
It does n’t matter if they really are stupid , the IT industry ’s reputation for arrogance has been earned by the frequent misapplication of grossly unjustified arrogance from many IT practitioners .
And if you think arrogance makes you “ strong ” , just stay the hell away from me you sociopathic jerk .
Besides making average ( non - arrogant ) geeks ’ life a misery , quite a few major companies have been destroyed due in no small part to arrogance .
Napster probably should have been a huge commercial success , it could have opened the door for huge new revenue streams for record companies and artists .
But Shawn Fanning ’s extraordinary arrogance turned him into his greatest potential customers ’ mortal enemy .
It ’s true that the record companies seem to be controlled by greedy old white guys who run their business like the mafia .
They might have gone after Napster if Fanning had been as sweet as pie but his attitude in the early days pretty much sealed his fate .
By the time he had been sufficiently coached to act like a grownup it was too late .
4 . Hype over Substance – There ’s no getting around it , IT is exciting .
The rate of change and the explosion in computing power have opened so many possibilities it ’s dizzying .
Sometimes literally .
It seems that “ irrational exuberance ” is an occupational hazard in IT .
Sure , it ’s a great way to get media attention and investment capital but it seriously hurts your credibility if you ca n’t deliver on the hyperbole .
Have you ever noticed that overhyped “ world - changing ” technologies almost always fail utterly ?
( the Segway springs to mind ) .
And the truly life - changing things seem to sneak up on us .
In retrospect we can see how great they are but they were n’t heralded by trumpets from the heavens .
The iPod was unveiled as a great product but I do n’t recall outlandish claims about how Apple would sell millions , create an entire new market and essentially rejuvenate the entire company with a bloody portable music player .
If Jobs had introduced the iPod by predicting the sales figures Apple have actually achieved in the years since , he would have been a public laughing stock .
5. Constantly focusing on “ the now ” .
While IT development is arguably about creating the future , I ’m always astonished at how many colossal screw - ups are perpetrated by thinking only about the current moment in time .
The Y2 K issue was created by programmers deliberately introducing an appalling limitation into systems essentially because it was n’t a problem for them – someone would fix it in the future .
Arguably , this turned out to be true but this issue is a perfect illustration of how short sighted thinking in IT has long term consequences .
This can also be seen in how people tend to discuss the current stars in the IT environment at any given time .
The number of discussions running rampant at the moment about the disproportionate power of Digg are utterly ridiculous .
Digg came out of literally nothing a very short time ago .
The very fact they exist and have achieved prominence so quickly is evidence that Digg is likely to be irrelevant long term .
There is every possibility that a different , better service will eclipse Digg in the future .
But far too often , analysis of these topic seem to be based on the idea that the status quo of today will never shift .
Because Digg ( or YouTube or MySpace or even Google ) is so dominant today , they will always be dominant and it ’s pointless to even try to compete with them .
This simply is n’t true but you hear it again and again .
– – –
For each of the above examples it would be easy to cite examples of companies and individual who have triumphed over these threats ( and hopefully people will provide some in the comments ) .
The fact that these threats can be successfully fought does n’t invalidate this article , that ’s the whole point of the article .
Knowing what issues you face is the first step in dealing with them ( that ’s the analyst in me talking ) .
Ignoring threats or worse still , being totally ignorant of the threats you face is playing Russian Roulette .
And sooner or later you ’re going to spin up the wrong chamber .

Unfortunately , you do n't have any CD , floppy , USB - key , no nothing at hand .
Fortunately , you do n't need any one of them .
The trick Copy the ( small ) Linux installer on a hard disk and run it from your previous operating system .
Finish using the network .
That 's all .
In some cases you can substitute the network by a ( big ) hard disk if your network is not good .
The even better trick Jordi Massaguer i Pla is developing instlux , a sofware automating most of the steps below .
Instead of hunting all across the internet for a bunch of files , now you just have to download instlux , run it and reboot .
It 's currently working for OpenSUSE 10 and Ubuntu breezy 5.X .
Since you are now rushing to instlux to escape the reading of this boring document , let me just remind you to backup your data before doing anything !
Note :
This document is focused on Microsoft Windows as the pre-existing operating system , but many things still apply if you start from something else .
You 'll just have to " translate " a bit .
As a bonus , the " translation " will probably be shorter and easier .
You may even find some bits of this document useful if you start with no pre-existing operating system at all and want to boot your machine from the network .
Note 2 : This document is ( too ) long because it covers many different cases / configurations / linux distributions .
But most people will only need to read not even 1/3 of it to get the job done .
Intensive use of hyper - links and tables of contents is recommended .

Life of a Linux installer Almost all Linux installers I know work the same .
They use one of the numerous ways your PC has available to boot to load in memory two files : a Linux kernel , and an initial ( root ) filesystem containing the minimal files needed for a tiny GNU / Linux system and the actual installer program .
This very first filesystem is also located in memory ( RAM ) thanks to a technique called ... " ramdisk " .
The Linux kernel and the INITial RamDisk ( initrd ) are typically pulled from the CD or the floppys used to boot .
But they are also two relatively small files easy to download and save on the hard disk of your networked PC .
After booting , the task of the distribution installer is basically to put a whole lot of software packages on your hard disk .
These packages are also typically pulled from a CD or DVD , but if you have a high speed network connection , it is much more convenient and sometimes even faster to download them directly from the network .
Moreover , this way you download only the packages you need , as opposed to downloading a whole CD image ( so it may be even faster ) .
So , if your machine is running Windows and connected to the some GNU / Linux distribution mirror , and thanks to a tool called Loadlin or GRUB for NT you do n't need any removable media to install Linux ; you can do it without moving your hands off the keyboard .
Why did not you hear this before ?
Because the procedure detailed below is a bit more complex than " stick the CD in and press the button " , so it 's too complex for basic users .
But faster and more convenient in many cases .
There is absolutely nothing revolutionary below , actually many hackers know this already .
It is even documented in the dark corners of the installation manual of some distributions .
But since you absolutely not need to be a hacker to achieve this , I wrote this document to help any sysadmin or advanced user do it quickly and easily .
Why do this ?
your laptop does n't have a CD or a floppy drive .
your floppy drive has died ( buried in dust ) and you do not have a CD - burner / blank CD - ROM at hand
burning a CD or writing floppies is boring and takes time .
Moreover , floppies are too small ( you usually need at least two of them ) and unreliable .
And you keep losing this *% $& install CD every time .
you frequenly install Linux , and want the latest installer each time , without wasting a blank CD each time .
you can customize and test the Linux installers quickly and easily
for some people , the network is faster than a CD - ROM .
Especially considering the " medium swapping " time .
And since you 'll have to use the network anyway ( to download security updates ) why not get completely rid of all these CDs and their obsolete packages ?
you need a lot of different kernels / installers ( for different machines ) and do not want to burn a CD for each combination
your installer image can be as big as your hard disk allows it
of course your old PC does not boot from USB .
It does not even have an USB port .
Come on , transfering CDs through a network is ugly .
Be serious , simply transfer the files inside .
you want to show off
it 's fun
Preparing & downloading
The installers of some distributions provide nice graphical disk partitioning utilities , but you may prefer to prepare your disk earlier using some Windows - based disk manager .
It 's up to you and your distro .
Warning : Partitioning is really a risky operation .
You really should backup all your data off your hard disk before that .
This warning is off - topic ( you have to re-partition your disk whatever your install media is ) , but was added because of its importance and by " popular demand " .
In particular , there has been recently an infamous partitioning bug making the partition table incorrect and thus preventing you to boot Windows afterwards .
This bug is due to an incompatibility between the linux kernel version 2.6 and the partitioning tool " parted " or similar , versions less than 1.6.12 .
Have a look at this FAQ for more information .
From there : " Known major distributions having this problem are but not limited to Mandrake 10 , SUSE 9.1 , Fedora 2 . "
Now the very first thing you need to look for and download are the Linux kernel and initrd ( INITial RamDisk ) files of the target distribution .
Finding these files may take a while , since the documentation usually insists that you use a CD or floppy image instead ( that 's one of the reason I wrote this page ) .
I have compiled this information for most major distributions below .
Then you need to find out the distribution - specific , tuning options that the bootloader ( GRUB or Loadlin , see next section ) will pass to the kernel at boot time .
These options are needed to tune the kernel or the installation process to your machine or to your taste .
Sometimes none is required , sometimes the kernel will not boot your machine or the installer will not run without some of them .
There is usually some isolinux.cfg text file located next to the kernel and initrd files .
Open it : the tuning options are inside .
If you have some odd hardware that linux has a hard time to detect / initialize , you may need to add a few tuning options specific to your machine ( whether you install with a removable or not ) .
Check the BootPrompt HOWTO about these issues .
Now have a look at the distribution specifics section below to gather the relevant information and come back here .
Game over ?
At this point you should see the greetings of the installer .
From now on , just follow the regular documentation of your distribution .
Obviously the very first thing you need to do now is to configure and make the net work , in order to connect to the nearest mirror for your distribution .
The only remaining issue you may encounter is making work this brand new network interface ( yes , the one you bought without checking its Linux compatibility first ) .
Most installers allow you to load additional drivers before going on .
Use this feature to try to find and load the appropriate driver in case your network interface does not appear in the installer .
If the installer is not able to make your network interface work , an alternative is to download the ISO image of the first CD , because some installers are also able to get their stuff from a CD image on the hard disk ( check the installation manual of your distribution ) .
You do n't get the benefit of not downloading the first CD , but you still do n't need any removable media nor drive .
You should now move to the regular installation manual provided by your distribution .
In particular , you will have to decide how you boot your new GNU / Linux system ( as opposed to boot its installer ) .
If you used GRUB for NT to boot the installer , you perfectly can re-use it to permanently boot the installed system .
When your installer asks if you want to " make your system bootable " , just answer no , and carefully write down instead the location of the kernel and ( optional ) initrd image it would have configured , as well as the location of your boot partition .
Go back to Windows , and use these informations to re-configure GRUB for NT .
You are done .
I do n't want to make this document too long and off topic by providing more details about this ; all you need you know should be in the installation manual of your distribution and in GRUB 's documentation .
There are countless ways to " chainload " bootloaders .
To decide which is the best one for you , also have a look at Linux Boot Loaders Compared and at this nice NT boot process article .
Do n't forget to google too !
If " the terrorists " hate the U.S. so much , why have n't they attacked the undefended electrical and data infrastructures that animate the Great Satan ?
Why do " the terrorists " only carry out symbolic pinprick attacks that are MUCH more difficult to execute than strategic , decapitation strikes ?
Why not deliver a blow to the U.S. that would actually take it down ?
The demand for electricity to operate its expanding intelligence systems has left the high - tech eavesdropping agency on the verge of exceeding its power supply , the lifeblood of its sprawling 350 - acre Fort Meade headquarters , according to current and former intelligence officials .
Agency officials anticipated the problem nearly a decade ago as they looked ahead at the technology needs of the agency , sources said , but it was never made a priority , and now the agency 's ability to keep its operations going is threatened .
The NSA is already unable to install some costly and sophisticated new equipment , including two new supercomputers , for fear of blowing out the electrical infrastructure , they said .
At minimum , the problem could produce disruptions leading to outages and power surges at the Fort Meade headquarters , hampering the work of intelligence analysts and damaging equipment , they said .
At worst , it could force a virtual shutdown of the agency , paralyzing the intelligence operation , erasing crucial intelligence data and causing irreparable damage to computer systems -- all detrimental to the fight against terrorism .
...
Agency leaders , meanwhile , are scrambling for stopgap measures to buy time while they develop a sustainable plan .
Limitations of the electrical infrastructure in the main NSA complex and the substation serving the agency , along with growing demand in the region , prevent an immediate fix , according to current and former government officials .
We 've already seen Walmart and McDonald 's talking about sustainability ; now it 's the U.S. National Security Agency .
Sustainability of what ?
Fascism , that 's what .
Is n't it interesting that a few undefended copper cables are so critical to the operation of the NSA ?
What does this tell you about " the terrorists " ?
We always hear about how smart , how cunning , " the terrorists " are .
After all , according to legend , " the terrorists " are so smart and so cunning that they hijacked aircraft and flew them into buildings , and all the rest of that bullsh *t ... Yet , for some reason , " the terrorists " do n't seem interested in attacking the undefended support infrastructure of the U.S. National Security Agency ?!
" The terrorists " are , likewise , uninterested in taking out the undefended data infrastructures that undergird U.S. mega corporations .
A better question is :
Who benefits from the Hollywood blockbuster - style fireballs and fetishisation of victims that TV - camera terrorism facilitates ?
" The terrorists " are manufactured by the corporate state in order to deliver increasing amounts of power to the psychopaths at the top of the pyramid .
Sustainable fascism requires a constant application of psychological terror in order to frighten the populace into a numb state of acquiescence and helplessness .
This is accomplished , quite simply , by running eye catching fodder in an endless loop on the PSYOP payload delivery boxes that most people voluntarily watch for several hours per day .
This PSYOP payload forms the basis of reality for the victims / consumers of mass media .
The elite get an easy to manage prison camp as a result .
" The terrorists " do n't want to bite the hand that feeds them , by , say , shutting down all financial transaction clearing in the Western World , or plunging the largest cities in North America into darkness with tools no more complicated than shovels , wrenches , hatchets , bolt cutters and sledgehammers .
( Actually , the plunging - into - darkness part is happening without any assistance from " the terrorists " . )
Sticking hot pokers into the eyes and ears of the corporate state ( the NSA ) would n't be a sustainable practice for fascism either .
No .
Rather than striking at the strategic assets of the corporate state , " the terrorists " are tasked with creating an environment in which fascism can bloom and prosper ...
Sustainably :
I Ca n’t Believe This Worked on Me !
post # 267 — December 21 , 2006 — a Client Relations post
We all love to believe that we are very rational in our own buying , especially when it comes to purchases of important things like professional services .
Nevertheless , there are times when marketing and selling approaches that we would like to believe donâ€™t work on us , well , they actually do .
For example , this is a terrible confession , but youâ€™ve almost always got me to complete those silly questionnaireâ€™s that come in the mail if you include a dollar bill with the questionnaire .
Itâ€™s an old direct marketing technique , but just as Robert Cialdini analyzes in his justifiably famous book Influence , the â€œsense of obligationâ€  that putting that dollar in my wallet creates is enough to make me complete and return the darn questionnaire .
And thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m going to avoid the problem by throwing the dollar away , am I ?
And it will cost me more in time to send back than itâ€™s worth !
I ’m trapped with no way out !
Similarly , I hate it that Iâ€™m a sucker for the freebies that exhibitors give away at conferences .
I know , if I had more courage , I could just go and help myself to the freebie ( pens , computer flash memory , free software ) without getting into a conversation with the people staffing the booth , but it just feels rude not to enquire politely about their product or service .
Iâ€™m not saying I always end up buying , but a high percentage of the time they get my business card , and they follow up .
The darned approach works on me and I wish it didnâ€™t .
Iâ€™ll confess that Iâ€™m also a sucker for â€œextra features .â€ 
If you show me a plain vanilla option and an â€œextra special option , â€ 
Iâ€™m going to listen hard for what the latter can do for me .
I hate that I fall for it — but I do .
I hate it that I buy the â€œextra insuranceâ€  when renting a car , even though my statistical training tells me itâ€™s a stupid purchase .
They play on my insecurities , and they win .
Have any of you got confessions to make about marketing or selling tactics that worked on you that you really didnâ€™t think were going to ?
I donâ€™t just mean at the supermarket or the car showroom , but perhaps in hiring a professional provider to assist you .
Have you ever spent more than you planned to on a service provider ?
What did they do that â€ œworkedâ€ on you ?
I do n’t mean the honorable , trust - earning things that truly make you want to work with an honorable provider .
I mean the things that make you say ( as the title of this blogpost says ) : I ca n’t believe this worked on me !
A former executive of an Irvine car wax manufacturer alleges in a lawsuit that the company fired him because he had not pursued “ a Christian lifestyle ” and was n’t “ on fire for Jesus . ”
Atticus O. Firey , 34 , of Newport Beach contends Meguiar ’s Inc. committed religious discrimination when it fired him in July after nearly 10 years with the company .
Company president Barry Meguiar repeatedly urged Firey , then the chief operating officer , to attend church , the suit alleges , and told him he was “ robbing this company of the blessing of God by not being on your knees and on fire for Jesus . ”
Meguiar , who is host of a cable TV and radio program called “ Car Crazy , ” did not return a call seeking comment .
His lawyer , Richard Ruben , said religion had nothing to do with Firey ’s firing .
He said the company ’s senior management decided to terminate Firey because his job performance was sub-par , with a management style that was “ demeaning ” and “ negative . ”
“ The company was suffering economically , and Mr. Firey was not showing up at the office and was only sporadically attending to his duties , ” Ruben said .

He added that the company ’s management includes “ people of all religions ” and characterized the lawsuit as a “ publicity stunt . ”
He said he expected a judge to throw out the suit , because Firey had previously agreed to submit to arbitration , rather than go to the courts , should such a dispute arise .
The suit , filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court , says Meguiar sat in Firey ’s office and read to him from the Bible , thrust Christian books on him and demanded he read them and forced managers to attend prayer meetings .
When Firey asked about a promised bonus , the suit says , Meguiar said he would not give it to him until Firey joined a Christian church .
Confronted with his behavior , the suit says , Meguiar said he had the right to manage the business , which has some 300 employees , by the tenets of Pentecostal Christianity .
The company hired and fired employees based on religion , the suit says , with Meguiar tutoring executives on how to interview prospective employees in a way that elicited information on their religious beliefs .
In one case , Meguiar asked a candidate whether he thought he would go to heaven or hell if he died today , the suit says .
When the candidate said he was a Catholic trying to lead a virtuous life , the suit alleges , Meguiar replied that merely “ being a good person and following a works - oriented religion ” would not save him from hell .

Firey , who is Meguiar ’s former son- in - law , alleges in his suit that in another instance , his boss tried to block the hiring of an employee because she was living “ in sin as a fornicator ” with her boyfriend .
“ If there were two candidates and one was a Christian but had lesser skills than a non-Christian , Mr. Meguiar would pick the Christian , ” the suit alleges .
In one case , the suit says , Meguiar blocked the hire because he was not “ Christian ” and accepted a weaker candidate who went to church .
Stuart Jasper , Firey ’s attorney , said the lawsuit was necessary because the company had “ reneged on its obligation to pick an arbitration service . ”
The lawsuit asks for unspecified damages and asks the court both to compel arbitration and to prevent the company from continuing the alleged discriminatory practices .
Jon Gunnemann , a professor of social ethics at the School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta , said all companies have a “ corporate culture , ” often with powerful implicit signals -- such as what kind of jokes are acceptable -- that define their boundaries .
Advertisement
“ You learn very quickly what can get you hired and what can get you fired , ” he said .
“ Almost every business does have a corporate culture which functions not much differently from explicit religious belief .
It ’s not easy to say why the one is all right and the other is not . ”

This more or less constitutes a smoking gun
Michael Schlesinger
Researchers from the UK's National Oceanography Centre say currents derived from the Gulf Stream are weakening , bringing less heat north .
Their conclusions , reported in the scientific journal Nature , are based on 50 years of Atlantic observations .
They say that European political leaders need to plan for a future which may be cooler rather than warmer .
The findings come from a British research project called Rapid , which aims to gather evidence relating to potentially fast climatic change in Europe .
Atmospheric radiator
The north Atlantic conveyor
Enlarge Image
As the north - eastern branch flows , it gives off heat to the atmosphere , which in turn warms European land .
" It 's like a radiator giving its heat to the atmosphere , " said Harry Bryden from the National Oceanography Centre ( NOC ) at Britain 's Southampton University .
" The heat it gives off is roughly equivalent to the output of a million power stations , " he told reporters .
By the time it reaches the northern latitudes around Greenland and Iceland , the water has cooled so much that it sinks towards the ocean floor , a process known as " overturning " .
This cooler water heads south , forming the return stream of a conveyor belt .
The complete cycle sees warm water coming northwards on the ocean 's surface , and the cold water returning hundreds or thousands of metres underwater .
The Rapid team monitored at roughly 25 degrees north
The NOC researchers concentrated on the colder water flowing south ; and they found that over the last half century , these currents have changed markedly .
" We saw a 30 % decline in the southwards flow of deep cold water , " said Harry Bryden .
" And so the summary is that in 2004 , we have a larger circulating current [ in the tropical Atlantic ] and less overturning . "
And less heat then delivered to European shores .
First evidence
Computer models of climate have regularly predicted that the North Atlantic conveyor may well reduce in intensity or even turn off altogether , a concept that was pushed beyond credence in the Hollywood blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow .
Less salinity means a lower density ; the waters then cannot sink , so the conveyor weakens .
Computer models have predicted that if it turned off completely , Europe would cool by perhaps four to six degrees Celsius .
Commenting in Nature , Detlef Quadfasel from the University of Hamburg writes that the NOC experiments provide " ... the first observational evidence that such a decrease of the oceanic overturning circulation is well underway . "
Natural variation
The NOC researchers admit that the case is not yet proven .
The analysis involves only five sets of measurements , made in 1957 , 1981 , 1992 and 1998 from ships , and in 2004 from a line of research buoys tethered to the ocean floor .
Even if the trend is confirmed by further data , it could be down to natural variability rather than human - induced global temperature change .
" This issue of variability is very important , " said Harry Bryden , " and we do not have any good grasp of it .
In 2004 buoys were deployed from ships onto tethers
Michael Schlesinger from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , a leading expert in models of climate and ocean circulation , believes that even with these caveats , the NOC team has probably come up with a link to human - induced climate change .
" The variability question is the right one to ask , " he told the BBC News website , " but the phasing is wrong . "
A decade ago Professor Schlesinger showed that the North Atlantic conveyor undergoes a natural 70 - year cycle of strengthening and weakening .
" The Bryden measurements are out of phase with this cycle , " he said .
" The natural cycle had a northern cooling until the mid-1970s and a warming afterwards , and here we see an apparent cooling . "
He is also convinced by other details of the NOC measurements showing that the changes in the southerly underwater flow have occurred at great depths .
" The slowing down of the southward return occurs between 3,000 and 5,000 m ; and this more or less constitutes a ' smoking gun ' , " he said .
Choosing policies
So what does all this mean for European weather ?
Will it necessarily get colder - or will the apparent recent trend of warmer summers continue ?
Models can predict variability , but we think we ought to go out and measure it
Harry Bryden
But climate is a complex phenomenon ; other factors could conspire , even so , to produce a net warming .
" The UK government is looking , in terms of mitigating climate change and adapting to it , at a warming scenario , " said Phil Newton of the UK's Natural Environment Research Council , which funds the Rapid investigators .
" You might now be asking what sort of mitigation and adaptation they should be looking for . "
To answer this question , the Rapid team plans to continue its measurements in the next few years .
Its buoys remain in place , and ships can go to gather their data as often as finance allows .
The findings will have resonance beyond the shores of the UK and Europe , as extra heat left circulating around the tropical Atlantic could have major impacts on weather systems in Africa , the Caribbean and Central America .

The traditional way of dividing a cake is the ' cut and choose ' approach , where one person cuts the cake in two and the other chooses a half , write Professor Michael Jones and colleagues from
While this ensures both people get the same sized portion , it does n't necessarily mean they are equally happy .
For example , one may like chocolate icing , sprinkles or cream more than the other .
Surplus procedure
To even this out , the researchers propose people tell a referee how much they value certain qualities of a cake .
The referee then uses these weighted values to calculate where to cut the cake .
In an ideal world , both parties would get 100 % of what they want .
But in reality there 's a compromise .
Jones says his team 's algorithms ensure that both parties get about 65 % of what they want , based on the principle of giving each person at least 50 % of the cake plus the surplus as they value it .
The catch is that the system depends on honesty and requires a referee and a calculator .
The surplus procedure system can be used for two or three people , Jones says , but does n't work quite as well for three or more .
He says the method can also be applied to other heterogeneous and divisible items , like dividing land or deciding how much rent each flatmate pays .

" If you really wanted to sell this to a 10 year old , they would n't go for it , They 'd still think the other piece is better . "
He says a square cake , for example , can be cut into five fairly by using the equation that says the area of a triangle equals the length of its base times its height , divided by two .
The cake can't be cut into equal squares because there will only be four pieces .
And it can't be cut into parallel pieces because the pieces on the edge will have more icing ( if the cake is iced around the edge and not just on top ) .
The answer is to cut the cake in equally sized wedges .
" If the cake has a perimeter of 50 centimetres , you start at one corner and measure 10 centimetres and make a mark , then you go around until you 're back to the beginning and you have five marks .
" From those marks you cut through the middle and those wedges will be exactly one fifth . "
Eggs and sandwiches
Polster says applying surplus procedure to cakes is n't the first time maths has been used to share food .
The 'egg yolk ' theory describes how best to divide a fried egg into pieces with an equal portion of yolk and white .
And he says the ' ham sandwich ' theory makes sure you can cut a sandwich and get equal amounts of ham , lettuce and bread .

Faith in a higher being is as old as humanity itself .
But what sparked the Divine Idea ?
Did our earliest ancestors gain some evolutionary advantage through their shared religious feelings ?
In these extracts from his latest book , Robert Winston ponders the biggest question of them all
The Dolley Pond Church of God With Signs Following was founded in Tennessee in 1909 by one George Went Hensley .
This former bootlegger took to the pulpit in a rural Pentecostalist community in Grasshopper Valley .
One Sabbath , while he was preaching a fiery sermon , some of the congregation dumped a large box of rattlesnakes into the pulpit ( history does not record whether they were angry or just bored ) .
Without missing a beat , in mid-sentence , Hensley bent down , picked up a 3 ft - long specimen of this most venomous of snakes , and held it wriggling high above his head .
Unharmed , he exhorted his congregation to follow suit , quoting the words of Christ : " And these signs will follow those who believe ... in my Name ... they will take up serpents . "
News of Hensley 's sermon spread through Grasshopper Valley ; others joined him in handling snakes , and the practice caught on .
There have since been around 120 deaths from snakebite in these churches , but most of the congregants tend to refuse medical help if they are bitten , preferring to believe that divine intervention will be more efficacious .
Sadly , Hensley himself perished from a snakebite in 1955 , and shortly afterwards the US government wisely acted to prevent the practice - although it is still legal in parts of the States .
Today , snake - handling continues mostly in small communities in rural areas of Tennessee and Kentucky , as well as pockets in other southern states .
Participants feel that " the spirit of God " comes upon them as they open the boxes containing the snakes .
Often lifting three or four of them up simultaneously in one hand , holding them high and allowing the creatures to wind around their arms and bodies , they praise God ecstatically .
To many of us , religious or not , this type of activity seems little short of outright lunacy .
And it 's certainly the case that religion and mental ill - health have long been linked .
The disturbed individual who believes himself to be Christ , or to receive messages from God , is something of a cliche in our society .
Ever since Sigmund Freud , many people have associated religiosity with neurosis and mental illness .
Many years ago , a team of researchers at the department of anthropology at the University of Minnesota decided to put this association to the test .
They studied certain fringe religious groups , such as fundamentalist Baptists , Pentecostalists and the snake - handlers of West Virginia , to see if they showed the particular type of psychopathology associated with mental illness .
Members of mainstream Protestant churches from a similar social and financial background provided a good control group for comparison .
Some of the wilder fundamentalists prayed with what can only be described as great and transcendental ecstasy , but there was no obvious sign of any particular psychopathology among most of the people studied .
After further analysis , however , there appeared a tendency to what can only be described as mental instability in one particular group .
The study was blinded , so that most of the research team involved with questionnaires did not have access to the final data .
When they were asked which group they thought would show the most disturbed psychopathology , the whole team identified the snake - handlers .
But when the data were revealed , the reverse was true : there was more mental illness among the conventional Protestant churchgoers - the " extrinsically " religious - than among the fervently committed .
A Harvard psychologist named Gordon Allport did some key research in the 1950s on various kinds of human prejudice and came up with a definition of religiosity that is still in use today .
He suggested that there were two types of religious commitment - extrinsic and intrinsic .
Extrinsic religiosity he defined as religious self - centredness .
Such a person goes to church or synagogue as a means to an end - for what they can get out of it .
They might go to church to be seen , because it is the social norm in their society , conferring respectability or social advancement .
Going to church ( or synagogue ) becomes a social convention .
Allport thought that intrinsic religiosity was different .
He identified a group of people who were intrinsically religious , seeing their religion as an end in itself .
They tended to be more deeply committed ; religion became the organising principle of their lives , a central and personal experience .
In support of his research , Allport found that prejudice was more common in those individuals who scored highly for extrinsic religion .
The evidence generally is that intrinsic religiosity seems to be associated with lower levels of anxiety and stress , freedom from guilt , better adjustment in society and less depression .
On the other hand , extrinsic religious feelings - where religion is used as a way to belong to and prosper within a group - seem to be associated with increased tendencies to guilt , worry and anxiety .
It is possible that strong levels of belief in God , gods , spirits or the supernatural might have given our ancestors considerable comforts and advantages .
Many anthropologists and social theorists do indeed take the view that religion emerged out of a sense of uncertainty and bewilderment - explaining misfortune or illness , for example , as the consequences of an angry God , or reassuring us that we live on after death .
Rituals would have given us a comforting , albeit illusory , sense that we can control what is in fact ultimately beyond our control - the weather , illness , attacks by predators or other human groups .
However , it is equally plausible that the Divine Idea would have been of little use in our prehistoric rough - and - tumble existence .
Life on the savannah may have been in the open air , but it was no picnic .
Early humans would have been constantly on the lookout for predators to be avoided , such as wolves and sabre - tooth tigers ; hunting or scavenging would be a continual necessity to ensure sufficient food ; and the men were probably constantly fighting among each other to ensure that they could have sex with the best - looking girl ( or boy ) or choose the most tender piece of meat from the carcass .
Why would it be necessary , in the daily scramble to stay alive , to make time for such an indulgent pursuit as religion ?
Richard Dawkins , our best - known Darwinist and a ferocious critic of organised religion , notes that religion seems to be , on the face of it , a cost rather than a benefit : " Religious behaviour in bipedal apes occupies large quantities of time .
It devours huge resources .
A medieval cathedral consumed hundreds of man-centuries in its building .
Sacred music and devotional paintings largely monopolised medieval and Renaissance talent .
Thousands , perhaps millions , of people have died , often accepting torture first , for loyalty to one religion against a scarcely distinguishable alternative .
Devout people have died for their gods , killed for them , fasted for them , endured whipping , undertaken a lifetime of celibacy , and sworn themselves to asocial silence for the sake of religion . "
It seems at first glance as if Dawkins is arguing that religion is an evolutionary disaster area .
Religious belief , it seems , would be unlikely , on its own merits , to have slipped through the net of natural selection .
But maybe that interpretation of what Dawkins is saying neglects some of the further benefits that religion might well offer in the human quest for survival and security .
In his book Darwin 's Cathedral , David Sloan Wilson , professor of biology and anthropology at Binghamton University in New York state , says that religiosity emerged as a " useful " genetic trait because it had the effect of making social groups more unified .
The communal nature of religion certainly would have given groups of hunter - gatherers a stronger sense of togetherness .
This produced a leaner , meaner survival machine , a group that was more likely to be able to defend a waterhole , or kill more antelope , or capture their opponents ' daughters .
The better the religion was at producing an organised and disciplined group , the more effective they would have been at staying alive , and hence at passing their genes on to the next generation .
This is what we mean by " natural selection " : adaptations which help survival and reproduction get passed down through the genes .
Taking into account the additional suggestion , from various studies of twins , that we may have an inherited disposition towards religious belief , is there any evidence that the Divine Idea might be carried in our genes ?
While nobody has identified any gene for religion , there are certainly some candidate genes that may influence human personality and confer a tendency to religious feelings .
Some of the genes likely to be involved are those which control levels of different chemicals called neurotransmitters in the brain .
Dopamine is one neurotransmitter which we know plays a powerful role in our feelings of well - being ; it may also be involved in the sense of peace that humans feel during some spiritual experiences .
One particular gene involved in dopamine action - incidentally , by no means the only one that has been studied in this way - is the dopamine D4 receptor gene ( DRD4 ) .
In some people , because of slight changes in spelling of the DNA sequences ( a so - called polymorphism ) making up this gene , the gene may be more biologically active , and this could be partly responsible for a religious bent .
And it is easy to suggest a mechanism by which religious beliefs could help us to pass on our genes .
Greater cohesion and stricter moral codes would tend to produce more cooperation , and more cooperation means that hunting and gathering are likely to bring in more food .
In turn , full bellies mean greater strength and alertness , greater immunity against infection , and offspring who develop and become independent more swiftly .
Members of the group would also be more likely to take care of each other , especially those who are sick or injured .
Therefore - in the long run - a shared religion appears to be evolutionarily advantageous , and natural selection might favour those groups with stronger religious beliefs .
But this is not the whole story .
Although religion might be useful in developing a solid moral framework - and enforcing it - we can quite easily develop moral intuitions without relying on religion .
Psychologist Eliot Turiel observed that even three - and four - year - olds could distinguish between moral rules ( for example , not hitting someone ) and conventional rules ( such as not talking when the teacher is talking ) .
Furthermore , they could understand that a moral breach , such as hitting someone , was wrong whether you had been told not to do it or not , whereas a conventional breach , such as talking in class , was wrong only if it had been expressly forbidden .
They were also clearly able to distinguish between prudential rules ( such as not leaving your notebook next to the fireplace ) and moral rules .
This would suggest that there is a sort of " morality module " in the brain that is activated at an early age .
Evidence from neuroscience would back this up , to a degree .
In my last book , The Human Mind , I noted that certain brain areas become activated when we engage in cooperation with others , and that these areas are associated with feelings of pleasure and reward .
It also seems that certain areas of the brain are brought into action in situations where we feel empathy and forgiveness .
So religion does not seem to be produced by a specific part of our psychological make - up .
Is it more likely , then , that religious ideas are something of an accidental by - product created by other parts of our basic blueprint , by processes deep in the unconscious mind that evolved to help us survive ?
Shared beliefs
What identical twins teach us about religion
In the United States during the 50s and 60s , it was considered best to separate at birth twins who were to be adopted .
This led to a number of these children being brought up by families who did not even know that their adopted baby had a twin ; and sadly , the children themselves were brought up intotal ignorance of their " lost " twin .
Identical twins , of course , are formed in the uterus by the embryo splitting ; so identical twins have exactly the same DNA .
Non-identical twins - growing from two separate eggs fertilised by different sperm - do not have identical genes , but will just share many general aspects of their genetic inheritance , as do any other brothers or sisters in one family unit .
Thomas Bouchard , professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota , recognized that these twins , if compared with each other as they grew up , would provide an important way of measuring genetic and environmental influences .
His groundbreaking work in the 1980s and 90s gave rise to some extraordinary insights into which aspects of the human condition are more likely to be due to nature , and which to nurture .
In one study , Bouchard concentrated on 72 sets of twins who had reached adulthood .
He first established which of the twins ( 35 sets in all ) were genuinely identical by genetic testing .
These were then invited to complete personality tests .
Such questionnaires , which are widely used by psychologists , pose questions in the form of statements , to which the respondents have to rate their level of agreement on a scale of one to eight .
The following is a small sample of the many statements relating to religion :
· I enjoy reading about my religion .
· My religion is important to me because it answers many questions about the meaning of life .
· It is important to me to spend time in prayer and thought .
· It does n't matter to me what I believe as long as I am good .
· I pray mainly to gain relief and protection .
· I go to my ( church , synagogue , temple ) to spend time with my friends .
· Although I am religious , I do n't let it affect my daily life .
When Bouchard and his team compared the answers to these and other personality questions , they found strong statistical evidence that identical and non-identical twins tended to answer differently .
If one identical twin showed evidence of religious thinking or behaviour , it was much more likely that his or her twin would answer similarly .
Non-identical twins , as might be expected ( they are , after all , related ) , showed some similarities of thinking , but not nearly to the same degree .
Crucially , the degree of religiosity was not strongly related to the environment in which the twin was brought up .
Even if one identical twin had been brought up in an atheist family and the other in a religious Catholic household , they would still tend to show the same kind of religious feelings , or lack of them .
Work by several other scientists has inclined to confirm Bouchard 's findings .
One study , conducted by an international team at the Institute of Psychiatry in London under Dr Hans Eysenck , looked at information from twins living in the UK and Australia .
The researchers found that attitudes to Sabbath observance , divine law , church authority and the truth of the Bible showed greater congruity in identical rather than non-identical twins - again supporting the idea of a genetic influence .
Bouchard has consistently found in many of his studies that intrinsic religiosity - which seems to incorporate a notion of spirituality - is much more likely to be inherited .
Extrinsic religiosity tends to be a product of a person 's environment and direct parental influence .
Bouchard also found that tendencies towards fundamentalism were also rather more likely to be inherited .
It is of some interest , too , that , in the populations that Bouchard and his colleagues have studied , women tend to have inherited rather more religious attitudes than men .

My comments on " Hitting the High Notes "
Two months ago , Joel Spolsky published an essay entitled Hitting the High Notes in which he uses the metaphor of vocalists to explain something about software developers .
In a nutshell , I would paraphrase his article like this :
Great software products do n't happen without the very best software developers , just as certain musical performances simply do n't happen unless the performers have someone who can hit the high notes .
These " peaks " in performance are the result of certain individuals with extraordinary talent , and there is no substitute .
You can't reach these peaks through the sum of talent levels .
Your opera score says the tenor needs to be able to hit a high B . Adding baritones wo n't help increase the vocal range .
It just makes the group louder .
Similarly , adding mediocre programmers does n't increase the talent range to the point where they can create something insanely great .
I really like this metaphor , but it 's a two - sided coin .
High notes are amazing , but harmony is powerful .
I am not disagreeing with Joel 's metaphor .
Rather , I like his metaphor so much that I want to finish it .
Joel spoke of individual talent in terms of a soloist .
I want to speak of team talent in terms of a choir .
A serious choir
Mention of the word " choir " can conjure up lots of different images .
Perhaps the first thing that popped into your mind was your child 's second grade holiday program .
Those events are special memories and the reason why we buy camcorders , but that 's not really what I 'm talking about .
Maybe when you think of a choir you think of your church choir which does a special song on the fifth Sunday and where the average age of the women in the alto section is 92 .
I think it 's great that churches create opportunities for people to sing , but that 's not really what I 'm talking about .
I 'm talking about a serious choir , which is a choir that could be described like this :
All of the choir members had to audition to get in , and lots of people did n't make the cut .
The director is formally trained .
All of the voices start and stop at exactly the same instant .
When the choir is singing softly , there is no less intensity than when they are singing loudly .
When they perform What Child is This ?
at their holiday concert , nobody takes a breath in the middle of a line .
( In the proper singing of that piece , the singers are allowed to breathe four times per stanza , not eight . )
takes a breath in the middle of a line .
( In the proper singing of that piece , the singers are allowed to breathe four times per stanza , not eight . )
The people in the audience are not wearing jeans .
If you have never heard a truly excellent choir , I highly recommend that you invest the time .
Most universities have at least one serious choir .
Go listen to their next concert .
The experience can be very moving .
You might be amazed .
Anyway , back to the point .
Like I said , Joel 's metaphor is a two sided coin :
The " high notes " side of this coin speaks of what you cannot obtain through addition .
You can not get the range of a soprano by adding several altos .
A really outstanding programmer is ten times better than an average one , but you can't get the same results by hiring ten average programmers .
The " choir " side of this coin speaks of what you cannot obtain without addition .
The most talented vocalist can't sing a chord .
In music , there are things only a choir can do .
In software , there are things only a team can do .
The most obvious thing here is simply the benefit of size .
Even Fred Brooks would agree that there is usually a positive correlation between team size and its production capacity .
Suppose you have two teams , one with 50 people and one with just a single person working alone .
Hand each team the spec to develop a new CAD system .
No matter how many high notes the lonely coder can reach , I do n't think he 's going to finish first .
A plurality of programmers offers other benefits as well .
Things like pair programming , brainstorming , and code reviews all make sense only in the context of a team .
Okay -- enough stating the obvious .
We all agree on the value of good teams .
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few ...
For a soloist , hitting the high notes is an essential skill .
In a choir , the essential skill is the ability to blend .
Some of the most gifted soloists just do n't have the stuff it takes to fit in a really great choir .
Sometimes , they can't blend .
Their voice is the problem .
A really distinctive voice is an asset to a soloist but is a disadvantage in a choir .
They can't blend because that 's just the way their voice is .
More commonly , they wo n't blend .
Participation in a serious choir requires a generosity that simply is not present in everyone .
Choir members do n't get individual accolades or fame .
Soloists do .
It happens in music , in sports and in software development .
The super - talented people are often the very same people who have trouble blending into a team .
Serious choirs ( or software teams ) are successful when they are built with people who genuinely want success for the concert ( or the product ) more than they want success for themselves .
So are you saying we should forget about the high notes ?
Certainly not .
I am not suggesting that you hire " mediocre programmers " .
By all means , continue to look for people who can hit the high notes .
But I daresay Joel would agree that any team built exclusively with that criterion is likely to develop other problems .
Be it a choir or a team , you want every member to be at the highest possible talent level .
But the people on your team have to be willing and able to blend .
Two kinds of talent
So Joel is right : Creative technical genius ( the ability to hit the high notes ) is a critical ingredient when building insanely great products .
But it 's not the only one .
In every choir I have seen , there are certain vocalists which surface as leaders .
Their leadership is visible only to the other members of the choir , never to the audience .
As an example , let 's consider Jane , a soprano who sings in the third row of the Fog Creek choir .
During rehearsals , Jane sings her part confidently and with full voice , because she is highly talented and has the ability to " sight read " the musical score .
The sopranos near Jane are probably talented as well , but to at least some degree , their confidence is being increased by listening to Jane .
At concert time , the audience can't tell that Jane is any different from the rest .
She is n't hitting notes any higher than the other sopranos .
She is blending , just as she should be .
Is Jane one of those vocalists who can hit the high notes ?
Probably .
Maybe not .
Either way , she is applying a talent which is just as valuable in the context of a choir :
She makes everyone around her better .
The same effect is visible in software .
Great developers do n't just make the product better -- they make everybody around them better .
So when hiring developers , always ask both questions :
The " high notes " question :
How much talent does this developer have to help make our product great ?
How much talent does this developer have to help make our great ?
The " choir " question :
How much talent does this developer have to help make our team great ?
If you only ask the choir question , you might end up with a group of highly cooperative people who work very well together as a team .
But they never create anything worthy of buzz .
Instead of high notes , they produce a peaceful chord as they build boring products that nobody wants .
If you only ask the high notes question , you might end up with a group of highly talented people who will reach great peaks as individuals .
But they never really work together .
Instead of harmony , they produce noise as they build poorly integrated products that draw attention but not users .
Sun Microsystems , the maker of server computers , reported a fourth - quarter loss yesterday on costs related to job cuts and said demand for new products raised sales .
The net loss was $ 301 million , or 9 cents a share , in contrast to a profit of $ 50 million , or 1 cent a share , in the period a year earlier .
Sun , based in Santa Clara , Calif. , said sales rose 29 percent , to $ 3.83 billion .
The chief executive , Jonathan I. Schwartz , presiding over results for the first time since taking that position April 24 , is cutting as many as 5,000 workers this year to help reverse five years of losses .
Sun updated its storage devices and servers , computers used to run corporate networks , to help reclaim market share lost to rivals .
“ The new product cycle is driving a return to growth , ” said Brent Bracelin , an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in Portland , Ore .

The first public revelation of the earliest continuous Semitic text ever deciphered has taken place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
Spell from the Egyptian pyramid text states in a Semitic language , but written in hieroglyphics : " Mother snake , mother snake says mucus - mucus . "
( Image courtesy of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem )
The presentation was made by Prof. Richard Steiner , professor of Semitic languages and literature at Yeshiva University in New York , in a lecture entitled " Proto - Canaanite Spells in the Pyramid Texts : a First Look at the History of Hebrew in the Third Millennium B.C.E . "
The lecture was sponsored by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in cooperation with the Hebrew University and the World Union of Jewish Studies .
Prof . Steiner , a past fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University and a member of the Academy of the Hebrew Language , has deciphered a number of Semitic texts in various Egyptian scripts over the past 25 years .
In his Hebrew University lecture , he provided the interpretation for Semitic passages in Egyptian texts that were discovered more than a century ago , inscribed on the subterranean walls of the pyramid of King Unas at Saqqara in Egypt .
The pyramid dates from the 24th century B.C.E. , but Egyptologists agree that the texts are older .
The dates proposed for them range from the 25th to the 30th centuries B.C.E .
No continuous Semitic texts from this period have ever been deciphered before .
The passages , serpent spells written in hieroglyphic characters , had puzzled scholars who tried to read them as if they were ordinary Egyptian texts .
In August , 2002 , Prof .
Steiner received an email message from Robert Ritner , professor of Egyptology at the University of Chicago , asking whether any of them could be Semitic .
" I immediately
recognized the Semitic words for ' mother snake , ' " said Steiner .
" Later it became clear that the surrounding spells , composed in Egyptian rather than Semitic , also speak of the mother snake , and that the Egyptian and Semitic texts elucidate each other . "
Although written in Egyptian characters , the texts turned out to be composed in the Semitic language spoken by the Canaanites in the third millennium B.C.E. , a very archaic form of the languages later known as Phoenician and Hebrew .
The Canaanite priests of the ancient city of Byblos , in present - day Lebanon , provided these texts to the kings of Egypt .
The port city of Byblos was of vital importance for the ancient Egyptians .
It was from there that they imported timber for construction and resin for mummification .
The new discovery shows that they also imported magical spells to protect royal mummies against poisonous snakes that were thought to understand Canaanite .
Although the
Egyptians viewed their culture as far superior to that of their neighbors , their morbid fear of snakes made them open to the borrowing of Semitic magic .
" This finding should be of great interest to cultural historians , " said Prof.
Steiner .
" Linguists , too , will be interested in these texts .
They show that Proto - Canaanite , the common ancestor of Phoenician , Moabite , Ammonite and Hebrew , existed already in the third millennium B.C.E as a language distinct from Aramaic , Ugaritic and the other Semitic languages .
And they provide the first direct evidence for the pronunciation of Egyptian in this early period . "
The texts will also be important to biblical scholars , since they shed light on several rare words in the Bible , he said .
" This is a sensational discovery , " said Moshe Bar - Asher , Bialik Professor of Hebrew Language at the Hebrew University and president of the Academy of the Hebrew Language .
" It is the earliest attestation of a Semitic language , in general , and Proto - Canaanite , in particular . "

A one - sentence overview of the poster concept
A large - format poster is a big piece of paper or image on a wall - mounted monitor featuring a short title , an introduction to your burning question , an overview of your novel experimental approach , your amazing results in graphical form , some insightful discussion of aforementioned results , a listing of previously published articles that are important to your research , and some brief acknowledgement of the tremendous assistance and financial support conned from others — if all text is kept to a minimum ( 500 - 1000 words ) , a person could fully read your poster in 5 - 10 minutes .
Downloadable templates
Below are templates that can be used to make a meeting poster .
Just download , adjust the dimensions ( if you need to ) , and start typing .
You can , of course , also change background color , text box color , font , etc .
The templates are just starting points that can save you a few hours of fussing over the basics .
1. Horizontal template with results arena
This layout gives a lot of central , visible space to the results and demotes less important sections ( Literature cited , Acknowledgements , Further information ) to the bottom portion of the poster .
Download ( PPT file ) .
2. Horizontal template with big central column
If you prefer a more traditional layout ( just columns ) but still like the big central area for results , use this Powerpoint file ( or emulate the design ) .
3. Horizontal template for humanities
This template ( PPT ) is just a modification to illustrate that you can rename your sections to fit your discipline and tastes .
I ’ve tweaked it to address two questions but you can modify it however you want .
4. Portrait template
I hate portrait layout for posters but if you ’re forced to use one , here ’s a template ( PPT ) .
I ’ve opted for a larger central column because your results are likely to contain charts or tables , and those do n’t look good when overly shrunken .
The photograph below illustrates why portrait layout is often bad for large - formate posters : a big chunk of the poster real estate is below a viewer ’s field of vision so you need to stoop to fully read .
If you are in charge of a poster session , please read my plea about this problem .
What to put in each section
Below are some rough guidelines on what to include in each section of a scientific poster and how to pitch that content .
The word - count guesses are for a poster that is approximately 3 x 4′ , so adjust accordingly if your poster is a different size .
Names of the section headings are somewhat flexible , too , especially if you ’re not crafting a science poster .
Title
Should briefly convey the interesting issue , the general experimental approach , and the system ( e.g. , organism ) ; needs to be catchy in order to reel in passersby who are trying to avoid boring interactions , a real danger at conferences just like in the real world .
[ approximately 1 - 2 lines ]
Abstract
Do not include an abstract on a poster ( a poster is an abstract of your research , so having two summaries is a waste of valuable poster space ) .
Some meetings require an abstract , of course , and if that ’s the case be as brief as possible .
But if you can get away with it , just omit the section — there are rarely poster police at conferences , and they ’re not going to tase you if your poster lacks an abstract .
Introduction
Write this section to target an intelligent person who is not in your field .
Assume they do n’t know your study organism at all and assume they are predisposed to find your topic unimportant .
E.g. , if you ’re an astronomer , imagine a visitor who has a degree in biology or mathematics .
Quickly ( first sentence or two ) get your viewer interested in the issue or question that drove you to take up the project in the first place .
Use the absolute minimum of background information , definitions , and acronyms ( all of which are boring ) .
Place your issue in the context of published , primary literature .
Pitch an interesting , novel hypothesis , then describe ( briefly ) the experimental approach that can test your hypothesis .
Please note that “ X has never been studied before ” or “ my mentor gave me this project ” are lame reasons for doing something , even if true .
Also note : unlike a manuscript for a journal , the introduction of a poster is a wonderful place to display a photograph or illustration that visually communicates some aspect of your research question .
A nice image can draw people in even if you look boring or have a boring poster title .
Keep length to approximately 200 words .
Materials and methods
Briefly describe experimental equipment and procedure , but not with the detail used for a manuscript .
Use figures and flow charts to illustrate experimental design if possible .
Include a photograph or labeled drawing of organism or setup .
Mention statistical analyses that were used and how they allowed you to address hypothesis .
Keep length to approximately 200 words .
Results
First , mention whether your experiment procedure actually worked ( e.g. , “ 90 % of the birds survived the brainectomy ” ) .
In same paragraph , briefly describe qualitative and descriptive results ( e.g. , “ surviving birds appeared to be lethargic and had difficulty locating seeds ” ) to give a more personal tone to your poster .
In second paragraph , begin presentation of data analysis that more specifically addresses your hypothesis .
Refer to supporting charts or images .
Provide engaging figure legends that could stand on their own ( i.e. , could convey some point to reader if viewer skipped all other sections , which they will do ) .
Opt for figures over tables whenever possible .
This is always the largest section ( except if you have no data ) .
Keep length to approximately 200 words ( not counting figure legends ) .
Conclusions
Remind the reader , without sounding like you are reminding the reader , of the major result and quickly state whether your hypothesis was supported .
Try to convince the visitor why the outcome is interesting ( assume they ’ve skipped the Introduction ) .
State the relevance of your findings to other published work .
Add relevance to real organisms in the real world .
Add sentence on future directions of research .
Keep length to approximately 200 words .
Literature cited
Follow format described by your main society exactly .
Grammar and typography police at conferences will find even minor infractions .
Acknowledgments
Thank individuals for specific contributions ( equipment donation , statistical advice , laboratory assistance , comments on earlier versions of the poster ) .
Mention who has provided funding .
Do not list people ’s titles ( e.g. , write Colin Purrington not Dr Purrington ) .
Also include in this section disclosures for any conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment ( more info ) .
If you have a lot of conflicts , put them all in a Conflicts section .
Keep length to approximately 40 words .
Further information
If you have n’t botched the content and tone , some visitors will want to know more about your research , so provide your e-mail address , your web site address , or perhaps a URL where they can download a PDF version of the poster or relevant data .
If you provide a URL , format it so it ’s not blued or underlined .
Full disclosure : I made up this section , so if your mentor thinks it ’s silly , that ’s why .
Keep length to approximately 20 words .
DOs and DON’Ts
Below are some tips to avoid producing a terrible poster .
Please see this post for an example of a terrible poster .
The number one mistake is to make a poster too wordy .
Aim for 1000 words or less .
That might mean 700 words in paragraph form ( body text ) , plus 300 words in the legends of all your figures and tables .
Below is an example poster that has almost 2000 words , 1000 too many .
The second - most common mistake is related to the first : a failure to maintain a pleasing amount of white space around text boxes and figures .
A cramped poster is hard to read , and the brain simply cannot effectively process the information provided , regardless of how amazing it is .
Avoid titles with colons if you can : they are overused .
If you absolutely must have a coloned title , just be sure it does n’t force you to spill onto a third line .
Format the title in sentence case ( # 1 , below ) so that capitalization and italicization are preserved in trade names , Latin binomials , gene names , allele names , etc .
For example , title case ( # 2 below ) and all caps ( # 3 below ) obscure such information .

Use a non-serif font ( e.g. , Helvetica ) for title and headings and a serif font ( e.g. , Palatino ) for body text .
Serif - style fonts are much easier to read at smaller font sizes ( that ’s why novels are rarely set with Helvetica and the like ) .
Do not add bullets to section headings .
The use of a bolded , larger font is sufficient for demarcating sections .
The width of text boxes should be approximately 45 - 65 characters .
Lines that are shorter or longer are harder to read quickly .
Do n’t vary the width of text boxes ( it ’s visually distracting ) .
Whenever possible , use lists of sentences rather than blocks of text .
Use italics instead of underlining .
Underlining draws too much attention to a word .
When using acronyms and numbers ( e.g. , ATP , 42 ) within the body of text , scale down the font size by a couple of points so that their sizes do n’t overpower the lowercase text .
Use of “ small caps ” will sometimes do the trick , but this effect varies with different fonts and with different software .
Set line spacing manually to make sure spacing is uniform .
Doing this is critical if you have used super - or sub - scripted text .
If you do n’t , only some lines will have extra space , and that would be visually distracting .
Do not trust the tab button to insert the correct amount of space when you are indenting a paragraph ( the default is usually too big ) .
Set the tab amount manually , with the ruler feature .
And never , ever use spaces to create a tab - like space ( it just does n’t work ) .
When you have quotations , make sure your software has n’t used the “ double prime ” glyph instead of quotation marks .
Double primes are the thingies used for inches ( e.g. , 5 ′ 11 ″ ) , and mathematical formulas / formulae .
Correct any errors in spacing wit hin and between words , especially before and after italicized text .
( See how annoying that is ?!)
Use only a single space between sentences .
The double - space convention was needed for typewriters so insisting on two spaces marks you as old person .
Use the Search / Replace feature to globally replace all double spaces with single spaces ( and to locate locations where too many spaces occur between words ) .
Avoid dark backgrounds for text boxes .
Dark text on white is the easiest for most people to read .
Also , dark backgrounds make designing graphics much harder .
It ’s better to just use a white background .
And you save on ink , too .
Avoid color combinations that create problems for those with color - deficient alleles .
Approximately 8 % of males and 0.5 % of females have some degree of color - vision deficiency ( example ) .
To test whether you ’ve made a terrible mistake in color choice , you can run a JPG of your poster through Coblis , or use the built - in simulator in Photoshop .
In general , avoid using red and green together , and opt to use symbols and line patterns ( e.g. , dashed vs solid ) instead of colors for graph elements .
Similarly , if you have a color sensitivity mutation and do n’t know it , you might choose colors that are inadvertently confusing or clashing .
Get yourself tested , especially if you ’re a white male .
Complete the entire poster on a single platform .
Switching from PC to Mac or Mac to PC invites disaster , sometimes in the form of lost image files or garbled graph axes .
Even if you are lucky enough to transfer content across platforms , switching in this way often creates printing problems in the future .
Give your graphs titles or informative phrases .
You would n’t do this in a manuscript for a journal , but for posters you want to guide the visitor as much as possible .
If you can add miniature illustrations to any of your graphs , do it .
Visual additions help attract and inform viewers much more effectively than text alone .
Tables benefit from this trick as well .
Choose the right graph .
Please see “ Watch your figures ” for help choosing among bar graph , line graph , etc .
Most graphing applications automatically give your graph an extremely annoying key that you should immediately delete .
Just directly label the different graph elements with the text tool .
Acronyms and other shorthands for genotypes , strains , and the like are terrible for communicating with people outside of your laboratory .
Use general , descriptive terms , even if they require more space , which they do .
Y - axis labels aligned horizontally are much , much easier to read , and should be used whenever space allows .
Format axis labels in sentence case ( Not in Title Case and NOT IN ALL CAPS ) .
People process sentence - case text faster .
Never give your graphs colored backgrounds , grid lines , or boxes .
If your graphing program gives them to you automatically , get rid of them .
( If you are friends with any of the programmers who make software that has such settings as defaults , please plead with them to revisit that decision . )
Never display two - dimensional data in 3 - D.
Three - dimensional graphs look adorable but obscure true difference among bar heights .
Make sure that details on graphs and photographs can be comfortably viewed from 6 feet away .
A common mistake is to assume that axes labels , figure legends , and numbers on axes are somehow exempt from font - size guidelines .
The truth is that the majority of viewers want to read only your figures .
If you include photographs , add a thin gray or black border to make them stand out against background color .
Provide the source of any image that is not yours .
And only uses images that are in the public domain .
When in doubt , ask the author / photographer / illustrator for permission .
Or buy it .
Please see , “ Adding photo credits to talk slides . ”
Use web graphics with caution .
You need something with high - enough resolution so that it does n’t look pixelated ( fuzzy ) when printed .
FYI , photographs imported from TIFFs often look better than JPEGs because the latter are often compressed too much ( or too many times ) .
Gruesome details if you ’re interested .
If you ca n’t find the perfect illustration or photograph for your poster , get one made .
A good image can be used in multiple posters , future talks , and even in manuscripts .
There are lots of illustrators and photographers out there , and they are starving .
Give them a call .
Do n’t clutter the top of your poster with logos .
If you are required by your mentor to include logos on your poster , put them on the bottom of the poster and make them small .
Here is an example image of a poster with logos at the top if you ’d like see why it ’s a graphical fail .
Format your Literature cited contents carefully .
Even small mistakes will mark you as incapable of grasping the importance of details .
When asking somebody to proof your poster , specifically ask them to be critical of your citation format .
Ask several people , too : no one person is going to catch all your errors .
Keep the font size the same as the size in other sections .
Write “ data are , ” not “ data is . ” “ Data ” is a plural noun while “ datum ” is the singular .
Although it ’s true that almost all non-scientists say “ data is ” when speaking , you should protect yourself from the scorn of grammar prudes at conferences .
There are a lot of Type A people in science .
If you do n’t know the difference between “ effect ” and “ affect , ” it ’s probably best to avoid those words .
The Oatmeal ’s “ 10 words you need to stop misspelling ” explains the difference nicely .
If you use “ woman ” as an attributive noun ( e.g. , “ woman participant ” ) , be consistent and use “ man ” in the same way ( e.g. , “ man participant ” ) .
If either sounds awkward , revert to using adjectives ( female , male ) , which work really well .
Here ’s the same advice from a woman in case you have discounted my opinion because I ’m male .
Do n’t plagiarize .
If this is not obvious , please see my page on the topic .
How to make your poster more engaging
Your poster is yours , so you should feel free to add objects to increase the effectiveness of your message .
Doing so will dramatically increase the number of people visiting and remembering you and your poster .
1 . Add hidden panels
If you have information that only some viewers might find interesting , use a hidden panel approach .
Just print your interesting extras onto your poster , then cover the area with a hinged piece of poster board onto which you have glued something else .
Zoos and museums do this a lot .
2. Add 3D images
If you have three dimensional data or complex molecular structures ( examples ; more examples ) , make 3D images .
There are software programs that can generate stereoscopic images that are viewable with cheap 3 - D glasses .
Here are directions on making your own stereoscopic setup for about $ 19.98 ( before taxes ) using Legos and two novelty key - chain cameras .
Have a pouch near the figure so that viewers can help themselves to glasses even when you have abandoned your poster .
Attach glasses with string if you think somebody will walk off with them .
3 . Add objects
If your topic is related to a thing or object , attach it .
E.g. , if you study sexual dimorphism in freakishly large beetles , glue the beetles onto the poster so people can appreciate them .
It ’s so much better than a photograph .
If your thing is fragile , just put it into clear protective container and then attach the container .
Use 3 M removable tape if you want to minimize damage to underlying poster paper .
Neodymium magnets are even slicker — just attach a magnet to your thing and affix a second magnet on the poster .
Note that researchers of large things can always use miniaturized version made by a 3D printer ( example ) .
Attaching an object will increase visitor traffic by at least 20 % ( I ’m making that up , but I ’m sure it ’s measurable ) .
4 . Add doodles
Use removable tape to add a transparency sheet over a graph or photograph if you want to make non-permanent doodles with Dry - Erase markers .
You can then doodle on critical parts of your poster , then erase .
5 . Add slideshows and movies
If you wish to show movies or photographs , attach an iPad ( below ; another example ) .
Here ’s a video showing how to attach .
If the movies and photographs look OK on smaller screens , use an old iPod or iPhone .
You can also buy cheap digital photo frames at Targét .
Note : provide headphones if audio is banned in session room ( common ) .
And if your media presentation is critical to the poster , put it online and then provide the QR code ( for URL ) on the spot underneath the iPad so that viewers can still see the movie even when you remove the iPad ( so people do n’t steal it when you ’re away from your poster ) .
6 . Add sound
If your topic is related to sound , attach a sound device that contains your sound ( bird calls , engine rattle , etc. ) .
A cheap “ sound postcard ” will often do the trick if you do n’t want to risk your iPad .
Just fill the picture frame with an illustration of the sound - generating organ or machine , and indicate where on the photograph the viewer should press to activate the sound .
7 . Add virtual reality content
Add virtual - reality content ( and VR goggles ) if you need a way to enhance the poster - viewing experience in some way .
8. Add odors
If your topic is related to olfaction , try to get the odor onto your poster somehow .
Microencapsulation is one way to make scratch - n - sniff areas , but if you work on a common odor there might be a scented ink that you can just buy .
E.g. , you might go for the smell of fresh cut grass if your poster is on effects of grazing .
Gimmicky , but then you ’d be famous .
You can also buy odor sample bags to trap smells for later use ( just attach them to your poster with instructions on how to extract a whiff ) .
Printing
Before you print a poster , print to a PDF first and confirm — at 100 % magnification — that colors , fonts , and images look perfect .
If you ’ve never printed to a PDF before , it ’s easy : on Windows machines , select , “ Save As ” , and on Macs , “ Print To . ”
If the PDF looks awful , go back and fix your source file .
One trick is to upload the PDF to http://pdf-analyser.edpsciences.org/, which will give you a listing of the resolutions of all images contained , plus will flag any fonts you ’ve used but were n’t embedded in the PDF .
If you own Adobe Acrobat Pro , you can get the same information by running a preflight diagnostic .
Once you have a PDF that you ’re pleased with , send it to your campus poster printer , a local media business ( Office Max , Staples , Kinko’s , etc. ) , or to a poster printing service that prints academic posters .
If you opt for an online service , they ’ll mail it to you ( in a tube ) , even to your meeting location if you so desire .
I ’ve use PhD Posters in the past because their locations are run by people with science PhDs who value good design and know about academic conferences ( plus they have n’t plagiarized my site like other companies ) .
In many cases , conference organizers have arrangements with online poster printers that offer a discount , so check with the people in charge .
Ideally , do all the above in time that you can re-print if you discover a problem .
You might have made a $ 100 mistake , but if you ’re trying to impress people , and you probably are , it might be worth the do - over .
These days , there are lots of options on paper thickness and gloss , plus even the option to print on various types of fabric that can be folded .
One huge advantage of fabric posters is that you can store the poster in your briefcase / backpack , and thus minimize the chance you ’ll inadvertently leave the poster behind at the airport ( when your poster is in tube , this happens ) .
Another huge advantage of cloth posters is that when you are done presenting you can make geeky clothes .
Of course , many conferences these days feature posters on monitors .
But you should also print your poster so that you have something to hang in your hallway when you return .
Note that if you receive your poster and the images look pixelated or the colors displease you , just print out high - resolution replacements and attach them with tape to cover the bad versions .
How to present a poster
To see people presenting posters , there are thousands of YouTube videos .
Tips below will help you get the most out of the experience .
At most meetings you ’ll be required to stand next to your poster and walk a visitor through it .
But you should have designed it so that it ’s understandable without you around .
If your conference promotes a meeting hashtag ( e.g. , # geekfest19 ) , broadcast a short title and your poster ’s time and location on Twitter .
Here are some examples of people trying to drum up an audience in advance .
If your society has n’t advertised the official hashtag at least a year in advance , nudge them to get on board with modernity .
Attach a sketch of your research topic to yourself at the start of the meeting .
Or a miniature version of your actual poster .
4×6 ″ sticker label paper is ideal .
Add text like , “ Lincoln Conference Room , Fri @ 7 pm ” , so people know where / when to find you .
You can also opt to make the drawing on a card that matches the size of your meeting ID , and then attach with tape on back .
Add your email address and phone number onto the back of your meeting registration ID .
When people ask for your contact information , just flip it around and they can copy what they need .
Do not refer to notes when explaining your poster .
When presenting your poster , use your fingers to point out specific parts of your poster .
A typical poster visitor appreciates a 2 - sentence overview of why your research is interesting and relevant .
Get them hooked on your question before explaining anything more about your poster .
For example , you might point to the illustration of the submerged hamster in your “ Materials and methods ” and say , “ I was interested in whether hamsters could evolve gills when subjected to repeated dunkings , which would be adaptive if the ice caps melt away . ”
Then point to the graph in Results section and say , “ I found that hamsters did n’t evolve gills , but instead drowned . ”
Keep it general , and make it clear to the visitor why you find the topic interesting .
Avoid vagueness such as “ this figure shows our main result . ”
Say something concrete , like , “ We found that brainectomized rats finished the maze more slowly , as you can see from this graph that plots time … ”
If more viewers arrive halfway into your spiel , finish the tour for the earlier arrivals first .
That ’s unless the new arrivals are super important , and the first crowd just a bunch of worthless groupies .
When in doubt about how to act at your poster , imagine that a viewer will be considering your application for a job ten years into the future , or will be considering your graduate school application next week .
This is pretty much how it all happens .
Attach a few business cards to your poster .
Even if you are an academic and think owning a business card destroys your soul .
If you want to stay informal , just order yourself a stack of cards that feature photographs of your research organism ( or star system , or whatever you work on ) .
I ’m fond of MOO ( see my cards ) .
If you must leave your poster for a bit , attach a note alerting any viewers to your expected time of return or telling them where you can be found .
Put your phone number on the note .
E.g. , “ Hey , this is crazy , but if you want to chat about this poster , text me at 800-867-5309 . ”
If you ’re assigned to a dark corner in the poster session room , buy a cheap flashlight and stick it on a leash for visitors .
Or , better , attach a clip - on , battery - powered lamp .
Attach a photograph of yourself near or on your poster so that people can find you more easily .
Have on hand , but do n’t aggressively peddle , manuscripts and reprints of your work .
If you have space on the mounting board , just pin them up for the taking .
Make shrunken versions of your poster as handouts .
If you have resisted the urge to shrink your font size , the text will still be legible .
If you have unpublished research , or research that might be deemed offensive to non-scientists , attach a “ Please do not photograph ” note to your poster .
Keep a black pen and correction fluid in your pocket in case a viewer discovers an embarrassing tybo .
If you are obsessive compulsive and have a large wardrobe , try to choose your clothes to match your poster color ( more people will visit ) .
If you ’re color blind or fashion - impaired , please ask somebody for help .
To lure viewers , attach a clear plastic cup full of candy to your poster along with a note saying , “ please help yourself . ”
Stand off to the side of your poster , then swoop back in when victims take the bait .
If you ’re the plan - ahead type , make a JPG of your poster ( or research organism ) and order yourself a t - shirt to wear at conference .
It would be funny , plus would attract people to your poster who might not otherwise care at all .
When everyone starts doing this it wo n’t be as funny , so act now .
If you ’re outgoing and unhappy with your assigned poster location , go mobile .
Just attach some string onto the top to convert your poster into something wearable then go find an audience .
You can also order a sandwich board .
Thank your viewers for visiting .
If they have stayed more than 4 minutes , you have succeeded .
If they say , “ This is really interesting — I ’ll definitely come back later , ” you have failed .
Motivational advice
The best general advice I can give a first - time poster constructor is to describe the circumstances in which a poster will eventually be viewed : a hot , loud , congested room with really bad lighting .
And meeting organizers will invariably situate your poster next to something more catchy such as “ Teaching house cats to perform cold fusion . ”
Your poster needs to be interesting and visually slick if you hope to attract viewers .
If you ’re crafty , a handmade poster is far superior to anything that you could make with a poster printer .
Plus you ’d be the highlight of a meeting .
E.g. , Jason McDermott ’s poster .
Embrace the rough draft process
The most important part of producing a great poster is to embrace the rough draft process .
You ’ll want to get honest feedback from people in your laboratory and from smart strangers who might not really care about your topic .
Perhaps the easiest way to get feedback is to print a miniature version of your poster on 8 1/2 x 11 ″ paper .
If people ca n’t read the text ( especially on the figures ) , that ’s a sign that your font size is too small .
Another way to get feedback is to use a projector to display your poster on a large screen or monitor , then ask people to verbally critique .
You want an audience that can walk up to the screen like it ’s a poster at a meeting .
Ideally , print a draft poster at least a month before the meeting and get people to critique your poster when you are not present .
I.e. , hang it in a hallway with a huge sign that pleads and begs for honest feedback about layout , word count , spelling , font , color , content , etc .
Tell them to leave comments on Post - It notes ( so provide these in container , with pens ) .
And , again , do n’t be present for this .
If you are lurking like a proud parent , people will say , “ Looks beautiful ! ” out of politeness and a desire to get away fast .
If your hallway is populated with slackers , motivate them by providing food rewards in a box attached near poster .
Attach sign to box : “ Please tell me how to make my poster better .
Mini candy bars are my pathetic thanks . ”
Software recommendations
Although the vast majority conference posters on the planet are produced with Microsoft Powerpoint , you ’ll end up with a better - looking poster if you use a page - layout application such as QuarkXPress , InDesign ( great poster instructions ) , LaTeX ( templates ; instructions ; example ) , or Scribus ( instructions ) .
These programs allow control of text wrapping around images , automatic text flow among associated text blocks , and much more .
You can also make posters with graphics software such as Illustrator , CorelDRAW , Freehand , Omnigraffle , and Inkscape .
I ’ve also heard great things about Canva .
There ’s also PosterGenius for those who need a program that will make a lot of the design decisions for you .
Why give a poster instead of a talk
Although you could communicate research via a 15 - minute talk at the same meeting , presenting a poster allows you to more personally interact with the people who are interested in your topic , and lets you reach people who might not be in your esoteric but no doubt fascinating sub -field .
And , it turns out , posters sessions are not all about you : research has demonstrated that people who are standing are more engaged learners than people sitting in chairs ( at talks ) .
Posters are also handy because they can still be viewed even when you ’re not present .
And after the conference ends , you can hang the poster in the hallway of your department for people to admire .
Finally , presenting a poster is especially recommended if you are bad at public speaking or can’t comfortably speak a particular language ( the reason poster sessions were invented ) .

09/30/2005
Oct. 2009 : Tim O'Reilly and John Battelle answer the question of " What 's next for Web 2.0 ? " in Web Squared : Web 2.0 Five Years On .
The bursting of the dot - com bubble in the fall of 2001 marked a turning point for the web .
Many people concluded that the web was overhyped , when in fact bubbles and consequent shakeouts appear to be a common feature of all technological revolutions .
Shakeouts typically mark the point at which an ascendant technology is ready to take its place at center stage .
The pretenders are given the bum 's rush , the real success stories show their strength , and there begins to be an understanding of what separates one from the other .
The concept of " Web 2.0 " began with a conference brainstorming session between O'Reilly and MediaLive International .
Dale Dougherty , web pioneer and O'Reilly VP , noted that far from having " crashed " , the web was more important than ever , with exciting new applications and sites popping up with surprising regularity .
What 's more , the companies that had survived the collapse seemed to have some things in common .
Could it be that the dot - com collapse marked some kind of turning point for the web , such that a call to action such as " Web 2.0 " might make sense ?
We agreed that it did , and so the Web 2.0 Conference was born .
In the year and a half since , the term " Web 2.0 " has clearly taken hold , with more than 9.5 million citations in Google .
But there 's still a huge amount of disagreement about just what Web 2.0 means , with some people decrying it as a meaningless marketing buzzword , and others accepting it as the new conventional wisdom .
This article is an attempt to clarify just what we mean by Web 2.0 .
In our initial brainstorming , we formulated our sense of Web 2.0 by example :
Web 1.0 Web 2.0 DoubleClick --> Google AdSense Ofoto --> Flickr Akamai --> BitTorrent mp3.com --> Napster Britannica Online -->
Wikipedia personal websites --> blogging evite --> upcoming.org and EVDB domain name speculation --> search engine optimization page views --> cost per click screen scraping --> web services publishing --> participation content management systems --> wikis directories ( taxonomy ) --> tagging ( " folksonomy " ) stickiness --> syndication
The list went on and on .
But what was it that made us identify one application or approach as " Web 1.0 " and another as " Web 2.0 " ?
( The question is particularly urgent because the Web 2.0 meme has become so widespread that companies are now pasting it on as a marketing buzzword , with no real understanding of just what it means .
The question is particularly difficult because many of those buzzword - addicted startups are definitely not Web 2.0 , while some of the applications we identified as Web 2.0 , like Napster and BitTorrent , are not even properly web applications ! )
We began trying to tease out the principles that are demonstrated in one way or another by the success stories of web 1.0 and by the most interesting of the new applications .
1. The Web As Platform
Like many important concepts , Web 2.0 does n't have a hard boundary , but rather , a gravitational core .
You can visualize Web 2.0 as a set of principles and practices that tie together a veritable solar system of sites that demonstrate some or all of those principles , at a varying distance from that core .
Figure 1 shows a " meme map " of Web 2.0 that was developed at a brainstorming session during FOO Camp , a conference at O'Reilly Media .
It 's very much a work in progress , but shows the many ideas that radiate out from the Web 2.0 core .
For example , at the first Web 2.0 conference , in October 2004 , John Battelle and I listed a preliminary set of principles in our opening talk .
The first of those principles was " The web as platform . "
Yet that was also a rallying cry of Web 1.0 darling Netscape , which went down in flames after a heated battle with Microsoft .
What 's more , two of our initial Web 1.0 exemplars , DoubleClick and Akamai , were both pioneers in treating the web as a platform .
People do n't often think of it as " web services " , but in fact , ad serving was the first widely deployed web service , and the first widely deployed " mashup " ( to use another term that has gained currency of late ) .
Every banner ad is served as a seamless cooperation between two websites , delivering an integrated page to a reader on yet another computer .
Akamai also treats the network as the platform , and at a deeper level of the stack , building a transparent caching and content delivery network that eases bandwidth congestion .
Nonetheless , these pioneers provided useful contrasts because later entrants have taken their solution to the same problem even further , understanding something deeper about the nature of the new platform .
Both DoubleClick and Akamai were Web 2.0 pioneers , yet we can also see how it 's possible to realize more of the possibilities by embracing additional Web 2.0 design patterns .
Let 's drill down for a moment into each of these three cases , teasing out some of the essential elements of difference .
Netscape vs. Google
If Netscape was the standard bearer for Web 1.0 , Google is most certainly the standard bearer for Web 2.0 , if only because their respective IPOs were defining events for each era .
So let 's start with a comparison of these two companies and their positioning .
Netscape framed " the web as platform " in terms of the old software paradigm : their flagship product was the web browser , a desktop application , and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high - priced server products .
Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would , in theory , give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market .
Much like the " horseless carriage " framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar , Netscape promoted a " webtop " to replace the desktop , and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers .
In the end , both web browsers and web servers turned out to be commodities , and value moved " up the stack " to services delivered over the web platform .
Google , by contrast , began its life as a native web application , never sold or packaged , but delivered as a service , with customers paying , directly or indirectly , for the use of that service .
None of the trappings of the old software industry are present .
No scheduled software releases , just continuous improvement .
No licensing or sale , just usage .
No porting to different platforms so that customers can run the software on their own equipment , just a massively scalable collection of commodity PCs running open source operating systems plus homegrown applications and utilities that no one outside the company ever gets to see .
At bottom , Google requires a competency that Netscape never needed : database management .
Google is n't just a collection of software tools , it 's a specialized database .
Without the data , the tools are useless ; without the software , the data is unmanageable .
Software licensing and control over APIs -- the lever of power in the previous era-- is irrelevant because the software never need be distributed but only performed , and also because without the ability to collect and manage the data , the software is of little use .
In fact , the value of the software is proportional to the scale and dynamism of the data it helps to manage .
Google 's service is not a server -- though it is delivered by a massive collection of internet servers -- nor a browser -- though it is experienced by the user within the browser .
Nor does its flagship search service even host the content that it enables users to find .
Much like a phone call , which happens not just on the phones at either end of the call , but on the network in between , Google happens in the space between browser and search engine and destination content server , as an enabler or middleman between the user and his or her online experience .
While both Netscape and Google could be described as software companies , it 's clear that Netscape belonged to the same software world as Lotus , Microsoft , Oracle , SAP , and other companies that got their start in the 1980 's software revolution , while Google 's fellows are other internet applications like eBay , Amazon , Napster , and yes , DoubleClick and Akamai .
Nov. 26 , 2006  --
The week 's flare - up of violence in Iraq has been met by a flurry of new diplomacy .
Vice President Cheney has just returned from a one - day visit to Saudi Arabia , and President Bush is heading to Amman this week for a summit with the Iraqi prime minister , hosted by King Abdullah of Jordan .
ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent George Stephanopoulos spoke with King Abdullah on " This Week . "
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : Welcome back to " This Week , " Your Majesty .
KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN : Thank you very much , George .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Is this Amman summit the last chance to save Iraq ?
KING ABDULLAH : Well , we hope that this is an opportunity for both President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki to be able to come together in a common understanding on how to bring the sectarian conflict much lower .
We are very , very concerned for the future of all Iraqis , and we hope that there will be something dramatic .
The challenges , obviously , in front of both of them are immense .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You say , " something dramatic . "
What could that be ?
KING ABDULLAH :
Well , we have to make sure that all parties in Iraq understand the dangers of the ongoing escalation , and I hope that Prime Minister Maliki will have some ideas to be provided to the president on how he could be inclusive in bringing all the different sects inside of Iraq together .
And they need to do it now , because , obviously , as we 're seeing , things are beginning to spiral out of control .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Many here in the United States say that , if Prime Minister Maliki does n't come forward with that kind of a package , President Bush should issue an ultimatum :
It has to happen now or we 're going to begin to withdraw our troops from Iraq .
Would that be useful ?
KING ABDULLAH : Well , I 'm not exactly privy to what the discussion points will be between both sides .
But there needs to be some very strong action taken on the ground there today .
Obviously , the indicators are of tremendous concern to all of us , and I do n't think we 're in a position where we can come back and revisit the problem in early 2007 .
There needs to be a strategy .
There needs to be a plan that brings all the parties together , and bring them today and not tomorrow .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Is it a civil war in Iraq right now ?
KING ABDULLAH : Well , George , the difficulty that we 're tackling with here is , we 're juggling with the strong potential of three civil wars in the region , whether it's the Palestinians , that of Lebanon or of Iraq .
And I hope that my discussions , at least , with the president will be to provide whatever we can do for the Iraqi people .
But at the same time , we do want to concentrate ourselves on the core issues , which we believe are the Palestinians and the Palestinian peace process , because that is a must today , as well as the tremendous concern we 've had over the past several days , what 's happening in Lebanon .
And we could possibly imagine going into 2007 and having three civil wars on our hands .
And therefore , it is time that we really take a strong step forward as part of the international community and make sure we avert the Middle East from a tremendous crisis that I fear , and I see could possibly happen in 2007 .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That is a frightening prospect , the prospect of three civil wars .
All three of those societies -- Iraq , Lebanon , the Palestinian Authority -- have had elections over the last couple of years .
And now we 're seeing the prospect of civil war .
Could the United States push too hard , too fast for democracy ?
KING ABDULLAH :
The issue is not whether you 're pushing one agenda or another .
The issue is we have not been able to deal with the core problem of the Middle East .
Now , I know people will say that there are several core problems in the Middle East .
Obviously , the closest to American minds , because of your commitments of soldiers is Iraq .
But for the majority of us living in this part of the world , it has always been the Israeli - Palestinian , the Israeli - Arab problem .
And I fear that if we do not use the next couple of months to really be able to push the process forward , I do n't believe that there will be anything to talk about .
In other words , there will not be enough of circumstances to create a two - state solution -- in other words , Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and harmony .
If we do n't solve the Israeli - Palestinian problem , then how can we ever solve the Israeli - Arab problem ?
And I do n't believe that beyond mid-2007 , if we do n't get the process going , there will be anything of a Palestine to talk about .
And therefore , do we resign this whole region to another decade or two of violence , which none of us can afford .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Secretary of State Baker is considering just that prospect , pushing for a comprehensive peace plan as he looks at solutions for Iraq , as well .
But help me out here .
Does n't the situation in Iraq now have a logic of its own , the Sunnis and the Shiites killing each other in an uncontrolled manner ?
What does that have to do with what 's going on in Palestine ?
KING ABDULLAH :
Well , the thing is , as we look at the three potential flash points , before , I believe , the Lebanese war this summer , I would have put Iraq in the number one position .
After the Lebanese war , the Palestinian scenario was in the number one position , followed very closely in the past several weeks .
I would say that the Lebanese problem and the Palestinian ones are neck - in - neck .
They 're all extremely important .
Solving all three of them are going to be critical .
But the priority I believe today in the long term is the Israeli - Palestinian one , because it resonates beyond the borders of Iraq , beyond the borders of the Arab and the Muslim world .
...
And you know , you 've been with this issue for many years .
It is still the emotional core issue for our part of the world .
The problem when we discuss this sometimes with the American public , they say , no , this is just an excuse , because there are other problems in the Middle East .
But the emotional impact that the Israeli - Palestinian problem has on the ground can be translated to the insecurity and the frustrations throughout the Middle East and the Arab world .
For me , that is the priority .
When it comes to things exploding out of control , I would put today , as we stand , Palestine and probably a close tie with Lebanon .
Iraq , funny enough , although as concerned as I am with Iraq and the major problems that that might bring to us , is in third position .
Obviously , this is all relative .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Well , one of the ideas for dealing with all three of these conflicts is an international conference that would include Jordan , would include Saudi Arabia , would include Egypt and include the United States , but also Syria and Iran .
Do you think it would be useful to include Syria and Iran in that kind of a conference right now ?
And what kind of leverage does the U.S. have over that ?
KING ABDULLAH : Well , look .
We always believe that dialogue is a way of reaching out to each other .
As we continue to push each other into corners , then the only alternative is to have more of a violent reaction than common sense leading the way .
I do believe that there are feelers going to different countries to see if we can come together on the issue of Iraq .
But I think , the problem is , is that America needs to look at it in the total picture .
It 's not just one issue by itself .
I keep saying Palestine is the core .
It is linked to the extent of what 's going on in Iraq .
It is linked to what 's going on in Lebanon .
It is linked to the issues that we find ourselves with the Syrians .
So , if you want to do comprehensive -- comprehensive means bringing all the parties of the region together .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And does it also mean -- when you talk about a reinvigorated U.S. effort , what are you looking for exactly ?
What kind of a sign are you expecting from the United States to prove that the Bush administration is serious about seeking this kind of comprehensive effort ?
One idea being floated right now is that former Secretary of State Baker be appointed a special envoy by President Bush .
Would that be useful ?
KING ABDULLAH : Well , from my point of view , I 've known Secretary Baker for many years .
He was a good friend of his late Majesty King Hussein .
He has a tremendous , strong reputation in this part of the world as being an honest broker .
Obviously , that 's a decision for the American president and his administration .
But he is probably -- Secretary Baker is one of the qualified ... people I 've ever come across in being able to deal with Middle East issues .
STEPHANOPOULOS : King Abdullah , thank you very much for your time this morning .
KING ABDULLAH : Thank you .
Campaigners claim flights stopped in eastern Europe en-route to Cuba
Jack Straw said the letter " expressed concern " on behalf of all EU countries and he was waiting for a response .
He spoke after human rights group Liberty urged police to probe allegations that the flights called at British airports .
The US government has said its laws have not been broken .
But it has refused to confirm or deny the existence of " secret prisons " in third countries .
Liberty has called for action within 14 days - or , it has said , it will go to court claiming police aided and abetted kidnap and torture .
' Appropriate steps '
The Foreign Office has said it had no evidence of such use of UK territory .
At a news conference with Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini , who is visiting the UK , Mr Straw said his letter " had gone " .
He said he was waiting for a response from the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and he would circulate the reply to all his foreign minister colleagues .
" Meanwhile , let me say , I think there is no purpose in speculating on allegations that are made on this side or the other side of the Atlantic , " he said .
" These are allegations about a foreign government .
We have taken the appropriate steps , which is to ask for clarification by that government . "
The Guardian in September reported claims that at least 210 CIA flights had landed in the UK since the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US .
It is alleged at least 12 airports in England and Scotland have been used , with the busiest being Prestwick in Ayrshire where CIA aircraft landed more than 75 times .
Suspicions
Shami Chakrabarti , Liberty 's director , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " The allegations , the suspicions , the circumstantial evidence if you like , gives serious enough concern that we should ask chief constables to do their duty .
" They have positive obligations under international law and under our human rights act to investigate , and that 's what we ask them to do . "
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell told Today : " We need full disclosure by the government .
" If in fact people are being moved from a jurisdiction where torture is illegal to a jurisdiction where torture is permissible , that seems to me to be wholly contrary to international law .
" If we are allowing facilities for aircraft carrying out those actions , then we are at the very least facilitating it ; we may even be complicit in it . "
Police letters
Liberty has written to the chief constables of Bedfordshire , Cambridgeshire , Dorset , Essex , Hampshire , Kent , the Metropolitan Police , the Ministry of Defence police , Sussex , Thames Valley and West Midlands forces .
Because of the possibility of court action if police fail to respond , Scottish police operating under a different legal system have not been contacted , Liberty says .
The airports allegedly involved include Biggin Hill in Kent , Birmingham , Bournemouth , RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire , Farnborough , Gatwick , Heathrow , Luton , Mildenhall in Suffolk , RAF Northolt in north London , Stansted and Prestwick .

The cells connected up with other parts of the retina
UK scientists treated animals which had eye damage similar to that seen in many human eye diseases .
They were able to help them see again by transplanting immature retinal stem cells into their eyes .
UK experts welcomed the study , published in the magazine Nature , saying it was " stunning " research .
This is a stunning piece of research that may in the distant future may lead to transplants in humans to relieve blindness
Professor Andrew Dick
University of Bristol
If the results can be translated into a treatment for human eye disease , it could help the millions of people with conditions ranging from age - related macular degeneration to diabetes .
Once the cone and rod photoreceptors in a retina are lost , they can not be replaced .
While treatments are being developed which might prevent or delay the loss of these cells , scientists are also seeking to help those already affected .
It is thought the retina is one of the best places to try out cell transplant therapy because photoreceptor loss initially leaves the rest of the wiring to the brain intact .
But previous attempts to transplant stem cells , which can turn into any kind of cell in the body , in the hope that they will become photoreceptors have failed because the cells were not developed enough .
Harvest
In this study , funded by the Medical Research Council , scientists from the University College London Institutes of Ophthalmology and Child Health and Moorfields Eye Hospital transplanted cells which were more advanced , and already programmed to develop into photoreceptors .
1 - Early stage retinal cells are taken from a newborn mouse 2 - They are transplanted into the retina of a mouse which has lost its sight 3 - The cells implant and connect with existing cells in the eye , restoring some sight to the mouse .
The team took cells from three to five - day - old mice , a stage when the retina is about to be formed .
The cells were then transplanted into animals which had been genetically designed to have conditions which meant they would gradually lose their sight - either mimicking the human disease retinitis pigmentosa or age - related macular degeneration .
The transplants were successful ; the photoreceptors implanted and made electrical connections to the animals ' existing retinal nerve cells - key to allowing them to see again .
Tests showed that the mice 's pupils responded to light and that there was activity in the optical nerve , showing signals were being sent to the brain .
Dr Jane Sowden , one of the study 's leaders , said : " Remarkably , we found that the mature retina , previously believed to have no capacity for repair , is in fact able to support the development of new functional photoreceptors . "
' Not false hope '
To get human retinal cells at the same stage of development , however , would involve taking stem cells from a foetus during the second trimester of pregnancy .
But Dr Robert MacLaren , a specialist at Moorfields Eye Hospital who worked on the research , said they did not want to go down that route .
He said the aim now would be to look at adult stem cells to see if they could be genetically altered to behave like the mouse retinal cells .
There are some cells on the margin of adult retinas that have been identified as having stem cell - like properties , which the team says could be suitable .
Dr MacLaren stressed it would be some time before patients could benefit from such a treatment , but he said that at least it was now a possibility .
" Everyday , I sit in my clinic and have to tell patients that there 's nothing I can do .
" I do n't want to give patients false hope .
But at least now , if I see a young patient , I can say that there might be something within your lifetime . "
Dr Stephen Minger , a stem cell expert at King 's College London , said : " I think this is important , superb research - it clearly shows that the host environment is important in directing the integration of transplanted cells . "
But Andrew Dick , professor of ophthalmology at the University of Bristol , added : " As with any basic research we have to be careful not to overhype .
However , this is a stunning piece of research that may in the distant future lead to transplants in humans to relieve blindness . "
The pair met in an online chatroom
Paul Gibbons , 47 , tracked down John Jones using details obtained online after the pair exchanged insults in an internet chatroom , a court heard .
He travelled 70 miles to Mr Jones ' home in Clacton , Essex , and beat him up with a pickaxe handle in December 2005 .
Gibbons , of Southwark , south London , admitted unlawful wounding and will be sentenced on 7 November .
Threatening exchanges
The pair met in an internet chatroom called Yahoo , Islam 10 as both had an interest in the Muslim faith , the Old Bailey was told .
Their exchanges soured after Gibbons accused Mr Jones of spreading rumours about him .
This is the first instance of a web - rage attack
Det Cons Christopher Creagh
" There was an exchange of views between the victim and the defendant which were threatening on both sides , " said prosecutor Ibitayo Adebayo .
Gibbons , a man with a violent past , traced Mr Jones to his home using personal details about himself that he had put online .
Cut with a knife
Gibbons arrived at Mr Jones ' home armed and accompanied by another man carrying a machete , the court heard .
Mr Jones , whose partner and three children were in the house , opened the door holding a knife for protection , said Mr Adebayo .
A fight broke out during which Mr Jones was disarmed and beaten with the pickaxe handle and cut with the knife .
Gibbons fled after the victim 's partner called for help .
Mr Jones suffered cuts to his head , neck and hands .
Identity safety
Det Cons Christopher Creagh , of the Metropolitan Police , said : " This is the first instance of a web - rage attack . "
Det Sgt Jean - Marc Bazzoni , of Essex Police , added the case demonstrates the importance of protecting one 's identity on the internet .
" Mr Jones had posted pictures of his family on the web and had chatted to Gibbons on an audio link , " he said .
" It demonstrates how easily other users can put two and two together and also shows how children could also find themselves in danger . "
The present has a way of changing the way that historians think about the past .
The trauma of Sept. 11 , 2001 , is likely to be no exception :
Five years after the attacks on New York and Washington , many historians say 9/11 and its aftermath are leaving their mark on how American history is written and taught .
American history is being studied less as the story of a neatly packaged nation state and more in a global context , as part of something much larger , many historians say .
The idea of America as an empire , too , is in vogue .
And historians are giving new attention to topics like the turbulent history of civil liberties in the United States .
There is growing interest in the history of terrorism , of Muslims in America , of international cultural conflicts and exchanges .
The history of foreign policy is being rethought , some historians said , with less emphasis on the cold war and more on post - colonial politics .
The Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis from 1979 to 1981 seem like significant turning points in ways that they had not before .
“ For historians , history is never set in stone , ” said Joanne Meyerowitz , a professor of history and American studies at Yale who edited “ History and September 11th ” ( Temple University Press , 2003 ) , a collection of essays .
“ It ’s written and rewritten in each generation .
The events of the present , of the contemporary age , always help us reframe the events of the past .
And the events of the past always help us to reframe the age we ’re living in . ”

The report into violent racism shows that at least 28 people were killed and 366 were assaulted in 2005 .
This year there have already been a number of high - profile cases , including the death of a Senegalese student .
Amnesty condemns discrimination by the authorities and a failure to properly record or investigate racist crimes .
Russia 's police and prosecutors need to tackle head - on the growing scourge of violent racism in Russia
Kate Allen
Amnesty International
Attacks that stain Russia
The Amnesty report , entitled " Russian Federation : Violent racism out of control " , includes examples of police and prosecutors routinely classifying murders and serious assaults by skinhead extremists as lesser crimes of " hooliganism " .
Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said racist killings and violent attacks against foreigners , visible ethnic minorities and anti-racist campaigners in Russia were out of control .
" Some Russian authorities are turning a blind eye , " she said .
" Instead of seeing only ' hooliganism ' in vicious organised attacks on students from African , south - east Asian countries and non-Slavic Russians from Chechnya , Russia 's police and prosecutors need to tackle head - on the growing scourge of violent racism in Russia . "
She said President Vladimir Putin 's government should adopt a comprehensive " plan of action " to combat racism and anti-Semitism .
Protests
Cases highlighted in the Amnesty report include the killing of nine - year - old Tajik girl Khursheda Sultonov .
She was attacked with other members of her family in St Petersburg in February 2004 by a gang .
Khursheda was stabbed nine times in the chest , stomach and arms and died at the scene .
Another victim was Vu Anh Tuan , a 20 - year - old Vietnamese student , stabbed to death in October 2004 by a gang of 18 skinheads near a metro station in St Petersburg .
Dmitri Krayukhin , head of anti-racist organisation United Europe , told Amnesty he had received threats to " cut off your head " .
He has repeatedly been denied protection from the authorities in Orel , western Russia .
The report also heard from members of the Roma community who have stopped travelling into St Petersburg city centre , having been the victims of attacks .
Russian citizens and foreigners living in the big cities have led demonstrations against the attacks and the authorities ' failure to tackle the problem .
" It caught up with all of us in 2004 when the industry recalled 30.6 million vehicles , nearly twice the number we sold last year , " he said , adding that the problem " undermines the trust people have in the our industry . "
The hybrid push is a core goal of Toyota 's competitive strategy as it looks to increase its overall share of the world 's auto market to 15 percent , which would likely vault it past General Motors as the world 's largest automaker .
The volatility of gas prices , political instability and environmental issues make the continued development of the technology a priority , Mr. Press and other Toyota executives have said .
" To us , it 's not a passing phase but a vital technology for the 21st century , " Mr. Press said .
Toyota currently sells three hybrid models in the United States , the Toyota Prius , the Lexus RX 400h and a hybrid version of its Toyota Highlander S.U.V .
The company has previously announced 2 of the 10 new hybrid models , versions of its Lexus GS sedan and Toyota Camry .
Mr. Press declined to say what other models were under development , but did say that a pickup truck would likely be among the offerings .
Toyota 's plan will keep up the pressure on other automakers to develop more robust fuel economy strategies to compete with Toyota , as well as Honda , the two companies that brought the first hybrids to market .
So far , only the Ford Motor Company has responded with hybrids comparable to Toyota 's popular Prius , though most other automakers have models in the works .
Nissan plans to sell a version of its Altima sedan that uses Toyota 's technology , and G.M. and DaimlerChrysler , companies long skeptical of the technology , have said more recently that they are jointly developing a new hybrid system for trucks .
Sometimes a small sample is really helpful in showing the differences between two approaches .
Ruby on Rails is a slick web framework for building web applications the old way .
When I say the old way , I mean building URLs manually and passing parameters through query strings manually , i.e. marshaling session data manually .
Rails automatically maps URLs to controllers and methods in those controllers to set up the appropriate models , and automatically binds the correct view for that method , based on naming conventions of the files .
It 's a great method and saves much of the hassle of writing a web app while enforcing a nice model view controller paradigm .
Here 's a sample any Rails programmer will probably recognize , first list .rhtml ...
< tr > < td > " edit " , :id => recipe.id %></td> < td></td> < td></td> </tr> < p > " new " %></p>
and its controller ...
class RecipieController < ApplicationController def list @recipies = Recipie.find ( : all ) end def edit @recipie = Recipie.find ( @params [ :id ] ) end end
Nice and clean , but the programmer is still working in a template language , requiring constant context switching between Ruby and HTML , and still manually building anchor tag URLs by calling a method and passing in the recipe 's id .
Passing around ids requires that the next view , bound to the edit method in the controller , needs to look up the object from the database with that id from reading the request parameters .
You can see this in the edit method of the controller , it sets up data in an instance variable in the controller so the view will have access to it .
This is classic web development done very cleanly , and honestly very Smalltalk 'ish , however , passing around an object id is n't very object - oriented ( it 's rather relational actually ) , and context switching between two languages while working in the view is n't very fun .
Instead of passing around an object 's id why not pass around the object instead ?
Enter Seaside , same code , a different approach , more object - oriented ...
renderListOn : html self recipes do : [ : recipe | self renderRecipe : recipe on : html ]. html paragraph : [ html anchor callback : [ self editRecipe : Recipe new ] ; with : ' Create new Recipe ' ] renderRecipe : aRecipe on : html html tableRow id : #recipie , aRecipe id ; with : [ html tableData : [ html anchor callback : [ self editRecipe : aRecipe ] ; with : aRecipe title ] ; tableData : aRecipe category name ; tableData : aRecipe date ]
and the controller code ...
recipies ^recipes ifNil : [ recipes := Recipe findAll ] editRecipe : aRecipe self call : ( RecipeEditor for : aRecipe )
Seaside puts the view and controller together in one class , the component , and it can do so cleanly because there is no templating language , rendering views are simply method calls in pure Smalltalk .
So instead of having a controller , with a bunch of RHTML files and partials , we have components ( aka view / controllers ) , with rendering methods ( aka partial views ) .
It 's important to note however , that view code and controller code are still normally kept quite separate and organized using Smalltalk 's method categories .
View methods are normally categorized as " rendering " , or something more specific like " rendering ajax " , while controller code is categorized in categories like " actions " , " queries " , " accessing " , or whatever categories you make up to keep your code organized .
This is one of those Smalltalk things that no other language really has and only exists in its environment so it does n't translate to sample code .
Now , the main thing to note here , is that objects are passed between views as actual objects using a constructor on the view ( RecipeEditor for : recipe ) .
One component simply creates and calls another .
The components are also rendered in pure Smalltalk , which means they can be factored into smaller more reusable methods ( aka partials ) , using all of Smalltalk 's existing tools , i.e. the refactoring browser .
This is amazingly productive .
The anchor tag has a closure attached to it via its #callback : method , containing the actual code we want to execute when the user clicks the link .
This closure , or block as Smalltalkers call them , gets turned into a URL automatically by Seaside and stored as a continuation on the current session .
This means that RecipieEditor view does n't need to go back to the database and look up the recipe by its id , because it was given the actual recipe object directly ( less load on the database ) .
In essence , instead of passing a bunch of state through a URL manually , you simply say when this link is pressed , execute this code .
This is a technique discussed by Paul Graham in his essay Beating the Averages that he used in ViaWeb .
This one change drastically changes the way one thinks about , and builds web applications and makes programming much simpler .
Notice how I 've factored out the rendering of a single row into its own method .
This sets me up to do some nice simple Ajax updates of individual row by being able to pass an Ajax rendering canvas through that same #renderRecipeOn : method .
For example , I could re-render just that row , via Ajax , when a hyperlink is clicked with just this ...
html anchor onClick : ( html updater id : #recipe , self randomRecipe id ; callback : [ : ajax | self renderRecipe : self randomRecipe on : ajax ] ) ; with : ' Replace random recipe with another random recipe '
So when I write a page , I break it up into rendering methods based on which parts of the screen I want to update via Ajax .
This is similar to what Rails does with partials , except Seaside does it with ordinary objects and methods .
Top to bottom , objects and method calls in pure Smalltalk , no web stuff .
This is what Seaside gives you , a complete abstraction of the HTTP request - response cycle so you can program normally , as you would any desktop application , without all the extra hassles that web development introduced .
Even abstracting away JavaScript for the most part .
This translates into much faster application development , yes , even faster than Rails .
It also means if you have to port a desktop application to the web , Seaside may allow you to do so without having to completely rework the existing design .
The price you pay ... sessions and a little memory on the server .
Yes it 's harder to scale than a session - less approach like Rails , but it will scale , and memory is cheap these days , far cheaper than programmers .
Seaside , like Rails , is a very opinionated framework .
Seaside 's opinion is that programming is the most expensive part of application development , so let 's optimize development time instead of CPU memory and cycles and throw out the ( stateless / templated HTML ) model of web development in favor of simpler web development in one language , where you have all of your tools available and are n't constantly context switching between several languages .
“ If a field is missing , that student would not even get into the process , ” he said .
That the omission occurred at all is worrying scientists concerned about threats to the teaching of evolution .
One of them , Lawrence M. Krauss , a physicist at Case Western Reserve University , said he learned about it from someone at the Department of Education , who got in touch with him after his essay on the necessity of teaching evolution appeared in The New York Times on Aug. 15 .
Dr. Krauss would not name his source , who he said was concerned about being publicly identified as having drawn attention to the matter .
An article about the issue was posted Tuesday on the Web site of The Chronicle of Higher Education .
Dr. Krauss said the omission would be “ of great concern ” if evolutionary biology had been singled out for removal , or if the change had been made without consulting with experts on biology .

People always celebrate the Solstices at Stonehenge
After negotiating with site - managers English Heritage , the crowd performed traditional solstice activities on Thursday morning , and left peacefully .
One reveller , who wished to remain anonymous , said : " We formed a ring and held hands , and touched the stones .
The man with the green cloak was there .
" But there were an awful lot of red faces , " she said .
The Pagan celebration of Winter Solstice is one of the oldest winter celebrations in the world .
People assume because the Summer Solstice is the 21st June , the Winter Solstice will be the 21st December
English Heritage
The Solstice is actually at 0022 GMT on Friday , and some crowds are expected at Stonehenge on Friday morning .
" I do n't know if I 'll go back , " the reveller said .
A spokeswoman for English Heritage , which looks after the site , said : " People assume because the Summer Solstice is the 21st June , the Winter Solstice will be the 21st December .
" They should always check . "
Stonehenge is currently competing against other iconic buildings and structures , ranging from the Statue of Liberty to the Great Wall of China , in a global hunt for the New Seven Wonders of the World .
The poll is being organised by the Swiss - based group New7Wonders and the winners will be announced in July 2007 .
Last year , planning permission was refused for a new visitor centre at Stonehenge but English Heritage plans to appeal against the decision in December .
It also said that the much - needed improvements to the A303 - which have been endorsed at a public inquiry - were now subject to a government review as a result of cost increases .
" What emboldens the enemy is the almost 4 years ' presence of Western troops in the middle of a Muslim country 's capital , which causes over 70 percent of the residents of that country to oppose our presence .
" What emboldens the enemy is the open - ended presence of Western troops , which serves as a magnet for extremists and gives a propaganda club to our enemies .
" What emboldens the enemy is invading Iraq without the support of the international community .
" What emboldens the enemy is lawlessness and looters ransacking public buildings and institutions in Iraq .
" What emboldens the enemy is invading Iraq without a plan for the aftermath of the invasion .
" What emboldens the enemy is increasing the number of American troops , which results in Iraqis taking less responsibility for providing security for all the citizens of Iraq .
" What emboldens the enemy is the creation of Green Zones protecting Iraqi political leaders , in which they pursue a winner - take - all political approach . "
I guess when you 're a Republican in Washington and you 've got a good , digestible smear going on your opponents , you stick with it even if the slime is now directed at the vast majority of the American people .
Such is the case with the most recent use of false choices by the GOP in which they say that the only course of action to take in Iraq is to stick with whatever knuckleheaded scheme the White House picks next to salvage George W. Bush 's legacy or you are , in fact , " emboldening the enemy .
"
The application of that charge may be the only bipartisan thing that 's happened on Capitol Hill in the last couple of years , as it now appears to apply to Democrats and Republicans alike .
Senators Chuck Hagel ( R-NE ) , John Warner ( R - VA ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) all oppose the Bush - McCain Doctrine of escalating the Iraq war so they 're also accused of emboldening the enemy .
According to the GOP spin machine , roughly 70 percent of Americans who oppose sending any more troops to Iraq must be in bed with the insurgents as well .
Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) -- you know , the guy cosponsoring the Warner - Levin bill that the Republicans refuse to debate -- took to the Senate floor on Monday to knock back attempts by the GOP to stall debate on the war and to let everyone know he 's tired of the low - rent language about " emboldening the enemy " when Congress tries to do exactly the job it 's supposed to do .
" The administration says this bill emboldens the enemy , " said Levin , who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee .
" Congressional debate over Iraq policy does n't embolden the enemy .
The enemy is already emboldened .
" Levin then went on to give Republican leaders and the White House a lesson on what truly emboldens the enemy as follows :
" We owe our troops everything .
We owe them the best equipment we can provide .
We owe them the best training .
We owe their families the best support we can give them , " said Levin , in his plea to Republicans to put the national interest over providing cover for Bush .
" We also owe them our best thinking .
I think it is an insult to the intelligence of our troops to suggest that debating the wisdom of deepening the military presence in Iraq somehow or other emboldens the enemy .
" And Levin reminded his fellow lawmakers that an election was held in November in which voters made clear their desire to see a dramatic change in Iraq and not the same old rubber - stamping they saw from the do - nothing , Republican Congress .
"
The American people have strong opinions about what is happening in Iraq .
They want their elected officials to debate this issue , and we should do it , " said Levin .
" The president 's course of action , which he has been on for 3 1 / 2 years and which he has now proposed to continue on to deepen our involvement in Iraq , does not enhance our security .
It does not maximize chances of success in Iraq .
" " The debate should go forward .
A filibuster is out of place on war and peace issues , on something of this magnitude . "
What ’s with all the social bookmarking icons at the bottom of every single friggin’ blog post out there ?
Given the Ebola - like spread of these things they must be really effective , right ?
Not so much .
Zero out of Technorati ’s top 10 blogs feature those icons .
And only two out of the 15 entries in the current crop at Digg ’s Top Today page offer “ Digg me ” icons .
This focus on campaigning over content seems like a classic case of misplaced priorities .
The reason posts wind up at Digg , Delicious , or elsewhere is n’t because the authors made it easier to vote for them ( it ’s already easy ) .
A post winds up at these sites because people respond to its content and quality .
So think twice before badgering readers with “ vote for me ” pleas .
The hectoring is tiresome , it results in extraneous visual noise , it makes your site look cheap , and the benefits are dubious at best .
Instead , focus on delivering great content .
If you do , people will figure out how to spread the word just fine .

Lessons are added to this site as they are written and proofread ; you can also find drafts of other lessons by typing in URLs like ~ pp~www.bilkent.edu.tr/~robin/lesson*.html~/pp~, where * is the number of the lesson .
However , you read the drafts entirely at your own risk ; they may contain typos , bad explanations and even bad Lojban - nobody 's perfect !
There will be about 12 lessons when the course is complete .
OK , that 's enough boring stuff , let 's learn some Lojban ....

Very loose translation
Susan felt a bit embarrassed .
She
looked down at her glass .
Just then , she found it very interesting .
Ranjeet and Jyoti kissed each other .
" I think you two have just met , "
she said .
The wine was somehow incredibly interesting , and she drank it
quickly .
" Errr , no , we 've never met , " said Ranjeet .
A little later ,
Susan laughed .
" Come on , you 're both being silly , " she said , " Let 's go
to the disco . "
LESSON 1 : Sounds , names and a few attitudes
The first thing you need to do when you learn a foreign language is to
become familiar with the sounds of the language and how they are
written , and the same goes for Lojban .
Fortunately , Lojban sounds
( phonemes ) are fairly straightforward .
Vowels
There are six vowels in Lojban .
a ~--~as in " f a ther " ( not as in " hat " )
~--~as in " f ther " ( not as in " hat " ) e~--~as in " get "
i ~--~as in Italian " v i no " ( not as in " hit " )
~--~as in Italian " v no " ( not as in " hit " ) o~ --~as in " so "
u~--~as in " cool " ( not as in " but " )
These are pretty much the same as vowels in Italian or Spanish .
The
sixth vowel , y , is called a " schwa " in the
language trade , and is pronounced like the first and last " A "s in
" America " ( that 's English " America " , not Spanish ) .
It 's the sound that
comes out when the mouth is completely relaxed .
Two vowels together are pronounced as one sound ( diphthong ) .
Some
examples are :
ai~ --~as in " h igh "
" au ~ --~as in " how "
ei~--~as in " h ey "
" oi~--~as in " boy "
ia~--~ like German " Ja "
ie~--~ like " yeah "
iu~ --~ like " you "
ua~--~as in " quark "
ue ~--~as in " q ue stion "
stion " uo ~--~as in " quote "
ui~--~ like " we " , or French " oui "
Double vowels are rare .
Two examples are ii , which is pronounced like English " ye " ( as in " Oh
come all ye faithful " ) or Chinese " yi " , and uu ,
pronounced " wu " .
Consonants
Most Lojban consonants are the same as English , but there are some
exceptions :
c ~--~" sh " , as in " sh ip "
~--~" sh " , as in " ip " j~--~as in " measure " or French " bonjour "
x ~--~as in German " Bach " , Spanish " Jose " or Arabic " Khaled "
The English sounds " ch " and " j " are written as tc and dj .
Lojban
does n't use the letters H , Q or W .
Special Characters
Lojban has no punctuation , but some of the characters normally used
in punctuation affect the way Lojban is pronounced .
A full stop
( period ) is a short pause to stop words running into each other .
An
apostrophe separates two vowels , and is pronounced like an H. For
example , ui is normally pronounced " we " , but u'i is " oohee " .
Commas are rare in Lojban , but can be used to stop two vowels blurring together when you do n't want to
use an apostrophe ( which would put a " h " between them ) .
No Lojban words
have commas , but they 're sometimes used in writing non-Lojban names , for
example pi , ER . ( Pierre ) .
Capital letters are not normally used in Lojban .
We use them in non-Lojban words ( like
Pierre ) when the stress of a word is different from the Lojban norm .
This is to put the stress on the last - but - one syllable , so , for example ,
kurmikce ( nurse ) is kurmikce , not kurmikce .
The name " Juliette " would be written DJUli , et. if pronounced in an English way , but julIET .
if pronounced as in French .
" Correct " pronunciation
You do n't have to be very precise about Lojban pronunciation ,
because the phonemes are designed so that it is hard to mistake one
sound for another .
This means that rather than one " correct "
pronunciation , there is a range of acceptable pronunciation ~--~ the
general principle is that anything is OK so long as it does n't sound too
much like something else .
For example , Lojban r can be pronounced like the R in English , Scottish or French .
Two things to be careful of , though , are pronouncing Lojban i and u like Standard
British English " hit " and " but " ( Northern English " but " is fine ! ) .
This
is because non-Lojban vowels , particularly these two , are used to
separate consonants by people who find them hard to say .
For example ,
if you have problems spitting out the zd in zdani ( house ) , you can say " zIdani " ~--~ the first
I is very short , but the second has to be long .
Lojban with attitude !
If you tried pronouncing the vowel combinations above , you 've
already said some Lojban words .
Lojban has a class of words called
" attitudinal indicators " , which express how the speaker feels about
something .
The most basic ones consist of two vowels , sometimes with an
apostrophe in the middle .
Here are some of the most useful ones .
. a'o hope
.au desire
. a'u interest
. ie agreement
.i'e approval
. ii fear ( think of " Eeek ! " )
.iu love
. oi complaint
.ua discovery , " Ah , I get it ! "
.ue surprise
.u'e wonder , " Wow ! "
. ui happiness
.u'i amusement
.uu pity , sympathy *
.u'u repentance , " I 'm sorry ! "
In English , people have started to avoid the word " pity " , because it
has come to have associations of superiority .
.uu is just the raw emotion ~--~ if you wanted to
express pity in this rather condescending way , you 'd probably say .uuga 'i~--~" pity combined with a sense of
superiority , " or .uuvu'e~ --~" pity combined
with a sense of virtue . "
There again , you would probably just keep your
mouth shut .
You can make any of these into its opposite by adding nai , so .uinai means " I'm
unhappy " , .aunai is reluctance , .uanai is confusion ( " I do n't get it " ) and so on .
You can also combine them .
For example , .iu.uinai would mean " I am unhappily in love . "
In
this way you can even create words to express emotions which your native
language does n't have .
Attitudinal indicators are extremely useful and it is well worth
making an effort to learn the most common ones .
One of the biggest
problems people have when trying to speak in a foreign language is that ,
while they 've learned how to buy a kilo of olives or ask the way to the
post office , they can't express feelings , because many languages do this
in a round - about way ( outside group therapy , very few British people
would say outright that they were sad , for example ! ) .
In Lojban you can
be very direct , very briefly ( there are ways of " softening " these
emotions , which we 'll get to in a later lesson ) .
In fact , these
attitudinals are so useful that some Lojbanists use them even when
they 're writing in English , rather like emoticons ( those e-mail symbols
like ;-) :-( etc. ) .
Exercise 1
Using the attitudinal indicators above ( including
negatives ) , what might you say in the following situations ?
You 've just realised where you left your keys .
Someone treads on your toes .
You 're watching a boring film .
Someone 's just told you a funny story .
You disagree with someone .
Someone 's just taken the last cookie in the jar .
You really do n't like someone .
You are served a cold , greasy meal .
Your friend has just failed a test .
There is a large green beetle crawling towards you .
Lojban Names ( cmene )
Watch any film where people do n't know each other 's language .
They
start off saying things like " Me Tarzan , " which is as good a place to
start learning Lojban as any .
So here we go .
mi'e robin .
I - am - named Robin ; I 'm Robin
mi'e is related to mi , which is " I " , " me " and so on .
It 's a good
example of the apostrophe separating two vowels , and sounds a bit like
" me hey " .
I am lucky because my name goes directly into Lojban without any
changes .
However , there are some rules for Lojban names which mean that
some names have to be " Lojbanised " .
This may sound strange ~--~ after
all , a name is a name ~--~ but in fact all languages do this to some
extent .
For example , English speakers tend to pronounce " Jose " something
like " Hozey " , and " Margaret " in Chinese is magelita .
Some sounds just do n't exist in some
languages , so the first thing you need to do is rewrite the name so that
it only contains Lojban sounds , and is spelled in a Lojban way .
Let 's take the English name " Susan " .
The two S's are pronounced
differently ~--~ the second one is actually a Z~ -- ~ and the A is not
really an " a " sound , it 's the " schwa " we just mentioned .
So " Susan "
comes out in Lojban as suzyn ..
You may have noticed the extra full stop ( period ) there .
This is
necessary because if you did n't pause , you might not know where the name
ended and the next word began .
In addition , if a name
begins with a vowel , you need a full stop there as
well .
For example :
.an. Anne
.axmet .
Ahmet
.eduard .
Edward
. IBraxim . or .
IBra'im .
Ibrahim
.odin. Odin
You can also put a full stop in between a person 's first and last names
( though it 's not compulsory ) , so " Jim Jones " becomes djim.djonz . .
An important rule for Lojbanising names is that the last letter of a cmene ( Lojban name ) must be a consonant .
Again ,
this is to prevent confusion as to where a name ends , and what is and is
not a name ( all other Lojban words end in a vowel ) .
We usually use S
for this , so in Lojban , " Mary " becomes meris . ,
" Joe " becomes djos .
and so on .
An alternative
is to leave out the last vowel , so " Mary " would become mer .
or meir ..
A few combinations of letters are illegal in Lojbanised names ,
because they can be confused with Lojban words : la , lai and doi .
So " Alabamas " can't be .alabamas .
but needs to be .alybamas . , for example .
The final point is stress .
As we 've seen , Lojban words are stressed
on the penultimate syllable , and if a name has different stress , we use
capital letters .
This means that the English and French names " Robert "
come out differently in Lojban : the English name is robyt . in UK English , or rabyrt .
in some American dialects , but the French is
roBER ..
To give an idea of how all this works , here are some names of famous
people in their own language and in Lojban .
English
Margaret Thatcher - magryt.tatcys .
( no " th " in Lojban because most people around the world can't say it ! )
( no " th " in Lojban because most people around the world can't say it ! )
Mick Jagger - mik.djagys .
French
Napoleon - napolion .
Juliette Binoche - julIET.binOC .
Chinese
Laozi - laudzys .
Mao Zedong - maus.dzeDYNG .
Turkish
Mustafa Kemal - MUStafas.kemal .
Erkin Koray - .erkin.korais .
German
Ludwig Wittgenstein - ludvig.VITgynctain .
Clara Schumann - klaras.cuman .
Spanish
Isabel Allende - .izaBEL.aiendes .
Che Guevara - tcegevaras .

Lojbanise the following names :
John
Melissa
Amanda
Matthew
Michael
David Bowie
Jane Austen
William Shakespeare
Sigourney Weaver
Richard Nixon
Quito
Istanbul
Madrid
Tokyo
San Salvador
Lojban words as names
By now you should be able to Lojbanise your own name .
However , if
you prefer , you can translate your name into Lojban ( if you know what it
means , of course ) or adopt a completely new Lojban identity .
Native
Americans generally translate their name when speaking English , partly
because they have meaningful names , and partly because they do n't expect
the wasichu to be able to pronounce words in
Lakota , Navaho or whatever !
All Lojban words end in a vowel , and although you
can use them as names as they stand , it 's common to
leave out the final vowel to make it absolutely clear that this is a
name and not something else ( Lojban goes for overkill when it comes to
possible misunderstanding ) .
So if your name or nickname is Cat ( Lojban
mlatu ) , you can either add s like a normal cmene to
make mlatus . , or just chop the end off and call
yourself mlat ..
Here are a few examples :
Fish - finpe - finp .
- Bear - cribe - crib .
Green - crino - crin .
- Mei Li ( Chinese = beautiful ) - melbi - melb .
Ayhan ( Turkish = Moon Lord ) - lunra nobli ( = lurnobli ) -
lurnoblis .

Exercise 3
There are usually alternative spellings for names , either because
people pronounce the originals differently , or because the exact sound
does n't exist in Lojban , so you need to choose between two Lojban
letters .
This does n't matter , so long as everyone knows who or where
you 're talking about .

LESSON 2 : Relationships and places
Names and relationships
In Lesson 1 we looked at cmene , Lojban names .
cmene always label one particular thing .
Just as in English , if I say " Mary " ,
I mean one particular person called Mary , no matter how many people
there are in the world called Mary , so in Lojban , meiris .
can
only refer to one person .
This means that cmene can never
stand for classes of things ( like " person " , " dog " or " computer " ) or for
relationships between things ( like " loves " , " gives " or " is inside " ) .
Relationships are the key to Lojban , and words describing a relationship
are called selbri .
A selbri is not a type of word ( like a " verb " in English ) , it is
something that some types of word can do .
Various types of word can act as selbri , but cmene , as we 've seen , can't .
The main type of word used as a selbri is a gismu , or root - word .
These are the building blocks of Lojban vocabulary .
gismu are easy to recognise , because they always have five letters , in the form
CVCCV or
CCVCV ( C=consonant ; V=vowel ) .
Exercise 1
Which of the following Lojban words are :
( a ) gismu
( b ) cmene
( c ) neither ?
Note : I 've left out the full stops in the cmene ~--~ that would make it too easy !
lojban
dunda
ankaras
mi
cukta
prenu
blanu
ka'e
dublin
selbri
Now we can recognise a gismu , let 's see what we can make it do .
dunda means " give " , and as a selbri describes a relationship between a giver , something they give , and someone who receives it .
Let 's say we have
three people , Maria , Claudia and Julia .
If we say
la mari , as. dunda la .iulias .
la klaudias .
we mean that Maria gives Julia to Claudia ~ --~ let 's say Julia is a baby , as since the abolition of slavery , we do n't normally give people as presents .
In English you can " give " someone in marriage , but that 's
a culture - specific metaphor , and Lojban discourages that kind of thing ~ -- ~it 's an example of malglico ( " bloody
English " ) , transferring features of English into Lojban which do n't
work .
If , on the other hand , we say
la .iulias .
dunda la mari , as. la klaudias .
we mean that Maria is the baby , and Julia gives her to Claudia .
How do
we know this ?
English uses the word " to " to indicate the receiver , and
in some other languages ( like Latin or Turkish ) the form of the words
themselves change .
In Lojban , as in logic , we have what is called
place - structure .
Place - structure means that
dunda does n't just mean " give " , it means x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} gives x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} to x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB}
where " x " means someone or something .
Even if we just say dunda on its own , we still mean that someone gives
something to someone ; we just are n't interested in ( or we already know who or what .
We can say , then , that dunda has three " places " .
We can think of places as slots which we can , if we want , fill with people , objects , events or whatever .
These places are called sumti in Lojban ( easy to remember , as it sounds a bit like someone saying " something " and chewing off the end of the word ) .
Again , a sumti is not a type of word , it is something a word does .
The simplest Lojban sentence is a bridi , i.e. a selbri and a bunch of sumti .
In other words ,
bridi = selbri + sumti
Note for logicians and computer programmers : for selbri read " function " ; for sumti read " argument . "
How many sumti can a selbri describe ?
The number depends on the place structure of the word we use for the selbri ( there are ways of tagging on extra sumti , which we 'll cover in later lessons ) .
A gismu has a set number of places ; as we 've just seen , dunda has three .
The number of places varies from one to a staggering ( and rare ) five .
Here are some examples .
One place
ninmu x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is a woman ( any female humanoid person , not necessarily adult )
blabi x{SUB( ) }1{SUB} is white / very light - coloured
cmila x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} laughs [ [ not necessarily at someone or something ~--~ to include the object of the laughter you would use the lujvo ( compound word ) mi'afra~--~x{SUB( ) }1{SUB} laughs at x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} , a slightly different concept ] ]
Two places
cipni x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is a bird / avian / fowl of species x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB}
vofli x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} flies in air / atmosphere using lifting / propulsion means x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB}
jungo x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} reflects Chinese Mandarin , Cantonese , Wu , etc. culture / nationality / language in aspect x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB}
junri x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} ( person ) is serious / earnest / has gravity about x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} ( event / state / activity )
Three places
xamgu x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is good / beneficial / acceptable for x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} by standard x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} [ [ This is very Lojbanic ~ --~ the English word " good " on its own is so vague as to be almost meaningless .
It is also slightly malglico to put a person in the x{SUB ( ) }1 {SUB} place , which is normally filled by an object , state or event ~--~ or moral good you would usually use vrude ~--~" virtuous " ] ]
pritu x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is to the right of x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} facing x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} remember all those times you have to ask " Is that my right or your right ? " in English
cliva x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} leaves x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} for x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} by means x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB}
kabri x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is a cup / glass / tumbler / mug / vessel / bowl containing contents x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} , and of material x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB}
Four places
vecnu x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} seller sells / vends x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} goods / service / commodity to buyer x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} for amount / cost / expense x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB}
tivni tiv television x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} broadcaster televises programming x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} via media / channel x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} to television receiver x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB}
Five places
klama x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} goes / comes to x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} from x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} via x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB} by means x{SUB ( ) }5{SUB}
cukta x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is a book about subject / theme / story x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} by author x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} for audience x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB} preserved in medium x{SUB ( ) }5{SUB}
funva x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} translates x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} to language x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} from language x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB} with translation - result x{SUB ( ) }5{SUB}
Determining place structure
If all these places sound a bit daunting , do n't worry ~ --~ you do n't have to memorise all of them ( in fact nobody does ) .
There are a few cases where it's worth learning the place structure to avoid misunderstanding , but usually you can guess place structures using context and a few rules of thumb .
The first place is often the person or thing who does something or is something ( in Lojban there is no difference between " doing " and " being " ) .
If there is someone or something that has something done to them he / she / it is usually in the second place .
" to " places nearly always come before " from " places .
Less -used places come towards the end .
These tend to be things like " by standard " , " by means " or " made of " .
The general idea is that the places which are most likely to be filled come first .
You do n't have to use all the available places , and any unfilled places at the end are simply missed out .
Exercise 2
Try to guess the place structure of the following gismu .
You probably wo n't get them all , but you should be able to guess the most important ones .
Think of what needs to be in the sentence for it to make sense , then
add anything you think would be useful .
For example , with klama , you need to know who 's coming and going , and
although you could in theory say " Julie goes , " it would be pretty meaningless if you did n't add where she goes to .
Where she starts her journey , the route she takes and what transport she uses are progressively less important , so they occupy the third , fourth and fifth places .
karce - car
nelci - like
cmene - name
sutra - fast
crino - green
sisti - stop , cease
cmima - member
barda - big
cusku - say , express
tavla - talk , chat
gismu as sumti
So far we 've seen how a gismu can express a relationship between two or more cmene , so we
can say things like
la bil .
nelci la meilis .
Bill likes Mei Li
But if we do n't know her name , how can we say " Bill likes the woman " ?
If we say la bil .
nelci la ninmu , we mean that Bill likes someone whose name is " Woman " .
What we say , in fact , is
la bil .
nelci le ninmu
What does le mean here ?
We translated it into English as " the " , but that is n't quite it .
The best way to think of it
is " the thing ( s ) I call " .
la + cmene is like a permanent label ( Bill is always Bill ) .
le +
gismu is more like a temporary label ~ -- ~ I have something in mind , and choose to call it " woman " .
Probably she really is a woman , but with le this does n't have to be so ~--~ we could be talking about a transvestite or a stone that looks a bit like a woman .
There are other articles which can show that it 's a real woman , or a typical woman or whatever , but we 'll leave those alone for the time being .
One more word is sometimes necessary when using gismu as sumti : cu .
This does n't carry any meaning , but separates the selbri from whatever comes before it .
It 's not necessary with cmene , because they can't run
over into anything else , but le ninmu klama does n't mean " The woman goes " ; ninmu and klama get run together , with the result that it means " The woman - type - of goer " ( maybe a female traveler ) .
What we say
instead is
le ninmu cu klama
IMPORTANT !
cu does NOT mean " is " ( as in " The woman is going " ) .
In fact it does n't mean anything ~-- ~it 's just there to indicate that there 's a selbri coming .
You can also use cu after a cmene , but it is n't usually necessary .
Similarly , you do n't need cu after mi ( I / me ) , do ( you , the person I 'm talking to ) or any words like this ( " pro-sumti " , in Lojban jargon ) .
Exercise 3
Add cu to the following Lojban sentences where necessary , then work out what they mean .
la klaudias .
dunda le cukta la bil .
le karci sutra
la kamIL. cukta
mi fanva la kaMIL .
la lojban
le prenu sisti
le ninmu cliva
la .istanbul .
barda
mi tavla la mari , as .
la meiris .
pritu la meilis .

le cipni vofli
crino
ninmu
Changing Places
We 've seen that if we do n't need all the places ( and we rarely do ) , then we can miss out the unnecessary ones at the end of the bridi .
We can also miss out the first place if it is obvious ( just as in Spanish ) .
However , it sometimes
happens that we want places at the end , but not all the ones in the middle .
There are a number of ways to get round this problem .
One way is to fill the unnecessary places with zo'e , which means " something not important " .
So la suzyn .
klama la paris .
la berlin .
zo'e le karci tells us that Susan goes to Paris from Berlin by car , but we 're not interested in the route she takes .
In fact zo'e is always implied , even if we do n't say it .
If someone says klama , what
they actually mean is zo'e klama zo'e zo'e zo'e zo'e but it would be pretty silly to say all that .
Most people do n't want more than one zo'e in a sentence ( though there 's nothing to stop you using as many as you like ) .
A more popular way to play around with places is to use the place tags fa , fe , fi , fo and
fu .
These mark a sumti with a certain place , no matter where it comes in the sentence .
For
example ,
la suzyn .
klama fu le karce Susan goes in the car / Susan goes by car
fu marks le karce as the fifth place ( the means of transport ) .
Without fu , the sentence would mean " Susan goes to the car . "
With place tags you can also swap places around .
For example ,
fe le cukta cu dunda fi la klaudias .
The book was given to Claudia .
Again , you probably do n't want to overdo place tags , or you 'll end up counting on your fingers ( although they 're very popular in Lojban poetry ~ --~ place tags , that is , not fingers ) .
A final way to change places is conversion , which actually swaps them round , but we 'll leave that for another lesson .
There are no rules for which method you use , and you can use them in any way you want , so long as the person you 're talking to understands .
Summary
In this lesson we 've covered the following points :
The basic bridi structure .
structure .
The difference between cmene and gismu , and the article le .
The place structure of gismu .
. cu to separate selbri from sumti .

Although there is a lot more to Lojban sentences than this , you now have the basics of Lojban grammar ~ --~ the rest is just a matter of adding things on to it ~--~ different articles , tags , times , numbers and so on .
Answers to exercises
Exercise 1
lojban - cmene
dunda - gismu ( give )
.ankaras . - cmene ( the capital of Turkey )
mi - neither , it 's a type of cmavo ( structure word ) called a " pro-sumti " , a word that stands in for a sumti , like an English pronoun stands in for a noun
cukta - gismu ( book )
prenu - gismu ( person )
blanu - gismu ( blue )
ka'e - neither , it 's a cmavo or structure word , meaning " can "
dublin . - cmene ( the capital of Ireland )
selbri - neither , it 's a lujvo or compound word
Exercise 2
karce
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is a car / automobile / truck / van a wheeled motor vehicle for carrying x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} , propelled by x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB}
nelci
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is fond of / likes / has a taste for x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} ( object / state )
cmene
x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} ( quoted word (s ] is a / the name / title / tag of x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} to /used - by namer / name - user x{SUB ( ) }3 {SUB} ( person )
sutra x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is fast / swift / quick / hastes / rapid at doing / being / bringing about x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} ( event / state )
crino
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is green
sisti
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} ceases / stops / halts activity / process / state x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} not necessarily completing it
cmima
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is a member / element of set x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} ; x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} belongs to group x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} ; x{SUB( ) }1{SUB} is amid/ among / amongst group x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB}
barda
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is big / large in property / dimension (s ) x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} as compared with standard / norm x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB}
cusku
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} expresses / says x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} for audience x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} via expressive medium x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB}
tavla x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB}
talks / speaks to x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} about subject x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} in language x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB}
Note the different place structures of cusku and tavla .
With cusku the emphasis is on communication ; what is communicated is more important than who it is communicated to .
Quotes in e-mails frequently start with " do cusku di'e " ( di'e means " the following " ) as the Lojban equivalent of " You wrote " ( ciska - " write " - places more emphasis on the physical act of writing ) .
With tavla the emphasis is rather more on the social act of talking ~--~ you can tavla about nothing in particular .
Exercise 3
la klaudias .
dunda le cukta la bil .
Claudia gives the book (s ) to Bill .
le karce cu sutra
The car (s ) is / are fast .
la kamIL. cukta
" Camille " is a book .
mi fanva la kaMIL .
la lojban
I translate " Camille " into Lojban .
le prenu cu sisti
The person (s ) stop (s ) whatever it was they were doing
le ninmu cu cliva
The woman / women leave (s )
la .istanbul .
barda
Istanbul is big .
( an understatement ~--~ it has a population of over ten million )
mi tavla la mari, a.
I talk to Maria .
la meiris .
pritu la meilis .
mi
Mary is on the right of Mei Li , if you 're facing me .
le cipni cu vofli
The bird (s ) flies / fly
crino
It 's / they 're green .
ninmu
She 's a woman /
They 're women / There 's a woman / There are some women
In sentences 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 and 9 , cu is possible but not necessary .
In the last two sentences , cu is impossible , since it has to separate the selbri from the sumti that comes before it , and there are no sumti here .
Note that I have translated these sentences in the present tense ( since in English you have to choose a tense ) but they could be in any tense , so le cipni cu vofli could also mean " The bird flew " , for example .
We 'll look at how Lojban expresses tense in later lessons ; just remember that you do n't actually need it ~--~ normally it 's obvious whether an action takes place in the past , present or future .
Lesson 3
Commands , Requests and Questions
So far we 've looked at simple propositions , sentences that say that
something is true .
You can , in theory , say anything you want with
propositions , but it 's pretty inconvenient .
For example , if I want you
to run , I could say just that :
" I want you to run "
but I 'd probably just say :
" Run ! "
How do we do this in Lojban ?
We can't copy English grammar and just say
bajra , since , as we 've seen , this means " Someone / something
runs " .
Instead we say
ko bajra
ko means you , the person I 'm talking to , but only in commands
( in normal sentences it 's do ) .
Normally it comes in the first
place of the bridi , since normally you 're asking people to do
something or be something , not to have something done to them .
However ,
you can put it elsewhere , e.g .
nelci ko
This means something like " Act so that someone unspecified likes you " ,
and sounds pretty odd in English , but you could use it in the sense of
" Try to make a good impression . "
Another example is :
mi dunda le cifnu ko
or " Act so that I give the baby to you , " with the possible meaning " Get
up and put your cigarette out ~-- ~I 'm going to pass you the baby . "
You can even have ko in two places in a bridi , for example ,
ko kurji ko Act so that you take care of you
or in other words , " Take care of yourself . "
In fact , since we can put
the selbri anywhere other than the beginning of the sentence
( since this would imply " someone / something " for the first place ) , we can
( and do ) say
ko ko kurji
Exercise 1
Imagine that someone says these things to you .
What is it that they want you to do ?
ko klama mi
ko dunda le cukta mi
la .izaBEL .
nelci ko
ko sutra
ko ko nelci
So far we 've looked at simple commands .
However , outside the army , we
do n't normally use these very much ~--~ normally we ask people politely .
Foreigners in England often make the mistake of thinking that putting
" Please " in front of a command makes it into a polite request , which it
does n't ( in English we usually have to make it into a question e.g .
" Could you open the window ? " ) .
Fortunately , in Lojban , " please " really
is the magic word .
Putting the attitudinal .e'o before a
sentence with ko changes it into a request e.g .
.e'o ko dunda le cukta mi
is literally " Please give me the book , " but is actually more like " Could
you give me the book , please ? "
Questions
In English , we make a yes / no question by changing the
order of the words ( e.g . " You are ... " ->
" Are you ... " ) or putting some
form of " do " at the beginning ( e.g . " Does she smoke ? " ) .
This seems
perfectly natural to someone whose native language is English ( or
German , or whatever ) but is actually unnecessarily complicated ( as any
speaker of Chinese or Turkish will tell you ) .
In Lojban we can turn any
proposition into a yes / no question by simply putting xu at the
beginning .
Some examples :
xu do nelci la bil .
Do you like Bill ?
xu mi klama
Am I coming ?
xu crino
Is it green ?
There are two ways to answer these questions .
Lojban , like some other
languages , does not have words that mean " yes " or " no " .
One way to
answer " yes " is to repeat the selbri e.g .
xu do nelci la bil .
nelci
We can also use go'i , which repeats the last bridi .
In this case ,
though , it does n't mean do nelci la bil .
but mi nelci la bil .~--~it is
the meaning , rather than the words of the bridi which are repeated .
In
other words , in an answer to a yes / no question , it means " yes " .
What about negative answers ?
Any bridi can be made negative by
using na .
This negates the whole of the bridi , so you can put
it anywhere you want ~--~ most people either put it right at the beginning ,
or before the selbri ( I prefer the beginning , since then it is
clearer that I 'm negating the whole thing ) .
So na mi nelci la bil .
means
" It is not true that I like Bill , " or in other words , " I do n't like Bill . "
As an answer to a question , we do the same thing , so we just say na nelci or na go'i .
Logical note : Negatives are a lot more complicated than they look , in
both English and Lojban .
Strictly speaking , na mi nelci la bil .
is
true even if I 've never heard of Bill ( since it 's pretty hard to like
someone you know nothing about ) .
We 'll look at some other negatives
later , but for the time being na will do fine .
Just as in
English , if you ask someone if they like Bill , and they reply " No "
because they have n't met him , they 're being amazingly unhelpful .
English also has a number of " wh - " questions ~ --~ " who " , " what " etc .
In
Lojban we use one word for all of these : ma .
This is like an
instruction to fill in the missing place .
For example :
do klama ma la london .
" Where are you going ? " " London "
ma klama la london .
la klaudias .
" Who 's going to London ? " " Claudia . "
mi dunda ma do le cukta " I give what to you ? " ( probably meaning " What was it I was supposed to be giving you ? " )
" The book . "
Finally we have mo .
This is like ma , but questions a
selbri , not a sumti~--~it 's like English " What does X
do ? " or " What is X ? " ( remember being and doing are the same ! ) .
More
logically , we can see mo as asking someone to describe the
relationship between the sumti in the question .
For example :
do mo la klaudias .
" You ??? Claudia "
The answer depends on the context .
Possible answers to this question
are :
nelci " I like her . "
pendo " I am her friend "
prami " I adore / am in love with her . "
xebni " I hate her . "
fengu " I 'm angry with her . "
cinba " I kissed her . "
Note that the time is not important here : just as cinba can
mean " kiss " , " kissed " , " will kiss " and so on , mo does not ask a
question about any particular time .
There are ways to specify
time in Lojban , but it 's not necessary to use them ( just to satisfy your
curiosity though , " I kissed Claudia " is mi pu cinba la klaudias . ) .
We 've said that mo can also be a " What is
... " type of question .
The simplest example is ti mo ~--~" What
is this ? " .
You could also ask la meilis .
mo , which could mean
" Who is Mei Li ? " , " What is Mei Li ? " , " What is Mei Li doing ? " and so on .
Again , the answer depends on the context .
For example :
ninmu " She 's a woman . "
jungo " She 's Chinese . "
pulji " She 's a policewoman . "
sanga
" She 's a singer " or " She 's singing . "
melbi " She 's beautiful . " ( possibly a pun , since this is what " meili " means in Chinese ! )
There are ways to be more specific , but these normally involve a
ma question ; for example la meilis .
gasnu ma ( " Mei Li
does what ? " ) .
There are more question words in Lojban , but
xu , ma and mo are enough for most of what you
might want to ask .
Three other important questions , xo ( " How
many ? " ) ca ma ( " When ? ) and pei ( " How do you feel about
it ? " ) will come in the lessons on numbers , time and attitudes .

Lesson 4 : Numbers , and a few more articles
One of the first things you learn in a new language is how to count , and
this course is no exception .
However , in Lojban , numbers include much
more than just counting ; for example , in Lojban , " some " , " many " and
" most " are numbers .
Basic numbers
The numbers from one to nine are as follows :
pa
re
ci
vo
mu
xa
ze
bi
so
This leaves zero , which is no ( think " yes , we have no bananas " ) .
You may have noticed that the numbers repeat the vowels AEIOU .
Since you
ca n't get by without memorising numbers , try to think of mnemonics for the
unfamiliar ones .
For example , although the sound is different , xa
has the X of " six " , and I remembered so by thinking of the proverb
" A stitch in time saves nine , " which is about sewing ( .oi ) .
Numbers from 10 onwards are made by putting the digits together , just like
you 'd say a telephone number .
For example :
pano 10
zebi 78
xanoci 603
vomusore 4,592
4,592 has a comma in it ( or a full stop in some languages , just to make
things confusing ) .
We ca n't use a comma in Lojban , because that means
" separate these two syllables " ( as we saw in Lesson 1 with Lojbanised names
like zo , is. for " Zoe " ) .
What we say instead is ki'o .
We
do n't have to use ki'o , but it can make things clearer .
It also
has the advantage that if the following digits are all zeroes , we do n't
need to say them , so 3,000 is ci ki'o .
You can remember
ki'o easily if you think of " kilo " ~ --~a thousand .
Just as we have a word for a comma , we also have one for a decimal point :
pi ( do n't get this mixed up with the number " pi " - 3.1415 ... ! ) .
So
5.3 is mupici .
In fact , pi is not always decimal ~--~ it's
the point for whatever system you 're using .
Question :
What is the difference between the following numbers ?
pareci
li pa li re li ci
The first one , as we 've seen , has to be " one hundred and twenty - three , " so
the second is " one , two , three . " li is the article for numbers .
Exercise 1
What are the following numbers in Lojban ?
( do n't forget li ! )
35
4,802
6,000
7.54
6,891,573.905
Numbers and articles
So far , we 've looked at three articles : la , for cmene ,
le , for sumti and li for numbers .
So li bi
is " the number eight . "
Actually , outside mathematics , li is not
used very much .
What we usually want to say is things like " three people , "
or " the two women . "
Note for mathematicians : Lojban has a number of words to deal with
basic mathematics , and also an incredible number of words to deal with just
about any mathematical expression you can think of in a separate subset of
the language .
But come on guys , this is a beginners ' course .
We can use numbers either before or after le .
For example ,
ci le gerku means " three of the dogs " , while
le ci gerku means " the three dogs . "
What do we do , though , if we just want to say " three dogs " ?
For this we
need another article , lo .
The logic of lo is pretty
complicated , but it basically means " something which really is , " which nine
times out of ten is the same as English " a " or " some " ( translating Lojban
grammar into English like this is a mortal sin , but even so , this is the
best thing to do with lo at this stage ! ) .
Note for logicians : lo prenu cu klama expresses the proposition
" There exists at least one person , such that that person goes . "
ci lo gerku therefore means " three of those which really are dogs " ,
or in plain words , " three dogs " .
lo ci gerku , however , means that
there are only three dogs in the world , which is not something you 'd really
want to say ( mathematicians and logicians can look up the relevant parts of
The Complete Lojban Language if they want clarification on this
issue ) .
Let us now consider the English sentence " Three dogs bit me . "
This actually
has two possible meanings .
The one we would expect is that I was attacked
by a pack of dogs , and all of them bit me .
However , I could be an extremely
unfortunate person who was bitten by three separate dogs on three different
occasions .
Lojban is a logical language , and so does not tolerate this
confusion !
If I say ci lo gerku cu batci mi , I just mean that three
dogs bite me .
Maybe one dog bit me in the morning , one in the afternoon ,
and one at night , or maybe I mean that I have been bitten by a dog three
times in my life .
However , if I say lu'o ci lo gerku cu batci mi , I mean that a group of three dogs bit me .
lu'o means
" the mass composed of " and in effect converts a bunch of individuals into a
coherent unit .
If you 're a fan of computer strategy games , think of
lu'o as like the " group " command for units ( there 's also an
" ungroup " command , lu'a ) .
With le things are simpler .
While le pano ninmu means " the
ten women " , '' ' lei pano ninmu means " the ten women treated as a
group or mass " .
Let 's imagine that ten women I have in mind kiss me on ten
separate occasions .
I could then say le pano ninmu cu cinba mi , in
which case I 'd consider myself quite fortunate .
However , if I say
' ''lei pano ninmu cu cinba mi , I mean that the ten women kiss me
en masse , in which case I would consider myself either blessed or
harassed ( maybe I 'm a rock star or something ) .
However , it does not
necessarily mean that each and every woman kisses me , simply that I was
mobbed by a group of ten women and kissed by one or ( probably ) more in the
process .
Proportions
Warning : this section gets into some tricky logical stuff .
Skip it if
you 're not interested .
Question :
If le ci prenu means " the three people , " and re le prenu means " two of the people , how do you say " two of the three
people " ?
You probably go this one pretty easily : re le ci prenu .
If ,
however , we use lo , the meaning changes .
We can't say re lo ci prenu to mean two out of any three people ( i.e. two thirds of the
population ) .
This is because while le ci prenu means the three
people that I have in mind , by the same logic , lo ci prenu means
the three people that actually exist , i.e. that there are only three people
in the universe .
You would therefore only use the number + lo+number
formula if you knew the actual numbers rather than just the proportions ,
e.g .
re lo mi ci mensi cu nelci la rikis. martin .
Two of my three sisters like Ricky Martin .
This states two facts : that I have three sisters ( not actually true ! ) and
that two of them like Ricky Martin ( it does n't actually state that my third sister hates him ~--~ she may be indifferent to him , or never have heard
of him ) .
If I use le in the same sentence , it is n't actually wrong ,
but it allows the possibility that I have , say , five sisters , but I 'm only
talking about three of them !
This is one of the few areas where le
and lo are not like " the " and " a / some " .
One way out of this is to use fi'u , which is like the Lojban slash
sign .
So " two out of every three people " is really " 2/3 of people " , or
refi'uci lo prenu
Quantities
I 've said that words like " most " and " many " are numbers in Lojban , which is
pretty logical if you think about it .
The following " numbers " are
particularly useful :
no none ( we 've already seen this as " zero " )
ro each / all
so 'a almost all
so'e most
so 'i many / a lot of
so'o several
so'u few
su'e at most
su'o at least
Some examples :
no le ninmu cu nelci la bil .
None of the women like Bill .
no lo ninmu cu nelci la bil .
No women like Bill .
because '' ' ' ' lo ninmu ' '_ potentially includes all women that exist
coi rodo
Hi , everyone
mi nelci ro lo mlatu I like all cats .
mi na nelci ro lo gerku
It 's not true that I like all dogs .
( this is not the same as " I do n't like any dogs " , which would be mi nelci no lo gerku or mi na'e nelci rolo gerku~ -- ~ " I other - than - like all dogs " )
so 'i lo merko cu nelci la nirvanas .
Many Americans like Nirvana ( the
group , not the mystical state ) .
so'u lo jungo cu nelci la nirvanas .
Few Chinese people like Nirvana .
su'e mu le muno prenu cu cmila
No more than five out of the fifty people laugh ( ed ) ( let 's say a comedian told a bad joke ) .
su'o pa lo prenu cu prami do At least one person loves you .
This last one is logically the same as lo prenu cu prami do , which
means " there exists at least one person such that that person loves you , "
but it makes the meaning clearer and more emphatic .
Exercise 2
Translate the following sentences .
All babies are beautiful .
The pack of three cats bite the dog .
What a surprise !
Mei Li loves two men . ( use an attitudinal indicator )
Most men love at least one woman .
It is not true that all men love at least one woman .
The group of four women kiss Ricky Martin .
It 's a shame that no - one likes Bill .
( use an attitudinal indicator )
The baby bites two people ( separately ) .
One in three women like David Bowie .
No more than 15 % of Buddhists eat meat .
( " Buddhist " is budjo , as you may remember from Lesson 3 ) .
Nine out of ten cats like " Whiskas . " ( use a cmene )
Number Questions
Remembering the sentence re lo mi ci mensi cu nelci la rikis.
martin. , how would I answer the following question ?
xo le mensi cu nelci rikis.
martin .
The answer , of course is re , which means that xo is the question word for numbers ( though not all questions that can be answered with a number have to take xo , as we 'll see in the next lesson ) .
xo is also used in mathematics , as in
li ci su'i vo du li xo 3 + 4 = ?
A few more examples :
xo le botpi cu kunti
How many of the bottles are empty ?
xo lo prenu cu klama ti How many people come here ?
do viska xo lo sonci
How many soldiers do you see ?
Note :
It is not actually necessary to include the lo after
xo .
In fact , it is n't necessary after any number ~--~ for example
ci lo gerku could be simply ci gerku , if you prefer .
However , many Lojbanists prefer to keep the lo for the sake of
clarity .
A final question
Lojban has no difference between singular and plural ~ --~ " the dog " and " the
dogs " can both be le gerku .
But suppose you wanted to make a
distinction between the two~ -- ~how would you do it ?
Summary
In addition to numbers , this lesson has entered the dangerous waters of
Lojban articles .
Lojban articles may seem difficult at first , but they are
perfectly logical .
In fact it 's probably because they are logical that
people have problems with them to start off with - you have to learn to
think in a slightly different way .
For the curious , here are the main
articles and article - like words :
la that named
le that described
lo that which really is
li the number ( lu is not an article , it 's a quotation mark ! )
la'e the referent of ( not really an article , as it takes a full sumti or pro-sumti , as in la'edi'u~ --~ the thing the last sentence refers to , as opposed to the words of the last sentence )
le'e the stereotypical
lo'e the typical
lai the mass named
lei the mass described
loi the mass which really is
la'i , the set named
le 'i the set described
lo 'i the set which really is
We also looked briefly at lu'o , which turns a set into a mass , and
lu'a , which turns a mass into a set of individuals ( " group " and
" ungroup " ) .
Strictly speaking , these are n't articles , though .
If all this looks terribly complicated , do n't be discouraged !
As you can
see , these articles are all really variants on la , le and
lo , which are normally all you will need .
My personal advice ( not
official Lojban policy ! ) is when in doubt , use le ' ' ' .
This is
because the only time le is completely wrong is with a
cmene ( which needs la , of course ) .
If you use le
where another article would be more appropriate , you may not express
yourself as clearly as you wanted , but at least you will not be talking
nonsense , like you would in German if you said " der Frau " .

A final question
" The dog " would be le pa gerku .
Normally , we would n't bother with
the pa though , unless we wanted to make it quite clear that we only
have one dog in mind .
" The dogs " would be le su'o re gerku ( or
lei su'o re gerku , if we 're thinking of them as a group ) ~--~ " the at
least two dogs " .
However , it is hard to think of many situations where you
would need to say this .
Like some other languages ( e.g. Chinese ) , Lojban
normally leaves number up to context .
You guessed it ~--~ you 've just spent
all this time learning to say how many people , dogs etc .
there are , and
piso of the time , you do n't need to !
But , like many features of
Lojban , it can be very useful when you want it , so please do n't feel
tricked .
One way to ask the question " What is the time ? " is ma
tcika .
We know that ma is the sumti
question word , so tcika must be
a selbri meaning " is the time " , with the ti meaning " this event " , or , in other words " now " .
The place structure of
tcika is
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} ( hours , minutes , seconds ) is the time of state / event x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} on day / date x{SUB ( ) }3 {SUB} , at location x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB} , by calendar x{SUB ( ) }5 {SUB}
A full answer would obviously be very long - winded , but remembering the
Lojban convention that you miss out all the places after the last one
you really need , a typical exchange would be :
ma tcika ti
li vo
" What 's the time ? "
" Four "
Note the li , since we are talking about a number here .
li vo
is short for li vo cu tcika ti — " four is the time of this
( event ) " .
If we want to be a bit more precise , we need to use pi'e .
This is like pi , but does n't need to keep the same value .
In
normal counting , pi is a decimal point , in hexadecimal it's a
hexadecimal point and so on , but it never changes its value .
pi'e does n't have that restriction , so we can
use it to separate hours from minutes .
So an alternative answer to the
question could be
li vo pi'e mu " Five past four . "
or if you want to be particularly precise ,
li vo pi'e mu pi'e pabi " Five minutes and eighteen seconds past four . "
Let 's imagine , though , that the time is not five past four , but five
to four .
We can still say li ci pi'e mumu ( 4:55 ) but we can also
say li vo pi'e ni'u mu .
ni'u is the
Lojban minus sign ( for negative numbers , not for subtraction ) — what we
are saying is " 4:- 5 " .
For " half past four " you can also use pi and say
li vo pimu — 4.5 .
I do n't particularly like
this method , but it is perfectly good Lojban .
If we are using numbers
for times , it is normal to use the 24 - hour system , so 6 p.m. is li pabi ( 18:00 ) .
Another possibility , is to use cmene for
hours , so " four o' clock " is la vocac. , " five
o'clock " is la mucac .
and so on .
For 11 and 12
we need extra numbers .
Fortunately
Lojban has these and more ; the number system actually goes up to 16
( hexadecimal ) , so we have the extra numbers
dau 10
fei 11
gai 12
jau 13
rei 14
vai 15
Obviously for anything
other than talking about computer programming , the numbers 13 - 15 are
useless , but we can use 10 - 12 for hours .
" Ten o'clock " is la daucac .
" Eleven o' clock " is la
feicac.and " twelve o'clock " is la gaicac ..
For " morning " and " evening " we can then add lir .
and lec. ,
meaning " early " and " late " .
So la mucaclir .
is five in the
morning .
Exercise 1
What are the following times in Lojban ?
Nine o'clock
Eleven o'clock in the morning .
Two in the afternoon .
Midnight .
9:25
12:15
14:30
17:50
If we want to give the time of an event , rather than just tell the time ,
we need to fill in some more places .
The second place of tcika is " state / event " , so we need some way to show
that the sumti in this position is a state or an event ,
and not a thing .
la daucac .
tcika le mi klama
does not mean " Ten o'clock is the time that I go " ( or come ! ) , but " Ten
o'clock is the time of my goer , " which is meaningless .
We get round
this problem with the word nu , which
means — you
guessed — " state / event " .
This is called an " abstraction descriptor " ( or
" abstractor " for short ) , other common descriptors being ka ( quality or property ) , ni ( amount ) and so on ( for a complete
list , see The Complete Lojban Language , p. 269 ) .
What nu does here is allow us to put a whole bridi into
a sumti place .
It 's usually written together
with the article ( le or lo ) but is actually a separate word .
So what we want
is
la daucac .
tcika lenu mi klama
( note that there is no cu here , since la daucac . is a
cmene )
If " Ten o'clock is the time that I go " sounds
backwards , there are two ways you can switch it round .
One is using
se , which swaps the first and second places of
the bridi .
le nu mi klama cu se tcika la
daucac .
means exactly the same thing .
se is
co-incidentally is pretty much the same as Spanish " se " , but is actually
part of a series along with te , ve and xe , which convert the first and third ,
first and fourth , and first and fifth places .
These are n't used so much
in sentences as se , but are often used in making
lujvo ( compound words ) , as we 'll see later in the course .
Still too long
and clumsy ?
Get ready for more Lojban tricks .
It would be really nice
if klama had a place for the time of
going / coming , but it does n't ( after all , you would n't really want a
six - place selbri ! ) .
To get round this problem of missing places , Lojban has a series of
" tags " of the class BAI .
The one we want here is ti'u , meaning " with time " .
So we can now say
mi klama ti'u la daucac .
So why , you may ask , did n't I just say that in the first
place ?
I could have done , but then you would n't have found out about
nu and se !
There is
more to this lesson than meets the eye .
Days and Months
The days of the week are also numbers , this time adding djed . , from the gismu ,
djedi , meaning " day " .
There is at present some disagreement about which day should be day one ,
though .
The original convention was to follow the Judeo - Christian
convention of taking Sunday as the first day , giving
Sunday la padjed .
Monday la redjed .
Tuesday la cidjed .
... and so on .
However , in a meeting in 1992 it was
agreed that Monday be day 1 , and Sunday be either 7 ( la zedjed . ) or zero ( la
nodjed . ) according to taste .
Eventually , though ,
people will use whichever system they prefer until one becomes
universally accepted .
This may sound chaotic , but I have gone into this
point as a good example of how in Lojban a large part of the language is
" left to usage " — meaning that ultimately the language depends on the
way people choose to use it in practice .
People are also free to work
out alternative conventions for cultures which do not use a seven - day
week , possibly adding to the name to make it clear ; e.g. la padjedjung .
could be the first day of the Chinese
ten - day week .
Months also use numbered cmene , adding mast . , so January is la
pamast . and so on .
Again , since there are twelve months ,
we use the extra numbers , so October is la
daumast ..
Exercise 2
What are these days and months in Lojban ?
Saturday
Thursday
March
August
November
December
Just in case you 're interested , the words for seasons are :
vensa Spring
crisa Summer
critu Autumn
dunra Winter
for full definitions of these words , see the gismu list ) .
If the seasons where you live do n't
match this pattern , then you can easily create new
words .
For example , the rainy season or monsoon could be
carvycitsi ( from carvi ,
rain , and citsi , season ) or simply la carv . .
Here are some I made up for fun to give
a better idea of the weather in the UK :
la lekcarv .
" the cold rain " — Spring
la mliglacarv .
" the warm ( mildly - hot ) rain " — Summer
la bifcarv .
" the windy rain " — Autumn
la duncarv .
" the freezing rain " — Winter
Joking aside , this shows two features of word - building in
Lojban : making cmene by losing the final vowel
( which we saw in Lesson 1 ) and creating lujvo ,
or compound words .
You actually need a pretty good knowledge of Lojban
to make up lujvo on the spot , but we 'll learn
how to make simple lujvo later on in this
course .
The gismu for dates is detri :
x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is the date ( day , week , month , year ) of state / event
x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} , at location x{SUB ( ) }3 {SUB} , by calendar x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB}
Phew !
Like tcika , though , most places of detri can be left out .
The location is
only important if we 're talking about radically different timezones , or
different planets , and the calendar is normally assumed to be the
standard Western one — if you want to use , for example , the Arabic or
Chinese calendars , you can put le xrabo or le jungo in the
fourth place ( as always , context is important — in a discussion of
Islamic history we would probably assume that the Arabic calendar was
being used ) .
The tricky bit is the number in x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} .
Normally we do n't
want to specify the day , week , month and year !
To prevent
confusion , the following conventions are used :
If there is only one number , it is the day e.g. li pano is " the 10th " .
If there are two numbers , they are the day and month e.g. li pano pi'e pare is 10 / 12 , or " the 10th of December " .
If there are three numbers , they are day , month , year ( not month , day , year , as in the American convention ) e.g. li repa pi'e ze pi'e pasoxaso is 21/7/69 - the date of the first moon landing .
We can therefore say
li repa pi'e ze pi'e pasoxaso cu detri lenu lo remna cu pamoi klama le lunra 21/7/1969 is - the - date - of the - event a human first go ( to ) the moon
Here we have another case of abstraction with nu .
Just like articles have the terminator ku ( which is usually missed out ) , abstractors like
nu have the terminator kei .
kei is not necessary in
this particular sentence , because the abstraction comes at the end , but
it would be necessary if there were other places after
x {SUB ( ) }2{SUB} — if , for example we wanted to emphasise that this was
the date in Houston ( but not in Tokyo ) we would say
li repa pi'e ze pi'e pasoxaso cu detri lenu lo remna cu pamoi klama le lunra kei la xustyn .
21/7/1969 is - the - date - of the - event a human first go ( to ) the moon ( according to the time at ) Houston
The kei here is important , as it is necessary to
stop the nu abstraction running into la xustyn. , which would make the sentence say that a
person went to the moon from Houston — true , but not what we want .
By
the way , if you 're wondering why kei was n't necessary in the tcika example , it
was because the cu marked the next word
as the main selbri .
Just as with tcika , we often want to put the event first — after
all in most languages we would normally say " My birthday is on the
fifteenth of August " rather than " The fifteenth of August is the date of
my birthday . "
We can manage this change by using place tags , e.g .
fe lenu mi jbena kei cu detri fa li pamupi'ebi the - event I am - born is - dated 15/8
but it is easier to use se like this :
lenu mi jbena cu se detri li pamupi'ebi the - event I am - born is - dated 15/8
And , as you probably guessed , there is a BAI tag for " dated " : de'i ( notice how BAI tags tend to be
similar to the selbri they suggest ) .
So the
other way I can tell you my birthday is mi jbena de'i li
pamupi'ebi
Question :
If only one number is used with
detri , it is the day .
So how do we say what year an event
happened without giving the day and month as well ?
The gismu , nanca cannot be used instead of
detri , since it has the place - structure
" x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is
x {SUB ( ) }2{SUB} years in duration , by standard x{SUB ( ) }3 { SUB} , " i.e. it gives the length of an
event in years , not the year when an event happened .
One way out is to
use a cmene for the year , so the year I am
writing this would be la pasososonanc .
Exercise 3 — history quiz
Give the dates to answer these questions , using cmene for the years .

Lesson 6 : Time and Space : basic Lojban " tenses "
By this time , you may have been wondering what had happened to all the tenses .
After all , a large part of learning a language is learning
tenses , and figuring out which one you ought to be using .
English , for
example , has about a dozen tenses ( depending on what you count as a tense ) and some languages have more .
Use the wrong one and you 're , well , wrong .
In addition , there are a load of words and phrases like " before " , " in a while " , " some time ago " and so on .
Lojban deals with time quite differently .
Like some other languages
( e.g. Chinese ) , tense is not compulsory .
All the bridi we 've looked
at so far have had no particular time attached to them , and this is
perfectly acceptable , in fact it is normal .
Saying mi klama ti
de 'i la redjed .
is good Lojban , even if out of context we do n't know
if it means I 'm coming here next Monday , or I came here last Monday .
In most cases , sentences do n't happen out of context , and the context is usually enough to tell us if we 're talking about the past , present or future .
Putting a past tense in just because the same sentence in English would be in the past tense is rather malglico .
Time with sumti
There are times , though , when you want to say things about time , and
Lojban has more than enough cmavo for this .
Let 's say that Zhang
left the bar at 10 o'clock and Susan arrived at 11 ( thus missing her
date ) .
The most precise way is to use times , as in the last lesson :
la jang .
cliva le barja ti'u la jaucac .
. i la la suzyn .
klama le barja ti'u la reicac .
However , if the actual times are not important , we can say :
ba lenu la jang .
cliva kei la suzyn .
klama le barja After Zhang left , Susan came into the bar .
or
pu lenu la suzyn .
klama le barja kei la jang .
cliva Before Susan came into the bar , Zhang left .
or more naturally , When Susan came into the bar , Zhang had already left .
( this , by the way , is another case of context meaning you do n't have to put everything in ~--~ we have n't said that the place Zhang leaves is the bar , we just understand it from the context )
What are these ba's , pus and keis ?
As you probably guessed , ba is " after " ( from the gismu for " future " or " later " , balvi ) and pu is " before " ( from the gismu for " past " or " earlier " , purci ) .
kei is a Lojban terminator ~--~ not a killer android , but a way of showing where a phrase finishes , a bit like closing brackets or parentheses .
We saw this in Lesson 5 when we were talking about dates and times .
kei is necessary here to keep the time phrase separate from the rest of the bridi~--~it 's like the comma in the English sentence .
In fact all sumti ( other than cmene ) and selbri have terminators , but usually we can leave them out , just like we leave out the cu separator when we do n't need it .
Just out of interest , the last sentence with all terminators and separators included would read :
. i pu le nu la suzyn .
cu klama le barja ku vau kei ku la jang .
cu
cliva vau
This is why we do n't use terminators unless we really need them !
A
criticism I 've heard of Lojban is that all these terminators are " unnatural " , and when I started learning the language I too had my
doubts about them .
In fact terminators are just a more specific way of representing a pause in speech or a piece of punctuation in
writing ~--~most of the time you do n't need them , but it 's very useful to have them available when you do .
There are very specific rules for when a terminator can and can't be omitted , but in practice it comes
perfectly intuitively .
If we only want to say that Susan came to the bar later , and Zhang's
leaving is unimportant or understood , we can then say :
baku la suzyn .
klama le barja
baku means " afterwards " or " later " .
The ku is necessary to
separate the ba from la suzyn .
( you can also say it as two
separate words , ba ku~--~ it makes no difference ) .
Similarly , " Zhang
left earlier " or " Zhang had left " would be :
puku la jang .
cliva
arrives just as Zhang is leaving .
We can then say :
caku la suzyn .
klama le barja :
At that moment , Susan came .
Which is
an easier way to say
ca lenu la jang .
cliva le barja kei la suzyn .
klama le barja
( note the difference between ku and kei here : ku separates
the ca from the rest of the sentence , while kei terminates an
event ) .
ca also comes from a gismu , in this case cabna ,
which means " now " or " simultaneous with " , so another way to say the same thing would be
lenu la jang .
cliva le barja cu cabna lenu la suzyn .
klama la barja
The event of Zhang leaving the bar is simultaneous with the event of Susan coming to the bar .
We now have three " time words " : pu ( before ) , ca ( at , while ) and
ba ( after ) .
We can modify these with another three , zi , za and zu ( series of cmavo often take an - i , - a , -u pattern , if they do n't follow the AEIOU sequence ) .
These mean a short , medium and long time distance .
So puzi is " a
short time ago , " puza is " a while ago " and puzu is " a long time ago " .
How long " long " is depends on what we 're talking about ~--~ if the subject is archeology , puzu could be thousands of years ; if you 've
missed your train it could be a matter of minutes .
Let 's say this time the unlucky Susan missed Zhang by only a few
minutes .
We could then say :
bazi lenu la jang .
cliva ku la suzyn .
klama le barja
or as two bridi ,
la jang .
cliva le barja .i caziku la suzyn .
klama
Exercise 1
Translate the following .
Do n't forget your nus and kus !
Juliette went to Paris a while ago .
A long time ago , I read " Camille . "
Ivan just left .
Yoshiko kissed Jorge just after Pierre came into the room .
Tracy was sad just a minute ago .
But Mike is happy now .
Vocabulary : room - kumfa ; badri~--~ sad ; gleki - happy ; ku 'i~--~ but , however ( bet you 'd forgotten that one ! ) .
Time and selbri
What we 've looked at so far is similar to ( but not quite the same as )
English words like " before " , " after " and so on .
However , we can use
exactly the same cmavo with selbri to give effects which are
similar ( but not identical ) to English tenses .
Actually this is easier ,
but I left it till later to avoid the danger of malglico !
Basically , any time cmavo can go before a selbri and put the
whole bridi into that time .
So
la jang .
pu cliva le barja
means " Zhang before - leave the bar , " or " Zhang left the bar . "
We can do the same thing with zi / za / zu , so la jang .
puza cliva le barja
means " Zhang left the bar a while ago . "
Another group of cmavo which can be used here is ze 'i / ze 'a / ze'u .
Just as zi/ze / zu indicate a short , medium or long time from the present ( or whatever other time we happen to be talking about ) , these
cmavo indicate short , medium or long times for the action or state
we are talking about .
So mi ze'u bajra means " I run for a long
time . " again , we can put these together , so mi puzaze 'u bajra means
" A while ago , I ran for a long time . "
A few more examples ...
oi.uinai le mi zdani puzi se darxi lo lindi
Oh no !
My house has just been struck by lightning !
( Every language course has to have a few of these ridiculously artificial examples ! )
Note that if you have a tense before the selbri you do n't need cu~--~zdani can not run into puzi .
la bil .
ze'u pinxe loi birje Bill drinks beer for a long time .
mi bazize 'a xabju la djakartas .
Pretty soon I 'm going to live in Jakarta for a while .
la natos .
baze 'u gunta la belgrad .
NATO will attack Belgrade for a long time .
Note that this does not mean that NATO is not attacking Belgrade now ( it is at the time I 'm writing this ) .
In Lojban , if we say that something
is true at a particular time , it does n't mean that it is not true at any other time .
There are ways to say that NATO will continue to attack , but that comes later ( sorry , I know I keep saying that things will come later , but you would n't really want to have to learn everything at once ~--~ it would be like an English course teaching " will go " and " will have been going " in the same lesson ) .
A complete explanation of time cmavo can be found in Chapter 10 of The Complete Lojban Language .
Space
This is where things start getting strange .
In Lojban , space can be a
" tense " just as much as time .
This is because there is no difference
between what traditional grammar calls " prepositions " and tenses .
As
we 've seen , English , like many languages , treats a word like " earlier "
and the past tense ending " - ed " as two totally separate things , while in Lojban they 're the same .
Space words like " in " or " near " are
prepositions in English , and can never be tenses , but in Lojban we treat them just like time words ( or if you prefer , you can say that Lojban treats time as a dimension , as in Einstein 's physics ) .
Remember the word ti ?
This is part of a series ti , ta , tu , meaning roughly " this " , " that " and " that over there . "
If we 're talking about places rather than things , we say vi , va , vu , meaning roughly " here " , " there " and " yonder " or " way over there " .
Again , this is determined by the thing you 're talking about .
If you 're telling a doctor where you feel pain , ti might be the end of your toe , while if you 're talking about astronomy , ti could be the solar system .
We can therefore say
viku mi gunka
Here , I work .
or , more naturally , " I work here . "
We 've seen that puku means " before something " ( as in pu lenu la
zhang. cliva kei ) .
Similarly , vi ku means " at the location of
something " , and we can expand it in the same way to say what the
" something " is , e.g .
vi la paris .
mi gunka
In Paris , I work .
vu le mi zdani mi gunka A long way from my home , I work
va lenu la KEnedis .
se catra kei mi gunka A medium distance from here Kennedy was killed , I work .
Note the kei~--~ if it was n't there , catra would run into mi , so the listener might start interpreting the sentence as " A medium distance from where Kennedy was killed by me ... "
Just like the time cmavo , place cmavo can be attached to selbri .
For example , instead of saying viku mi gunka , you can say mi vi gunka ~ -- ~ " I here - work . "
Again , this sounds odd in English , but one of the purposes of Lojban is to encourage you to say things in different ways , which may lead to being able to say different things .
Lojban expands the mind ( warning : unproven Lojban propaganda ! ) .
If we combine place vi etc. with fa'a , they become more productive .
fa'a is a place cmavo meaning " towards " , so fa'avi is " here " as direction , as in " come here " .
For example :
la bil .
fa'avi bajra
Bill towards - this - place runs Bill runs here .
Note that the more natural translation is ambiguous , since it could also
translate la bil .
vi bajra , meaning that this is where Bill runs , not where he runs to .
This may pass unnoticed by native English speakers , but speakers of languages which are more precise about direction find it extremely vague ( Turkish , for example , has at least three words to translate " here " ) .
There is a whole class of cmavo that work like fa'a ( called FAhA type cmavo , unsurprisingly ) .
These include to 'o ( away from ) , zu'a ( to the left of ) , ri'u ( to the right of ) , ne 'i ( within ) and so on ( again , all the space cmavo are explained in Chapter 10 of The Complete Lojban Language ) .
We can also combine time and space .
For example , mi vipuzu gunka
means " I here - past - long - time - distance work " , or " I used to work here a long time ago . "
A common expression with ku is puzuvuku ,
meaning " long ago and far away " ~--~ a standard way to begin a fairy story or legend !
Getting back to daily speech , these time and space cmavo are very
useful for questions .
ca ma is " simultaneous with what ? " , or in other words , " when ? " ( a simpler alternative to ti'u or di'e ) .
Similarly , vi ma means " at the location of what ? " , or " where ? "
Exercise 2
Translate the following .
le do zdani vi ma
la bil .
puzevi zutse
le cipni puzifa 'ava vofli
la tcarlz.daruin. puva xabju
mi bafa 'avu cadzuVocabulary : zutse~--~sit ; cadzu~--~walk .
Summary
In this lesson we have covered the following :
Time cmavo : pu , ca , and ba .
Time intervals : zi , za and zu .
Duration : ze 'i , ze 'a and ze'u .
Location : vi , va and vu
There are many more cmavo to describe time and space , but they are only there if you need them .
In fact , unless you want to be specific about time or space , you do n't even need the ones in this lesson .
Remember the golden rule of Lojban grammar :
If you do n't need it , do n't use it !
Lojban grammar is your servant , not your master .

In fact , you could even miss out the pu , but I left it in to avoid confusion ~ --~ maybe my friend thinks I 'm talking about a different person with the same name , or that I 'm somehow speaking metaphorically about the spirit of Darwin . ] ]
I will walk far away .
again note the English has two meanings , since it could also mean that I will walk in some distant place
Lesson 7 : Getting Personal : Pro-sumti
So far we 've been referring to everybody by name , which can get very
repetitive if you want to tell a story , or even string two sentences
together .
Consider the following :
la suzyn .
klama le barja .i la suzyn ze'e pinxe loi vanju .i la suzyn .
zgana lo nanmu .i le nanmu cu melbi . i caku le nanmu cu zgana la suzyn .
Susan goes to the bar .
Susan drinks some wine for a while .
Susan notices sees , observes a man .
The man is beautiful .
At that moment , the man notices Susan .
Note the use of melbi ~--~ in
English we usually
describe men as " handsome " rather than " beautiful " , but this rather
sexist distinction does n't apply in Lojban .
However , if you really
wanted a Lojban word for " handsome " ( beautiful - kind - of - man ) I suppose
you could say melnau ( melbi + nanmu ) .
It is
pretty tedious to have to keep repeating " Susan " and " man " .
English
gets round this problem by using pronouns , like " she " or " he " .
This works OK in this case , because we have one female and one male in
the story so far , but it can get confusing when more characters enter
the scene ( and it 's even more confusing with languages that only have
one word for " he " , " she " and " it " , like Turkish or spoken Chinese ) .
Lojban has pro-sumti , which are
like pronouns ~--~ sort of .
In
fact , we 've already met some pro-sumti : mi and do , and the ti / ta / tu group , but we still do n't have he / she / it ,
which are a bit more complicated .
One way of dealing with this is a
group of cmavo which refer back to something
we 've just said .
In fact we have met one of these in a different
context : go'i .
Just as go'i on its own repeats the previous bridi , le go 'i repeats the first sumti of the
previous bridi .
So we can rewrite the first three sentences as
la suzyn .
klama le barja .i le go 'i ze'e pinxe loi vanju .i le go 'i zgana lo nanmu
The system breaks down here , though , since
nanmu is not in the first , but the second place
of the previous bridi .
English does n't bother
with precision here ~--~ " he " just
means " some male person mentioned earlier . "
This works in the example
here , because there is only one man in the story , but what about
Bill saw Rick .
He hit him
Did Bill hit Rick , or did Rick hit Bill ?
We do n't know .
Coming back to the man Susan
saw , we can refer to him as ri , which means " the
most recent sumti " .
So we can say
. i le go 'i zgana lo nanmu .i ri melbi
ri is one of a series , ri/ra / ru ,
meaning " the most recent / fairly recent / distant sumti " , but as far as
I 've noticed , ra and ru are n't very popular in Lojbanistan at the moment .
ri , on the
other hand , is used a lot , since it 's
very common for the last thing in one sentence to be the subject of the
next sentence .
Another pro-sumti is da , which means
" someone / something " .
You may remember zo'e , which means also
means " something " , but with zo'e the something is unimportant -
it 's just a way of filling a sumti place .
da , on the
other hand , is important ~--~ it is something or someone we are talking
about .
Note for logicians : da is the " existential
x " , as in " There exists some x such that x is ... "
Coming back to our story , we could start by saying
da klama le barja~ -- ~ " Someone came to the bar . " da and its companions
de and di are used a lot for talking about language
- you see them frequently on the Lojban e-mail list , for example .
By
the way , there are no do and du in this series , because
these already have other meanings : " you " and " is the same thing as " .
Assigning pro-sumti
If we 're telling a story in English , the
meaning of , say , " she " keeps changing .
At the moment , it means " Susan " ,
but if Susan 's friend Jyoti walks into the bar , " she " could very well
mean " Jyoti " .
In Lojban , we can keep on using le go'i ,
ri and their relatives , but there is an easier way of dealing
with a larger cast of characters .
What we do is assign pro-sumti as
and when we need them , using the cmavo goi ( which I am
told is like the Latin word sive ) .
The sumti assigned by
goi are a series called KOhA , consisting of ko'a ,
ko'e , ko 'i ... you get the idea ?
Note for grammarians : series of cmavo ( called
selma'o in
Lojban ) are referred to by the name of a typical member written in
capitals ( with a small " h " instead of the apostrophe ) .
For example , the
attitudinals we looked at in Lesson 1 are part of selma'o .
UI .
Note for lawyers ( and frustrated non-lawyers ) : the
equivalent in legal documents of goi is
" henceforth referred to as , " and ko 'a is
something like " the party of the first part " .
Lojban has
in fact been proposed as the ideal language for law , where precision is
of utmost importance .
It would also allow non-lawyers to understand
legal documents , which would be something of a miracle .
OK , let 's go back to Susan 's story .
We start by saying
la suzyn .
goi ko 'a klama le barja
This means that from now on , every
time we use ko 'a , we mean " Susan " .
The man she
sees can then be ko'e , so we say
. i ko 'a zgana lo nanmu goi ko'e
Now every time we use ko'e it means that
particular man , so the full story so far reads :
la suzyn .
goi ko 'a klama le barja .
i ko 'a ze'e pinxe loi vanju .
i ko 'a zgana lo nanmu goi ko'e .
i ko'e melbi . i caku ko'e zgana ko'a
( note how the cus have disappeared ~ --~ ko'a , like mi , does n't need them ) .
Assigning ko'e to lo nanmu is actually better than
starting the next sentence with le nanmu .
This is because le nanmu
simply means " the thing I have in mind which I call ' man ' , "
which is not exactly the same as " the man " ( it could , in theory , be
something totally different ) .
Some Lojbanists would even say that using
le like this is a bit malglico .
Note : if you combine
ko 'a/e/i/o/u with ri/ra /ru , do n't count ko 'a - type pro-sumti when
you 're counting back .
For example
la suzyn .
rinsa ko'e .i ri cisma
does n't mean that ko'e ( the man , in this
context ) smiles , but that Susan smiles .
This is
because it is pointless to have a backwards - pointing ( anaphoric ) pro-sumti referring to a fixed pro-sumti like ko'e~--~it's
simpler just to re-use ko'e and keep
ri /ra / ru for more important things .
Let 's continue by
introducing Susan 's friend Jyoti ( if people are wondering where I get
all these unusual names from , Jyoti is an old Gujarati friend of mine ) .
We continue ....
caku la djiotis .
goi ko 'i mo'ine 'i . i ko 'i cusku lu coi ranjit .
li'u ko'e
At that time , Jyoti henceforth
third - thing - referred - to moving - inside .
Third - thing - referred - to says
" Hello Ranjeet " to second - thing - referred - to .
Just then Jyoti comes in
and says " Hello , Ranjeet " to the guy .
mo 'ine 'i is
another space " tense " .
mo 'i indicates movement ;
ne 'i means " inside " ( from the gismu , nenri ) .
The selbri is missed out because the way Jyoti moves is not important ( klama is possible , but unnecessary , but we could use bajra , for
example ) .
This is creative Lojban ~-- ~it 's not exactly ungrammatical to
leave a selbri out like this , but it means that
this is a sentence - fragment , not a bridi .
Do n't
try this at home , kids .
lu , li'u , du'u and vo'a
lu and li'u are like
" quote " and " unquote " ~--~ they put something someone says into a sumti .
li'u is one of the
few terminators that can almost never be missed out , since that would
make everything else that follows part of the quotation .
You can also
nest quotations , e.g .
la ranjit .
pu cusku lu la djiotis .
pu cusku lu coi li'u mi li'u Ranjeet said " Jyoti said " Hello " to me . "
which is similar to
la ranjit .
pu cusku lu la djiotis .
pu rinsa mi li'u Ranjeet said " Jyoti greeted me . "
Both can also be expressed in a rather more subtle way :
la ranjit .
pu cusku le du'u la djiotis .
pu rinsa vo'a Ranjeet past - express the - predicate Jyoti past - greet the - first - place OR Ranjeet said that Jyoti greeted him .
du'u is a tricky but very useful cmavo meaning , in logical terms , " the predicate " .
What this means in ordinary language is something like " the statement
that X is true " .
Sorry , that was n't really ordinary language .
The
closest equivalent in English is " that " , as in " Ranjeet said
that ... " .
Here 's another example of du'u :
la suzyn .
na djuno le du'u la jang .
cinynei vo'a Susan does n't know that Zhang fancies ( " sexually - likes " ) her .
And here we have another pro-sumti : vo'a .
This means " the first sumti of this bridi " , and
like the others , comes in a series ~--~ vo'e refers
to the second sumti , vo'i to the third and so on .
In practice , vo'a is used quite a lot , while the others are
rarer , but that could be because people still tend to think in terms of
natural languages ( notably English ) , and as people start
thinking more in Lojban , the others could get used more .
vo'a is very useful to give the sense of " herself " , " itself " and so on .
For
example
la meilis .
pensi vo'a Mei
Li thinks about herself .
le gerku cu batci vo'a
The dog bites itself .
You can also say
mi nelci vo 'a I like myself .
but this is the same as mi nelci mi , which
is simpler and more aesthetic .
Now for something clever .
la suzyn .
zgani la djiotis .
soi vo'a vo'e Susan notices Jyoti and vice versa .
OR Susan and Jyoti notice each other .
soi is a cmavo meaning
something like " you can change these sumti round
and the bridi will still be true " .
If there is
only one sumti after the soi , the other one is taken to be the one
immediately beforesoi .
So we
can say the same thing more briefly as
la suzyn .
zgani la djiotis .
soi vo'a , or even just
ko 'a zgani ko 'i soi vo'a ( vo'a is fixed , and ,
unlike ri can point back to
ko 'a , though you can also repeat ko 'a if you prefer ) .
Exercise 1
Translate the following .
Assume the same values for
ko 'a /e / i that we have been using so far ( i.e .
ko 'a is
Susan , and so on ) .
Note : doi is used to show
who you 're talking to ( without doi the cmene might become the first sumti of the bridi ) .
It 's a
bit like English " O " ( as in " O ye of little faith " ) or the Latin
vocative ( as in " Et tu , Brute " ) .
. i ko 'a ca cusku lu .ue coi li'u ko 'i soi vo'a .
i ko 'a .e ko 'i xanka cmila .i caku le go 'i catlu ko'e .
i ko'e cusku lu doi djiotis .
le do pendo mo li'u .
i ko 'i cusku lu la suzyn .
li'u .
i ko'e cusku .ui lu lo do pendo du lo mi pendo li'u .
i ko 'i fengu catlu ko'e .
i ko 'a xunfirbi'o
Vocabulary : xanka~ --~nervous , worried ; catlu~ --~look at
compare with zgani ; pendo~--~ friend ; fengu~--~
angry ; xunfirbi'o~ --~ blush [ xunre ( red ) + flira ( face ) +
binxo ( become ) ]
Some more personal pro-sumti
We 've already seen two personal pro-sumti , mi and do , meaning " I " ( or
" me " ) and
" you " .
However , " you " in English can mean four different things :
The one person I 'm talking to .
A number of people I 'm talking to .
The person or people I 'm talking to and some other person or people .
Anyone ( as in " Money ca n't buy you love . " ) .
Lojban gets round the confusion between 1 . and 2 . by using numbers .
The
most common way to express 2 . is rodo , " all of
you " ( or U.S. " Y'all " ) and , as we 've seen , coi rodo is " Hello all " ~--~a
common way to start an e-mail to a list .
You can also use specific numbers ~-- ~redo would
mean " the two of you " or " you two " ( for example , I start e-mails to my
parents with coi redo ) .
You can also use
numbers with doi e.g. rodoi ko klama ti .
3. is expressed by do 'o~--~ you and someone
else , and 4 . is completely different .
It 's normally expressed by roda or , more specifically
ro le prenu , but often you can just miss it out altogether .
English " we " is almost as confusing , as it can mean the speaker and the
listener (s ) , the speaker and some other people , or the speaker and the
listener and some other people .
Not surprisingly , Lojban has three
pro-sumti for " we " :
mi'o ~--~you and I ( but no - one else )
~--~you and I ( but no - one else ) mi'a ~--~I and another / others ( but not you )
ma'a~--~you and I and another / others
Some examples :
mi prami do I love you .
mi'a penmi do ti'u la cicac .
We 'll meet you at three o'clock .
ma'a remna
We are all human .
Exercise 2
The story continues !
For each of the pro-sumti in bold say who or what they mean .
Just two other
points : ka is like nu ,
but while nu describes a state or event , ka describes a property or quality .
na'e is like na but only
negates the selbri~--~ it says that there is some
relationship between the sumti other than that
which the selbri describes .
As we saw in Lesson
5 , mi na nelci ro lo gerku means " It is not true
that I like all dogs , " ( or " I do n't like all dogs ) , while mi na'e nelci ro lo gerku is more like " I dislike
all dogs . "
ko 'a mliburna . i ko 'a mo 'ini 'a clatu le kabri . i caku ri simlu leka cinri ko 'a .

Answers to Exercises
Exercise 1
Susan and
Jyoti say " Oh! Hello ! " to each other at the same time .
They laugh
nervously .
At that moment , Jyoti looks at Ranjeet .
He says " Who's
your friend ? "
She says " Susan . "
He says " Delighted ~ -- ~any friend of
yours is a friend of mine . "
She looks at him angrily .
Susan blushes .
Note that in order to get this into understandable English , we've
had to change some of the pro-sumti back into names .
We could also make
the translation sound more natural by changing the word order a bit
more , changing " says " to " asks " when it 's a question , and maybe putting
the whole thing into the past tense .
du here translates as " is " ,
but do n't use it for just any case of " is " ~--~it is like the = sign in
maths and can only be used for two expressions that describe the same
thing .
Using du to translate the " is " in , say , " Susan is a
doctor " is extremelymalglico .
la suzyn .
du lo mikce would mean that Susan is the same as each and every doctor
( the correct Lojban would be simply la suzyn . mikce ) .
Exercise 2
ri = le kabri
vo 'a = la ranjit .
" Ranjeet and Jyoti kiss each other . "
redo = la suzyn .
.e la ranjit .
" You two . "
le go 'i = le vanju " She drinks it quickly . "
go 'i = la suzyn .
puzi ninpe 'i la ranjit .
soi vo'a
Note that here go 'i refers not to the previous sentence in the story , but to the previous sentence in the conversation .
Obviously Susan would n't be talking about a story that has n't been written yet !
Access z / OS batch jobs from Java
Java provides access to z /OS batch jobs from anywhere
You probably know that you can use File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) to transfer files , but the z / OS FTP server is a little different .
Not only can it provide standard access to z / OS UNIX ® System Services files , the server can also provide the following :
z /OS datasets
Job Entry Subsystem ( JES ) spool datasets
SQL result sets
You can access these types of information from any FTP session .
With the help of a Java FTP client , you can put the information to good use .
Naturally , this article makes use of the access to the JES spool .
The FTP server provides access to a number of JES functions , including the following :
Submitting a job
Displaying the status of jobs
Receiving the spool output of a job ( Job Control Language [ JCL ] messages and SYSOUT )
Deleting a job
Submitting a job and automatically receiving output
This article addresses the second and third functions in more detail : displaying job status and receiving spool output .
Basics
Before starting , ensure the following :
Your z/OS machine has the FTP server running
You have a suitably authorized user ID
In addition , you can use any of several configuration parameters to control the behaviour of the JES interface , including the most important configuration parameter JESINTERFACELEVEL .
Table 1 shows a summary of configuration parameters .
Table 1 . JES interface configuration parameters
Parameter Description JESINTERFACELEVEL
Specifies the level of function the JES interface provides .
Set to 2 for the most function .
JESENTRYLIMIT
Limits how many jobs will be returned .
The default is 200 .
JESOWNER
Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this owner .
If blank , defaults to the current user .
JESJOBNAME
Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this job name .
If blank , defaults to the current user concatenated with an *.
Use * to retrieve all jobs .
JESSTATUS
Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this status .
If blank , defaults to all states .
Valid states are OUTPUT , ACTIVE , and INPUT .
You can use the STAT command to verify the settings of the FTP server .
Listing 1 shows an example .
Listing 1 .
Using the STAT command
ftp > quote stat 211 - Server FTP talking to host 192.168.152.1 , port 1858 211- User : ISIELW

Simple FTP session
When you finish configuration , start an ordinary FTP session with the server .
After you establish a session , use the SITE FILETYPE subcommand to indicate that you want to obtain JES information rather than normal HFS files .
Listing 2 shows an interactive FTP session from a Windows® client .
Listing 2 . Using the SITE command
C:\>ftp 192.168.152.2 Connected to 192.168.152.2. 220-FTPD1 IBM FTP CS V1R5 at p390.qld.isi.com.au , 04:26:27 on 2006-09-06 .
220 Connection will close if idle for more than 5 minutes .
User ( 192.168.152.2:( none ) ) : isielw 331 Send password please .
Password : 230 ISIELW is logged on .
Working directory is " ISIELW . " .
ftp > quote SITE FILETYPE=JES
200 SITE command was accepted ftp >
After you change the filetype to JES , several FTP commands operate differently , as described in Table 2 .
Table 2 . JES interface command differences
Command Description dir Lists jobs on the SYSOUT queue get Returns one or more SYSOUT files put Submits a job to JES delete Removes SYSOUT files
The operation of two of these commands is described below .
Command : dir
JES jobs on the SYSOUT queue are treated as single - level directories .
The dir command works in one of two ways :
The dir command with no arguments returns a list of all jobs that match the current setting of the JESJOBNAME parameter .
command with no arguments returns a list of all jobs that match the current setting of the parameter .
The dir command with an argument of a Jobid returns a list of all SYSOUT files that make up that job .
Listing 3 shows an example using the dir command .
Listing 3 .
Using the dir command
ftp > dir 200 Port request OK .

Note the following about this example :
The jobs match the criteria as specified in the status line 125 .
Job TSU00629 has 3 files , and this is what is reported when using the second command .
Command : get
The get command retrieves the contents of a specified JES job from the SYSOUT queue .
The command works in one of two ways :
Using an argument of jobid.n , the command retrieves the contents of file n from the job jobid .
from the job .
Using an argument of jobid.x , the command retrieves the contents of all files that make up job jobid .
In this case , the files are concatenated with a special separator of !!
END OF JES SPOOL FILE !! .

Java environment for sample code
The examples in this article were developed and run using the Eclipse environment .
Follow these steps to use the sample source code :
Create a new Eclipse project , or use an existing one .
Download the source code JAR file , and unzip it to a temporary location .
See Download .
Import the source code into the Project .
Download the Commons Net Library .
See Related topics .
Adjust the Project build path to include the Commons Net JAR file .
Java access
So far , I have given examples of FTP command line access to the JES spool files .
This is fine for simple work , but you can exploit the power of accessing the JES using FTP using a programmatic approach , such as Java .
You can use Java at two levels to access the JES using FTP :
Using Java to gain basic access to FTP services .
To do this , use the Jakarta Commons Net package .
See Related topics to find a link to download the Jakarta Commons Net package .
Exploiting the z / OS enhanced FTP server .
To do this , enhance the Commons Net configuration to adapt to the z / OS FTP server .
The two levels are described below in more detail .
Using the Commons Net library
Using the Commons Net library is easy , and it provides a means to access a number of communication protocols , including FTP .
When using the library for FTP access , use the main class FTPClient .
Refer to the Javadoc for useful getting - started notes about this class .
Listing 5 provides an example to illustrate how easy the library is to use .

Extending use of the Commons Net library
The examples above provide a simple approach to obtaining JES output .
But , how can you get more fine - grained control over what you access and retrieve ?
The Javadoc for the FTPClient describes a list Files method .
This method provides a degree of encapsulation of the files concept , because it returns an array of FTPFile objects rather than simple String objects .
Listing 9 shows the use of the list Files method .
Listing 9 . Using listFiles
FTPFile [ ] result = ftp.listFiles ( " * " ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i < result.
length ; i++) { System.out.println ( " file " + i + " is " + result [i].getName ( ) ) ; }
As the output in Listing 10 shows , the results are not acceptable .
The retrieved filenames do not correspond with the filenames the FTP server is meant to report .
Seemingly , even though the Commons Net library can detect the host type automatically , this does not extend to the z / OS FTP extensions .

The good news is you can use the Commons Net library to configure the FTPClient to parse different types of file listings .
All you need to do is to produce a parser that can understand the output from the dir command and create instances of an FTPFile class .
But first , get the most flexibility by extending the FTPFile class .
This enables you to store the special attributes available to describe the JES files .
Listing 11 illustrates the outline of such a class .
Listing 11 .
Extending the FTPFile class
package evan.org ; import org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPFile ; /** * The JesJob class extends the FTPFile class .
This * allows for < code > JES </ code > specific information to * be maintained , in addition to the standard < code > FTPFile </ code > * information . * < p> This allows information for the spool files such as : * < ul > * < li>job name </ li > * < li>job id </li > * < li>job owner </ li > * < li>job status </li > * < li>job class </ li > * < li>job return code </ li > * </ul > */ public class JesJob extends FTPFile { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L ; private String sJobName ; private String sOwner ; private String sStatus ; private String sJobClass ; private String sReturnCode ; private String sNumFiles ; public JesJob ( ) { super ( ) ; sJobName = " " ; sOwner = " " ; sStatus = " " ; sJobClass = " " ; sReturnCode = " " ; sNumFiles = " " ; } public String getJobName ( ) { return sJobName ; } public void setJobName ( String jobname ) { sJobName = jobname ; } ... }
You can configure the FTPClient to use a particular parser by supplying an instance of the FTPClientConfig class , as shown in Listing 12 .
This object is created with the name of a class that implements the FTPFileEntryParse interface .
Listing 12 .
Configuring the FTPClient
ftp = new FTPClient( ) ; FTPClientConfig conf = new FTPClientConfig ( " evan.org.SimpleJesFileParser " ) ; ftp.configure ( conf ) ;

Note the following about the code shown in Figure 13 :

In this case , you actually return an instance of , because you want to provide the extra JES information .
The parsing performed in this code uses a mixture of regular expressions and string comparisons .
This is a simple , functional implementation , though you could use better performing code to do the same thing .
Use the preParse method to filter out extra lines of information from the directory listing .
In the example , the heading line is detected and removed .
Finally , you can invoke the listFiles method , as shown in Listing 14 .
Note that the returned result is cast to the JesJob type .

4 troops abducted , killed in Iraq attack
By STEVEN R. HURST and QASSIM ABDUL - ZAHRA , Associated Press Writers 1 hour , 58 minutes ago
BAGHDAD , Iraq –
In perhaps the boldest and most sophisticated attack in four years of warfare , gunmen speaking English , wearing U.S. military uniforms and carrying American weapons abducted four U.S. soldiers last week at the provincial headquarters in the Shiite holy city of Karbala and then shot them to death .
The U.S. military confirmed a report earlier Friday by The Associated Press that three of the soldiers were dead and one was mortally wounded with a gunshot to the head when they were found in a neighboring province , about 25 miles from the compound where they were captured .
A fifth soldier was killed in the initial attack on the compound .
The new account contradicted a U.S. military statement on Jan. 20 , the day of the raid on an Iraqi governor ’s office , that five soldiers were killed “ repelling ” the attack .
The security breakdown and the dramatic kidnapping and murder of four soldiers leaked out just as
President Bush faces stiffening congressional opposition over his plan to flood Baghdad and surrounding regions with 21,500 more American troops .
Two of Congress ’s most vocal war critics , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( news , bio , voting record ) and Rep. John Murtha ( news , bio , voting record ) , were in the Iraqi capital as the news broke .
In a statement issued late Friday , the military said two of the soldiers were handcuffed together in the back seat of an SUV near the southern Iraqi town of Mahawil .
A third dead soldier was on the ground nearby .
The fourth soldier died on the way to the hospital .
The brazen assault , 50 miles south of Baghdad , was conducted by nine to 12 gunmen posing as an American security team , the military confirmed .
The attackers traveled in black GMC Suburban vehicles ( the type used by U.S. government convoys ) , had American weapons , wore new U.S. military combat fatigues , and spoke English , according to two senior U.S. military officials as well as Iraqi officials .
None of the American or Iraqi officials would allow use of their names because of the sensitive nature of the information .
The confirmation came after nearly a week of inquiries .
The U.S. military in Baghdad initially did not respond to repeated requests for comment on reports that began emerging from Iraqi government and military officials on the abduction and a major breakdown in security at the Karbala site .
Within hours of the AP report that four of the five dead soldiers had been abducted and found dead or dying about 25 miles east of Karbala , the military issued a long account of what took place .
“ The precision of the attack , the equipment used and the possible use of explosives to destroy the military vehicles in the compound suggests that the attack was well rehearsed prior to execution , ” said Lt. Col.
Scott Bleichwehl , spokesman for Multi-National Division - Baghdad .
“ The attackers went straight to where Americans were located in the provincial government facility , bypassing the Iraqi police in the compound , ” he said .
“ We are looking at all the evidence to determine who or what was responsible for the breakdown in security at the compound and the perpetration of the assault . ”
The Karbala raid , as explained by the Iraqi and American officials , began after nightfall on Jan. 20 , while American military officers were meeting with their Iraqi counterparts on the main floor of the Provisional Joint Coordination Center in Karbala .
Iraqi officials said the approaching convoy of black GMC Suburbans was waved through an Iraqi checkpoint at the edge of the city .
The Iraqi soldiers believed it to be American because of the type of vehicles , the distinctive camouflage American uniforms and the fact that they spoke English .
One Iraqi official said the leader of the assault team was blond , but no other official confirmed that .
A top Iraqi security official for Karbala province told the AP that the Iraqi guards at the checkpoint radioed ahead to the governor ’s compound to alert their compatriots that the convoy was on its way .
Iraqi officials said the attackers ’ convoy divided upon arrival , with some vehicles parking at the back of the main building where the meeting was taking place , and others parking in front .
The attackers threw a grenade and opened fire with automatic rifles as they grabbed two soldiers inside the compound .
Then the guerrilla assault team jumped on top of an armored U.S. Humvee and captured two more soldiers , the U.S. military officials said .
In its statement , the U.S. military said one soldier was killed and three were wounded by a “ hand grenade thrown into the center ’s main office which contains the provincial police chief ’s office on an upper floor . ”
The attackers captured four soldiers and fled with them and the computer east toward Mahawil in Babil province , crossing the Euphrates River , the U.S. military officials said .
The Iraqi officials said the four were captured alive and shot just before the vehicles were abandoned .
Police , who became suspicious when the convoy of attackers and their American captives did not stop at a roadblock , chased the vehicles and found the bodies , the gear and the abandoned SUVs .
The military statement said : “ Two soldiers were found handcuffed together in the back of one of the SUVs .
Both had suffered gunshot wounds and were dead .
A third soldier was found shot and dead on the ground .
Nearby , the fourth soldier was still alive , despite a gunshot wound to the head . ”
The wounded soldier was rushed to the hospital by Iraqi police but died on the way , the military said .
The military also said Iraqi police had found five SUVs , U.S. Army - type combat uniforms , boots , radios and a non-U.S. made rifle at the scene .
Three days after the killings , the U.S. military in Baghdad announced the arrest of four suspects in the attack and said they were detained on a tip from a Karbala resident .
No further information was released about the suspects .
Friday ’s military statement referred to the attackers as “ insurgents , ” which usually suggests Sunnis .
Although Karbala province is predominantly Shiite , Babil province is heavily populated by Sunnis in the north , near Baghdad .
Babil ’s central and southern regions are largely Shiite .
A senior Iraqi military official said the sophistication of the attack led him to believe it was the work of Iranian intelligence agents in conjunction with Iraq ’s Shiite Mahdi Army militia , which Iran funds , arms and trains .
The Defense Department has released the names of troops killed Jan. 20 but clearly identified only one as being killed because of the sneak attack .
Capt . Brian S. Freeman , 31 , of Temecula , Calif. , “ died of wounds suffered when his meeting area came under attack by mortar and small arms fire . ”
Freeman was assigned to the 412th Civil Affairs Battalion , Whitehall , Ohio .
The only other troops killed that day in that region of Iraq were four Army soldiers said to have been “ ambushed while conducting dismounted operations ” in Karbala .
The four were identified as 1st Lt. Jacob N. Fritz , 25 , of Verdon , Neb. ; Spc. Johnathan B. Chism , 22 , of Prairieville , La. ; Pfc. Shawn P. Falter , 25 , of Homer , N.Y. , and Pvt. Johnathon M. Millican , 20 , of Trafford , Ala .
All were with the 2nd Battalion , 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment , 4th Brigade Combat Team , 25th Infantry Division , of Fort Richardson , Alaska .

Iraq crash killed key U.S. officers
The copter went down last weekend .
A missile strike is suspected .
From the Associated Press
January 26 , 2007
BAGHDAD â€ ”
Two colonels , a lieutenant colonel and two command sergeants major were among the 12 U.S. soldiers killed last weekend in the crash of a Black Hawk helicopter northeast of Baghdad , the Pentagon said .
It appeared to be the largest number of key officers and command sergeants killed in a single incident since the Iraq war started nearly four years ago .
The helicopter went down Saturday in Diyala province , one of the volatile regions in the Iraq conflict .
The Army has said the cause of the crash is under investigation .
But a Pentagon official has said debris indicates the helicopter was hit by a surface - to - air missile .
Ten of the dead were members of the National Guard , making the crash the deadliest single combat incident for the Guard since at least the Korean War , said Mark Allen , a National Guard Bureau spokesman .
A Pentagon statement Wednesday said the victims included Col. Brian D. Allgood , 46 , the top Army surgeon in Iraq , and Col. Paul M. Kelly , 45 , assigned to the Joint Force Headquarters of the Virginia Army National Guard in Blackstone , Va .
Also killed were Command Sgt. Maj. Marilyn L. Gabbard , assigned to the Iowa National Guard , and Command Sgt. Maj . Roger W. Haller of the Maryland National Guard .
Command sergeant major is one of the Army ’s highest enlisted ranks .
The other victims were Lt. Col. David C. Canegata of the Virgin Islands National Guard ; Maj. Michael V. Taylor of the Arkansas National Guard ; Capt . Sean E. Lyerly of the Texas National Guard ; 1st Sgt. William T. Warren of the Arkansas National Guard ; Staff Sgt. Darryl D. Booker of the Virginia National Guard ; Sgt. 1st Class John Brown of the Arkansas National Guard ; Staff Sgt. Floyd E. Lake of the Virgin Islands National Guard ; and Cpl.

Japan usually just says the bombing was " regrettable "
Shoichi Nakagawa , the policy chief of the governing party , said that the use of atomic weapons was a crime .
Mr Nakagawa has attracted controversy recently , calling for a debate on whether Japan should have nuclear arms .
He raised the possibility that North Koreans might try to attack Japan with their own nuclear weapons .
Speaking in Nagasaki over the weekend , Mr Nakagawa - a right - winger - said that atomic bombings were a crime .
The American decision to drop the atomic bomb was truly impermissible on humanitarian grounds , he said .
He repeated the comments on Monday , telling Reuters news agency : " By dropping two atomic bombs , many people , including ordinary citizens , were killed ...
I believe that such an act can be called a crime . "
Stronger stance
After the nuclear attacks in 1945 , the Japanese wartime government condemned the bombings as crimes against international law .
But later on the authorities gave up any idea of pursuing the issue of criminality .
Today the phrase the government more often uses to describe the attack is " regrettable " .
Mr Nakagawa appears to be going further , saying they were impermissible on humanitarian grounds .
Analysts say that Mr Nakagawa might have made the comments to simply acknowledge the understandable concern there might be in Nagasaki about his calls for a debate about nuclear weapons , and that this was an attempt to allay those fears with a strong condemnation of the use of the atomic bomb .
" Nakagawa must have said what he said in Nagasaki with a desire to ' nuance ' his repeated statements that there was nothing wrong for Japan to have a debate on itself going nuclear - and make it more acceptable , " said Koichi Nakano from Sophia University .
At the same time , though , he points out that Mr Nakagawa 's reference to a war crime by the Americans that was never really prosecuted is a favourite theme of right - wingers in Japan .
The politician 's comments were probably intended simply for a local audience and were not thought likely to be picked up elsewhere .
Mr Nakagawa also used his speech to warn of the threat posed by North Korea .
" There exists a country that appears likely to use them if it does not like something , " he said .
" Japan should do its utmost to ensure that no weapon of mass destruction can be used ever again . "
The women were asked about lifestyle during early pregnancy
A London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine team looked at 600 women who had miscarried and 6,000 whose pregnancies continued past 12 weeks .
They found that eating fruit and vegetables , and also chocolate , daily helped reduce the risk of miscarriage .
Those classed as underweight had a body mass index ( BMI ) under 18.5 .
While we still do n't have all the answers , these findings are going to help women who want to reduce their risk of losing a baby in pregnancy
Miscarriage Association spokeswoman
Calculate your BMI
An estimated one in five pregnancies in the UK will end in miscarriage , affecting around 250,000 women in the UK every year .
There are a number of well - established risk factors , such as increased maternal age , a previous history of miscarriage , and infertility .
But the causes of the majority of miscarriages are not fully understood .
Many supposed risk factors , such as alcohol consumption , smoking and caffeine intake , are deemed controversial or are unconfirmed .
The latest work is published in the journal BJOG .
It looked at the diet and lifestyles of adult women .
All the miscarriages had taken place since 1995 , while the successful pregnancies had occurred since 1980 .
Year of conception and a history of miscarriage were taken into account by the researchers .
Risk factors
Underweight women were 72 % more likely to miscarry in the first trimester , they found .
But the two - thirds of women who took vitamin supplements during early pregnancy reduced their risk by around 50 % .
The effect was most pronounced among those taking folic acid or iron and multivitamins containing these .
Eating fresh fruit and vegetables daily or on most days was also found to halve the odds of miscarriage .
Eating chocolate every day , as half the women did , also appeared to lower the risk .
Single women were at an increased risk of miscarriage , as were women who had had a previous abortion ( 60 % higher risk ) and those who had had IVF ( 40 % higher risk ) .
Those who described their pregnancy as " planned " had 40 % reduced odds of miscarriage .
But out of this group , those who took more than a year to conceive were twice as likely to miscarry as those who had conceived within three months .
The study also confirmed the widely - held belief that morning sickness is an indicator that the pregnancy is progressing well .
Women who suffered from nausea and sickness in the first 12 weeks were almost 70 % less likely to miscarry , and the more severe the sickness , the better the odds of the pregnancy continuing .
Stay positive
The researchers , led by Noreen Maconochie , a senior lecturer in epidemiology and medical statistics , said : " It is likely that advice to encourage a healthy diet and to try and reduce stress and promote emotional well - being might help women in early pregnancy , or those planning a pregnancy , reduce their risk of miscarriage . "
Dr Donald Peebles , of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists said : " I would want to stress , as much as possible , the positive findings .
This is not about castigating women . "
The Miscarriage Association added : " We speak to thousands of women who are desperate to find out why they miscarried and what they can do to prevent it happening again .
" While we still do n't have all the answers , these findings are going to help women who want to reduce their risk of losing a baby in pregnancy . "

Warwickshire Police said it was keen to resolve the matter with Mr Markham .

Mr Markham said : " If it had n't been a policeman next door let 's be honest , I would n't have had four policeman on my doorstep , I would n't have seen a policeman .
" They can't come out to burglaries , do you think they would 've come out , four policeman to collect a ball ?
" It 's laughable really , if it was n't serious it would be laughable . "
A Warwickshire Police spokesman said : " It 's our intention to resolve the matter amicably at a local level .
" If Mr Markham is unhappy with the course of action taken he should contact the professional standards department at police headquarters and the matter will be further investigated . "
The National Enquirer 's Mike Walker is reporting that Britney Spears is going to get some much needed parenting help from ABC's " Supernanny , " Jo Frost .
Walker claims that after Britney 's recent mishaps with baby Sean Preston , she rung up Supernanny Jo and asked if she could arrange some private parenting lessons .
Nanny
Jo was thrilled at the chance to help out dear Brit and reportedly did n't hesitate to say yes $ cha- ching ! $ .
Word is that Britney was all ready to pay her the big bucks , but Nanny Jo had other ideas .
Instead , she refused to take any money and in exchange for private lessons , Britney had to agree to have the whole thing filmed for an episode of Supernanny .
Realizing how much her tips will will help her take care of Sean Preston and also show the critical public she is trying to be a better mother , Walker says Britney agreed to Nanny Jo 's conditions .
IMHO , this sounds a little too good to be true , but for everyone 's sake , Britney , Sean Preston , baby currently in Britney 's tummy and the fans ( me ! me ! ) who would love to watch this , I hope that it is .
Plus , the story is so funny , I had to tell you about it .
Weeee !
Supernanny to the rescue !

Deficit halved 2 years early
Three years ago , skeptics scoffed .
Now they 're eating crow .
Three years ago , President Bush established the goal of cutting the federal budget deficit by half in five years , without raising taxes .
At the time , many — including USA TODAY — expressed skepticism .
But it was achieved last year , three years ahead of schedule .
Now is the time to build on that success and work with Congress to balance the budget in the next five years .
On Feb . 5 , the president will propose the customary five - year budget , showing declining deficits every year and a surplus in 2012 .
Getting to balance requires both keeping the economy strong and keeping federal spending under control .
Key to the first is continuing pro-growth policies — including tax relief — that have helped fuel our robust economy .
Since the president 's tax relief became fully effective in 2003 , we 've seen a dramatic increase in business investment , more thanseven million new jobs created and higher wages for American workers .
This stronger economy has also generated record revenues over the past two years , cutting our deficit by more than $ 150 billion .
This is why it is so important to balance the budget without raising taxes and not put our economy at risk .
Key to the second condition is setting budget priorities and stopping unnecessary orwasteful spending .
Fiscal restraint while investing in our national security is equally important to a balanced budget .
The president 's budget will demonstrate how balance can be achieved by using cautious economic and revenue projections in line with forecasts by outside experts .
On spending , the president will propose realistic restraint , while increasing funding for the global war on terror , including all costs of Iraq and Afghanistan over the next two years .
In demonstrating how we can balance the budget in the next five years , the president will continue to call for bipartisan solutions to the longer term challenges posed by unsustainable growth in important entitlement programs .
In fact , a key reason to pursue a balanced budget now is to position us better for that future challenge .
A balanced budget is good for the American taxpayer and for our economy .
There 's plenty of work to be done , but I am optimistic we can do it — across party lines — as the American people expect and deserve .
Rob Portman is Office of Management and Budget director .
It has been discussed recently somewhat in The new old ..
and Revisiting AWK , but I am finding more and more treatments of Unix shell scripting ( actually , not quite " shell scripting " , but the combination of all of the Unix mini- languages ) as a means to perform complex tasks usually reserved for real monolithic programming languages .
Here is an interesting ( intro level ) computational linguistics paper ( original postscript ) ( verbatim pdf ) about counting trigrams on a decent size corpus using just standard Unix utilities .
As John mentioned the other day , Dennis Hastert chose to give his press conference about the Foley scandal in front of a cemetary .
Well , Jon Stewart and the brilliant Daily Show team picked up on it and started off Tuesday 's show with a hilarious skit about the power and symbolism of the meticulosuly chosen photo - op backdrop .
They also pick up on the slightly more flattering angle FOX News chose to shoot the press conference .

Stewart :
That sounds to me like your publicist said " Hey , you know what ?
I quit . "
Because your speech was excellent ; you said " I will fight on ... " but the background seemed to say , " Yea , though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death . "
The world 's first Creationist museum - dedicated to the idea that the creation of the world , as told in Genesis , is factually correct - will soon open .
Stephen Bates is given a sneak preview and asks : was there really a tyrannosaurus in the Bible ?
Just off the interstate , a couple of junctions down from Cincinnati 's international airport , over the state line in rural Kentucky , the finishing touches are being put to an impressive - looking building .
When it is finished and open to the public next summer , it may , quite possibly , be one of the weirdest museums in the world .
The Creation Museum - motto : " Prepare to Believe ! " - will be the first institution in the world whose contents , with the exception of a few turtles swimming in an artificial pond , are entirely fake .
It is dedicated to the proposition that the account of the creation of the world in the Book of Genesis is completely correct , and its mission is to convince visitors through a mixture of animatronic models , tableaux and a strangely Disneyfied version of the Bible story .
Its designer , Patrick Marsh , used to work at Universal Studios in Los Angeles and then in Japan before he saw the light , opened his soul to Jesus , and was born anew .
" The Bible is the only thing that gives you the full picture , " he says .
" Other religions do n't have that , and , as for scientists , so much of what they believe is pretty fuzzy about life and its origins ... oh , this is a great place to work , I will tell you that . "
So this is the Bible story , as truth .
Apart from the dinosaurs , that is .
As you stand in the museum 's lobby - the only part of the building approaching completion - you are surrounded by life - size dinosaur models , some moving and occasionally grunting as they chew the cud .
Beside the turtle pool , two animatronic , brown - complexioned children , demurely dressed in Hiawatha - like buckskin , gravely flutter with movement .
Behind them lurk two small Tyrannosaurus Rexes .
This scene is meant to date from before the Fall of Man and , apparently , dinosaurs .
Theological scholars may have noticed that there are , in fact , no dinosaurs mentioned in the Bible - and here lies the Creationists ' first problem .
Since there are undoubtedly dinosaur bones and since , according to the Creationists , the world is only 6,000 years old - a calculation devised by the 17th - century Bishop Ussher , counting back through the Bible to the Creation , a formula more or less accepted by the museum - dinosaurs must be shoehorned in somewhere , along with the Babylonians , Egyptians and the other ancient civilisations .
As for the Grand Canyon - no problem : that was , of course , created in a few months by Noah 's Flood .
But what , I ask wonderingly , about those fossilised remains of early man -like creatures ?
Marsh knows all about that : " There are no such things .
Humans are basically as you see them today .
Those skeletons they 've found , what 's the word ?
... they could have been deformed , diseased or something .
I 've seen people like that running round the streets of New York . "
Nothing can dent the designer 's zeal as he leads us gingerly through the labyrinth of rooms still under construction , with bits of wood , and the odd dinosaur head occasionally blocking our path .
The light of keenness shines from the faces of the workers , too , as they chisel out mountain sides and work out where to put the Tree of Life .
They greet us cheerily as we pass .
They , too , know they are doing the Lord 's Work , and each has signed a contract saying they believe in the Seven Days of Creation theory .
Mornings on this construction site start with prayer meetings .
Do n't think for a minute that this is some sort of crazy little hole - in - the - corner project .
The museum is costing $ 25 m ( £ 13 m ) and all but $ 3 m has already been raised from private donations .
It is strategically placed , too - not in the middle of nowhere , but within six hours ' drive of two - thirds of the entire population of the US .
And , as we know , up to 50 million of them do believe that the Bible 's account of Creation is literally true .
We pass the site where one day an animatronic Adam will squat beside the Tree .
With this commitment to authenticity , I find myself asking what they are doing about the fig leaf .
Marsh considers this gravely and replies : " He is appropriately positioned , so he can be modest .
There will be a lamb or something there next to him .
We are very careful about that : some of our donors are scared to death about nudity . "
The same will go for the scene where Eve is created out of Adam 's rib , apparently , and parents will be warned that little children may be scared by the authenticity of some of the scenes .
" Absolutely , because we are in there , being faithful to scripture . "
A little licence is allowed , however , where the Bible falls down on the details .
The depiction of a wall - sized section of Noah 's Ark is based , not on the traditional picture of a flat - decked boat , but one designed by navy engineers with a keel and bows , which might , at least , have floated .
" You can surmise , " says Marsh .
When you get inside , there 's nifty computer software telling you how they fitted all the animals in , too .
The museum 's research scientist , Dr Jason Lisle , has a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Colorado at Boulder .
He realised he was a Christian while he was an undergraduate , but did n't spread it around : " People get very emotional about the issue .
I do n't believe we should ever be obnoxious about our faith .
I just kept quiet . "
And how did he pass the exams ?
" I never lied , but if I was asked a question about the age of the universe , I answered from my knowledge of the topic , not my beliefs . "
The museum 's planetarium is his pride and joy .
Lisle writes the commentary .
" Amazing !
God has a name for each star , " it says , and : " The sun 's distance from earth did not happen by chance . "
There is much more in this vein , but not what God thought he was doing when he made Pluto , or why .
Now , we are taken to meet Ken Ham , the museum 's director and its inspiration .
Ham is an Australian , a former science teacher - though not , he is at pains to say , a scientist - and he has been working on the project for much of the past 20 years since moving to the US .
" You 'd never find something like this in Australia , " he says .
" If you want to get the message out , it has to be here . "
Reassuringly , on the wall outside his office , are three framed photographs of the former Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh - " cricket 's never really caught on over here " - and inside , on his bookshelves , is a wooden model of a platypus .
On top of the shelves is an array of fluffy poodle toys , as well as cuddly dinosaurs .
" Poodles are degenerate mutants of dogs .
I say that in my lectures and people present them to me as gifts . "
Ham is a large man with a chin- hugging beard like an Old Testament prophet or an old - fashioned preacher , both of which he is , in a way .
He lectures all over the world and spent a month in Britain earlier in the summer spreading the message to the faithful in parish halls from Cornwall to Scotland .
" We want to try to convince people using observational science , " he says .
" It 's done very gently but forthrightly .
We give both sides , which is more than the Science Museum in London does . "
This is true in that the Creation museum does include an animatronic evolutionist archaeologist , sitting beside a creationist , at one point .
But there 's no space for an animatronic Charles Darwin to fit alongside King David and his harp .
On the shelf behind Ham 's desk lie several surprising books , including Richard Dawkins ' latest .
" I 've skipped through it .
The thing is , Dawkins does not have infinite knowledge or understanding himself .
He 's got a position , too , it 's just a different one from ours .
The Bible makes sense and is overwhelmingly confirmed by observable science .
It does not confirm the belief in evolution . "
But if you believe in the Bible , why do you need to seek scientific credibility , and why are Creationists so reluctant to put their theories to peer review , I ask ?
" I would give the same answer as Dawkins .
He believes there is no God and nothing you could say would convince him otherwise .
You are dealing with an origins issue .
If you do n't have the information , you can not be sure .
Nothing contradicts the Bible 's account of the origins . "
We wander across to the bookshop , which , far from being another biblical epic , is done up like a medieval castle , framed with heraldic shields and filled with images of dragons - dragons , you see , being what dinosaurs became .
It is full of books with titles such as Infallible Proofs , The Lie , The Great Dinosaur Mystery Solved and even a DVD entitled Arguments Creationists Should Not Use .
As we finish the tour , Ham tells us about the museum 's website , AnswersInGenesis.org .
They are expecting 300,000 visitors a year .
" You 've not seen anything yet , " he says with a smile .

GAZA CITY , Gaza ( CNN ) --
Two
Fox journalists kidnapped by militants two weeks ago in Gaza and freed appeared to be in good health as they embraced family and co-workers in an emotional reunion .
Fox reporter Steve Centanni and photographer Olaf Wiig were released shortly after noon Sunday and dropped off at the Beach Hotel in Gaza City , where they were greeted by a swarm of people offering hugs .
The hotel is a popular place for journalists .
The two men later crossed into Israel and left for Jerusalem .
The Palestinian government had condemned the kidnapping and the men's families pleaded publicly for their release .
( Watch as freed journalists prepare to cross into Israel -- 1:52 )
Hours before their release , a video on the Palestinian news service Ramattan TV showed the two reading statements proclaiming they had converted to Islam .
But the two later explained they had done so at gunpoint , and that the conversion was not real .
Centanni spoke to Fox News Network immediately after his release .
" I'm a little emotional because this is overwhelming , but I 'm really fine , healthy , in good shape , " he said .
" Somebody did the right thing somewhere because here I am , and I must first off thank everybody for their support and for all the work that this team here has done , " he said .
" My family and friends , I understand , have been very helpful . "
( Watch Centanni and Wiig 's first moments of freedom -- :59 )
Centanni and Wiig were snatched off the streets on August 14 by masked gunmen and held by a previously unknown group calling itself the Holy Jihad Brigades .
" We were driving down a narrow side street in Gaza City and there was a car stopped in front of us , " Centanni said .
" Before we realized what kind of car had stopped , four masked gunmen came over . "
Centanni said he and Wiig were shoved into a small Toyota and their captors draped black hoods over their heads before speeding away .
" That was the beginning of our torment that night , " he said .
A spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Interior , Khaled Abu Hilal , said the journalists ' release " is the payoff of the continuous efforts from different Palestinian sides to secure their safety and release . "
Hilal did not provide details on the process of their release but did confirm the Palestinian Authority will secure their exit from Gaza .
Palestinian Interior Minister Saed Sayyam said at a news conference , " There is a promise that similar actions would not be happening again , " although he did not say who made that promise .
" Regarding the issue of specifying the identity of the kidnappers , that is to be investigated by the Palestinian government , " he said .
" Our main concern at the beginning was to secure their release and not to put obstacles in front of those who were involved to solve this case . "
He added , " Whoever was the side responsible and whatever political backgrounds were standing behind it -- this is absolutely rejected .
It is the responsibility of the security forces to investigate . "
The journalists thanked British and U.S. officials and praised Palestinian officials for helping secure their release .
( Watch freed journalists speak after release -- 4:24 )
" I just hope this never scares a single journalist away from coming to Gaza to cover this story because the Palestinian people are very beautiful , kind - hearted loving people who the world needs to know more about , " said Centanni at a brief news conference .
Wiig echoed those remarks .
" That would be a great tragedy for the people of Palestine and especially for the people of Gaza .
Your story does n't get very well told because it is difficult to work here and anything that -- any little discouragement -- an incident like this could give a network an excuse not to be here and that would be a great tragedy for the people of Gaza , " he said .
In Kennebunkport , Maine , President Bush was informed by senior staff about the developments .
" The president is pleased the journalists were released and will soon be reunited with their entire families and colleagues , " said White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino .
The initial condition for release was that all Muslim prisoners " in the jails of America " be released .
The United States refused to offer concessions to their demands , keeping with its long - standing policy .
Pressure had mounted from Palestinians for the kidnappers to release the journalists .
A Palestinian prisoners ' rights group said that even Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails asked the kidnappers to release the journalists immediately and unconditionally .
