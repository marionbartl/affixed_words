Jim Cramer can't stop talking about Jon Stewart , and this week he told a college newspaper that Stewart " ambushed " him and that the show lured him into the mauling with lies .
Cramer 's self - pitying tirade to Ohio State University 's The Lantern reads like a tour through the stages of grief as he mourns the man he used to be before Stewart pantsed him in front of the world , and it bears quoting at length :
1. Anger : Jon Stewart does n't fight fair .
He used Facts and Logic because he hates me .
" It was a complete and utter ambush , " Cramer said in an interview with The Lantern .
" He told my staff that it was going to be fun , convivial , no clips , but [ it ] does n't matter , he 's a comedian , he can do whatever he wants . " [ snip ]
" Was it a fair fight ?
No , it was n't even a fight .
I came on with the idea of taking a high road approach and discussing the issues , obviously [ Stewart ] came on strictly to try to humiliate me , " Cramer said .
" It was brutal .
Was he stand - up ?
Absolutely not .
Did he comport himself as a gentleman ?
Hardly .
It was a deposition ; he wants to be a prosecutor . "
" He had an animus toward me .
At the conclusion of the interview , not on the mic , he said , ' I picked the wrong guy , I 'm sorry , ' but that 's not gonna get out there , " Cramer said .
" He just said it to me as just a throwaway .
His goal was just to humiliate and destroy me and probably get me fired , and last I looked , I still have a show . "
2. Delusions : Jon Stewart does n't know the real me , who is not an asshole and is always right .
All the people who watched the whole thing could see that .
" I think that people who watch [ " Mad Money " ] know that the show that I do is very different from the show that the critics say it is , " he said .
" I think that Jon Stewart has never seen my show , ever . "
Cramer said that while " you can pick any single clip to make people fib , " Stewart could have also shown clips of some of Cramer 's correct predictions .
" Those are the calls that I care about , but they 're not gonna mention those calls - that would make me look good .
It 's nobody 's interest to make me look good , " he said . [ snip ]
" It was a 20 minute interview [ ed .— it was a 12 minute interview , but math is hard ! ] , he picked the worst eight minutes to make me look as horrible as possible .
It 's his show , he can do whatever he wants .
If he comes on my show , it 'll be a fair discussion , but he 's not gonna come on my show , because he 's all about his [ ratings ] numbers , " he said .
3 . Acceptance :
But let me be clear , I am one huge asshole .
I know this because I am still rich .
" I am a highly controversial figure [ on " Mad Money " ] .
I was not a controversial figure when it came to making money .
And I can tell that guy , when he 's made his first 100 million in the market , I will respect his judgment about the market . "
Extra points for being willing to admit that his correct predictions are the only ones he cares about .
Except we knew that already .
This is just the latest stop on Cramer 's hapless tour to recover from the evisceration .
Previously he has made a big joke of it , called Stewart " naive and misleading " for attacking the media , and said he was just taking the " high road . "
Director J.J. Abrams is putting a younger face on Star Trek with his movie , due out in May .
But dedicated Trek fan Frank Elchesen is honoring the original TV series by re-creating props and entire episodes of the '60s show in Lego form .

New Star Trek Will Be Younger , Faster , Louder
Choosing memorable moments from classic episodes such as " The Doomsday Machine , " above , Elchesen lovingly renders his detailed images with nothing but Lego bricks .
He then captures the images with a simple camera and shares the images with the world .
Elchesen , 49 , recently finished re-creating the entire original Star Trek pilot episode , " The Cage , " which he posted in three separate photo sets on Flickr .
As Elchesen moves on to more episodes and more images from the expanded world of science fiction , he spoke about his methods with Wired.com from his home in Cleveland .
In this re-creation from " The Cage , " green - skinned Orion slave girl Vena dances for Captain Pike .
Why does Elchesen put in the hours necessary to create such images ?
" The time involved depends on if I feel like working on my latest creation or not , " Elchesen said .
" As for the effort , when someone sees it , I want that person to see something that is one of a kind — never done before . "
Elchesen analyzes his source images in an effort to keep the details true to Trek , as in this shot of the Enterprise bridge .
" I want people to ask themselves , ' Is that made of Legos ? '
A few people have asked that , and that makes the time and effort all worth it , " he said .
How long does it take for Elchesen to complete a shot like this moment of Captain Pike meeting the Talosians from " The Cage ? "
" Not as long you might think , " Elchesen said .
" The backgrounds I use are really quite simple .
I use bricks to raise or lower objects , stand over them with my camera , shoot the pictures , zoom in and trim .
That 's all there is to it . "
While re-creating space shots like this image of the Enterprise leaving a space - dock , Elchesen uses a black kitchen rug .
" I sit the ships or planets or docks on the rug and arrange the shot , " he said .
" Other backgrounds like skies and planets might be different colored shirts or a big piece of cardboard . "
Elchesen only has a few self - imposed rules when making his scenes , like this shot of the Enterprise self - destructing in Star Trek III : The Search for Spock .
" I try to keep it all Legos — especially with the ships and the planets , " he said .
What 's the fan reaction been to Elchesen 's Lego versions of Trek scenes and props , like the communicator and phaser shown here ?
" It 's been unbelievable and totally unexpected , " he said .
" I hope I can keep up the views with what I have planned next . "

Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $ 125 billion in economic losses each year , according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum , an organization led by Kofi Annan , the former United Nations secretary general .
The report , to be released Friday , sifted data sets and existing studies of health , disaster , population and economic trends .
It found that human - influenced climate change  mainly by exacerbating flooding and drought  was elevating the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition , diarrheal disease , malaria and heat - related ailments .
But even before its release , the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk , who questioned its methods and conclusions .
Along with the deaths , the report said that the lives of 325 million people , primarily in poor countries , were being seriously affected by climate change .
It projected that the number would double by 2030 .
Roger A. Pielke Jr. , a political scientist at the University of Colorado , Boulder , who studies disaster trends , said the forum ’s report was “ a methodological embarrassment ” because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human - driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable regions .
Dr. Pielke said that “ climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention . ”
But the report , he said , “ will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed . ”

Niall Ferguson thinks that if deregulation is to blame for our recent financial collapse , then financial deregulation should also get the credit for the preceding 27 years of economic growth .
Matt Yglesias takes a look at income growth over that period and is n’t so sure :
For the top one percent , that ’s a pretty impressive period .
For the next 19 percent , there ’s something happening .
But for the bottom 80 percent , there ’s just very little going on in terms of real income growth .
There was , however , pretty robust consumption growth fueled by the credit boom and declining savings rates .
The current downturn is now threatening that and calling into question the sustainability and worth of the overall growth throughout the period .
This is a kissing cousin to the question everyone is raising these days about financial innovation .
It goes like this : the basic benefit of all the financial innovation we ’ve seen over the past few decades has been to make credit more easily available , and that clearly had something to do with the credit boom and subsequent bust .
This in turn begs the obvious question : was it really a good idea to make credit so easily available ?
If the answer is no — if the only result was to mask stagnant wages and produce a fake consumption boom — then maybe all that innovation was n’t such a hot idea in the first place .
This is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom , and Matt ’s point deserves more attention as part of it .
For good or ill , the modern economy is driven by middle - class consumption .
If middle class wages are rising , everything is fine .
They ’ll consume more , debt will stay tolerable , and rich people will benefit from the growing economy .
But if middle class wages are stagnant , then vast pools of money are increasingly directed toward the rich , who have a limited ability to spend it .
So they end up loaning it back to the middle class , collecting economic rents along the way , and the middle class laps it up , figuring that their wage stagnation is just temporary and they ’ll eventually pay all the money back .
But they do n’t , of course , because today ’s rich have no intention of ever allowing wage growth among the middle class .
The result , eventually , is disaster .
I realize that most economists will never believe this until someone says the same thing accompanied by several dozen pages of equations with lots of Greek characters .
So can someone please get cracking on that ?
The Obama administration has come under intense criticism for replacing the term " war on terror " with the emaciated euphemism " overseas contingency operations , " and for referring to individual acts of terror as " man-caused disasters . "

The romantic imagery painted of Spanish bullfighting in Ernest Hemingway ’s famous book The Sun Also Rises might soon be the stuff of history .
Spain is edging ever closer to banning the sport .
[ social_buttons ]
Thanks to a petition with 180,000 signatures , the regional government of Spain ’s northeastern Catalonia area will soon debate banning the sport tied so closely to Spain ’s image .
Recent polling indicates that less than 30 % of Spanish citizens like bullfighting , reflecting an overall trend that animals should be treated more humanely .
Of course , it is likely that opposition to banning the sport will be noisy , especially when it ’s a multimillion dollar generating industry that ’s subsidized by the Spanish government .
Then there are also those fans to whom the sport is a profound tradition to be upheld , like a ten year old matador who set a Guiness World Record for killing six young bulls in one weekend despite protests .
He later declared , “ No one can stop me fighting … I was born a bullfighter and will die one . ”
At least this boy has been banned from bullfighting in Spain and now must practice his trade in Latin America .
The famous city of Barcelona has also made efforts to stop the torture that bulls face in the arena .
In 2004 they passed a declaration that condemned bullfighting , but came short of banning it .
125,000 people still attended bullfights in Barcelona ’s Monumental Bullring in 2008 , showing the declaration alone was not entirely effective .
In Spain ’s Canary Islands , however , the sport has been successfully banned .
But now as the Catalonia region of Spain moves to ban the sport , we can only hope others will follow .
About 250,000 bulls are estimated to die each year in the nine countries that allow the sport , with 60,000 of the kills occurring in Spain .
Awareness about the need to protect animal rights has become much stronger across Europe in recent years .
Earlier this month the European Union banned seal products in condemnation of Canada ’s brutal seal hunt .

Treating People right
About a year ago our flight was delayed coming back from a business trip in California .
Really delayed , as in minutes before we were about to board some observant technician noticed that one of our engines was not going to keep us in the air .
I was flying back with a good friend and business partner .
We were in California talking to investors .
I 'm sure he'd tell this story differently , but here goes nothing .
The problem occurred during a layover in Vegas .
You know how those things go , at first it 's an hour delay , then two , then three and eventually you 'll take off .
Except we were on hour six and no sign of ending .
One man started going to each of the passengers saying " F --- this , let 's ditch this flight and charter a plan . "
If I remember correctly , he was trying to recruit ten willing passengers , at $ 2,000 each .
I did n't take him up on his offer .
Eventually they canceled our flight all together .
No hope of repair .
My friend called his mother , who is a travel agent , to figure out what was going on with the flights , and what was available to rebook us .
The problem was that systems were apparently out of sync or some kind of miscommunication was going on ( I 'm not sure of the details with how these systems all tie together ) .
My friend started speaking louder as he was at the counter talking to the flight attendant and his mother on the phone .
Louder turned into screaming , which turned into profanity .
The airline had locked up the rest of the flights while they figured out how to reassign passengers .
The problem was that everything was for a flight tomorrow .
Not only was this extremely inconvenient , but all parties involved in the dispute did n't necessarily believe that the airline was doing their best to accommodate us .
After a bit more arguing , my friend walked away from the counter and continued to loudly deride the airline while on the phone .
I had felt that he had just done more harm than good for our cause , so I walked up to the same attendant and just said ( in an extremely pleasant and calm manner ) , " Excuse me but I really need to be in Philadelphia by 10:00 am tomorrow morning .
Is there anyway you can make that happen ? " I smiled .
She smiled .
It was the first smile she 'd seen in ten hours of people yelling at her .
She said " Let me see . " and about 30 seconds later she asked " Are you traveling with anyone else ? " .
I laughed and turned around to look at my friend who was about 20 feet away but clearly audible and still yelling .
" I 'm sorry he 's an asshole . " , is all I could muster .
We both laughed and she reserved two spots for us that would get us home well before when I needed to be .
I thanked her , turned around , and walked to my friend .
I interrupted him and said " It 's taken care of . "
He had this look of disbelief .
His response was " How ? " .
I responded , " I asked nicely . "
Our original flight did eventually get repaired and we did n't need to use the reserved flight .
In this instance things would have worked out either way , but being nice to others has single handedly gotten me further in life than any other quality or trait that I possess .
It 's easy .
Few do it .
Even fewer mean it when they do it .
Honestly , the bar is set so low that a " Thank you ! " and a smile will get you half way around the world .
FLOWERY BRANCH , Ga. -- Atlanta Falcons offensive lineman Quinn Ojinnaka is free on bond after being accused of fighting with his wife over his Facebook activity , police said Friday .
Ojinnaka , a fourth - year reserve drafted out of Syracuse in the fifth round of 2006 , was charged with simple battery , said police spokesman David Schiralli in suburban Gwinnett County .
Police said Ojinnaka 's wife confronted him about contact with a female friend on Facebook .
Police said he tossed her down some stairs and threw her out of their house in Suwanee late Tuesday .
Ojinnaka , who has started seven of 30 career games , told police his wife began the fight by attempting to stab him with a pen .
Falcons spokesman Reggie Roberts said Friday that coach Mike Smith had talked with Ojinnaka , but the team would have no further comment .
Mr Burnie bought Doxford Hall in 1993 A Northumberland millionaire is selling his £ 16 m country estate and giving every penny of the proceeds to charity .
Brian Burnie is open to offers for the Doxford Hall Hotel and its 10 acre estate near Alnwick .
He hopes to use the profits from the sale to establish and pay for a Macmillan cancer nurse for north Northumberland .
The 64 - year - old also hopes to pay for a set of custom - made vehicles to take cancer patients to and from hospitals .
Mr Burnie said : " We live in a me , me , me society and it has always been important to me to think of others .
" We can all do something by leaving money to charity when we die , but why do n't we do something while we are still living ? "
Writing out the cheque is the easy bit - its actually getting off your jacket and helping the cause you want to support that is the hard part
Brian Burnie Father - of - three Mr Burnie said he and his wife Shirley - a breast cancer survivor - would live on their private pension when the estate was sold .
He said : " We wo n't exactly be selling the Big Issue but we will be downsizing .
" I 've done the stately home bit - the bricks and mortar - but I 've always been a people person .
" To be able to do something to help people has a much bigger return than any financial gain . "
The Newcastle - born millionaire joked he " went to school in Heaton and not Eton " .
' Millionaires in kindness '
He said : " You are what your parents are and you should never forget your roots - we were millionaires in kindness , not money .
" Writing out the cheque is the easy bit - it 's actually getting off your jacket and helping the cause you want to support that is the hard part . "
Mr Burnie began his working life as a 15 - year - old grocery delivery boy before beginning a student apprenticeship for builders John Laing .
He progressed to become a trained engineer before moving into management - firstly in the building industry then in petrochemicals .
In 1979 , Mr Burnie and a partner started investment company Kelburn Holdings in Newcastle before later moving into recruitment .
Brightly coloured vehicles
This all led to Mr Burnie and his wife buying Doxford Hall from Northumberland County Council in 1993 .
It is now a 25 - bedroom hotel and spa complex which also hosts conferences and weddings .
Mr Burnie said he will call the transport service Daft As A Brush and will use brightly coloured vehicles .
Mr and Mrs Burnie have been contributing to charity for the last 40 years , supporting various cancer charities , inviting war veterans to their home for meals and opening their door to the less fortunate on Christmas Day .
A spokeswoman for Macmillan Cancer Trust said : " We are hoping to meet with Mr Burnie next week to discuss his plans and look forward to working with him to help people affected by cancer in Northumberland . "

HOUSTON  John Grunsfeld was sitting in an astronomical meeting in Atlanta in January of 2004 when he got a message to come back to headquarters in Washington to talk about the Hubble Space Telescope .
To say that he was excited would be an understatement .
As an astronaut , Dr. Grunsfeld had twice journeyed to space to make repairs on humanity ’s most vaunted eye on the cosmos , experiences he had described to a high - level panel pondering Hubble ’s fate only a few months before as the most meaningful in his life .
He was looking forward to leading the third and final servicing mission , which had been delayed by the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew the year before .
Thinking that the mission was now being scheduled , Dr. Grunsfeld raced to Washington , only to learn that Sean O’Keefe , NASA ’s administrator , had canceled it on the ground that it was too risky .
Wearing his other hat as NASA ’s chief scientist , Dr. Grunsfeld now had the job of telling the world that the space agency was basically abandoning its greatest scientific instrument at the same time that it was laying plans for the even riskier and more expensive effort to return humans to the Moon .
He said he felt as if he had been hit by a two - by - four .
“ Being an astronaut , there are not a lot of things that have really shocked me in my life , ” Dr. Grunsfeld said in a recent interview .
But , he added , “ I do n’t think anybody could ever prepare themselves for , you know , trying to bury something that they have said , ‘ Hey , this is worth risking my life for . ’ ”
Or – provocative title aside – why does Parrot want to move away from Perl in its build process ?
Yesterday , Jim Keenan asked me a question about a Windows bug in some Perl code used in Parrot configuration .
My suggestion was to use a function from IPC :: Cmd instead , since IPC :: Cmd is core in Perl 5.10 and thus already well - tested across a wide range of platforms .
In his reply , he mentioned that Parrot configuration targets Perl 5.8 with only core modules ( except things distributed with the Parrot source ) and he added this as well :
And , in fact , the Parrot leadership has set the goal of getting every bit of Perl 5 code out of the Parrot distribution .
See , e.g. , https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/619
I ’m sure there ’s more to the issue , but as I do n’t follow Parrot discussions all that closely , my first reaction is that it seems unwise to me .
( ( Unless the goal is to have Parrot completely bootstrap itself from existing Parrot binaries , which might actually be a decent thing . ) )
The advantage of Perl for configuration is that it ’s already portable – so you can configure the same way on Windows as you would on Unix .
Take away Perl and then you ’re stuck with MSYS or cygwin , or other ports of Unix tools to Windows , none of which are as easy to use as , say , installing Strawberry Perl .
That Parrot ticket suggests using autoconf .
Really ?!?
Google for “ autoconf windows ” .
Here ’s a example of what you get : I hate autoconf .
Plus , you need Perl for autoconf anyway , so this approach layers a unix -y tool on top of Perl to build makefiles to build Parrot .
That ’s a lot of places for things to break across platforms .
I ’d rather just have Perl .
In fact , I ’ll go further in my rant and point out that even Perl ca n’t be automatically configured on Windows because it depends on shell scripts .
Instead , configurations are maintained and edited by hand in the Perl source , and anyone building on Windows has to hand edit them again for any local customization .
I think that one of the reasons that Strawberry Perl has kept its momentum and frequent releases is that the build process got coded up into Perl : : Dist , so that all the custom configuration needed to build a Windows Perl binary could be automated with Perl .
So , maybe as an “ outsider ” to the Parrot project my opinion does n’t count for much , but I think if they really want to be more portable and more automated , they should be looking to use more Perl , not less .
Chad has accused Sudan of sending over the rebels Chadian troops have defeated a rebel attack in the volatile east but some areas are still not under control , the government says .
Aid workers were evacuated from several displaced people 's sites in areas bordering the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur this week .
The interior minister said all major towns were under control and the rebels had failed to gain any territory .
The rebels denied being beaten and said they were still advancing , reports say .
Chad has accused Sudan of sending the rebels over the border despite a truce .
There has been no word of casualties on either side .
Many observers believe the Union of Resistance Forces ( UFR ) group , which was formed in January , is making a last - ditch attempt to prove its relevance before the arrival of June rains makes any movement in the east impossible .
A rebel communique issued on Wednesday said the UFR 's ultimate goal was to reach the Chadian capital , N'Djamena , but the mood in the city remains calm with most people going about their business as normal , the BBC's Celeste Hicks reports .
Rebels in Chad have been trying to topple President Idriss Deby for more than three years .
Bombing Interior Minister Ahmat Mahamat Bachir went on national radio to say the rebels had not succeeded in gaining any territory , even though they had moved at least 100 km ( 62 miles ) into Chad from the Sudanese border and exchanged fire with government forces .
Earlier , he said that government planes had bombed the rebels .
Fighting was reported south of Goz Beida on Wednesday morning .
Estimates of the number of rebel vehicles in Chad range from 50 to 200 , and UN sources say two separate groups appeared to be on the move - around Goz Beida and also further south in the forested , unpopulated area that borders the Central African Republic .
A government spokesman , Mahamat Hissein , told the BBC on Thursday that there had been no heavy fighting since Wednesday evening .
" The government is in a position to stop the invasion and the invaders are always going backwards and forwards to find a new way to continue , " he said .
Asked by the Network Africa programme why aid workers were asking to be evacuated , he replied : " We do n't have military in all the towns and the NGOs [ non- government organisations ] are deployed even outside of these towns and are not secured by the army . "
An e-mail received by AFP news agency from an unnamed rebel leader on Thursday said the UFR was still advancing and all was going according to plan .
Another unconfirmed statement from the rebels , quoted by AP , says they seized 12 military vehicles mounted with machine - guns in fighting on Tuesday .
Amid concern about rebels passing through the area , Irish troops working for the UN peacekeeping mission Minurcat evacuated about 50 NGO workers from a camp for displaced people south of Goz Beida .

YOU are what you eat , or so the saying goes .
But Richard Wrangham , of Harvard University , believes that this is true in a more profound sense than the one implied by the old proverb .
It is not just you who are what you eat , but the entire human species .
And with Homo sapiens , what makes the species unique in Dr Wrangham 's opinion is that its food is so often cooked .
Cooking is a human universal .
No society is without it .
No one other than a few faddists tries to survive on raw food alone .
And the consumption of a cooked meal in the evening , usually in the company of family and friends , is normal in every known society .
Moreover , without cooking , the human brain ( which consumes 20 - 25 % of the body 's energy ) could not keep running .
Dr Wrangham thus believes that cooking and humanity are coeval .
In fact , as he outlined to the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) , in Chicago , he thinks that cooking and other forms of preparing food are humanity 's “ killer app ” : the evolutionary change that underpins all of the other — and subsequent — changes that have made people such unusual animals .
Humans became human , as it were , with the emergence 1.8 m years ago of a species called Homo erectus .
This had a skeleton much like modern man's — a big , brain - filled skull and a narrow pelvis and rib cage , which imply a small abdomen and thus a small gut .
Hitherto , the explanation for this shift from the smaller skulls and wider pelvises of man 's apelike ancestors has been a shift from a vegetable - based diet to a meat - based one .
Meat has more calories than plant matter , the theory went .
A smaller gut could therefore support a larger brain .
Dr Wrangham disagrees .
When you do the sums , he argues , raw meat is still insufficient to bridge the gap .
He points out that even modern “ raw foodists ” , members of a town - dwelling , back - to - nature social movement , struggle to maintain their weight — and they have access to animals and plants that have been bred for the table .
Pre-agricultural man confined to raw food would have starved .
Firelight
Start cooking , however , and things change radically .
Cooking alters food in three important ways .
It breaks starch molecules into more digestible fragments .
It “ denatures ” protein molecules , so that their amino - acid chains unfold and digestive enzymes can attack them more easily .
And heat physically softens food .
That makes it easier to digest , so even though the stuff is no more calorific , the body uses fewer calories dealing with it .
In support of his thesis , Dr Wrangham , who is an anthropologist , has ransacked other fields and come up with an impressive array of material .
Cooking increases the share of food digested in the stomach and small intestine , where it can be absorbed , from 50 % to 95 % according to work done on people fitted for medical reasons with collection bags at the ends of their small intestines .
Previous studies had suggested raw food was digested equally well as cooked food because they looked at faeces as being the end product .
These , however , have been exposed to the digestive mercies of bacteria in the large intestine , and any residual goodies have been removed from them that way .
Another telling experiment , conducted on rats , did not rely on cooking .
Rather the experimenters ground up food pellets and then recompacted them to make them softer .
Rats fed on the softer pellets weighed 30 % more after 26 weeks than those fed the same weight of standard pellets .
The difference was because of the lower cost of digestion .
Indeed , Dr Wrangham suspects the main cause of the modern epidemic of obesity is not overeating ( which the evidence suggests — in America , at least — is a myth ) but the rise of processed foods .
These are softer , because that is what people prefer .
Indeed , the nerves from the taste buds meet in a part of the brain called the amygdala with nerves that convey information on the softness of food .
It is only after these two qualities have been compared that the brain assesses how pleasant a mouthful actually is .
The archaeological evidence for ancient cookery is equivocal .
Digs show that both modern humans and Neanderthals controlled fire in a way that almost certainly means they could cook , and did so at least 200,000 years ago .
Since the last common ancestor of the two species lived more than 400,000 years ago ( see following story ) fire - control is probably at least as old as that , for they lived in different parts of the world , and so could not have copied each other .
Older alleged sites of human fires are more susceptible to other interpretations , but they do exist , including ones that go back to the beginning of Homo erectus .
And traces of fire are easily wiped out , so the lack of direct evidence for them is no surprise .
Instead , Dr Wrangham is relying on a compelling chain of logic .
And in doing so he may have cast light not only on what made humanity , but on one of the threats it faces today .
Think we 're exaggerating ?
We 've got the numbers to back it up .
As big as you think porn is , it 's bigger , and its influence on modern society is deeper .
As Jules Verne once said , " Some day , this whole thing is gonna be titties . "
This world is rife with moral decay .
Doubters need only look to the vacant church pews and surging Cracked readership for confirmation .
That , and the fact that the porn industry utterly dominates all others .

The Long , Hard Facts
Hollywood cranks out around 500 movies a year to an international audience of 2.8 billion .
Its closest competitor , India 's Bollywood , makes about 1,000 movies a year , but 50 percent are n't released and 95 percent of those released are financial flops .
This is unfortunate considering every Bollywood clip we 've ever seen has been absolutely amazing .
In 2008 , The Dark Knight alone grossed $ 533 million domestically and over $ 1 billion internationally , certifying it in the top five highest grossing films of all time and a crown jewel in the Hollywood empire .
It 's just further evidence that the institution of Hollywood cannot possibly be bested in any way , and certainly not by the data in the following paragraph .

As early as 2002 , about 11,000 adult movies were released per year - - more than 20 times the mainstream movie production .
Of course , it 's not really fair to compare them in that regard since Hollywood has to worry about dialogue , special effects and plot , while porn only requires a handcam , titties , and maybe a pizza delivery guy costume .
To meet current demand , a new pornographic video is being created every 39 minutes in the U.S.
We do n't know if that includes filming Giada De Laurentiis handling zucchini , eggplants or eclairs for various shows , but it damn well should .
I 'm not sure that eggplant is clean yet , Giada .
Give it another quick rubdown , wouldya ?

When it comes to cinematic preferences , people let their money do the talking .
Since mainstream theater chains wo n't show The Crotchmen in wide release , we 're forced to use other means of comparison .
And every time , porn wins .
For example , in hotel chains that offer in - room X - rated content alongside major Hollywood releases , porn movie rentals represent 55 percent of the overall pay - per - view usage .
Porn consistently generates more revenue than the hotels ' mini-bars , though that probably would n't be the case if the hand - lotion was locked up in there too .
In 2005 , there were approximately 425 films released in Hollywood , including a Star Wars prequel and a Harry Potter movie , with domestic grosses of $ 8.597 billion .
That 's very impressive .
In 2006 , the cumulative grosses for porn videos in the U.S. , leveraging video sales , rentals , mobile phone content and Internet revenues -- came out to ....

Are you ready ?
$ 8.65 billion .
About the same , and that 's minus the billions Hollywood spends on promotion .
Oh , and we 're going to take a wild guess and say that the combined budgets of every porno shot that year would n't even pay for the CGI in the opening credits of a Harry Potter movie .
So , yeah , we 're thinking that $ 8.65 billion is pretty much all profit .
Euroscepticism is alive and kicking in England , the BBC's Jonny Dymond reports , as he roams across EU member states , gauging opinion ahead of next month 's European elections .
In the leafy lanes around West Kirby , in the Wirral in north - west England , Conservative candidate for the European Parliament Jacqueline Foster is doing her best .
JONNY DYMOND
I 'm Jonny Dymond and I 've said goodbye to the BBC Brussels bureau for the next few weeks .
I 'll be taking the temperature in nine EU member states before the European Parliament elections on 4 - 7 June .
I 'm going to ask voters what they think of the EU and what their priorities are .
Join me on the trip !

At door after door that she and her energetic team try , there is no response .
" Has the football started ? " she asks one young assistant .
" That 'll stop them coming out . "
In Abbey Road she finally finds a willing victim .
" Hello , " she starts off , brightly , " I'm Jacqueline Foster , one of the Euro - candidates I was an MEP for five - and - a - half years " The woman in the doorway listens for a moment and starts to catalogue the ills that plague her life - potholes , the failures of social services , the sign at the top of the road that lists traffic accidents , the closure of local libraries .
Jacqueline Foster nods , listens , nods a lot more , agrees with nearly everything and after about five minutes , and after taking a key ring with the voter 's husband 's phone number on it ( in case she needs any advice in the future about transport policy ) , secures a promise of a vote .
All politics , it is often said , is local .
Never more so , it seems , than when Britain is going to the polls for a European election .
Travelling east across England the search is on for one person who has anything good to say about Europe .
It is surprisingly tough .
Merrie England
In the rolling Cheshire hills , the village of Marbury is celebrating a Marbury Merry Day .
An English Civil War re-enactment : Fertile ground for Eurosceptics
It is difficult to find anything more delightful , or closer to the spirit of that mythical place , Middle England .
There is a coconut shy , a tractor parade , a vintage car display and even a re-enactment of a battle from the English Civil War .
Sitting next to her partner , who is in full Royalist battle dress , is Marie Pickstock , a public servant .
She blames a lack of education and a highly critical media for the negativity that now surrounds the EU in Britain .
" I actually feel European , " she says .
" The first time that I voted was in the election that got us into the European Union , the referendum .
The political statement that it was making was about working together as a continent .
" I think we 've got caught up now in the whole economic thing and the whole process of ' what 's this doing for our businesses and our money , ' rather than thinking about it in terms of bringing us all together . "
National pride But Marie is the lone EU - enthusiast I speak to .
Instead it is criticism that comes from nearly every quarter of the Merry Day fields - about Brussels interfering too much , about the perceived threat to British identity , about the financial cost of British membership .
Lyn and Roger feel remote from Brussels - and proud to be British
There are the usual Euro - myths knocking about , but most of the comments are driven by a sense that something about Britain - for which you can generally read England - is under threat from a centralising , homogenising EU .
" I do n't mind being part of Europe , " says Lyn Bailey , sipping fizz in the spring sunshine , " but I do think that we should have our individuality as well . "
Standing next to the five - inch - gauge railway , the men and women camping out in the style of the 17th Century and the dog - dressing competition , I ask whether English eccentricities are really under threat ?
" No , " she replies firmly .
" But I think if they [ Brussels ] had their way they would be . "
" We are being stifled , " picks up her husband , Roger , " because European legislation is taking over from our English legislation and we do n't want to be ruled by a bunch of people who do n't understand us . "
I leave Marbury with the roar of cannon in my ears and head east to the coast .
The final stop is Cleethorpes and the golf club , which one bright and blustery morning is hosting a match between Grimsby Seniors and their Cleethorpes counterparts .
Cleethorpes takes the day , and over a fish lunch I ask what these wise souls make of the EU these days .
The response is resoundingly negative .
No -one has a good word to say about the EU .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The most common refrain is that the British were conned - that we thought we were joining a trading organisation , but it 's gone so much further than that .
And there are some strong words about identity , too .
Do you feel European , I asked one table of golfers ?
" No , no , " came one response .
" British , British , " came another .
" Definitely not a European , no , " says a third .
" I 'm a patriot , I 'm English , I'm English through and through , " rounds off a fourth .
At other tables , one or two people said that being English and European might be possible .
But the contrast with those who live on the continent was striking across the breadth of England that I had traversed .
Where continentals wear their Europeanness like a second skin , from Liverpool to Grimsby people told me that they did n't feel anything other than English .
And the hostility towards the EU in this admittedly unscientific cross-section of English society was clear and undeniable .
" We 've burnt our boats now , we 're in , we can't go back , " one golfer told me .
That wo n't stop many in Britain hoping .

Let me start with the " British " issue brought up by Andrew Brown , Hugh and Ian Edwards .
I am sure it must be infuriating to some that the English use the words " British " and " English " interchangeably .
On one level it is clearly wrong to do so .
It places the BBC in a difficult position though ; who am I to correct English people when they call themselves British ?
I 'm not sure I would even be right to do so .
I 'm English .
I'm British .
What I think is terminologically important is to make sure that at some point in an article it 's made clear that it is an English ( or English - British ? ) point of view , rather than a UK - wide one , and I did this at various points .
I apologise if I did n't make it clear enough .
Have I represented the UK fairly , not going to Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland ?
Not as comprehensively as I would have wished , since a quick look at the voting figures shows lower levels of support for withdrawalist or Eurosceptic parties in the other parts of the UK .
That said , England is by far the most populous part of the UK .
If I was writing about any other country , could only go to one part of it , and chose to go to a devolved part with only a small proportion of the population , I think it would be pretty odd .
And , to include the point that Arthur Waters of Barcelona made about Spain , Portugal , Greece et al , there is only so much time .
I 'd like to do more .
I 'd also like to see my ( currently quite small and very sweet ) children before they graduate .
As for the " universally bland population " of Europe that Michael Watters of Austin , Texas writes about : no offence Michael , but have you ever been to Europe ?
National stereotypes and wild regional variations are alive and kicking across the EU , uncrushed by the technocrats of Brussels .
And since when did a powerful federal government destroy regional variations anyway ?
When I travelled across the US I seem to remember Texans being very , very different from New Yorkers , Californians and Illinoians ( there must be a right word for that )
David Landt in Chicago writes about Britain maximising its influence in Brussels despite a sceptical population .
This chimes very much with my experience .
The British negotiating team ( called UKRep in Brussels - speak ) is widely thought to be amongst the best .
The political complexion of the Commission is much more Anglo - Saxon free market than it was , and the flow of statist and interventionist legislation has slowed to a trickle .
Battles such as the right to opt out of an average 48 - hour working week are of course still being fought ( and ' won ' in the eyes of the British government ) .
But the Working Time Directive dates from 1993 , and seems to me like something from a different age .
Finally , my own thoughts on the " European " question .
It does seem odd that a country like Britain , a key player in the Renaissance and the Enlightenment , home to Adam Smith and Karl Marx , for centuries a country that looked to Rome for religious guidance , that owned a great chunk of France , that imported its monarchies from the Netherlands and Germany and its Jews from the across Continent , could somehow not be part of " Europe " .
This is of course very different from whether you see yourself as European or whether Britons feel comfortable within the EU .
But let 's not make the Channel too wide .
As ever , I am deeply grateful for your thoughts .
Onward to the elections !
Here are some of your comments on Jonny 's feature :
What 's up with you interchanging between England and Britain , you should have given some viewpoint from Wales or Scotland as well .
Huw , U.K
My personal belief is that the EU needs to do more to help the everyday man understand what it actually does .
Which is a lot of use .
A transnational currency that once was thought of as an experiment is now a major reserve currency , is one of the examples .
I find it amusing that an American entry supports moving away from the EU despite the United States itself being a collection of states , many of which were suspicious of the creation of the USA after the declaration of independence , but nevertheless found it works .
Check the history .
As for losing British or even English identity , it has n't happened in all the time that the UK has been in the EU and is quite simply impossible .
The Germans are not less German .
The French are no less French .
And so we remain .
Cooperation is not losing sovereignty .
I say let 's get further in the EU so we can take our rightful place and run the show .
Kas Iqbal , London
It always strikes me as odd to hear the English complain about the EU when their country has done a phenomenal job of maximizing their voice in the union while not fully participating .
No other country has done half so well in getting what they want from the EU while opting out of what they do n't .
If I were English , I would be gloating .
David Landt , Chicago , USA Brits are not Europeans , you only have to visit Europe to see the similarities between all the European countries but come to Britain and it is very different .
I think being a separate island has helped Britain remain very much its own country and I like it .
Britain does not need Europe , we have just joined by default .
Most Europeans do n't even consider us as part of it ; Britain is the absent country of the EU and personally I am proud of that fact .
I will be voting UKIP this year , it 's about time we saved the £ 55 bn for our own country and develop our already strong relationships with America and the Commonwealth even further .
Rule Britannia !
Alex , Dorset As an American , I say there is nothing wrong at all about wanting to remain British / English .
Brits have a long and storied history and are showing their national pride and perhaps some disdain for the Euros .
Bravo !
Please remain British , and do n't give in to the transnationals , who want a universally bland population .
I 'm happy to see some of that renowned British fortitude still remains .
Michael Watters , Austin , Texas , USA I am pro-British any day !
Britain does not need Europe 100 % .
By her mere location , the EU relationship is a must by default and by the fact that the Brits are Europeans , but they can be sure to forfeit the rest of her ex-colonies and share their markets if they decide to embrace EU fully .
Britain can still be sufficient with her English and Commonwealth markets and a bit of mandatory links in trade with mainstream EU countries .
I am from Africa and have travelled quite a bit within the EU and am comfortable to be an English speaker from Africa .
Sam Kanja , Finland
I feel you should have canvassed views in your article from Scotland , Wales and Ireland too , not just England , as the title of your article is " In search of Europe : UK " .
Ian Edwards , Holyhead People seem to forget so quickly .
The European Union is a huge success in making the European countries work together .
Sure often the discussion is long and boring , but at least they are talking !
Gone are the days of trade protectionism between European countries , military build - up between Germany and the rest .
We can now go somewhere without visas , passports , fifteen different currencies .
Working or studying in another country still brings a lot of red tape , but nothing compared to what it would have been without the EU .
The dream of a united , free Europe that would never have a war again , is not popular anymore .
But the EU as an institution seems to have been succesful in implementing much of that idea , albeit in a bureaucratic , liberal way .
Also the EU is really bad at Public Relations .
If something good comes out of European discussions ( consumer protection , environment , ..) individual governments like to take the praise , but when ' bad ' things have to be decided ( fishing quotas , stopping government support of companies , ... ) it is always the EU that took that decision .
Hicham Vanborm , Brussels , Belgium Your column on the English view of the EU mirrors my own .
English and Islander first , Continental , not at all .
I believe the fault can be laid at the door of successive governments , both Tory and Labour , which have failed to ask the people what they want .
Now it is in my mind too late to go to the country .
It is time the UK withdrew from full EU membership and moved towards an arrangement similar to the Swiss model , where EU legislation does not apply .
Michael Harding , Penshurst , UK Sounds more like a sounding board for English Nationalism .
Comments like " I'm English , not British " from an English Nationalist will help speed up the break of these Islands .
This will make us easier to be absorbed bit by bit by the EU .
After all , if Britain can't be united where is the hope ?
Seems not so long ago we all fought as a BRITISH nation against the Nazis .
Now we are divided , no - one wants to be British any more , just English .
It 's only if we stand together that we can fend off the takeover of our BRITISH nation by the EU .
English nationalism will destroy this country .
Brian Davies , Verwood , Dorset , UK
This sad appraisal reflects the fact that it is very much a case of the blind leading the blind .
Where there is no leadership , it is hardly surprising that the uninformed have only negative attitudes .
Hugh McLean , Newton Mearns , SCOTLAND
How our memories fail us , Marie Pickstock said in your article : " I actually feel European .
The first time that I voted was in the election that got us into the European Union , the referendum " .
An interesting quote , but the facts , at least my memories are somewhat different .
The actual vote was not to join the " EU " but to either remain in it or not .
The Government having broken faith with the Commonwealth and many longstanding trading partners then asked us if we wanted to now break faith with our new European partners or not - some choice !
John , Moscow , Russia
The English have every reason to be sceptical about the EU , as one of the EU 's goals is to balkanise England into the English regions .
We have had no vote on the EU - just the common market years ago and we 've had no vote on the English regions but we get them anyway .
The EU is interested in power not democracy .
For as long as that is true the English must fight the EU all the way .
The best thing that could happen to England is the re-establishment of the English Parliament .
J D Asher , Birmingham , England Such a wonderfully parochial , insular reflection on England and the media there .
No wonder the UK is the worst country hit by the finance crisis .
Instead of being positive , engaging with Europe , exporting to Europe there is just negativity .
I live out in the Czech Republic and just about anything I can think of to do with home renovation just does n't exist here .
Compression fittings for water , damp proof injection DIY kits , cheap anti-corrosion or water - proof paint .
There is a FORTUNE to be made , yet every website I visit , company I talk to will deliver practically free in the UK but cross that water - No Thanks matey !
Instead of leading , Britain is following and losing - it makes me weep with frustration .
Rod McLeod , Ostrava , Czech Republic
It sounds like you spoke to a lot of old people rather than the youths of today .
People who preach about sovereignty are rarely in their 20 - 40s and those are the people who are raising the next generation with their own beliefs .
Having said that , I really do n't think enough is done to explain what these elections mean .
Mike Newlad , Lincoln
We had this problem too .
Our original constitution allowed too much power to the Federal Government .
We created the Bill of Rights , of which the 10th amendment is the last part .
Here was our solution : Amendment 10 - Powers of the States and People .
Ratified 12/15/1791 .
Note
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
Richard E. Taney , Collegeville / Pennsylvania U.S.A
I do n't feel European and do n't want to be part of Europe .
I am English and wish to continue to feel English and be proud of being English .
The European Union is bleeding us dry and trying to take over , by making us all abide by the European Rules they make , which do not necessarily benefit us in Great Britain .
Linda , Eltham I note from the map that the farthest south you 'll get is Verona - skipping most of Italy , and all of Greece , Spain and Portugal .
Do you really think this will allow you to report comprehensively about Europe ?
Arthur Waters , Barcelona
I have lived in Europe for 9 years , my oldest daughter was born in Germany , BUT , I am English first , British second & NOT European at all .
I am more than happy to work with the Europeans but I do not want to be such an integrated part whereby we lose our identity as we are doing .
Why does England not show as a country in Europe , but Scotland does ?
Just another chip at our way of life .
Peter , Basingstoke
This might have been a decent piece if it did n't ignore the non-English British voters completely .
How interesting it might have been to hear the views of those who are already ruled by a government in another country .
Perhaps they welcome the recognition of differences that the EU offers ?
What I took away from this , however , is there are still far too many English people who think British and English are interchangeable .
Andrew Brown , Tokyo , Japan
I now live in much - maligned Brussels but originally I come from another European country .
It took me a long time to realize that the locals did NOT really think of me as a foreigner ( that 's the Turks and Moroccans ) , just a provincial with some funny habits .
I guess the good people of Marbury would quickly realize how European they are if one could parachute them into the deepest Congo , Laos , or Oregon .
P Raman , Brussels , Belgium
What a profoundly depressing picture this presents of our country .
These people do n't understand the issues - how can you have a trading area without common laws and standards ?
It 's self - evident nonsense - they 're just reacting with narrow - minded prejudice against anything " foreign " .
" We do n't want to be ruled by a bunch of people who do n't understand us , " says Roger .
Why must he split Europe up into " us and them " ?
We are Europeans , and we are ruling ourselves .
How sad this is .
Mark , London Spot on Jonny .
The British were conned into the EU and anyone who thinks that the conned can grow to love the conmen is a fool .
The re-enactors are wise to be EU - sceptic .
They play out what happens when some people think they have a divine right to rule .
Tony Sweeting , Leicester , UK
And then those same people criticise American patriotism .
If these people are not European , then what are they ?
African ?
The problem with Euroscepticism is that it is either based on a total ignorance of the functioning of the EU , or on an outdated nationalistic attitude .
Valid critique is non-existent , but sycophantic xenophobia and nationalism are rife .
Case in point : UKIP
Nicholas Corbett , Slough Hello Jonny
I fully empathise with your problems in finding someone in England who supports the EU .
I myself belief strongly in the EU and what it stands for , as I personally feel that without a strong EU there is no way of competing with trading blocks such as China and India , nor competing against aggressive Russian foreign policy or developing a coherent regional peacekeeping organisation .
It 's a sad state of affairs that people near where I live ( Wirral ) are short - sighted as to the point of the EU .

SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) -- Former South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun committed suicide Saturday by leaping to his death from a hill behind his house , the government announced .
Former South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun served from 2003 - 2008 .
He was 62 .
Roh , who was president from 2003 to 2008 , had gone hiking near his home with an aide about 6:30 a.m. Saturday ( 5:30 p.m. ET on Friday ) , the state - run Yonhap news agency said .
He was found later with head injuries , and died at 9:30 a.m. after being taken to a hospital in Busan , police said .
A hospital spokesman declined to comment .
Roh left a suicide note for his family that family lawyer Moon Jae - in handed out to South Korean media .
News reports said Roh wrote it on his computer about half an hour before he left the house .
" I am in debt to too many people , " the note reads .
" Too many people have suffered because of me .
And I cannot imagine the suffering they will go through in the future . "
Roh 's death came amid an investigation into a bribery scandal that had tarnished his reputation .
Prosecutors were investigating the former president for allegedly receiving $ 6 million in bribes from a South Korean businessman while in office .
Roh 's wife was scheduled to be questioned by prosecutors Saturday , and Roh was planning to answer a second round of questions next week .
With Roh 's death , prosecutors said , the case against him has been suspended .
Roh had said he was ashamed about the scandal .
In the first round of questioning , he said he was losing face and that he was disappointing his supporters .
Watch more about his death »
The former president said he learned about the payments only after he left office and that some of them were legitimate investments , Yonhap reported .
Roh wrote about his thoughts on a blog that he maintained , which also attracted supporters and tourists to his hometown , Yonhap said .
Watch Roh 's political rise and fall remembered »
Roh 's suicide note said his health was poor and that " nothing is left in my life but to be a burden to others . "
" Do n't be too sad .
Are n't life and death both a piece of nature ?
Do n't be sorry .
Do n't blame anyone .
It is fate , " he wrote .
The note asks that his body be cremated and for a small headstone to be left near his house .
" It 's what I have thought about for a long time , " he writes at the end .
Although Roh had not made a formal guilty plea , many were disappointed that a man who came to power vowing an end to corruption would face such allegations .
U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement he was " saddened " by news of Roh 's death .
" During his tenure , President Roh contributed to the strong and vital relationship between the United States and the Republic of Korea , " Obama said in the statement issued by the White House .
" On behalf of the government of the United States , I offer my condolences to his family and to the Korean people . "
Roh hoped to leave a legacy of improved relations with North Korea .
Just before he left the presidency , Roh became the first South Korean leader to cross the demilitarized zone and meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il .
Roh believed in the " sunshine policy " of his predecessor , Kim Dae - Jung , that sought to engage the north , and Roh also promised aid .
Roh spoke to CNN correspondent Sohn Jie-ae just after that trip and said he thought his legacy would be to ensure that many others crossed the demilitarized zone after him .
The current South Korean president , Lee Myung - Bak , however , takes a harder line on the north and has so far not continued Roh 's efforts .

Astronauts have put a refurbished pair of gyroscopes into the Hubble Space Telescope after encountering problems with a new set on Friday .
Hubble now has four brand new sets and two refurbished ones .
It took Atlantis mission specialists Mike Good and Mike Massimino approximately two hours to complete the work , which was the top priority of the repair mission .
Later , mission Control confirmed to the astronauts that the gyroscopes and new batteries all worked properly .
A Winthrop , Massachusetts man has been charged with hate crime assault after beating a woman on Commercial Street in Provincetown :
" Twenty - year - old Eric Patten of Winthrop was arrested shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday .
Police said Patten approached two women in front of a cafe on
Commercial Street , called one of them an offensive name referring to
gay men and pushed one of them into a cafe window , which broke .
Authorities said Patten was drunk and thought the two women were gay men . "
CapeCodOnline : " … residents and visitors alike said they were disgusted by the incident .
' People
are outraged , ' said Dana Hope outside the Post Office Cafe and Cabaret ,
where Patten …allegedly accosted two women and
assaulted one of them . "
Residents in his home town of Winthrop called Patten a " do - gooder " : " No one was home yesterday at his mother ’s home , a three - story house
that sits on the ocean just steps from the toney Cottage Park Yacht
Club .
The neighbor , who requested anonymity , said Patten , the son of a
well - to - do family , is ' the type of kid who would run across the street
and help carry in the groceries . ' ”
“ He ’s a very good kid .
Very respectful , ” the neighbor said .
The women were treated for injuries .
Patten is due in court on Tuesday .
A blind man flying with his wife from Philadelphia to Belgium ( where he works as a translator ) was arrested and dragged off the plane when he stood up and demanded to know , after two hours , why they were sitting on the tarmac , with no drinks and no news .
The arresting officers did n't let him grab his cane , but rather accused him of faking blindness , then characterized his problems leaving the plane as " resisting . "
He was imprisoned overnight without being told of his charges , read his rights , or given access to counsel — and he injured himself while there because he did n't have his cane .
Cantisani said he spoke with the captain , who told him the plane was having mechanical problems .
He then returned to his seat .
Shortly afterward , another passenger made a remark about the crew , prompting three Philadelphia Police officers to escort that man off the plane , Cantisani said .
Then , police tried to remove Cantisani as well , he said …
He said the officers yanked Cantisani from his seat and dragged him off the plane , injuring his hand , which was gripping his seat belt .
Then they forced him into a wheelchair .
At one point , an officer held him " by the throat , " he said ..
During the struggle with police , Cantisani said , he lost his retractable walking cane , making him unable to navigate .
Officers told him they had done the " blind test " and did n't believe he was blind , he said .
Vanore said he knew of no " blind test " administered by police .
( CNN ) --
Dating advice books take a tech - addicted turn with the release of " Flirtexting : How To Text Your Way To His Heart . "
The authors of " Flirtexting , " above , say women need to learn how to text their way to love .
The book 's co-authors , Olivia Baniuszewicz and Debra Goldstein , seek to explain the dating scene based on the premise that men understand text messages while women need to catch up .
" It 's official .
Boys text , therefore girls must learn how to flirtext ! " they say on their Web site , flirtexting .com .
Baniuszewicz and Goldstein offer up a new etiquette for what they call the " A.C. " world of dating -- or " after cells . "
The pair , who described themselves as " best friends " and " best flirtexters , " spoke with CNN about their book , and the text message 's role in society .
The following is an edited version of that conversation .
CNN : What abbreviations would you need to know in order to flirt over text messages ?
Debra :
We say , " If you do n't wanna date , abbreviate . "
Too many abbreviations is a turn off , so be very careful .
If you do n't have to abbreviate , then do n't .
For " OK , " you can write the letter " k , " and for " are " you can write the letter " r , " but never the " great " with the 8 in the middle [ gr8 ] .
Please never do that .
Olivia :
So , the things you should avoid when abbreviating is writing " perf " [ short for " perfect " ] or " brill " [ short for " brilliant " ] back to a guy .
That 's fun for girls texting to each other , but not when you 're trying to flirtext .
CNN : What 's the difference ?
Why would a guy take it differently ?
Olivia :
It 's just a little girly .
You just have to know your audience and speak to it , and that 's all flirtexting is all about .
CNN : Do you think the idea that you need to teach girls how to use text messages to pick up guys is a little sexist ?
Debra : Sexist ?
Oh absolutely not .
I think it 's about empowering women to have the time to come across exactly the way they want and in the best light .
Watch how to enter this new dating world »
Olivia : I think flirtexting is all about empowering .
It 's all about you choosing your moment .
Girls can choose their moment .
Girls can decide what they want to get out of this text in order to ask him out , or is it a date , or for him to just meet up with you that night just to have a good laugh , and banter back and forth because you 're bored at work .
This is all that it 's about .
CNN : Are there any people who date exclusively through texts ?
Debra :
There 's a lot of girls who will say , " He keeps texting me but I want him to call " ...
I think there is a time when you need to put the cell down and pick up the phone if you really like someone .
Olivia :
There 's a huge no - no : not to be heavy in your text messages .
So a lot of times , I think things like " I want to break up with you " or " I love you " for the first time over text -- you should just not be doing that , and I think that 's a mistake a lot of people do .
CNN : What are some other things that should n't be discussed over text ?
Debra :
We say , " Do n't kid yourself . "
If he only texts you past 10 p.m. he 's probably just looking to hook up .
So girls , watch out for that .
Olivia : True .
And the other do n't --
I think we 've all been there -- is texting under the influence : TUI .
[ Laughs ] .
It 's true .
I think you 're out with your girlfriends , you 're having a drink , or it's a lonely Sunday evening and you just feel the urge to flirtext a guy .
You 're going to regret it the next morning .
So find a sponsor , one of your friends that you call or text instead , to kind of wean you off of texting in that moment .
CNN : What about dating using other mediums , like Facebook or Twitter ?
Olivia : Flirtweeting ?
...
Facebook has really taken that up to a different level and has opened our dating world in a sense to us .
Because we could be like , " Oh !
Todd is friends with my friend Sara .
Let me ask Sara about Todd before I respond back to his message or his friend request .
I mean , it 's beautiful !
Debra :
It is beautiful .
Olivia : I 'm gonna cry .
CNN : Could you all give me some personal examples of " dos and don'ts . "
Either texts that you 've sent that you 've regretted or things that were sent to you that were really bad .
Debra :
Oh absolutely .
In flirtexting there are the most important three dos .
We call them " The Three Ts . "
The first is timing .
Just because it 's speedy technology does n't mean you have to be speedy with your response .
It 's your moment , and we say , " Text when you 're ready . "
And the second one is thought .
You 've got 160 characters to create a message that 's sure to impress .
So take your time , and be sure to make him laugh .
And the third one is texting plan .
If you 're going to be flirtexting off the chain like we do then you 're going to need an unlimited texting plan .
And Virgin Mobile has a really good one right now , it 's called the Texter 's Delight .
And it is delightful .
Olivia :
It is a delight .
CNN : Do you all both use that company ?
Are you sponsored by that company ?
Debra : Both .
We do , yeah , we use it .
It 's great , it 's really easy .
CNN : Do you use the cell phone to talk ?
Olivia : I do with my mom , who does n't text [ laughs ] .
But um , she 's slowly learning and then maybe I can just get rid of that altogether .
CNN : How has that experience been , trying to teach your mom how to text ?
What does she think of it ?
Olivia :
It 's been challenging at first , being that she came from an over - the - phone , old - school approach .
She is coming to realize that it 's really becoming a cultural phenomenon and it's something that she needs and wants to adapt to .
And she 's also single .
She knows that she needs to pick up that phone if she wants to be flirtexting and going on dates .
CNN : Are you working on anything after this ?
Debra :
There 's hopefully more books .
I think guys are really interested to know what girls are thinking .
We 've taught girls how to text her way into his heart and now we think guys are really wanting to know how to get into our hearts .
So there 's a lot .
Good stuff .

' Libel tourism ' bill passes state Senate STATE SENATE
Legislation designed to thwart " libel tourism " - the practice of trying to silence one 's critics by suing them in England , where defamation is easier to prove than in the United States - cleared the state Senate without a dissenting vote Thursday .
The bill , prompted by the case of a Saudi businessman who sued a U.S. author in a British court for accusing him of financing terrorists , would prohibit enforcement of most foreign libel verdicts in California .
The Senate 's 38 - 0 vote moved the legislation by Sen. Ellen Corbett , D - San Leandro , to the Assembly .
" Britain has become a mecca for mostly rich folks who can litigate there to obtain judgments for bad things people say about them in California or anywhere else , " said Thomas Newton , lawyer for the California Newspaper Publishers Association , which is sponsoring the bill .
One difference between British and U.S. libel law is that a U.S. plaintiff must prove that the defamatory statement was false .
In Britain , once the plaintiff shows that a statement would harm his or her reputation , the defendant must prove it was true .
The U.S. Supreme Court has also ruled that a public official or prominent person suing for libel must prove that a falsehood was knowing or reckless , a requirement not imposed in Britain or any other nation .
Corbett 's bill , SB320 , would allow a California court to enforce a foreign award of damages from libel only if it came from a nation that provided the same protections to defendants that U.S. and California courts have recognized .
A similar law was signed last year in New York .
Although there has been no organized opposition to Corbett 's bill , a lawyer for the Saudi entrepreneur whose suit gave rise to the measures in both California and New York said Thursday that the legislation " addresses a problem that actually does n't exist . "
" In fact , no foreign libel judgment has ever been enforced in the United States , " said the attorney , Timothy Finn .
Without such laws , he said , U.S. courts refuse to enforce libel verdicts from nations that do n't protect the freedom to speak critically .
But even the threat of being sued for libel overseas has a chilling effect on free speech , said Rachel Ehrenfeld , the New York writer who was sued by Finn 's client .
" I 'm an American citizen .
I felt I had very good protection from the First Amendment , " Ehrenfeld said .
She learned otherwise after publishing her 2003 book " Funding Evil , " which documented the alleged role of Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz in financing terrorism .
Bin Mahfouz , who has filed numerous suits disputing similar allegations , sued Ehrenfeld in England , where he owns property and where 23 copies of her book were sold online .
Unwilling to hire a British lawyer and defend herself , she defaulted .
Bin Mahfouz was awarded $ 15,000 in damages plus $ 210,000 in legal fees and court costs .
Although Ehrenfeld has n't had to pay any damages , she said the verdict has made her reluctant to travel overseas and has hurt her research .
Look after the pennies , and the pounds will look after themselves .
In the alternative version of this , Colin says “ plenty more … coins in the …bank ” and then Penny says “ really ” and then Colin says “ well , not so much at the moment ” .

Interesting – there is another guy talking about how people should focus their efforts on fixing and improving core libraries rather than writing their own code .
Documenting Emacs also improves your Emacs Lisp skills because you ’ll likely be reading other hacker ’s Emacs Lisp code .
Most important of all you ’ll be working on existing code for Emacs rather than making more when it is not entirely necessary to reinvent the wheel .
I guess my last two posts , which have been more self - indulgent rambling than code demonstration , have muddied the purpose of this blog .
Let me try and explain where I ’m coming from .
Then in future posts I can get back to the important thing which is talking about code .
What do I want [ from this blog ] ?
I do n’t want to become a super emacs coder primarily because the effort required is too great .
There is no documentation other than the code that gets me from where I am to there .
And to be honest I do n’t care about hacking on emacs core .
My [ unrealistic ? ] goal is to get more people to write emacs lisp .
Not necessarily good emacs lisp but any emacs lisp .
Why ?
Because that leads to more discussion , more libraries , better documentation and more people writing emacs lisp .
It is a virtuous circle .
And if you do n’t get anyone in on the first rung of the ladder , for sure you wo n’t be getting new guys hacking on the core libraries either .
What have I done about that ?
I ’ve written about a couple of libraries and APIs that are available and techniques to solve simple emacs problems that are accessible to any programmer , not just one who is steeped in the emacs way .
And I think I ’ve done a pretty good job .
If I want to know how to use overlays , and even what they are where are the best places to look ( the answer – my lens which covers a practical use of emacs overlays ) .
If my blog did n’t exist , the only option people have to learn about this stuff is to read some fairly dry documentation or the code itself .
What about comint , my favourite library ?
Again , either my db mode lens or my comint post .
An example that is not mine : emacs fu is the best place to learn about custom menus and numerous other little emacs features .
Unfortunately a blog is n’t an ideal place for documentation .
But I do keep the list of archives up to date .
And one day I ’ll make a half decent index page .
Other places to go for a good introduction to emacs are Xah Lee ’s Emacs stuff and of course the Emacs Wiki .
Do you want to know why there are so few elisp programmers ?
Its because emacs is " self - documenting " .
That basically means " we ca n’t be bothered to write documentation " .
Take a look at perl , php , python .
The documentation is good , extensive and centralised and there are numerous examples and discussions of how to do things .
And perhaps not coincidentally , all of those languages are orders of magnitude more popular than elisp .
That should be the model to aim at .
And a good start might be to translate parts of PLEAC to elisp .
I ’ll take a look at that .
Technically , Burma ’s 2007 Saffron Revolution was n’t saffron .
The term was coined out of deference to the saffron - yellow robes that Buddhist monks in Asia usually wear .
The robes of Burmese monks ’ robes are , in fact , plum colored ( the better to hide the blood ? ) .
The Saffron Revolution was triggered by Burma ’s military dictatorship when it took the International Money Fund and its trademark “ structural adjustment program , ” as well as the World Bank ’s advice , a little too literally .
In one bold stroke , the junta , which has been ruling Burma with the proverbial iron fist since 1962 , stopped subsidizing fuel .
Prices rose at least 50 % .
Imagine the chaos that would ensue if the United States Government pulled a stunt like that ?
Triple the effects on a semi-impoverished state like Burma .
As revolutionaries have a way of doing , the activists who initiated the 2007 protests leveraged economic mismanagement into a general call for reform .
In the Southeast Asian tradition of Buddhist activism , monks soon joined in and gave the movement a shot in the arm .
Also , they really hit the junta where it lives when many of the monks marched with their traditional alms bowls monks held upside down .
Thus did they signal that any donations the military gave them would be refused by the monks , whose blessings the regime relied on for whatever sense of legitimacy they could squeeze out of it .
In retrospect , one wonders if severing the military from any pretense of a spiritual life freed it to act with even fewer ethical constraints than normally .
Though , in fact , some in the military , including at least one of the ruling junta ’s twelve generals , refused to cooperate in stamping out the demonstrations .
At the peak of the protests , the streets of Yangon and other cities filled with 100,000 people .
Soon , though , the junta rounded up the monks — on the streets by day and in monasteries by night — and detained and even killed some .
Soon the junta broke the back of the Saffron Revolution .
While the demonstrations were in progress , access to Burma was denied to foreign news crews by the junta .
Into the the void jumped the Democratic Voice of Burma , a collective of 30 Burmese video journalists ( VJs ) determined to keep the world informed of events in Burma while also trying to retain their anonymity , lest they be imprisoned and even tortured .
Burma VJs : Reporting From a Closed Country by director Anders Østergaard from Norway , where DVB is based , is their story .
The film is narrated by one of the VJs , code - named Joshua , who , early in the movement , is “ made ” by the Burmese authorities .
He escapes to Thailand , where he acts as coordinator for the crew , who smuggle their footage across the border to him .
From there it ’s transmitted to Norway , where the DVB disperse it to the footage - starved BBC and CNN .
The director is forthcoming about staging Joshua ’s scenes .
Variety wrote that they “ help to fill in the gaps , although some may grumble that it undermines pic ’s status as a journalistic document of fact . ”
In fact , with their low lighting , these scenes are unassuming and critical to continuity .
Meanwhile , the DJs ’ mini-cams drop the the viewer into the streets .
You may have experienced this before with news footage or YouTube clips of Nepal in 2006 or Seattle in 1999 .
But not to this extent .
In the beginning , despite the ubiquity of security , especially in plain clothes , flash mobs unfurl banners right smack in the middle of a marketplace and voice their protests .
At the time , geopolitical analyst F. William Engdahl wrote :
Myanmar ’s “ Saffron Revolution ” , like the Ukraine “ Orange Revolution ” or the Georgia “ Rose Revolution ” .
. . is a well - orchestrated exercise in Washington - run regime change , down to the details of “ hit - and - run ” protests with “ swarming ” mobs of monks in saffron , Internet blogs , mobile SMS links between protest groups , well - organized protest cells which disperse and re-form .
[ The population ] “ is being used as a human stage prop in a drama scripted in Washington by .
. . US intelligence asset[s ] .
. . to spark “ non-violent ” regime change .
. . on behalf of the US strategic agenda [ which includes use ] of the strategic sea lanes from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea . ”
Of course , that does nothing to detract from the legitimacy of the Burmese cause .
Useful to each other , perhaps Washington and Burmese dissidents might best characterize their relationship as “ Who ’s zooming who ? ”
As the demonstrations escalate , Buddhist monks march as far as the eye can see .
They and the students are met by the Burmese army , which surrounds and , at critical moments , opens fire on them .
In one frightening scene , soldiers chase students and a VJ , his camera stashed in a bag at this point , up the stairs of a building while shooting at them .
After the crackdown , many of the monks dissolved into the countryside and some managed to find refuge in the U.S. and join the Burmese emigrant community here .
At the special screening in Manhattan , a Q&A followed with the director and three of the Buddhist monks who were at the forefront of the movement .
One , seen in the film rallying his fellows in thundering tones with a megaphone , had reverted back to a gentle Buddhist monk again , lending his cause just as much gravitas as did his activism .
Trying to find fault with Burma VJs is no mean feat .
Forced to , here ’s one — Joshua ’s frequent use of the word “ shooting . ”
It can be difficult to determine if he ’s referring to the military shooting protesters with their guns or his crew shooting the protests with their cameras .
That ’s about it .
Random impressions . . .
Practically on the street with the protesters , at times you want to reach out and pull them from the danger .
. .
Disdain for the junta is dripping from those lining Yangon ’s broad boulevards as well as those looking on from apartment balconies .
Imagine how difficult it must be to rule a country in which nobody likes you but those in your employ .
At one point , Joshua remarks : “ I think I want to fight for democracy .
But I think we better make a longer plan . ”
But it ’s already been a long time — 47 years .
Watching the film it ’s natural to wonder how best the United States can help .
With our motives suspect , it might not be a good idea for us to intervene directly beyond sanctions .
Even they ’re of questionable value .
At the screening , DVB deputy executive director Khin Maung Win commented that the 100 - plus that the junta killed in the Saffron Revolution represent an improvement over the 3,000 in the 1988 uprising .
It would be sad to think such incremental progress is the best Burma can expect .
Trailing a string of national awards behind it , Burma VJs will play in New York City ’s Film Forum from May 20 to June 2 .
“ Hasta la vista . ” ~ Terminator 2
On May 19 , Californians will go to the polls to decide the fate of six propositions .
These propositions all deal with the tax code .
Passage of all five of them is required to ratify the compromise that was hammered out by Governor Schwarzenegger and the legislature .
That compromise was facilitated by the vote of one Republican , who switched sides after weeks of deadlock .
A two - thirds vote is required by law in each house .
Three Republicans in each house voted for it — the bare necessity .
The last man to switch was Abel Maldonado , a businessman .
The compromise mandates $ 14 billion in tax hikes .
Some compromise !
The state is facing a deficit of $ 42 billion .
That is not the total budget .
That is the deficit .
One nonpartisan website summarizes :
The California state budget , according to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on January 16 , is in a “ state of crisis . ”
He said that the $ 42 billion deficit the state faces “ is a rock upon our chest and we cannot breathe until we get it off . ”
As recently as October 2008 , the state was projecting a much smaller deficit in the range of $ 8 billion .
Even with the smaller deficit the state was marked as a state “ that could n’t pay for itself ” by BusinessWeek for having the highest percentage budget gap in America , with 22 percent .
If any of the five fail , the budget package must go back to the legislature .
The fiscal year begins on July 1 .
There is not much time to come up with a solution .
The polls indicate that five of the six will fail .
Only one is assured of passage .
That one specifies that if the state runs a deficit , there will be no pay raises for legislators in that fiscal year .
That proposition is on the ballot only because the vote - switching Republican made it a condition of his vote to raise taxes .
Their pay is $ 116,000 a year , plus $ 170 a day for expenses .
Frozen ?
The horror !
The governor has been on the road across the state promoting yes votes on these propositions .
Yet , back in 1990 , he sat in front of the cameras and did a promotional for Milton Friedman ’s PBS TV series , “ Free to Choose . ”
His rhetoric was libertarian .
You can view his promotional on YouTube .
Decades ago , my friend M. Stanton
Evans came up with a law , comparable to Murphy ’s Law .
I came across it in a delightful compilation of these laws , a book titled “ The Official Rules . ”
It is designated as Evans ’ Law of Political Perfidy .
“ When our friends are elected , they are n’t our friends any more . ”
Anyone who imagines that electing someone governor in a high - tax welfare state like California is going to make a difference is suffering from political delusion .
The governor could have killed this monstrosity with a veto .
Instead , he is campaigning for it .
His public opinion rating is down to 33 % .
That makes him a winner .
The legislature ’s favorable rating is at 14 % ( Field Poll ) .
Critics are likely to vote no on the Big 5 .
Within days , it will be panic time in Sacramento .
The governor and the legislature will have to come up with another compromise .
The last one almost did not materialize .
Republicans are in a position to kill this spending monstrosity .
Their votes can keep the two - thirds majority from occurring .
If California adheres to the state constitution , a no vote on May 19 will de-rail the state ’s finances .
The state will have to survive with whatever revenues the existing tax code will generate .
The recession is cutting revenues rapidly and across the board .
Then the credit - rating agencies will go to work .
There is a high probability that California ’s credit rating will be lowered within a few weeks .
This will also take down the bonds of municipalities , for cities that depend on state funding .
If California ’s credit rating falls , the state will have to pay more interest to generate lenders who will buy its bonds .
But who wants to lend to a state whose legislature is paralyzed and whose governor cannot persuade voters to agree to a budget deal ?
What likelihood is there that California will go bankrupt within a few months ?
Unless the Federal government bails out the state , the likelihood of bankruptcy is high .
This is why I think Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) will attempt to push a bailout bill through the House of Representatives when California ’s voters turn down the budget .
If she is successful , then a new precedent is set .
The U.S. government becomes the lender of last resort to state governments that are faced with a taxpayer revolt .
That will mean that all American taxpayers will be 6 n the hook .
The lender of last resort is the taxpayer , who must fund the Federal government .
BONDS AND PRICE INFLATION
There are high - income Americans who invest in municipal bonds .
They do n’t have to pay Federal taxes on income from these bonds .
This is a Federal subsidy to municipal debt .
But municipal bonds rest on the ability of cities to generate sufficient revenues to pay off the bonds .
It should be clear by now that the bankruptcy of California will raise doubts about the solvency of the muni bond market .
The Federal government will be pressured to use revenues from national taxpayers to subsidize bonds that exempt their holders from taxation .
Talk about a redistribution of wealth !
The endless subsidies of the current tax system are so numerous and so complex that no one can sort them out .
The system rests on the assumption that municipalities will not go bankrupt .
But they can .
The ultimate guarantor of state bonds would then be the Federal government by way of the Federal Reserve System .
This means monetary inflation : funding the Federal government .
But price inflation raises long - term interest rates ( bonds ) , which lowers the market value of existing bonds .
The economy is dependent on the Federal Reserve System to fund any shortfall in the Federal government that results when private investors and foreign central banks fail to buy Treasury debt .
That raises the issue of the long - term viability of the bond market .
A TAX REVOLT HAS BEGUN
California ’s crisis will escalate on May 20 .
It will be clear to everyone that there is a tax revolt in progress .
Californians have this wonderful advantage : they must approve every tax hike .
The state constitution mandates this .
This means that they can veto the spending plans of state politicians .
This threatens the unions .
The trade union movement is on its last legs in the United States .
The collapse of the Big Three auto manufacturers has put the United Auto Workers on the defensive .
The UAW pension fund now owns 55 % of Chrysler .
That means it owns 55 % of a turkey .
Industrial unions are barely visible today .
Unions still have large memberships in government bureaucracies .
The teachers ’ union is the largest in the country .
But a budgetary crisis in California points to what is coming nationally .
Taxpayers are going to revolt .
The revolt has begun .
California is a high - tax , high - spending state .
It is now facing the end result of a political system that believes that the state can always collect more money from the public .
The public is about to issue a veto .
The amazing fact is that mainstream media pundits see this veto as a big mistake on the part of voters .
Somehow , voters do not perceive that higher taxes are a good thing .
They are going to vote down tax hikes that are needed to fund “ vital services . ”
The pundits cannot come to grips with the concept of vital services purchased by taxpayers with their after - tax income .
The pundits are ready to accept a $ 14 billion tax hike , despite the fact that this will reduce the number of vital services that taxpaying citizens can afford to purchase for themselves .
For the pundits , vital services are those services supplied by the state , which has either a monopoly over the supply of these services or else provides subsidies for them .
The threat of a tax revolt to the union movement is very great .
If union members can no longer extract wealth by way of the ballot box — “ yes ” on debt and taxes — then they will face either unemployment or wage cuts .
They will lose their competitive advantage , which rests on their ability to force government agencies to deal with them .
The agencies are not allowed to hire non-union workers .
I did a Google search for the following :
vital servicesCaliforniaMay 19 , 2009
Here are the hits .
You can click on some links .
See how many lead to sites run by state employees , unions , local governments , and Democratic Party politicians .
California leads the nation in trends , both good and bad .
This is one of the good ones .
Politicians around the nation will be aware of the outcome of this election .
They will see that they cannot rely on taxpayers to foot the bill for every pork - laden budget .
The economy is in recession .
The tax base is falling .
Revenues are falling .
State expenditures are rising because of unemployment insurance expenses .
When the voters get through with five of the six propositions , California ’s yes - vote legislators will find that their yes votes not only did them no good , they exposed the state ’s government to a crisis .
They will have to pay for “ vital services ” with revenues generated in a recession .
The state ’s deficit will move up like a rocket .
There will be no way to raise added money through taxes .
The state will have to borrow .
It will find that it must pay much higher interest to secure the loans .
All eyes will turn to Washington and Mrs. Pelosi .
Like Mecca to Muslims is Washington to state politicians .
Politicians do not bow in prayer facing Washington five times a day , but they surely make phone calls to Congressmen and Senators .
The faster the dominoes fall at the state level , the more pressure there will be on Washington to run a larger deficit .
Politicians cannot bring themselves to live within a budget .
They see vital services — and vital votes — on all sides .
They refuse to cut vital services .
They always hope for another deferral of the day of reckoning .
Politicians believe in something for nothing .
Washington is going to be asked to supply lots and lots of something for nothing .
California ’s politicians want to be able to go before their constituents and assure them that vital services will still be available at below - market prices .
Uncle Sugar has come up with the money .
THE BOTTOMLESS PIT
Politicians believe in the bottomless pit of tax revenues .
They are like investors who think the same thing about corporate bailouts .
Washington is seen by all as a bottomless pit of wealth to fund vital services .
All services are vital , although some are more vital than others .
Which are the most vital ones ?
Those that are supplied by union members .
Unions vote as blocs .
The bottomless pit is the taxpayer .
He is called on to fork over the money .
But he is now using a knife rather than a fork .
In California , voters have knives .
They will use them on May 19 .
The Federal Reserve System is the bottomless pit during recessions .
It will soon face a new source of demand : state governments that cannot balance their budgets or sell their bonds .
If the Federal government bails out California ’s government in order to overcome a veto by voters , then voters can forget about reining in state governments .
They can veto spending , but they will wind up paying for Federal bailouts of busted state governments .
If Congress does not hold the line in this issue , the precedent will be set in concrete .
Governors from now on will say : “ You bailed out Arnold .
Why not bail out me ? ”
The political centralization process will escalate .
When the Federal government is seen as the escape hatch for state government spenders , it will pay to spend , run up a huge deficit , and threaten to default .
California voters will send Sacramento a message on May 19 .
The question will then be this :
What message will Congress send to state legislatures around the nation ?
CONCLUSION
I suggest that you pay attention to the results of the special election of May 19 .
Be prepared to see a bailout of the state government by Congress .
Here are the political questions that will face Congress on May 20 .
If AIG is too big to fail , what about California ’s government ?
If Chrysler is entitled to almost $ 8 billion in Federal funding just to go bankrupt , how much should Congress pay to keep California from going bankrupt ?
I expect an emergency bailout package to be signed , sealed , and delivered within weeks .
The faster the bond market responds , the faster Congress will act .
Let us see whose budget gets cut : California ’s or ours .
Probably ours .

A ' Psychic Thrill ' for US Empire
The United States began as a Republic seeking to avoid foreign entangling alliances , but the nation has been tempted over the past two centuries into becoming an Empire .
Bruce Fein , who worked in Ronald Reagan ’s adminstration , says the momentum toward Empire has accelerated over the past few decades as the United States established more and more overseas military bases and Americans were sold on the quixotic notion that they could shield themselves from risk .
( The story summary continues below . )
“ We get a psychic thrill about dominating people and thinking that we should n’t have to tolerate risk anywhere , ” Fein said in arguing that the United States has overinvested in military power at the expense of American freedoms and the survival of the Republic .
" Part of being a Republic is to accept some risk , " he said

Up to 500,000 terrified residents of Pakistan 's Swat valley have fled or else are desperately trying to leave as the military steps up an operation using fighter jets and helicopter gunships to " eliminate " Taliban fighters .
As the military intensified what may be its most determined operation to date against militant extremists , the UN said 200,000 people had already arrived in safe areas in the past few days while another 300,000 were on the move or were poised to leave .
The escalation of the operation came after Pakistan 's Prime Minister , Yousaf Gilani , made a public appeal for unity .
In a televised address on Thursday evening , Mr Gilani said : " I appeal to the people of Pakistan to support the government and army at this crucial time .
We pledge to eliminate the elements who have destroyed the peace and calm of the nation and wanted to take Pakistan hostage at gunpoint . "

The struggle to drive the Taliban from Swat comes amid intense pressure from the US and deepening anxiety in Pakistan about the spread of the militants to areas no more than 60 miles from Islamabad .
The government had initially hoped to bring an end to two years of violence in the former tourist haven by signing a controversial peace deal which saw it agree to the establishment of sharia law in the valley and in neighbouring areas .
However , the ceasefire appeared to encourage Taliban militias and their fighters slipped into the adjacent area of Buner .
Last night a military spokesman , Major - General Athar Abbas , told a Pakistani television channel : " To a rough estimate there are between 4,000 to 5,000 militants present in Swat .
We are looking forward to the return of the writ of the state . "
Yet the operation – which the military says had already killed scores of militants – could yet present Pakistan with one of its greatest humanitarian challenges .
In Geneva , Ron Redmond , a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , said there was now a " massive displacement in north - west Pakistan " .
He added : " The provincial government estimates between 150,000 to 200,000 people have already arrived in safer areas of North West Frontier Province [ NWFP ] over the last few days , with another 300,000 already on the move or about to move .
Those fleeing the latest escalation of hostilities ... join another 555,000 previously displaced Pakistanis who had fled their homes in the tribal areas and NWFP since August 2008 .
The new arrivals are going to place huge additional pressure on resources . "
What also remains unclear is exactly what the military will have to do to clear and secure the Swat valley and how long that might take .
While the Taliban may be outnumbered , the offensive is far from one - sided .
" They are putting up very stiff resistance , there is no doubt .
I do n't think this is going to go away very quickly .
It will be weeks , if not months , " said General Talat Masood , a former military officer turned analyst .
" But it 's not just about pushing them back .
The military then have to hold the territory and then set in place the administrative structure that will give people confidence to return . "
The military operations are taking place in three districts over some 400 square miles .
Much of the fighting has been in the city of Mingora , home to 360,000 people before the insurgency .
Among those who remain , some have said they had been prevented from leaving by the Taliban who may to use them as human shields .
The sales reports for U.S. videogame hardware rarely change from month to month : Wii on top , Xbox 360 in a distant second , PlayStation 3 in third .
In Japan , it 's been a totally different story during 2009 .
The past two years have seen Nintendo in a definitive first place in its home country , which on a total installed units basis is still rock - solid – one estimate says Nintendo has sold 8 million Wii consoles in Japan versus 3 million PS3s and 1 million Xbox 360s .
This year , however , Wii sales have fallen and PlayStation 3 sales have increased .
The main reason why is not difficult to guess :
There has n't been much compelling Wii software this year , while Sony 's system has gotten a string of system - selling hits , from Street Fighter to Yakuza 3 to the Final Fantasy XIII demo .
This perfect storm of software – met with little resistance on Nintendo 's part , unless you count ports of old GameCube games as " resistance , " which you should not – has resulted in Sony selling more units than Nintendo over the past few months .
Thus far this year , both have sold about half a million consoles in Japan .
What this really means is that neither of them are doing particularly well , historically speaking .
Japan 's market for home gaming consoles is smaller than it used to be , and it seems like Nintendo and Sony are scraping to get bigger pieces of a shrinking pie .
In February 2003 , while researching a book on Japanese games , I interviewed Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii .
At that time – not long before the Japanese game industry went through a major contraction – he said that games faced a major threat from the growth of the Internet and of cell phones , which he said were more attractive time - killers .
Since then , Japanese leisure time has become increasingly more fractured , personalized , and bite - sized .
In introducing Nintendo 's Wii no Ma streaming video service this week , Nintendo president Satoru Iwata lamented the collapse of the traditional family - around - the - television : " It has been long since traditional ocha no ma style where family members stay together in front of TV became extinct , as cell phones and the internet brought about rapid changes on people ’s ways of life all over the world . "
How interesting that an image of a family huddled around a television set , once derided as the decline of traditional family life , is now a romantic idyll .
But that 's not the point .
Iwata is no traditionalist attempting to maintain a stodgy old company 's values in a changing world .
For even though his words carry at least a subtle undercurrent of pining for a return to the traditional days when a family played Famicom together , Iwata 's company is doing all it can to exploit the new trend of personalization and fragmentation .
Iwata has been very clear on the point :
He does not want one Nintendo DS per household , he wants one per person .
In his mind , a brother and a sister sharing a DS is n't a charming Norman Rockwell painting , it 's a missed sale .
Hence the personalizable DSi with its camera , SD card , etc .
And this is why Nintendo DS and Sony 's PSP are doing much better in Japan than the home consoles .
How much better ?
To get a sense of what 's happened in the Japanese market , look at these graphs by data analyst Bill Harris .
Here , Harris uses " 12 - month moving averages " to illustrate the sales of game consoles in Japan since their respective launches .
Each data point represents the average sales of the console over the previous 12 months of its life .
This clearly illustrates the trends while adjusting for the little spikes and dips that occur with big game releases , holiday seasons , etc .
What this graph illustrates first and foremost is just how different the home console situation is , in this generation .
The dark blue line represents the PlayStation 2 .
That 's our benchmark for the sort of sales success that first - place consoles have always enjoyed in Japan .
Note that Wii , while it started off higher ( hence it is historically the " fastest - selling " console ) , has plummeted since .
The green line is GameCube , a very distant second .
PlayStation 3 , the sky blue line , was selling more than GameCube for a while , but the streams crossed a little while ago .
All the way down at the bottom , the Xbox 360 is doing significantly better than Xbox , but that 's almost literally saying nothing , considering that the original Xbox 's sales at this point were already trending asymptotically to zero .
With a lackluster holiday season that saw Wii Music flop and Animal Crossing not make much of an impact , Nintendo's Japan sales are what Harris describes as a " freefall . "
Hard to argue with that .
In the U.S. , game releases have traditionally had longer legs .
Look at the top 10 sales for January 2009 .
The ninth , Mario Kart DS , came out in 2005 .
While Nintendo has had no small amount of success getting Japanese games to sell longer than the customary two weeks , it cannot just coast off of those evergreen releases for as long as it can in the U.S.
New software is paramount .
As Nintendo has lost ground , Sony has significantly bettered its position in its home country .
We know , barring any delays , that Final Fantasy XIII will be released in Japan in late 2009 , meaning that Sony could keep up this momentum throughout the year .
While Nintendo has announced lots of games in Japan for 2009 , this list is entirely made up of second - tier titles like Punch - Out !! and Sin and Punishment 2 . Besides Wii Sports Resort and the MotionPlus controller , Nintendo has not said what major releases it intends to ship this holiday season in an attempt to give console sales a shot in the arm .
In fact , in announcing Wii no Ma , Iwata went off on a tangent to apologize for the lack of content : " As for our deployment during the latter half of this year , I would like to announce on the other day as it is not today ’s main topic .
I would like to address that Nintendo recognize that we have been short of new proposals during the former half of this year , so far . "
With titles like Monster Hunter 3 ( pictured top ) coming soon and Dragon Quest X coming much , much later , Wii does have some potential smash hits out on the horizon .
But has the damage been done ?
The possibility remains that nothing can be done about the shift in momentum at this point , and Wii will slip into a month - on - month second place status that it cannot fight its way out of .
Sony has been able to get PSP from a state of abject failure into a more reasonably successful position in the Japanese portable market .
It stands to reason that it could do the same for PlayStation 3 , especially up against Wii 's weaker software lineup .
But in the battle for Japan 's living room , I wonder if anyone can truly say that they are winning .

VIEWPOINT
Barry Gardiner
Biodiversity is not getting the attention it deserves on the international agenda , says Barry Gardiner .
In this week 's Green Room , he warns that we need to understand the true value of ecological services before it is too late .
Well - intentioned campaigning organisations have fed us with sentimental descriptions of the polar bear , giant panda and blue whale
For the past 16 months I have put off upgrading my mobile phone because two years ago a little girl was stung by a jellyfish on a beach in south - west England .
Let me elaborate : it is demand for the latest mobile phones that has made the metal coltan so valuable , leading to conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
That conflict has caused deforestation , which has seen a decline in the number of forest mammals .
As a result , more people demand more fish as an alternative protein , leading to overfishing of species higher up the food chain .
Fishermen , in turn , have shifted their focus to species further down the food chain , reducing their population .
This has allowed jellyfish become the lower reaches of the food chain .
Hence , a possible reason why large blooms of jellyfish were invading the south coast of England .
Web of life Every form of life on this planet stands not on its own but is supported by , and supports , other living things .
Jellyfish blooms could be a sign that all is not well beneath the waves
Lose one species and you lose a vital part of some ecosystem .
That means you lose not just a plant or an insect but a service : you lose the medicine that comes from that plant ; you lose the pollination of crops which that insect provides .
Climate change matters , not because the world must n't get any hotter , but because the rate of change is too fast for species to keep pace .
As species die , so biodiversity is depleted and with it the ecosystem services that such biodiversity provides .
How ridiculous then that over the last three months , climate change has had 1,382 mentions in British national newspapers .
Yet , during the same period , biodiversity was mentioned just 115 times .
' Side show '
We have ignored the circus and focused on the side show .
Arguments for biodiversity have proven to be much less compelling for business leaders than Nicholas Stern 's reports
Perhaps the reason why biodiversity has been ignored while climate change has been taken progressively more seriously is that the case for biodiversity has often been couched in emotional terms .
Well - intentioned campaigning organisations have fed us with sentimental descriptions of the polar bear , giant panda and blue whale .
However , these arguments for biodiversity have proven to be much less compelling for business leaders than Nicholas Stern 's report that climate change could cost us between 5 % and 20 % of global GDP by the end of the century .
Yet , the head of Deutsche Bank 's Global Markets predicts that our current rate of biodiversity loss could see 6 % of global GDP wiped out as early as 2050 .
Climate change does not just lead to biodiversity loss ; causality works the other way around too .
It is the loss of forest that is causing climate change .
It would be comforting to think that we can control this process , which is linear and predictable .
It is not .
In nature , disruptions to the equilibrium led to turbo - charged changes .
Yet nobody puts a value on pollination ; national accounts do not reflect the value of ecosystem services that stop soil erosion or provide watershed protection .
Economists call these externalities : things which we can take for granted and need not be ascribed a value .
The economists are wrong .
Unless we begin to value this natural capital in exactly the same way we value human or social capital , we will not begin to tackle the problem .
Is n't it ironic that the UK has a treasury department that spends most of its time talking about over - leveraging in the financial system and credit bubbles , but cannot see the connection with a world that every year consumes resources that it takes the planet one year and four months to renew or replace ?
The problems is that biodiversity is still left as the responsibility of environment ministers , who are usually relatively junior .
They do not have the clout to make changes across government policy .
Biodiversity should be , as climate change is beginning to be , a heads of governments ' issue .
Just as climate change has moved out of its environment cul - de-sac into mainstream government thinking to influence decisions on everything from transport to development and energy policies , so biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide need to be considered in every government decision .
The issue lacks a body like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to provide scientific assessments and advice to governments and the public .
Most important of all , we need a global agreement with teeth to protect biodiversity that captures the imagination like Kyoto .
Otherwise , the hordes of jellyfish will be the least of our problems .
Barry Gardiner is the Labour MP for Brent North , and co-chairman of the Global Legislators Organisation ( Globe ) Land Use Change & Ecosystems Dialogue The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Barry Gardiner ?
Are governments overlooking the importance of biodiversity ?
Do we need to make sure that ecological services are valued properly within our economies ?
Or is biodiversity just one of many issues that is clamouring for attention ?
Mr Gardiner is right , we humans , supposed to be the most intelligent , are acting ignorant on the issue of biodiversity .
If we protect biodiversity and the environment then the climate change will control itself .
The root cause of the climate change is the depletion of the biodiversity itself .
Ashish Parajuli , Kathmandu , Nepal Nice article .
Environmental debate is always focused on global warming .
When the arguably more important and compelling issues of reducing resource usage and decreases in biodiversity are a side line .
What we need to focus on is using less resources and preserving as much habit , and thus biodiversity , as possible .
We need to combat these things for there own sake .
Climate change would then be sorted out as a bi-product .
We are caretakers of the ONLY place in the universe that we know supports life , lets try and do a good job .
Chris , Bristol I 'm think so , The Government would be supported everything for conservation biological diversity .
Dr Kamolchai Kotcha , tHAILAND
Thoughtful and thought - provoking piece !
Thanks Barry and BBC Green Room !
Yes the environment is an interconnected system of systems !
And again and again we are realizing the shortcomings of tackling our problems in a piecemeal fashion .
Even if scientists start pointing out the linkages between our actions and consequences , our political systems seem inequipped to respond in a way that fixes one problem without creating another .
It 's is heartening when an elected member of parliament shows such a level of understanding !
Noha , Washington , DC A compelling message once it is understood .
Explained as clearly as this ignorance may not win the future .
Andy , Bruxelles I agree strongly with Barry and its been a major concern that that environmental considerations will be sideline with the current economic climate .
I second Barry 's ( Leeds ) comment if only the government push and support environmental concerns as hard as they work on the financial system .
Maybe its time for a bigger power like the EU to take the lead in this region .
Currently all environmental improvements via EU funds are mainstreamed within other programmes such as economic development .
This is not the right message .
If we want the environment to be the economic driver than policies , programmes and funds need to designed on this aspect .
EU need to have a separate fund for environment since most other bigger donors life UNDP , UNEP and GEF are mainly focusing on developing countries .
Kalpana , Cardiff , Wales
So refreshing to hear a Westminster politician cover this subject so well .
CO2 emissions and biodiversity loss are ' THE ' challenges of the 21st century and they are very intimately link .
My feeling is that climate change is a hot topic of debate ( not action unfortunately ) because it is seen to some degree as a technical fix and economic opportunity .
20th century politics ( which Gordon Brown represents ) still views the world in terms of GDP growth and economic models and CO2 emissions can be ssen to fit into these ( e.g. decoupling CO2 and GDP , renewable sector growth etc ) .
However , biodiversity can only be tackled by consuming less ( not consuming more but more efficiently ) .
This concept is totally alien to most post - Thatcher / Reagan economists and politicians .
Of course there 's also the other thorny issue of population growth :(
Having studied Env Science for the past 7 years I can see the train wreck we 're heading towards but I 'm still accused of being a woolly green idealist .
I do n't see it that way , I think of myself as a hard - nosed environmentalist willing to face up the new challenges .
It is economists and politicians with their 20th C world view that are living in a dreamworld ( or imo nightmare ) of perpetual growth .
Roly , London
It is good to read that an MP is concerned about biodiversity , as a conservation biologist that has worked and lived for the last 15 years in developing countries in the tropics , I wish there were more .
Unfortunately I think biodiversity and conservation in developing / emerging nations is going to be another causality of the financial crisis .
Colin , Sabah I agree with the broad spectrum that Barry puts forward .
We are facing a ecological crisis far greater than any banking crisis .
The issue of market forces and valuing ecosystem services is not addressed in mainstream economics .
Herman
Daly the founder of ecological economics offers many solutions putting a price on ecosystem services and how prudent discounting can protect fragile ecosystems .
I would disagree with Barry when he says there is no organization like the IPCC relating to biodiversity .
Indeed the WWF published a detailed " living Planet Report " anally and the UNDP published the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment giving a overview of the decline of biodiversity in all biomes .
The choice of Governments to ignore these warnings is a reflection of ignorance and misinterpretation .
Philip Crump , Plymouth UK
Governments seem to be only able to handle one major crisis at a time .
Biodiversity was in vogue for a number of years in the 1990s but Climate Change has pushed it out .
Now the World economic crisis has pushed Climate Change off the front page , although Stern showed how closely linked they are .
Attempts have been made to cost ecosystem services , starting with Costanza et al in Nature in 1997 ( $ 33 trillion per annum ) but politicians and the general public do n't read scientific journals so their impact has never been as great as the effect the Stern Report had for Climate Change .
But you could argue that even this seems to have had little real influence on the thinking of governments across the World .
It is only with a new administration in the US that the Challenge seems to have been renewed to combat Climate Change .
Barry Gardiner has made some valuable points but will either this government or others around the World respond to them ?
I doubt it somehow !
Dr Nick Carter , Spalding England
Thank you Barry Gardiner and the Green Room .
You clearly pointed out the inter - connected nature of living systems , of which we humans are a part of , but tend to forget whilst watching the scary stories on the nightly news .
It is broadly agreed that biodiversity is a key indicator of a healthy living system , our " canary in the coal mine " .
Our living system happens to be the planet Earth , and as we compromise the health of this system by pushing it to the limits ( and often beyond ) through exploitation of natural resources ( unsustainable forestry , fishing , mining , excess consumption , for example ) , we are destroying the very foundations we require for healthy human habitation .
Yes , climate change is clearly an issue , but more so from the perspective on how it will effect biodiversity rather than the economy .
We must put first things first .
The fundamental flaws with the world 's financial system were there for many years before the collapse and we did not act .
Do we need to wait for our ecological systems to collapse before we come to our senses ?
Then it will be far too late .
Tibor Hegedis , Hepburn Springs , VIC .
Australia
Just few thousands years ago , we were struggling to create space for the agriculture and homes on the earth which was full of forest and biodiversity .
We killed animals , birds , fishes for our survival .
We utilized their flash , skins etc for our use .
We survived and moved forward .
With the help of many discoveries and ideas , we kept on developing ourselves and became the most powerful specie of this planet .
But , things have reversed now .
We have to recreate the forest , environment , biodiversity with the same passion what we have been destroying earlier and even today .
Once again it 's a question of our survival .
On one hand , we are seeking possibility of shifting life on the Mars and other planets ; on the other hand we are least bothered about the natural biodiversity available on our own planet .
We have outnumbered all the species .
We are the fittest person on the planet though we have made our own planet unfit for everybody .
Barry Gardiner has raised a most basic issue and I really support his effort .
Sanjay Singh
Thakur , Indore , India Humans are in direct competition with all other species - we cannot protect biodiversity without limiting the size and impact of the rapidly expanding human population .
Such measures are unacceptable to our blinkered politicians , who will continue with " business as usual " politics until global heating and mass extinctions makes large areas of the earth uninhabitable for humans .
We need to face up to the approaching catastrophe and demand the radical measures that are necessary to mitigate it .
It is no longer preventable , but to ensure our species survives at all we need to act now .
Leyton Williams - Davies , Pontypool , Wales
The vast majority of Australian Politicians and powerful forestry groups view nature as an extraction / exploitation resource that must supply commodities for industry to justify its existance .
Australia 's unique Gondwana ecosystems are doomed to be enlessly ' compromised ' .
The Murray River is dying and Tasmania 's moist forests are logged ; prime examples of this ' economic rationalist ' death wish .
No jobs on a dead planet .
Good for you Barry Gardiner !
Angela Halpin , Trentham Victoria Australia GMO's , climate change , overfishing , clear - cutting , strip mining , chemical fertilizers and long - lived / broad spectrum pesticides ... will it end only when we are too weak to continue the assault on this space - ship earth that we are compelled to call home ?
I 'm an organic gardener and yes , biodiversity matters .
Bill in Detroit , Detroit , MI USA I agree with Mr. Gardiner .
Polar bears and pandas are cute , but the world could make it without them .
Frogs , honey bees and earthworms are just a few of many more also at risk .
We would be far worse off without them .
Meanwhile the human species carries on with warfare over petty disputes over religion and tribal feuds .
It 's long past time to wake up people .
Les Johnson , Selkirk NY USA I could n't agree more .
What this government ( and all others ) needs is to recognise this fact before it's too late and make everyone else fully aware of the issue , but I 'm afraid that eco dollars are n't as influential as consumer dollars .
We need to take the lead , but is Gordon the right man to lead us ?
Pete , Rhiwlas Biodiversity is vital to our survival on this planet .
Unfortunately , not many people are able ( or willing ) to connect the dots as poignantly as Barry Gardiner .
I applaud him and encourage him to continue the work of bringing this awareness to governments and to the public .
Jan Kabatoff , Canmore , Alberta , Canada Yes , I entirely agree with the distinguisghed MP .
We human beings took the atompsher for granted and emitted all sorts of noxious gases and we see where we are now .
The same is happening with the way we treat living resources .
If you go into rural Africa or other similar developing countries , life is almost completely dependent on biological resources .
The hats they live in are built from grass and wood .
You see people flocking to the nearby markets carrying things on their heads , shoulders or on the back of pack animals .
Everything is a product or an extract of the natural living things in the surrounding environment - fruits , wood , eggs , butter , grains , birds , charcoal , traditionally weaved garments , etc .
Imagine what the dramatic depletion of these resources would mean to the livelihood of these people .
Measures that are taken in areas such as fisheries , forestry and wildlife are primarily intended to regulate competition among users and to generate revenues for the government from license fees or by imposing user fees .
The real value of the ecological services that these resources are providing to keep the complex web of life healthy are not taken into account .
Valuation of the ecological services of species and the inclusion of such values into the national accounting system is long overdue .
Moreover , no effort that we take to day with respect to climate change will be successful or sustainable in a world that loses its biological diversity base in an alarming rate .
Worku Damena Yifru , Montreal , Canada
I think I agree with Barry , although I think he is wrong about externalities in economics and is being a bit unfair to economists .
I always understood an externality was a cost of consuming a resource that is not reflected in the market price .
The timber merchant pays the cost of extracting wood to a logger for example , but neither of them pays the price of the loss of bio-diversity .
That cost is incurred by us all and by future generations .
I thought the point of an externality was not that we need not ascribed a value , but that we MUST artificially ascribe a value through taxation , legislation etc. to ensure the market price reflects the true cost of consuming a resource ( although , how do you ascribe a value to biodiversity ? ) .
It seems to me the unregulated free market model that has come to pre-dominate world - wide is simply unable to deal with the major environmental problems we now face .
However , a new economic model that can address these issues is just not emerging fast enough .
Paul A , Absolutely agree , if the Government would put as much energy and effort into this matter as they are in trying to rejuvenate a now discredited financial system , then we would be much further forward .
I have no faith this will ever happen under the present government , because our leader is an economist with no environmental credentials .

For those familiar with Domain Driven Design ( DDD ) , this may seem like common sense .
However , as more people adopt DDD concepts , this subtlety is definitely something to pay attention to .
Quick Overview of Entities
In DDD , an entity is a design pattern used to describe an object in the domain model that is truly unique ; it has its own identity and distinctive behavior .
An easy way to identify entities is to ask yourself , “ If I duplicate an instance of this object , will it cause data integrity issues or other problems within my domain ? ”
For example , an address might be a value object or an entity , depending upon how it is used in your domain .
If an address can be duplicated and substituted in places where an address is needed without a problem , then it is a value object .
However , if an address is truly unique , as it might be in a post office application , a duplicate address would cause data integrity problems .
If a package needed to be dispatched to a specific address , and two of those addresses existed with the same identity , this condition would cause problems ; a package can only be delivered to one address .
An Example of Incorrectly Implementing Entities
Entities should be expressed with as much simplicity as possible .
An entity should only contain business logic specific to itself .
This concept is defined as plain - old CLR objects in C#/ VB.NET , etc. ( POCO ) , POJO in Java , PORO in Ruby , etc .
If you find your entities are dependent on other objects , this is usually a design smell calling for the use of the service DDD pattern .
Let ’s use the canonical customer / order example :
Look at the following sample dialog with a domain expert .
This person is an expert in some sort of online retailing business you might be contracted to write software for :
You :
So tell me a little bit more about your business , who are your customers ?
Expert :
We sell groceries online to people living in the New York City area .
We are fairly new in the market and are are looking to automate our business a little more , that ’s why we ’re hiring you !
You : Great !
I ’ll do my best to improve your automation .
Let ’s start with your customers , how do they place orders ?
Expert : First , they browse around our online store , adding items to their shopping cart .
Once they are ready to checkout , they hit the checkout button .
We get an email from the customer containing a list of items from our inventory , and the quantity of those items that they want to purchase .
Your brain starts to flash with ideas on how to improve their current system .
First , you might make a value object to encapsulate line items in an order as follows :
1 : class LineItem 2 : { 3 : public LineItem ( uint item Id , uint quantity ) 4 : { 5 : ItemId = itemId ; 6 : Quantity = quantity ; 7 : } 8 : 9 : public uint ItemId 10 : { 11 : get ; 12 : private set ; 13 : } 14 : 15 : public uint Quantity 16 : { 17 : get ; 18 : private set ; 19 : } 20 : }
Next , let ’s focus on the representation of the customer in the domain model .
The customer is definitely an entity ; it cannot be duplicated and substituted for another customer , because this would result in the order being processed for the wrong person .
A representation of a customer in a domain model needs an address , and the ability to change that address .
The domain expert stated that they do not service areas outside of New York City .
One way of expressing that in the entity is to throw an exception whenever the customer tries to change their address to a city other than New York City .
Recall the domain expert stated , “ We get an email from the customer containing a list of items from our inventory , and the quantity of those items that they want to purchase . ”
This statement might lead you to think that you need to encapsulate this behavior on the Customer class itself .
What the expert was really trying to communicate was that their current system compiles the customer information along with the order information and packages it up into an email .
Regardless , you go along with it , and start thinking about how to implement that behavior within the customer class .
To handle the orders , you might have an order generator that serves as a DDD factory to create an order , along with an order processor that actually places the order in the system .
Enough analysis , we now have a pretty good idea of what the first iteration of the Customer class should look like :
1 : class Customer 2 : { 3 : private readonly IOrderGenerator orderGenerator ; 4 : private readonly IOrderProcessor orderProcessor ; 5 : private Address address ; 6 : 7 : public Customer ( IOrderGenerator orderGenerator , IOrderProcessor orderProcessor ) : this ( orderGenerator , orderProcessor , new Address ( ) )
8 : { 9 : } 10 : 11 : public Customer ( IOrderGenerator orderGenerator , IOrderProcessor orderProcessor , Address address ) 12 : { 13 : this .orderGenerator = orderGenerator ; 14 : this .orderProcessor = orderProcessor ; 15 : this .address = address ; 16 : } 17 : 18 : public Address Address 19 : { 20 : get 21 : { 22 : return address ; 23 : } 24 : set 25 : { 26 : if ( newAddress .
City != " New York City " ) 27 : throw new ArgumentException (
" We do not service customers in your area , sorry ! " ) ; 28 : 29 : address = newAddress ; 30 : } 31 : } 32 : 33 : public OrderResult PlaceOrder( IEnumerable < LineItem > lineItems ) 34 : { 35 : var orderInformation = orderGenerator.CreateOrderFromLineItems(lineItems ) ; 36 : return orderProcessor.ProcessOrder(orderInformation ) ; 37 : } 38 : }
With this implementation , it seems very easy to place an order with code like this :
customer.PlaceOrder(lineItems ) ;
The Correct Way of Implementing Entities
The problem with the Customer implementation is that it is coupled to an order generator and an order processor .
This implies that in the real domain , customers have knowledge of these two services .
The way a customer is expressed in this domain model is fundamentally flawed .
Customers do not know of such things ; I frequently shop on Amazon.com , and I have no knowledge of an order generator , nor a processor .
In DDD , the order generator is an example of the factory pattern .
Factories are only used to support a domain model , not to define the domain model .
There are exceptions where the domain actually has some concept of creating something new , such as real factories .
The order processor is an example of the DDD service pattern , encapsulating interactions between other entities and value objects .
Other services or a higher layer should be consuming the order processor , not entities or value objects .
A more appropriate implementation of the Customer class can be defined by stripping dependencies on the two services from the class , distilling what is truly important to a customer in this domain model .
In this example , all that would remain is the validation that occurs when setting a new address .
This greatly simplifies the Customer class , and allows the definition to be a POCO :
1 : class Customer 2 : { 3 : private Address address ; 4 : 5 : public Customer ( ) : this ( new Address ( ) )
6 : { 7 : } 8 : 9 : public Customer ( Address address ) 10 : { 11 : this .address = address ; 12 : } 13 : 14 : public Address Address 15 : { 16 : get 17 : { 18 : return address ; 19 : } 20 : set 21 : { 22 : if ( value .
City != " New York City " ) 23 : throw new ArgumentException ( " We do not service customers in your area , sorry ! " ) ; 24 : 25 : address = value ; 26 : } 27 : } 28 : }
Notice how simpler the class is ?
It contains business logic only .
The messiness of invoking the services has been removed .
The removed behavior is an excellent candidate for another service , due to its interaction with entities and value objects .
Let ’s create an OrderService class :
1 : class OrderService 2 : { 3 : private readonly IOrderGenerator orderGenerator ; 4 : private readonly IOrderProcessor orderProcessor ; 5 : 6 : public OrderService ( IOrderGenerator orderGenerator , IOrderProcessor orderProcessor ) 7 : { 8 : this .orderGenerator = orderGenerator ; 9 : this .orderProcessor = orderProcessor ; 10 : } 11 : 12 : public OrderResult PlaceOrderForCustomer( Customer customer , IEnumerable < LineItem > lineItems ) 13 : { 14 : var orderInformation = orderGenerator.CreateOrderForCustomer(customer ) ; 15 : orderInformation.AddLineItems(lineItems ) ; 16 : return orderProcessor.ProcessOrder(orderInformation ) ; 17 : } 18 : }
The OrderService class adheres to the dependency inversion principle and can be configured with an IoC container to inject default implementations of the constructor dependencies .
This service allows for interaction of the customer entity , line item value objects , an order generation service , and an order processing service .
It is quite common to have services be dependent upon other services .
Services , factories , and repositories can have dependencies on other other pieces in the domain model or on infrastructure level objects .
We can now write a line of code to place an order similar to the previous line , without making direct calls on the Customer instance :
orderService.PlaceOrderForCustomer( customer , lineItems ) ;
Summary
You should be weary of a design smell whenever your entities depend on other objects .
These dependencies are typically domain model services or infrastructure pieces , such as logging or database support classes ( ActiveRecord anyone ? ) .
Keep your entities as simple and pure as possible .
Leaving out threading , logging , and all of the other impurities that can muck up the class .
Use services to encapsulate interaction between entities and value objects .

Far more than most of the candidates the netroots has gotten behind , Darcy Burner , who ran in 2006 and 2008 against Dave Reichert in WA - 08 west of Seattle , became integrated into the online community .
A few days ago I covered the entry on the 2010 candidate into that race , Suzan DelBene , an old colleague of Darcy 's from Microsoft .
Darcy is n't thinking about elective office now and when I called her a few weeks ago I got her in her car as she was driving across the country from Washington to Washington , DC , to start work at a new job heading up the American Progressive Caucus Policy Foundation .
And it's that job , heading up a non-profit foundation under the auspices of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , which is why we asked her to come back and talk with us at Firedoglake today ( 11 am , PT ) .
A little background before we meet in the comments section for a chat .
First off , the mission of the new foundation is to connect progressives inside and outside of Congress .
Specifically , she 'll be focusing on building connections in both directions between the progressive movement and the Congressional Progressive Caucus .
She was looking for a way to make a difference on the things she cares about and has been fighting for , and this seemed like a great opportunity to do so .
" I 'm passionate , " she told me yesterday , " about small - d democracy , and decided I could n't pass up this opportunity to work on making it easier for the millions of people in the progressive grassroots to be more connected to the people they send to Congress to work for them . "
If she succeeds it could revolutionize representative democracy .
And if I 've met anyone with the brains , maturity , energy , strength and intuition to get something like this off the ground , it 's Darcy .
Because it 's a start - up , she 's going to need all the help she can get -- and she told me there will be a bunch of opportunities for people who want to be involved to help the Foundation while learning a lot more about how Congress works .
This online community is probably a better place to start looking than anywhere else .
Like many of us , Darcy says she " promised that I would never stop fighting for the values we hold dear .
This is a downpayment on keeping that promise . "

An exoplanet hidden in the Hubble Space Telescope 's archival images has been revealed by data miners using a new technique for spotting the satellites of distant stars .
In search of more information about a known exoplanet orbiting the star HR8799 about 130 light - years from Earth , astronomers turned to the catalog of images Hubble has been amassing for more than 15 years .
Using an algorithm that can block the bright light of observed stars allowing the much fainter exoplanets circling them to be seen , the team spotted the planet in an image from 1998 .
The same technique could be used on 200 similar datasets from Hubble , as well an unknown number of archival images from ground - based telescopes .
" Now that we 've shown that it works , we can use it on a whole set of observations from the archive to see if a planet is hidden in the images , " said astronomer David Lafreniere of the University of Toronto , a member of the team that made the find .
The Hubble data archive is a paragon of scientific efficiency .
Its easily accessible and very search - friendly information architecture allows scientists to wring more discoveries out of the money we invest in the milestone space telescope .
The Hubble data has been used more than six times over , estimates Peter
Fox , a computer scientist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
Other scientific experiments and tools have generated mountains of information , but much of that data is stuffed away in hard copy formats or on hard - to - access databases .
Most of that data actually goes unanalyzed .
" The numbers that are typically quoted are three to ten percent of [ scientific ] data is analyzed , " Fox told Wired.com in January .
" That means almost none of it is reanalyzed .
Is that a good investment in public funds ?
Probably not . "
Lafreniere noted that his team 's work was aided by the Hubble archive 's metadata and searchability .
" You can search using different parameters , different target names , different wavelengths .
The search is easy , " he said .
" But maybe more importantly , the data is high quality ...
It 's been processed and calibrated such that the result is a high quality product .
With the technique verified , Lafreniere said that it would be applied to future data , too .
" I should add here that for the upcoming James Webb Telescope , this will definitely be one of the strategies used to look for planets , " he said .
" We need a method to subtract the light of the star . "
The James Webb is slated to be launched in 2013 .
The Kepler Space Telescope , which is designed to look for exoplanets , successfully launched into orbit in March .

I just read your new update to the cannabis closet about getting caught and I thought I 'd share my experience .
Towards the end of my senior year of High School I was arrested with a friend for possession of about a gram of weed .
I found out quickly that it did n't matter who I was or what the circumstances were , smoking weed makes you a criminal .
I had to pay some five hundred dollars and take a program that included eight weeks of drug testing and a class about substance abuse in order to avoid the conviction .
The final , and most ridiculous requirement , was a tour of the New Hampshire State Prison .
I suppose this was meant to scare me straight , to prevent smoking weed from leading me to commit more serious crimes .
I remember the first thing my case manager asked me was what exactly I was doing with my life , making the assumption that I was some kind of delinquent .
Of course I had already been accepted to college and I was working a part time job .
High School was nearly over and I would be graduating in high standing .
I found all of this to be somewhat humiliating since I really did n't believe that a crime had been committed .
I write this just three years after that incident and I still smoke marijuana regularly .
Not surprisingly , it has n't led me towards harder drugs or to a life of apathy .
This is my third year at Northeastern University where I study Political Science and International Affairs .
I 've been on the deans list every semester .
Last year I completed an internship and I plan on studying in Europe in the fall .
Thankfully we have decriminalization in Massachusetts now , so I worry less about getting caught .
However I wonder what the system in New Hampshire accomplished .
Had I been convicted I would have lost my financial aid and not been able to attend school in Boston .
In the end the legal system could have done more to ruin my future than the actual drug .
CANNES , France ( CNN ) --
Dark glasses are de rigueur on the sun-kissed French Riviera , but this year glamorous cineastes attending the opening night of Cannes were matching another kind of face wear with their tuxedoes and designer dresses .
The crew of " Up " pose for photographers ahead of the animated movie 's premiere at Cannes.
more photos »
The audience donned 3D glasses as they attended the premiere of Pixar 's " Up , " an animation in 3D , which marked the start of world 's most prestigious film festival .
It is the first time in the festival 's 62 - year history that Cannes has opened with an animation .
" Up " will show out of competition .
John Lasseter , chief creative officer of acclaimed filmmaker - led animation studio Pixar described the moment as " one of the greatest things that has happened to us in our careers . "
He said : " To have your movie actually open it is really , really exciting -- and to be the first 3D film too . "
The festival 's surprise choice , in the wake of the recent success of 3D pictures " Coraline " and DreamWorks ' " Monsters vs. Aliens " earlier this year , is perhaps the boldest message yet that 3D is being embraced by the mainstream as the format of the future .
According to Lasseter , who is also chief creative officer at Walt Disney Animation Studios , Pixar 's tenth film also marks a major shift for both studios .
" All of our films from now on will be made in 3D both at Pixar and at the Disney Animation Studios as well , " he said .
" Up , " co-directed by Pete Docter and Bob Petersen , tells the story of a grouchy 78 - year - old widower who ties thousands of helium balloons to his ramshackle house and floats away to realize his dream of visiting South America .
The heart - warming tale , which took four years to complete , is visually stunning , using 3D to make the screen like a window into the world of the film .
" We really tried to use depth in the same we use color and cinematography , and that is to further the emotion of the scene , " said Docter of the philosophy behind the team 's use of 3D in " Up . "
The computer animated drama showcases the strength of the format to immerse viewers in the narrative -- especially when it is in the hands of talented storytellers .
Docter and Petersen steer clear of using 3D to create wow factor with the visual gags the format can provide .
Lasseter agrees that 3D should be used as an aid to storytelling and not just for cheap visual thrills .
" 3D has a tendency , especially when you do all that ' comin ' - at - you ' stuff , everybody laughs , but now they 're out of the story , so we try to restrict that . "
Lasseter who co-founded the legendary animation studio behind animations " Toy Story ' ( 1995 ) , and " Monsters Inc. " ( 2001 ) , is one of many high profile 3D advocates .
DreamWorks CEO
Jeffrey Katzenberg has said that 3D is a film revolution akin to the inception of sound , which ushered in the era of the " talkies " in the early 20th Century .
Pixar made its first 3D film , " Knick Knack " in 1989 .
" The problem was that there was no theater in the world that you could see it in , " said " Up " producer , Jonas Rivera .
" We were waiting 16 or 17 years to see it in 3D . "
The problem of 3D screens has been solved by digital cinema , and although the roll out of 3D - enabled cinemas has been dealt a blow by the economic downturn , exhibitors are continuing to install screens all over the world .
Hollywood is also squarely behind 3D , green - lighting features from directors like Tim Burton and George Lucas .
The studios hope it will be the format global audiences will be watching films in the future -- in the cinemas and not in their living rooms .
In April , DreamWorks Animation 's latest feature , " Monsters vs. Aliens , " opened on 2,000 3D screens in the U.S and there are high hopes that James Cameron 's 3D title " Avatar " will be a 2010 Christmas blockbuster .
This year at Cannes , there are even some 3D films screening in the market including , " Station 21 , " a sci - fi thriller from French director , Olivier Parthonnaud .
Pixar 's innovation in filmmaking will be honored later this year at the Venice Film Festival , when the studio will be presented with a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement -- the first time in the festival 's history that a studio has been awarded this prize .

The Amazing Mini Snail House
This Russian lady from Petrozavodsk , Russia , now living at Helsinki , Finland has made this stunning mini-snail house .
The true size of the interior details can be understood looking at her fingers on the photos .
May 11 , 2009 BMW 's S1000 RR 1000 cc superbike might not be making big waves in World Superbike competition just yet , but today 's release of photos , specifications and a hugely detailed press pack leaves us in no doubt that the new Beemer flagship will be an absolute monster on the road .
A massive 193 horsepower is just the beginning - the S1000RR packs a combined ABS that 's lighter and smarter than Honda 's , variable intake tracts and exhaust butterflies that outdo the Yamaha and MV Agusta systems , a 4 - mode variable engine mapping system that seems a lot better thought - out than Suzuki's , and a very clever traction control system that 's integrated into the mind - boggling fly - by - wire engine management system in a way that seems much more logical than Ducati's .
Brand new in every way , this purpose - built German superbike is set to hit showroom floors well before the end of the year .
As Troy Corser and Ruben Xaus quietly go about the long and arduous task of developing the S1000RR into a World Superbike title contender , BMW are getting set to release the brand new superbike to showrooms worldwide .
The bike is packed with some of the most sophisticated and complex technology ever seen in the motorcycle world , all tightly integrated and kept out of the rider 's way in the name of huge , controllable power , the cutting edge in safety and sweet handling on wet or dry roads .
To say that the S1000RR features traction control , fly - by - wire throttle management , variable engine mapping or linked ABS braking seems woefully inadequate - BMW have integrated all these systems in a clever and rider - focused way .
" Rain " mode , for example , still gives the rider access to a 150 horsepower , but puts traction control and ABS on a hair - trigger .
At the other end of the scale , " slick " mode delivers the full complement of horsepower , with the most direct and aggressive throttle response , while tuning the traction control to allow controlled sliding and power wheelies for up to 5 seconds on a lean under 20 degrees before the computer starts retarding the spark and altering the fuelling to get things under control .
Grabbing the front brake in " slick " mode sends a proportion of braking force to the rear wheel as well to maximise braking stability - but then , if the rider applies the rear brake lever , the rear wheel ABS circuit is switched off so an experienced rider can lock up the back wheel and back the bike in to a corner on the racetrack .
Both the Dynamic Traction Control and ABS systems can be switched on and off at will - so presumably you 'll be able to do burnouts on the S1000RR - an activity which has caused much mirth and many burned - out clutches when attempted on a linked - brake Honda .
The new BMW 's amazing electronics are just one part of an overall package that seems set to deliver big - time on rideability , power , safety and giggle factor when it hits the showrooms before the end of 2009 .

In the 1938 comic strip Smokey Stover , a firefighter was known for his line ,  Where theres foo , theres fire . 
From Smokey , aircraft pilots borrowed the term foo fire to describe the various unexplainable phenomenon seen in the skies over Europe and the Pacific theatre during World War II .
While Allied pilots initially thought the flying objects were German secret or psychological weapons , after the war it was discovered that sightings were also reported by the enemy , who had assumed the crafts were US - made .
To this day , the sightings remain a mystery .
Over the course of the war , fireballs , estimated to be as big as 300 feet and as small as 1 foot in diameter , were reported and thoroughly documented .
These apparitions left witnesses awe - inspired , wary , and frightened although the foo fighters never harmed or attempted to harm anyone .
The CIA was commissioned in 1952 to study the reports and concluded that while mysterious , foo fighters were not a considered a threat to national security .
A
Foo fighter is an umbrella term that includes flying objects of various shapes and sizes .
Wobbling , or vibrating flares were described as glowing globes of intense green , yellow , red , orange , or white lights .
One crew even reported observing the phosphorescent spheres going through a sequence of color changes at regular intervals .
Other reports describe them as silver or gold metallic , and disk - shaped .
They frequently appeared at the wing tips of planes in pairs or alone , although sometimes they were found in larger clusters of fifteen or more .
In one report 150 objects were estimated to be arranged in 10 - 12 lines .
Picking up an aircraft , these blobs of fire could reportedly pace a plane at very high speeds through extensive evasive maneuvers for several minutes .
One British officer and his crew of sailors tracked an object from the deck of their vessel for over an hour .
Although a few baffled pilots attempted to intercept , and even fire upon the globes , their efforts were unsuccessful , and the objects usually zoomed away of their own accord .
Foo fighters were mentioned in the American mass media .
Ponderous articles appeared in Time and Newsweek in 1945 , contributing to the wave of UFO consciousness building in the US .
By 1952 so many civilians were contacting government agencies regarding UFO reports that regular intelligence work was being affected .
While scientists have never been able to explain the phenomenon , many speculations have been advanced as possibilities .
Five of the most plausible theories are : 1 . The fireballs may be nothing more than St. Elmos Fire , a reddish brush - like discharge of atmospheric electricity which has often been seen near the tips of church steeples , ships masts and yardarms .
It also appears at a planes wing tips .
2 . They may have been optical illusions , mere after - images of light remaining in pilots  eyes after being dazzled by flak bursts .
3 . Occurrences may have been the rare effect of ball lightning ,  a glowing , drifting bubble of light typically eight inches in diameter .
These generally , though not always , follow regular lightning strikes .
4 . Bright ground objects reflected from the curved plastic canopy of an aircraft can be perceived as images above the horizon .
5 . Proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesis ( ETH ) have suggested that foo fighters are hard evidence of ETs visiting earth .
Foo fighters are certainly some of the best documented reports of UFOs , and photographs and respected testimony abound .
Hopefully in time the mystery will be solved , and this comic book name will be replaced by its true name .

When six activists , protesting against climate pollution , scaled a tower at a coal - fired power station in 2007 the resulting court case drew support from the world 's leading scientists .
Their subsequent acquittal proved historic and changed government policy .
Here , the ' Kingsnorth Six ' tell their story
Six ordinary people .
One extraordinary feat of courage and endurance .
Twenty thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide belched into the atmosphere in a single day .
Twelve members of a jury , reaching a verdict that could change the future of the planet .
From these ingredients , Nick Broomfield has fashioned a film that tells the gripping and ( the description is unusually literal ) life - changing story of the Kingsnorth Six .
When a demonstration at the Kingsnorth power station in north - east Kent in late 2007 led to the arrest of six climate change activists , what had until then seemed a rather dry local planning issue exploded into a story of national and international concern .
The verdict at their trial turned out to have far - reaching implications for activism , the future of coal , even the planet .
Now a 20 - minute film , A Time Comes , by the much - admired documentary - maker Nick Broomfield , cuts police and Greenpeace footage of the occupation together with news clips and interviews with the activists .
What emerges is how ordinary the Kingsnorth Six are - they could be the bloke next door or the woman across the office - but also how brave and tenacious .
The film is released just as the government 's review of its coal policy is expected and campaigners hope and expect the review will define a seismic shift in official attitudes to carbon emissions .
" I was attracted to making a film about the Kingsnorth Six because they 're such everyday people , " Broomfield says .
" You tend to think of environmental activists as super - fit professionals , but they are modest and understated .
I admire the way they were prepared to see it through - to take action for what they believed and take the consequences - and I wanted to make the film immediate , personal , anecdotal .
" I loved the footage of them struggling up a chimney as if in Dante 's Inferno .
Their story is just a very human one of great courage and great love and belief , which is , I suppose , what all great stories are about . "
It is a story that began in October 2007 when a coal - fired power station at the mouth of the river Medway was nearing the end of its natural life .
E.On , the German company that owns and operates it , had applied the previous year for planning permission to build a replacement on the site .
This would be the first new coal - fired power station in Britain for 30 years , but a string of similar applications was lined up behind .
If Kingsnorth went ahead , it was reasonable to assume coal - fired power stations would be built across the country .
The government gave every indication it was intending to give permission , though it is widely acknowledged that coal is the single greatest threat to the climate , responsible for about half the fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere .
The average Briton emits 11 tonnes of carbon a year ; it would take this one hypothetical Brit 1,800 years to emit the equivalent of a day 's emissions at Kingsnorth .
So , at 5 am on the morning of 8 October , protesters waving placards jostled noisily at the front gates of the power station .
While the plant 's security guards were distracted , another group of about 30 activists made its way quietly along the sea defences at the rear , cut a padlock and sneaked onto the site .
" A security truck with a couple of guys tore up , " says Ben Stewart , who was there .
" We said we were Greenpeace and we had to shut down the power station because of climate change .
They said , ' Good luck .
Do it safely . ' "
Once inside , the activists scattered in the darkness - some to the pump house , 18 to occupy the conveyor belts that carry the coal to the furnace , five to the chimney that towers 220 metres above the hulking mass of the power station .
This last group walked inside , closed a metal roller - door behind them and cut the electricity .
Two of them - Stewart and Huw Williams , an experienced caver - had been up the inside of a tower at Didcot power station and they expected to find a similar spiral staircase here .
Instead , there was a metal ladder fixed to a wall .
The wall and the ladder were almost the height of Canary Wharf .
The five were each carrying 50kg bags holding their supplies , which included climbing ropes , paint , food ( pasta , pesto , tinned tomatoes , bread , water , coffee , and a cafetiere - " No instant shit for us , " Stewart says ) and they 'd estimated beforehand that it would take them two - and - a - half hours to reach the top .
Without a staircase , it was to take them nine .
" It was the most physically exhausting thing I have ever done , " Stewart recalls .
' We were climbing up between the four flues .
The CO2 goes up at a temperature of 120 degrees and it was like climbing through a huge radiator - the hottest , dirtiest place you could imagine . "
The ladder had a " back - scratcher " - a rudimentary metal cage designed to prevent falls - which meant the space was too narrow for their bags .
They had to pull up their kit on ropes , using their body weight to haul them between the five platforms .
" Imagine the most tired and in pain you 've ever been in and multiply that by a million , " says Will Rose , a press photographer , who shot much of the footage Broomfield used in his film .
" We had n't slept much the night before because we were nervous and in a strange place with a lot of other activists , and after a few hours of climbing , any adrenaline had worn off and we were dehydrated and exhausted .
I felt as though I was going to collapse .
My arms were aching from pulling on the ropes and my legs were aching from taking the strain .
You 'd get to a platform and rest for a minute and then have to pull up the bags .
You ca n't stop because you can't let down the rest of the team . "
The smokestack was filthy .
They had coal dust in their mouths , up their noses .
They had to scrape it off like tar .
After hours of struggle - " I 'm told it was nine but it felt like 12 , " Stewart says , " a dusty , dark , carcinogenic , hot , horrible experience for hours and hours and hours " - they saw light at the top .
They were running at least six hours late .
They rested briefly to recover some strength , aware that if they stopped for too long it would get dark .
Williams rigged up ropes .
Emily Hall , who works for Greenpeace in logistics , mixed paint .
Rose shot photographs and film .
Stewart spoke to the outside world , including his parents .
" You might see me on the news on top of a power station chimney , " he warned them .
" They said , ' Are you sure that 's wise ? ' "
At 6 pm , Kevin Drake , an experienced climber and freelance industrial rope access safety supervisor , went over the side of the smokestack with Hall , who had only been climbing a couple of years , " sporadically " .
Rose 's footage , if you are at all anxious about heights , is sickening : a vertiginous drop down a brick tower , Drake and Hall dangling , tiny figures in dizzying mid-air in the growing gloom .
" It was OK going over , " Hall says .
" I 'd been asked to do it two weeks before so I 'd had time to prepare myself mentally .
It was later on that it did n't feel so nice , when it was getting dark and starting to rain .
I could see the people on the conveyor belts being led away by the police below and that was disheartening .
The ropes were really heavy , because they had to be so long , plus we were carrying paint on our backs .
Our muscles were already sore from the climb . "
It is hard to imagine any of them being in trouble with the law under any other circumstances and for Rose , too , the numbers of police were alarming .
" It was cold and windy up there , but the thing that scared me most was the police helicopter that was circling us and the police vans below , with all these little black dots .
I 've got a huge amount of respect for the police , but it was alarming to think that sooner or later we'd have to come down and face them . "
The plan was for Drake and Hall to paint " Gordon Bin It " down the side of the chimney .
Drake 's main worry was that he was " a bit dyslexic " and may make a spelling mistake .
They judged the letter size with a length of knotted rope and from a distance the paint job looks surprisingly professional .
" It did n't look so good from close up , " Hall says .
They only managed to get as far as " Gordon " .
By 8 pm , the light was failing and they were worried about the climb back up .
Tim Hewke , who was co-ordinating from a van on the ground and would eventually be arrested and charged as the sixth member of the team , radioed , urging them to return to the top .
For Hall , getting back up the chimney " was the hardest thing I 've ever done .
It was a really hard slog , pulling on a rope , and my muscles were exhausted from pulling on ropes all day .
I was emotionally drained .
My hands were raw from climbing the metal ladder .
But Kevin stayed with me .
I swore a lot and he whistled and sang a bit and told me I was fine .
I knew they were cooking pasta at the top , and I was going to Paris on holiday in a couple of weeks , so I kept repeating to myself , ' Pasta , Paris .
Pasta , Paris . '
And I knew that not making it was n't an option " .
The pasta and pesto was , by general agreement , one of the best meals anyone had ever eaten .
Drake and Hall had intended to go back over the edge the following morning to complete their sign writing , but it turned out that the police in the helicopter , who had been shouting something inaudible at them through a megaphone , were warning that E.
On had obtained a high court injunction .
They would have to come down .
They decided they were too exhausted to get back safely that night , so they went inside the chimney and slept in the heat and coal dust until 6 am .
After a breakfast of tinned tomatoes , bread and coffee , they packed up and started back .
" It felt OK to come down then , " Stewart says .
" We felt we 'd done something important . "
Emerging from the chimney , Hall " felt really proud .
So many people had been involved , there had been so much planning and investment , and it was great to be part of it .
There was an amazing sense of fulfilment " .
The five activists emerged at around 1 pm .
The police - very pleasant , they all make a point of saying - took them away to their vans , swabbed them for DNA and fingerprinted them .
Eventually , they took them to Gillingham police station .
" I had to shower naked in front of two policemen , " Rose says , " but it was so amazing having a shower , I did n't really care . "
All the protesters who had been occupying the conveyor belts had also been arrested .
They were charged with aggravated trespass ; the six learned that they would also face charges of criminal damage .
Hall and Williams were released " by a fluke " that evening with the conveyor belt team .
The other four were held in custody for 24 hours .
They had discussed beforehand the possible consequences of the action .
" It was unlikely we'd be let off with a parking ticket , " Stewart says .
Even so , they were surprised by the extent of the criminal damage - £ 30,000 - said to be the cost of cleaning the tower .
" We left absolutely nothing up there , " Hall says , " and all they did to clean it up was to paint white boxes over our lettering . "
Perhaps , though , they were n't entirely dismayed .
Any criminal damage charge for more than £ 5,000 has to be tried by a jury .
" My first thought was , ' I 'm going to go to jail , ' " Stewart says .
" My second was , ' But I 'm going to get a jury trial . ' "
It would be an opportunity to put the climate change case in public .
The months of waiting for the court case were difficult .
Criminal damage cases involving similar sums had resulted in prison sentences .
" Some days , I felt we 'd done the right thing and people would see that and we'd be absolutely fine , " Rose says .
" On other days , I 'd think , ' Oh my God , I 'm going to prison for this . '
You can see what I look like .
I would n't last five minutes in prison . "
The eminent barrister hired to defend them , Keir Starmer , was made director of public prosecutions a month before the trial , leaving them without a lawyer .
Michael Wolkind QC stepped in .
" We had a meeting with him , " Stewart says , " and asked who else he 'd represented .
He said , ' The nail bomber , Tony Martin and the 7/7 bombers . '
We said , ' Have you ever represented anyone who 's not a fascist ?
And have you ever won a case ? ' "
The trial opened at Maidstone Crown Court ( in Ann Widdecombe 's constituency , perhaps not the first place a climate change activist would choose ) on 1 September 2008 .
" Michael Wolkind prepared really diligently , " Stewart says , " but his first line to the jury was , ' They care about Tuvalu .
Do you too ? '
And I thought , ' That 's it , I 'm going down . ' "
The standard defence against criminal damage is that by committing the crime , the defendant prevents damage to more valuable property - so it 's acceptable to kick down the door of a burning house if you thereby prevent its complete destruction .
The argument Wolkind and his team had to make was that shutting down Kingsnorth for 24 hours was a significant contribution to retarding carbon emissions , preventing the worse harm of climate change .
They also had to establish that there had been no legal options .
To everyone 's surprise , one of the world 's leading climate change scientists , Professor James Hansen , responded to an email from Joss Garman , Greenpeace 's coal campaigner , by saying he would testify on behalf of the Six .
Hansen , whom Garman describes as " a rock star of climate change " , has been director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies for the past 20 years , an adviser to US presidents , and was the first person to testify to Congress on the seriousness of climate change .
While in the UK , he met the prime minister and the foreign secretary , because that is the kind of person he is , but his reason for coming was to testify in a small courtroom in Kent .
The nub of his argument was that every tonne of carbon counts , so that while it may not be possible to pinpoint the extinction of one species to a particular molecule of carbon , it is reasonable to assert that Kingsnorth alone would lead to the extinction of 400 species over its lifetime .
Both Geoff Meaden , professor of geography at Canterbury Christ Church University , and Hansen produced maps showing the impact of rising sea levels on the Kent coastline , the world 's leading climate scientist giving a private seminar to the jury about the future of their area .
Inuit leader Aqqaluk Lynge described the melting of polar ice and its impact on Inuit homes and food supplies .
Gordon Brown had just changed his mind about an autumn election ; Zac Goldsmith argued that this had closed the normal democratic channels , especially given that it had recently been estimated that the world was a mere 100 months away from a climate tipping point .
Jennifer Morgan , a former adviser to Tony Blair and an expert on international climate negotiations , said the G8 had failed to deliver significant progress in preventing catastrophic change .
The defence 's arguments were given a boost by the 2006 Stern review for the British government , which put a price on climate change for the first time , calculating that each tonne of carbon causes $ 85 worth of damage .
This means that shutting down Kingsnorth for one day may have prevented around £ 1 m of damage .
Each of the defendants had prevented 3,300 tonnes of carbon from entering the atmosphere ( their share of a normal Kingsnorth day 's output ) .
It would have taken them 300 years of zero - carbon living apiece to have had an equivalent impact .
They all had to give evidence .
" It was petrifying , " Stewart says .
" I kept thinking if I buggered it up I 'd be letting down my fellow defendants and ruining the chances of making this important statement .
As the case went on and the evidence piled up , and it was such a compelling story , so emotional , I began to think we might get three of the jury not to convict - which , of course , would get us off .
I started to think we might even get five . "
The jury was discharged at 10 am on Tuesday 9 September .
They did not return their verdict that day and it was difficult for the Six to sleep that night .
" I managed to get through the trial fairly well , to hold my composure , " Rose says .
" Then about an hour before the verdict on Wednesday , I almost had a blackout .
I was shaking , my heart was racing , my breath was short .
I kept going back over everything , all the evidence .
It was like seeing your life before you die . "
" So much depended on that first utterance - ' N ' for not guilty or ' G ' for guilty , " Stewart says .
" As soon as the foreman went ' N ' , the court erupted . "
His mother , in the public gallery , burst into tears .
So did Hall .
There was elation in the Greenpeace offices , where everyone was gathered round director John Sauven 's phone , waiting for Stewart 's text ; and in New Zealand , where Hall is from ; in the Northumbrian coal mining village where Rose grew up ; and especially among all the other activists who had been at Kingsnorth .
That night , the 10 o'clock news reported that a government decision on the future of Kingsnorth had been postponed .
That this was a U - turn is not in doubt .
E.On had already gone out to tender for construction of the new plant .
Exchanges between the company and the civil servants in the Department of Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) , obtained by Greenpeace under Freedom of Information legislation , prove that the government had been drawing up conditions for approval of Kingsnorth and was prepared to be conciliatory about how far these related to climate change .
Within a month of the verdict , business secretary John Hutton was reshuffled and responsibility for energy moved from BERR to the new Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) , which put energy where it belongs , not with business , but with the environment .
The new secretary of state was Ed Miliband who , with David Miliband and Hilary Benn , had previously opposed a new Kingsnorth in cabinet .
The government 's previous position had been that the new plant would have to be " carbon capture and storage [ CCS ] - ready " .
In other words , whenever technology to capture and bury carbon emissions became feasible , Kingsnorth must be able to plug it in .
For Greenpeace , this was meaningless - " It 's like saying my garage is Ferrari - ready , " Stewart says .
CCS technology does exist , but has never been tried at scale .
It may not work .
It certainly may not be financially viable for a huge power plant .
The new policy , as articulated by Ed Miliband in April , complete with a neat soundbite - " The era of new unabated coal has come to an end " - is that no new coal - fired power station will be allowed unless it captures the carbon from 400 megawatts straight away .
In the case of Kingsnorth , this would represent about a quarter of its output .
And by 2025 , Kingsnorth would have to have CCS technology for its entire output .
Many questions remain to be answered .
The power companies are now lobbying fiercely , arguing that it makes no sense for them to build power plants that could be inoperable after 2025 if the technology does n't work or proves to be unaffordable .
They have the support of some of the civil servants who moved across from BERR and some members of the cabinet .
Greenpeace , meanwhile , does n't want to see a new plant that guarantees only that a quarter of emissions will be captured ; it would rather the CCS experiment was tried on an existing plant .
Results of a consultation on a new coal policy are due from DECC imminently .
Miliband will have to decide whether CCS is a promising enough technology to justify public investment and , if so , what form it will take .
Carbon can be captured before combustion , which is a cleaner method , or after , which has the advantage that the technology can be fitted to existing power stations and potentially sold abroad .
Greenpeace 's position is that there should be limits on carbon emissions for all power stations ( which it would set currently at 350g of CO2 per kilowatt - hour of electricity generated and reduce in time as the technology develops ) .
While CCS , certainly pre-combustion , would meet that proposed standard , the technology is not proven and Greenpeace would prefer to rely on renewables .
These are highly technical questions .
What is clear , even to those of us who are clueless about the science of carbon capture or unqualified to judge whether the energy gap can be bridged without coal , is that Kingsnorth is now unlikely to go ahead without offering some hope for climate change .
The publicity generated at the plant in October 2007 and the subsequent verdict has almost certainly ( as long as Miliband does n't crack ) paved the way to a more thoughtful energy policy which has climate change at its heart rather than as bolt - on , entirely dispensable rhetoric .
In this , the bravery of the Kingsnorth Six was vital .
What they have shown is that direct action can be a legitimate form of political action .
Properly carried out , it can muster public support and change people 's minds .
It can even shift government policy .
In years to come , we may have cause to thank these sympathetic , courageous and ordinary individuals .
It 's not a bad result from a day and night up a dirty chimney .
They all think now that the climb was worth it .
Power to the people
They came , they climbed , they conquered
December 2006
German company E.On applies for planning permission to replace the existing plant at Kingsnorth in Kent with the first new coal - fired station in Britain for 30 years .
The plant would produce an estimated 19,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every day .
October 2007
Environmental activists hold a demonstration at Kingsnorth .
Around 30 get on site and shut down the plant ; five scale the inside of the towers and paint a giant message on the outside .
All are arrested .
The five who scaled the tower and the activist who coordinated the ascent from the ground are charged with causing criminal damage of £ 30,000 .
January 2008
Medway council votes to allow building to go ahead at Kingsnorth but recommends a public inquiry .
April
The Royal Society criticises the government policy on coal , saying that any new coal - fired power stations unable to capture and bury 90 % of its carbon emissions by 2020 s hould be closed .
June
The head of the government 's sustainable development commission , Sir Jonathon Porritt , tells the secretary of state that a new generation of coal plants would " destroy the overall credibility of the government 's climate change programme " .
August
Environmental activists hold a climate camp outside Kingsnorth for 10 days .
Hundreds are arrested while taking direct action against the plant .
September
The trial of the Kingsnorth Six - those involved in the scaling of the tower - takes place .
Professor James Hansen , director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the first person to testify to Congress about the threat of climate change , gives evidence on their behalf .
All are acquitted .
December
The committee on climate change finds that coal stations should be expected to capture and bury all of their carbon emissions by the early 2020s .
April 2009
Ed Miliband , secretary of state for the newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change , announces a change of policy on coal , ruling out unabated coal stations .

President Dmitry Medvedev warned on Saturday that Russia would " decisively rebuff " aggression , as troops who defeated Georgia in a war last year took part in the annual Victory Day parade .
Medvedev , opening the biggest and most spectacular parade in post -Soviet history , said the lessons of the Soviet Union 's World War Two victory were still relevant today .
ernly warned its foes not to dare make any aggression against the country , as it put on a Soviet - style show of military might in Red Square including nuclear capable missiles .

" Our victory over fascism is a great example and a great lesson to all nations , a lesson which is still topical today , when again and again people appear who indulge in military adventurism ... , “ Medvedev said from a dais in front of Lenin 's tomb in Red Square .
" Defence of our homeland is our holy duty ...
We are sure that any aggression against our citizens will be decisively rebuffed , “ he added .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sat next to Medvedev but did not speak .
Russia says it was forced to defend its peacekeeping troops and citizens in rebel South Ossetia when Tbilisi tried to seize the pro-Moscow region by force .
Russia 's ties with NATO plunged to a post - Cold War low after the conflict and remain tense .

Underlining Russia 's present - day military power , troops drove trucks carrying the giant , nuclear Topol - M missiles and the latest S - 400 " Triumph “ air defence rockets through Red Square to gasps of admiration from the crowd of officials , veterans , officers and family members .
" It made a superb impression on me , “ said Maria Glavdivana , an 87 - year - old World War Two veteran , her chest festooned with clinking medals .
" We are showing the world our masculinity , our strength .
We will never ever weaken . “
Medvedev paid tribute to those who fought in Georgia , saying , " Those marching today in this square ... will include the ones who in a real battle proved the high combat readiness of the modern Russian army “ .

Goose - stepping guards of honour , clad in new dark - blue uniforms with crimson chests , golden shoulder - straps and embroidered peaked caps carried the Victory Banner at the start of the parade in Red Square , as 1,000 musicians from 19 military orchestras played stirring marches in bright sunshine .
The banner , a red hammer - and - sickle Soviet flag , was hoisted over the Reichstag building in Berlin , marking the end of what is known here as the 1941 - 45 Great Patriotic War .
It cost around 27 million Soviet lives .
A Soviet victory symbol -- a giant red-and - gold star -- was erected on the facade of the GUM department store , now a luxury shopping arcade , facing the Kremlin .

Veterans , their chests heaving with medals , watched from a grandstand as 9,000 troops from various sections of the Russian armed forces including the Space Forces , Interior Ministry , Air Force , Navy and Federal Security Service paraded .
MILITARY MUSCLE
" This parade proves we have people to defend our motherland , “ said Pavel Bogodukhov , who fought the Nazis in Stalingrad and marched with the victorious Soviet army to Berlin .
" We should feel proud that our armed forces are strong again . “
After Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov took the salute , standing in a grey , open - top Soviet Zil limousine , Russia 's latest T - 90 main battle tanks , armoured vehicles , howitzers and cannons rumbled past the red - brick walls of the Kremlin .
Around 70 combat aircraft and helicopters -- over twice as many as last year -- buzzed Red Square at a record low altitude of just 300 metres .
The final formation of warplanes dropped a burst of burning stars over the square .
Making its first flight over Red Square was the Mil Mi-28 all - weather , attack helicopter , referred to by NATO as " Havoc “ .
Other aircraft included the Cold War-era nuclear - capable Tu-160 strategic bomber , the biggest military aircraft built to date which flies patrols close to NATO nations .
Russia celebrates Victory in Europe Day a day later than the rest of the world as it was early morning on May 9 , 1945 in Moscow when the Soviet Union and its allies signed the Act of Germany 's Military Surrender outside Berlin .

If you ’re an Alien fan , you had better sit down and collect yourself before checking out this story .
We ’ve seen some pretty cool stuff from NECA before , but this just might take the cake !
From NECA
Online :
Xenomorphs have been around us for over 30 years now .
Many iterations have taken this aggressive race to become icons of Horror , Suspense , and even Adventure , and as so , caused many folks with an acute taste to want these creatures in their collections .
NECA ’s made several Alien action figures from almost all of the films in the franchise , including the most recent Aliens vs. Predator : Requiem .
This year we ’re bringing even more figures , and we wanted to answer a few of your questions .
New Aliens Warrior Action Figure
From James Cameron ’s
Aliens film , we ’re releasing an all new Warrior figure with removable limbs , fully articulated , and about 9 ″ tall .
The Two Colonial Marines
Aboard the warship Sulaco , Ripley is introduced to a team of Colonial Marines , one of which is Corporal Dwayne Hicks .
This year we ’ll bring
Hicks to life , fully articulated , at about 7 ″ tall , along with another Colonial Marine , which we ’re not yet ready to reveal the identity of .
You can expect the Warrior Aliens to have clean and battle damaged versions and both blue and brown highlights for variety when army building your hive .
1/4 Scale Original Alien Figure
From the 1979 original Ridley Scott film , we ’re preparing a release of the 1/4 scale Alien figure .
This is the classic Xeno , with the clear dome .
Yes – a gorgeously gross Classic Alien that stands over 22 inches tall and is fully articulated .
We ’ve done a Classic Alien 18 - Inch Action Figure in the past , so expect improvements including the enormous figure packaged fully assembled , and this Xeno will have new and improved deco over the original release from 2008 .
About The Alien Queen Action Figure
Hey , we love the Queen , too .
She ’s one of the scariest , meanest looking creatures in film history .
But currently she ’s only in our wishlists .
There ’s a slight possibility we ’ll get to her in 2013 , but there ’s nothing confirmed yet .
One of the reasons we ’re not getting to the Queen this year is because …
A Prometheus Line Is Coming Up This Summer
We ’re extremely excited about the upcoming film from Ridley Scott and have our hands full with a new line of figures .
We ’ll probably be able to show some Prometheus sculpts by the end of June .
Future For The Lines
We asked on Facebook and Google + what fans wanted to know about the license , and a lot of the questions were about its continuity , if we ’re doing a full set of Colonials , etc .
Honestly , it all depends on how well sales go and what our production schedule permits .
We are very excited to finally bring you Colonial Marines from Aliens , and we hope to bring you a Queen in 2013 .

ALBUQUERQUE –
In response to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union , New Mexico has agreed to provide retirement health insurance to the domestic partners of state employees .
" We are very pleased that the state has agreed to settle this litigation and provide the insurance .
It was n't fair that the state forced lesbian and gay employees to pay the high cost of health care for often inferior health insurance for their families when they worked just as hard as their straight colleagues , " said Peter Simonson of the ACLU of New Mexico .
" I 'm sure this will be welcome news to all lesbian and gay state employees , but especially to those who have retired or are planning to do so soon . "
The ACLU brought the lawsuit on February 5 , 2007 on behalf lesbian and gay state employees and their domestic partners .
The lawsuit charged that it was a violation of the state constitution 's equal protection guarantees for the state to treat lesbian and gay employees differently from its straight employees .
The settlement will reached with the state will cover both gay and straight employees and their domestic partners .
" This is fantastic news .
We can finally start planning our retirement , " said Havens Levitt , who has been a teacher for the Albuquerque public school for 25 years .
" Until now , our only option was for me to keep working because my partner 's employment does n't provide insurance for her and private insurance was just too expensive .
It means a lot that the state has acknowledged I should be treated the same as my straight colleagues . "
Levitt and her partner , Rebecca Dakota , have been partners for 13 years .
Dakota is a self - employed consultant to non-profits and an independent filmmaker .
Pursuant to the settlement , the state has agreed to develop a process for enrolling those interested during the next open enrollment period , which comes this fall .
The legal team for the ACLU in Levitt and Dakota v. New Mexico is George Bach , staff attorney with the ACLU of New Mexico , Ken Choe , a senior staff attorney with the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project of the ACLU , and cooperating attorney Maureen Sanders of Sanders & Westbrook , P.C .
Additional information about the case including a Q&A and the legal papers is available at : www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/28241res20070205.html.
G- POWER is a tuning company out of Germany that modifies Bimmers exclusively .
That statement sounds pretty innocuous , and it would be except for the fact that this group of wily engineers consistently puts out the most extreme BMWs on earth .
And unlike many tuners , they do it without slapping on all kinds of crazy spaceship - style aerodymanic kits that do n’t have the underlying juice to warrant such excessive downforce tweaks .
The new G - POWER M6 Hurricane CS is their latest creation and one of the best yet .
It ’s powered by a twin - supercharged V10 engine putting out 750 hp which make it good for a top speed of 230 mph .
Actually , the superchargers used can increase air volume up to 25 percent for a theoretical output of over 900 hp , although only a fraction of that was used for this engine .
I only point this out it because it was mentioned by G - POWER which means that some “ special ” customers are probably going to request the ‘ full monty . ’
The new G - POWER M6 Hurricane CS incorporates a multipart carbon fiber widebody kit , new titanium exhaust , carbon fiber seats , high - performance Carbon - Ceramic brakes , a remapped ECU , fully adjustable suspension kit and some serious 21 inch G - POWER wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tires ( for extreme performance ) .
The aerodynamic mods along with significant weight reduction allow the car to perform 0 to 62 mph in 4.4 seconds , reach 124 mph in 9.6 seconds and hit 186 mph in 26 seconds .
In order to get “ the most powerful engine ever to power a street - legal BMW ” you only have to cough up 360.000 Euros .

The three - week offensive Israel launched late last December , with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks by Hamas and other groups , killed at least 1,300 Palestinians and injured some 5,000 others .
The heavy bombardment and fighting also reduced homes , schools , hospitals and marketplaces to rubble .
“ For the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip to improve , lifesaving assistance must be decoupled from the security and political agendas , ” said John Holmes , Under - Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs .
“ If the Israeli - Palestinian peace that has been sought for over 60 years , and more recently inter-Palestinian reconciliation , remain preconditions for improving living conditions , the Gaza Strip risks being dependent on handouts for years to come , ” he warned , appealing for the reopening of all land borders to allow urgently - needed humanitarian and reconstruction supplies into Gaza .
Last month in Egypt , over $ 5 billion was pledged for reconstruction efforts in Gaza , “ possibly the most significant show of donor support for Gaza in the history of the occupied Palestinian territory , ” Mr. Holmes , who also serves as UN Relief Coordinator , said .
However , “ for once , money is not the main problem , ” he noted , adding that the funds are not “ hitting [ the ] mark ” with three - quarters of Gazans requiring some form of aid .
The sweeping Israeli ban on the import of construction materials , spare parts for public infrastructure and the industrial sector in Gaza , along with restrictions on the entry of cash , has prevented work to start on almost all of the planned early recovery projects , according to last month 's report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) on the situation in Gaza .
In addition , a ban on exports , apart from a few truckloads of flowers , has exacerbated the situation by crushing Gaza 's job - creation industries , said Mr. Holmes .
“ The ruin of hundreds of thousands of lives and livelihoods appears to be seen by Israel as the collective price that Gaza ' 's civilians must pay for the acts of a few among them . ”
Over 20 per cent of the population able and willing to work is unemployed and nearly half live below the poverty line , according to the latest survey of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics cited in the OCHA report .
It also indicated that the continued blockade on the livelihoods of Gazans – especially farmers , herders and fishermen – has been exacerbated by Israeli restrictions on access to farmland along the border and to fishing areas beyond three nautical miles from the shore .
This grim humanitarian situation was compounded for chronically ill patients as access to specialized medical treatment outside Gaza was dramatically tightened after Hamas took over the Referral Abroad Department ( RAD ) in late March .
Subsequently , the Palestinian Authority - controlled Ministry of Health has not approved or funded applications for treatment outside of Gaza , and without its consent neither Israel nor Egypt will allow patients to exit the Strip .
“ While Israel has primary responsibility for this terrible crisis of human dignity in Gaza , ” Mr. Holmes stressed that “ Hamas must also should its part of the blame because of the indiscriminate and pointless rocket attacks it committed from Gaza for so long , ” as well as for its three - year silence over the fate of Israeli captive Gilad Shalit .
The Israeli offensive may have ended in late January with unilateral ceasefires by both sides , but violent clashes – some resulting in deaths – occurring almost daily , according to OCHA .
“ In Gaza today , humanity has taken a back seat to politics , and a measly trickle of items has become the most the world can offer civilians trapped by a political stalemate not of their making , ” the Under - Secretary - General said .
“ Protection , food , water , healthcare and shelter are basic human needs , not bargaining chips , ” he underscored .
“ It is high time that fact is recognized by all the parties responsible for the immense suffering in Gaza today . ”

It ’s important for SEO purposes your website to load as fast as possible ; users want to see your web pages quickly and if you ca n’t give them that – then they ’ll go somewhere else .
In this article , you ’ll find a discussion on five simple and effective techniques for speeding up your web pages .
1. Use YSlow to profile and measure your website load times
Knowing how long it takes for your website to load is the first step in determining what ’s wrong .
It also lets you know if you need to makes changes to your website to speed it up .
Before we begin , if you have n’t installed YSlow , please do .
It is a Mozilla Firefox extension which can be found at the following link :
First , let ’s navigate to the Six Revisions website so we are all working with the same example ( just open it in a new tab or browser window ) .
In the bottom right hand corner of your browser , there is a bar with a odometer ( see Figure 1 ) .
Next to that bar , after the page has completly loaded , you will see ‘ YSlow ’ followed by a number .
That number is the time it took for the site to load ( in seconds ) in your browser .
We want that number to get this number as low as possible .
Figure 1 : YSlow icon and odometer showing the page load time .
Most often , what causes such a long page load time is one or a combination of the following :
Too many HTTP requests
Uncompressed ( or non-minified ) JavaScript files
No expiration headers for static graphic files
We ’ll talk about all of this in a moment .
To familiarize yourself with the performance of site load times , travel around a few sites .
Check out Google ’s homepage , Facebook , and a few of your favorite blogs / sites and you will notice that the more images or JavaScript a site utilizes , the higher the page response time is .
Using the features of YSlow
Aside from measuring the speed it takes for a page to load , YSlow also provides you some insight into what you can do to increase the performance of your site , as well as where your site ’s load performance is lacking .
Pictured below is the ‘ Performance ’ tab ( Figure 2 ) .
When you click it , it launches details grading each area which impacts your load time complete with a overall performance grade .
Figure 2 : The Performance tab .
The area that is the most subjective is Using a CDN ( content delivery network ) .
CDN ’s are more useful for larger sites .
What they do is spread the content of a site across multiple servers throughout various regions .
In loading a website , a page loads faster when the physical server is located closer to the user .
So in essence , using a CDN for your content delivery serves files from the server that is closer to the user accessing your page .
Figure 3 : Performance tab shows you a letter grade ( A , B , C , D , F ) and a percent grade ( 1-100 ) .
Aside from using a CDN ( which can be costly ) – everything else is doable .
Grading areas
Let ’s run through each grading factor .
Here is a brief desciption of what each of these graded areas are , and ways to
address them for optimum performance .
Make Fewer HTTP
Requests : HTTP requests happen whenever a web page requests a file from the
server .
These can range from scripts , CSS files , images , and asynchroneous client - side / server - side requests ( Ajax and other variations of the technique ) .
This is the most crucial area when it comes to performance , and also one that is easily addressed with just a little bit of elbow grease .
For example , caching files
on the user ’s machine often helps , as well as consolidating scripts , CSS ,
and images .
Add an Expires Header : 80 % of the page load time is wrapped up in downloading scripts , images ,
and CSS .
Most often , these elements do n’t change on users ’ machines .
By
adding some code to your .htaccess file you can cache the redundant files
on the users local machine ( we ’ll discuss how to do this later down the article ) .
Gzip Components : Gziping or compressing JS files , images , HTML documents , CSS files , etc. allows the user to download a much smaller version of a file , increasing the speed of the page load .
This can reduce the tax on your server , but unzipping ( uncompressing ) the components can lead to slower page response times depending on the user ’s browser .
Put CSS at the top : Putting CSS files at the top of your document allows your site to
render your web pages as soon as possible while other components such as images and scripts are still loading .
Put JS at the bottom :
With your CSS at the top of the document , inserting your JS files just before you close your < body > tag allows you to render what seems to be a complete page to the user while these scripts propagate in the background .
Avoid CSS
Expressions : I personally never use CSS expressions ( otherwise called Dynamic Properties ) , which is an IE - only , proprietary way of adding programming concepts ( such as control / conditional structures ) to CSS .
As of IE8 , Trident - based layout engines ( which is used in IE ) will no longer be supported , so it ’s never a good idea to use them anyways .
Rather , I script with PHP to
load different CSS style rules based on various conditions , be it a random number ,
time of day , or browser .
Make JS and CSS external : Placing JS and CSS in external files allows your browser to cache them
making your page load faster than those files loading inline every time
the page is called .
Reduce DNS lookups :
Whenever a user types in a domain name in their web browser address field , the browser performs a DNS lookup to the IP
address .
The more locations your site has to
access , the more DNS lookups that must occur .
Do your best to keep these
low , on average it takes 60 - 100 milliseconds to do a DNS lookup .
Minify JS : Unlike regular gzip compression , minifing JavaScript files is removing
the unnecessary spaces , tabs , and various other selected characters
reducing the overall size of the file .
With a smaller file your able to
have a faster page load .
You can use JSMIN to minify your JavaScript .
Avoid redirects :
No matter if you do a server - side header redirect , a JS redirect , or an HTML meta redirect , your site is going
to load a header with a blank page , then load your new page , increasing the time it takes for a user to get to the actual page they want to go to – So
completely avoid this at all costs .
Remove duplicate scripts :
Making your browser load the same script twice will increase your page
load .
It ’s simple math .
More files equals more load time .
Double check
your site and make sure your not calling jQuery 2 or 3 times or any
script for that matter .
Whew … that was a lot , let ’s move on to the next tab of YSlow just before we get into some other techniques to increase the performance of your website .
Figure 4 : The Components tab .
The Components tab ( Figure 4 ) gives you insight into what your efforts to increase your site speeds are producing .
Here , you can see how long it takes for certain files to load , if those files are gziped , response times , as well as if they are cached in the users machine and when their cache expires .
This is good for examining components of your site , measuring their performance and optimizing their speed .
Lastly , we have the Stats tab ( Figure 5 ) .
This tab shows all the HTTP requests for both the downloaded files , as well as the cached files .
The Empty cache shows the files the browser had to download in order to render the page .
The Primed Cache , on the other hand , is the list of files that were already in the user ’s browser cache , saving the browser from having to download those files again .
Figure 5 : Stats tab .
2. Using CSS Sprites to reduce HTTP Requests
CSS Sprites may be the coolest thing since Tesla invented electricity … did I say that .. oops , I meant Edison .
Well , not quite , but pretty close .
CSS sprites can reduce your page load time simply by reducing the amount of HTTP requests your page makes to the server through the consolidation of your CSS background images .
Most tutorials teach you just to use CSS Sprites for navigation , where I am going to say to use it for the entire user interface of your site .
First , let ’s take a quick look at YouTube and how they use CSS Sprites ( Figure 6 ) .
You can find YouTube ’s CSS Sprite here :
master - vfl87445.png
Figure 6 : YouTube ’s “ master ” CSS Sprite .
What happens is , using CSS , YouTube set a class with this image as the background ( pictured above ) .
Then with elements that need to use these images , their class is set accordingly , with the background - position CSS property set to properly align the top and left sides in that element .
Let ’s give it a try .
We are going to use the YouTube Image as an example .
In example below , we rendered the YouTube Logo to the screen .
Using the same sprite class , and same image , we are going to create a simple rollover icon .
< style > . sprite { background : url ( http://s.ytimg.com/yt/img/master-vfl87445.png); } #logo { width : 100 px ; height :45 px ; background - position :0 0 ; } </ style > < div id =" logo " class= " sprite " >
</div >
Now what we ’ve done is allowed for all of our static site assets to come from a single HTTP request , which significantly reduces page load
When you use hover with sprites it makes for a seamless transition , unlike when you load the file on the hover state , which leaves a blank space until that file is loaded .
< style > . sprite { background : url ( http://s.ytimg.com/yt/img/master-vfl87445.png); } #logo { width : 100 px ; height :45 px ; background - position:0 0 ; } #button { background - position : 0 - 355 px ; padding : 5 px 8 px ; } # button : hover { background - position : - 25 px - 355 px ; } </style > < div id =" logo " class = " sprite " > </div > < a href= " # " id =" button " class= " sprite " ></a>
3. Load your CSS first and your JavaScript last
With some websites , you simply can’t get around all the HTTP requests , as it disrupts your functionality .
So as an alternative , you can “ bring out the appetizer ” while the “ main entree ” is finishing up by loading the JavaScript files last .
In that regard , here ’s a couple of tips :
Load your CSS in your < head > tag above your body .
Load your JavaScript just before you close your < / body > tag .
What happens is that the page appears to be loaded on the user ’s machine , so their eyes can begin scanning the offerings , all the while the JavaScript is catching up in the rears and loading in the background .
Tip :
If you do n’t want to physically move the JavaScript tags , as you feel it will mess up the way your site works , I recommend using the defer property .
Usage is as
follows :
< script defer= ' defer '>
4. Using Subdomains for parallel downloads
Parallel downloads are when you increase the simultaneous file downloads .
If you have your status bar open in your footer , you will notice when traveling other websites making requests to static.domain.com and c1.domain.com .
This is a great way to optimize load performance .
Although you will simply be using subdomains , and the content is on the same server , the browser see ’s it as a seperate server .
To set this up :
Create 3
Subdomains on your server
Place your images in a folder in each of the subdomains Replace the image locations in your site to the paths of the newly create subdomains .
Now with JavaScript files , this does n’t exceed beyond two parallel at a time .
5. Adding an Expires Header
Some sites are just very rich , even after using the techniques described above , performance seems as if it can be increased even more .
A user can go to your website and make all the necessary HTTP requests to render the page , images , scripts , etc .
When you use an Expires Header , you can cache those elements on the user ’s local machine , not only increasing their speed , but also saving you bandwidth .
An Expires header can be used on all your scripts , CSS , and images as well .
This can be done simply by adding a line of code to your .htaccess file in the root directory of your site ( if you do n’t have one , you can create one – use a text editor and save it as .htaccess , then upload it to your root directory ) .
The following .htaccess entry sets a far future expires header sometime in 2010 for file types such as .ico , .pfd , .flv ( Flash source files ) , .jpg , .png , etc .
< FilesMatch " \.( ico|pdf|flv|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|js|CSS|swf ) $ " >
Header set Expires " Thu , 15 Apr 2010 20:00:00 GMT " </ FilesMatch >
Beware : if you make updates to a file that has a far future expires header , you ’ll have to rename it ( version it ) or else users with primed caches wo n’t see the updates .
For example , if you have a JavaScript file that you made updates to , use version numbers and then update all the files that refer to the old version ( i.e. javascriptfile - 1.0.js , javascriptfile - 1.1.js )

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House Republican leaders unveiled their alternative to the proposed Democratic budget Wednesday , calling for $ 4.8 trillion less in overall spending over the next decade -- in part through a five - year freeze in most nondefense discretionary spending .
Republicans on Wednesday offered an alternative to President Obama 's budget .
The GOP budget would repeal the entire $ 787 billion economic stimulus package except for an extension of unemployment insurance benefits .
It also would roll back a recently passed 8 percent spending boost in the budget for the remainder of the current fiscal year .
At the same time , the federal share of Medicaid payments would be converted to block grants for the states .
Medicare would be transformed for Americans younger than 55 by allowing them to choose from a series of preapproved private insurance plans , with premium payments from the federal government to insurers varying according to an individual 's age , income and health .
Overall the Republican budget calls for $ 3.6 trillion less in borrowing over the next 10 years .
Watch more on the GOP budget alternative »
" The president 's budget is little more than a thinly veiled attempt by Washington to spend its way into prosperity , tax its way into tax relief and borrow its way into debt reduction .
This simply cannot work , " said Wisconsin Rep .
Paul Ryan , the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee .
" Rather than getting spending under control , ( the Democratic plan ) sends spending out of control , " he said .
" Rather than keeping taxes low to create jobs , it chases ever higher spending with ever higher taxes and results in ever higher debt ; not just a modest increase in our national debt , but an unprecedented , unsustainable increase in red ink . "
Total federal spending under the GOP proposal would fall to 20.7 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product , as opposed to rising to 24.5 percent of the GDP as proposed in President Obama 's budget , according to a document released by the House Republican leadership .
The GOP budget permanently extends all of former President Bush 's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts .
Among other things , it also suspends capital gains taxes through 2010 .
It also calls for establishing a new tax system based on two rates .
A 10 percent income tax rate would apply to couples making $ 100,000 or less , as well as singles earning less than $ 50,000 .
The income tax rate would rise to 25 percent for those earning more .
The House GOP budget also calls for a repeal of the estate tax , as well as dropping the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent .
Capital gains and dividends would be taxed at 15 percent .
Defense spending would be increased by $ 5 billion compared with Obama 's budget .
The GOP proposal also calls for an additional $ 540 million in veterans ' spending above Obama 's proposal .
Watch more on Obama 's budget details »
Ryan slammed the Democrats for only providing a five - year budget projection .
Obama and the Democratic congressional leadership are trying to " hide their explosive spending by not offering a full 10 - year budget , " he argued .
Democrats were quick to criticize the GOP proposal as little more than a way to help the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the rest of the country .
" If you expected a GOP alternative to the failed policies of the past that got our country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , then I have two words for you : April Fools , " said Kenneth Baer , communications director for the administration 's Office of Management and Budget .
Democrats also took aim at the proposed Republican health care entitlement reforms .
" The Republican plan for health care , including Medicare , is to give everyone a voucher , deregulate the insurance market and say after that , ' You 're on your own . '
We as Democrats do n't believe that 's the answer or the solution to the problem we 're facing right now , " said Rep. Joe Crowley , D - New York .
" We ideologically have an honest and fair difference of opinion here , " he concluded .
But " the people have spoken .
They 've put us in charge . "

As the clampdown on the large public BitTorrent sites continues , private trackers could play an increasingly important role in the file - sharing community .
While some people firmly believe that a good public site is all you need , private trackers have their fanatical supporters too .
So , as it stands today , where do you get your BitTorrent fix ?
Although private BitTorrent trackers have a much lower profile than most sites , they are not in any way ‘ safer ’ than public ones .
In fact , the only BitTorrent users in the US who have received jail time were heading a private tracker that was dismantled by the FBI .
Nevertheless , after various crackdowns in recent years , people flood to these sites and their popularity continues to grow .
More recently , however , the pressure is being applied to the administrators of public BitTorrent sites and trackers who accommodate millions of users every day .
At any given point in time 25 million peers are connected to The Pirate Bay ’s trackers , which dwarfs every other tracker on planet earth while making the site the prime target of the entertainment industry .
If the Pirate Bay were to close , roughly 50 % of all public torrents would be put to a halt , and many of the smaller public trackers would have a hard time in coping with the extra load and could even collapse under the strain .
Meta - search engines like Torrentz would have much less to index too .
That said , if you ’re lucky enough to be a member of a private site , the show probably goes on .
What we ’re interested in is how many of you rely almost exclusively on public trackers such as The Pirate Bay and what percentage get your BitTorrent fix mainly on private trackers .
For clarity , we define a public site as one that requires no membership or logins and is open to all , while a private site is one you have to join and have probably been invited to .
This leads us to the following question for this week ’s poll .
TBILISI ( Reuters ) - NATO began military exercises in Georgia on Wednesday in a move Russia said threatened stability in the region just nine months after a war between the former Soviet neighbors .
A brief , bloodless mutiny at a tank base near Tbilisi on Tuesday cast a shadow over the start of the month - long exercises .
Georgia accused Russia of involvement , a charge Moscow dismissed as “ insane . ”
More than 1,000 soldiers from NATO countries , including the United States , will run through a simulated crisis response operation and peacekeeping exercises at a Georgian military base formerly used by the Russian air force .
Canadian soldiers were seen setting up command headquarters before field exercises get under way next week .
Russia has criticized the NATO exercises on its southern flank as “ muscle - flexing ” and says they could further undermine ties with the alliance .
Russia ’s envoy to NATO , Dmitry Rogozin , said on Tuesday the alliance would be better off holding the maneuvers “ in a madhouse ” than in a country where troops were “ rioting against their own president . ”
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ’s domestic opponents have paralyzed Tbilisi with weeks of protests demanding he resign over his record on democracy and last year ’s war .
They questioned the Georgian government ’s explanation for the mutiny .
“ There are many versions of what really happened , but the one offered by the authorities is the least credible , ” said Tina Khidasheli of the opposition Republican Party .
The war games , a year in the planning , have heightened tension between Russia and NATO , just as the two sides resumed formal contacts suspended after Moscow ’s war with Georgia .
Russia crushed a Georgian military attempt to retake the pro-Moscow separatist region of South Ossetia last August , routing Tbilisi ’s army and drawing condemnation from the West .
DIPLOMATS EXPELLED
NATO said this month ’s exercises should not be misused .
“ Georgia is just hosting the exercise and nobody should interpret the exercise in a different way and use it for other purposes , ” a NATO spokeswoman said .

Further souring the mood , Russia announced the expulsion of two Canadian staff at NATO ’s information center in Moscow on Wednesday -- a response to the Western military alliance ’s decision to throw two Russian diplomats out of Brussels last week over a spying scandal .
NATO said the expulsions were counterproductive at a time when the sides were working to improve dialogue and Canada summoned the Russian ambassador to provide an explanation .
“ Canada strongly regrets Russia ’s decision to expel two Canadians serving at the NATO Information Office in Moscow , ” said Catherine Loubier , spokeswoman for Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon .
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia wanted normal ties with NATO and that he would raise the situation in Georgia with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a visit to Washington later this week .
“ Of course we will discuss the alarming situation which continues in the South Caucasus , above all due to the provocative actions of the Georgian leadership , ” Lavrov told reporters in Moscow .
Georgia ’s government said the mutiny at a tank base east of Tbilisi was part of a Russian attempt to disrupt the NATO exercises and foment a wider rebellion against Saakashvili .
Russia said Saakashvili was trying to shift the blame for weeks of protests , which opposition leaders are threatening to broaden to the main east - west highway .
Military experts in Tbilisi suggested the tank battalion might have fallen victim of a tussle between the government and the opposition for the upperhand .
“ Georgia is a state facing great challenges , ” Saakashvili told a televised meeting with armed forces commanders .
“ It is a state ... where we are able to confront destabilization and where no one should have any illusions it can be overthrown . ”
Saakashvili said police had arrested a former Georgian diplomat and military expert who had worked at Georgia ’s office within NATO , on charges of passing military secrets to Russia .
The NATO exercises are being held a few kilometers from the Mukhrovani ‘ rebel ’ tank base .
“ The multi-national training will go ahead in the planned timeframe , ” Georgian Colonel Nugzar Tsintsadze said .
“ There was no threat . ”
NATO , which invited many non-member countries to take part as well , insists the exercises pose no threat to Russia .
They are seen as a gesture of solidarity with Georgia , whose NATO membership ambitions have been put on hold since the August war .

Builders working near the site of the Auschwitz - Birkenau death camp have found a message in a bottle written by prisoners , museum officials say .
The message , written in pencil and dated 9 September 1944 , bears names , camp numbers and home towns of seven young inmates from Poland and France .
At least two survived the Nazi camp , an Auschwitz museum official said .
The bottle was buried in a concrete wall in a school that prisoners had been compelled to reinforce .
The school 's buildings , a few hundred metres from the camp , were used as warehouses by the Nazis , who wanted them protected against air raids .
Museum experts have checked the authenticity of the note , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Six of the prisoners were from Poland and one was from France , AP said .
" All of them are between the ages of 18 and 20 , " the final sentence of the note reads .
An Auschwitz museum spokesman said the authors of the note " were young people who were trying to leave some trace of their existence behind them " .
The Nazis murdered some 1.1 million people at Auschwitz - mainly European Jews , but also non-Jewish Poles , Roma ( Gypsies ) and others .
OTL : ' Lock And Load '
AN DIEGO --
It is safe for him to come out now at Mission Beach .
Surfers dip their boards into a clear blue ocean that touches the sky .
Panhandlers wander around with empty Starbucks cups .
That thing they say about time and wounds ?
Maybe it 's true .
Because Ed Hochuli is treading through the California sand , loose and out there in shorts and sandals , and nobody feels compelled to hurl a rock at him .
It 's sort of poetic that Hochuli has a beach condo here , in the very town that wanted his white hat on a stick , along with his head .
His place on Ocean Front Walk is impeccable .
No smudges on the windows , no crumbs on the marble counters , and a sign near the doorway that asks potential renters to be courteous and please avoid trashing his offseason pad .

At his beach condo in San Diego , Ed Hochuli is able to escape from the pressures of his work as a lawyer and NFL referee .
" The best thing in the world is to sit in the rocking chair and watch people walk by on this boardwalk , " the NFL referee says .
" Especially in the summer , when it 's so crowded out here .
You see people walking by with birds on their shoulders .
The dress that you 'll see , the hairstyles .
... People are funny . "
Sadly , people are not perfect .
But before his nationally televised gaffe last September , many would 've argued Hochuli was .
His muscles exploding out of his tight , striped shirt , he exuded confidence with every blast of his whistle , and women gathered around HDTVs , entranced , as he explained , so forcefully and eloquently , why he had thrown his yellow flag .
It was n't just the body or the verbosity .
Hochuli is one of the most recognizable faces in all of officiating , and his was an excruciatingly precise climb .
He did n't just study the rulebook ; he wanted to test better than every other official .
Before every snap , 160 times a Sunday , Hochuli whispers to himself , " Lock and load , " so his mind does n't wander and his hazel eyes never miss a thing .
For this , there are at least four Web sites devoted to Hochuli , the most notable being WhatWouldEdHochuliDo.com .
NFL coaches were polled last season about who was the best referee .
Hochuli tied for first with Mike Carey .
And then came the day he missed a whopper of a call , in the final 80 seconds of the San Diego - Denver game Sept. 14 , a call that many before him have flubbed but that Hochuli could n't live down .
It followed him throughout the 2008 season , from Kansas City to Green Bay to the warm shores of Miami for a January playoff assignment .
Nearly every major officiating mistake , even if his crew was 2,000 miles away , evoked his name .
Could a lifetime on the brink of perfection be washed away with a single split - second decision ?
What would Ed Hochuli do ?
Getty Images Since 1990 , Hochuli has consistently strived for perfection as an NFL official .
Never mess with Ed the Lawyer
An exceedingly polite woman sits at the reception desk in the offices of Jones , Skelton & Hochuli , a Phoenix firm that touts itself as one of the most experienced litigation groups in Arizona .
It is unknown whether she 's the same brave soul who worked the morning of Sept. 15 , the day after the disaster in Denver , when the e-mails poured in from angry Chargers fans and bettors , and the firm 's phone lines had to be shut down .
That 's one of the drawbacks to being a lawyer - slash - NFL official in the Internet age .
When something goes wrong , an industrious man 's contact info is only a few clicks away .
WHAT WOULD ED SAY ?
Chat with NFL referee Ed Hochuli on Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET .
It was clear from a fairly young age that Hochuli would be a lawyer , just like his father and two brothers .
He loved the research , poring over depositions and precedents , having a box full of jurors look to him for the answers .
And almost always being right .
" As trial lawyers , one of the reasons we [ like trying ] cases is the adrenaline rush , " Hochuli says .
" You love that challenge -- the competition , if you will -- of it .
It 's a game .
It 's obviously a very important game to people , and I do n't mean to diminish the importance of it .
...
You have to follow these rules , and there 's a win- or - lose outcome .
You 're on a stage . "
One of his first cases as a young litigator was patron v. bar , with Hochuli 's firm defending the bar .
Guy fell off a barstool , hit his head on a pool table , could n't taste or smell anymore .
The evidence did not favor Hochuli 's client , and he and his partner , Donald Myles , knew it .
The bar floor had just been waxed ; the barstools were wobbly ; and witnesses were testifying that the plaintiff was n't drunk .
It did n't look good for the home team .
All Hochuli had was a hospital report saying the guy 's blood alcohol content was high .
So he opted for a little legal drama :
He put the report in a plain brown paper bag and told the jury that the contents of that bag would prove his case but that he was n't going to reveal what he had in the bag until the end of his presentation .
At the climactic moment , Hochuli opened the bag and showed the jurors the report , and they were appropriately impressed .
" The jury went out and came back in five minutes with a defense verdict , " Myles says .
( The judge was not as impressed .
He felt the jurors had made their decision based on emotion , not evidence , and overturned their verdict . )
Hochuli and Myles used to jog together .
On Friday nights , when the young and upwardly mobile were catching beers , Hochuli was driving to Yuma , a 185 - mile drive to the California border , to referee high school games for $ 38 plus mileage .
" Why do you do it ? " Myles used to ask .
" I love it , " Hochuli said .
" I just love still being part of the game . "
Like many red- blooded American males , he would have preferred being a football star .
He was a scrappy linebacker at the University of Texas - El Paso in the early 1970s before size got in the way .
So he started reffing Pop Warner games on Saturdays , making 50 bucks for four games .
Sure , at first it was a way for a young father to help pay for law school , but ...
" Any official would tell you the same story -- you get hooked , " Hochuli says .
" It 's like having a main line of adrenaline running in your vein for three hours on Sunday night .
It 's like standing on a cliff . "
Pee Wee led to preps , jucos and eventually the Pac - 10 in 1985 .
Hochuli had to work the chains for two years before he got to officiate a college game , and his lawyer buddies would come along to affectionately tease him from the stands at Sun Devil Stadium : Go , Down - Marker Ed !
They followed him to his NFL debut in 1990 , when he broke into the league as a back judge .
His first game was at Lambeau Field , preseason , and Hochuli was nervous .
What if somebody figured out he did n't belong there ?
He threw his flag and felt his stomach sink because he knew immediately that he had gotten the call wrong .
Hochuli quickly picked up the flag off the grass and stuffed it in his pocket , and the game went on .

" It 's like having a main line of adrenaline running in your vein for three hours on Sunday night , " Hochuli says of officiating in the NFL .
Like being the " Incredible Hulk , " but with a sense of humor
A ref toils away for 20 years , on average , before he makes it to the NFL .
He is scouted , interviewed , tested and graded .
In the end , he knows one thing : that , just like the behemoths on the field , he is among the very best .
There are 120 officials in the NFL each season and " another 20,000 who would kill to be there , " says Jerry Markbreit , a longtime NFL ref .
They do n't see themselves as traffic cops or walking rulebooks .
They 're keepers of the integrity of the game .
Icon SMI
What would Ed Hochuli do ?
More often than not , the answer is make the right call .
" It 's like a dual life , " Markbreit says .
" You 're transformed into something special , and when you take the uniform off , you 're like the ' Incredible Hulk . '
You go back to a normal size .
" Every official wants to be perfect .
And there is no perfection .
You strive for perfection , but you settle for excellent . "
They hear the boos , stand within earshot of the sideline tirades , but all that matters , really , are the grades from the boss .
The NFL spends roughly eight hours evaluating the officiating ... from each game .
Every play gets a grade after being examined from several angles of slow motion .
Collect enough bad grades , and you 're gone from the big stage .
From the early days , it was clear Hochuli would have a long run .
He was uberdriven and bound by the rules but always managed to show a little humanity under the stripes .
Say an angry 330 - pound tackle approached him to complain and said , God , Ed , are you blind ?!
I 'm being held !
Hochuli would break the tension and say something like : I know he 's holding you .
But see , we 've got this memo that says you 're so much better than he is .
If we do n't let him hold you , he 's not going to be in the game .
The tackle laughs , Hochuli says he 'll keep an eye on it and the game goes on .
Who would n't be enamored of Hochuli , his 58 - year - old body outrunning those of men half his age , his smooth lawyer tongue assuring you that everything is under control ?
When he got his start in the NFL , Hochuli wanted to know everything .
He flew to Skokie , Ill. , to pick Markbreit 's brain , and they talked well into the night , for 10 hours straight .
" When they talk about great referees in the NFL , " Hochuli told him , " they talk about Norm Schachter , Jim Tunney and Jerry Markbreit .
Someday , they 're going to talk about Ed Hochuli . "
" You get a roomful of [ refs ] , and they 're all exactly the same , " Markbreit says .
" They 're risk takers .
What they really want to find out is , ' Am I good enough ?
Am I good enough this week ? '
Some weeks , you 're not .
" It 's almost like acting .
In real life , if someone confronted you on the street and berated you , you 'd probably pop them in the nose .
But not here .
You pride yourself in not allowing them to get the best of you . "
All of which describes Hochuli to a T .
U.S. Presswire ( two at left ) ; AP photo ( right ) Hochuli tries to bring a little levity to a job in which even the smallest error is heavily scrutinized .
A sudden attack of dyslexia ?
The phone was ringing when Hochuli walked into the locker room in Denver on Sept. 14 .
It was Mike Pereira , the NFL 's vice president of officiating , and things were about to blow up .
A few minutes earlier , in a huge Week 2 game between the teams expected to contend for the AFC West title , Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler had reared back to throw with 1:17 remaining and the ball had slithered out of his grasp .
Fumble .
The ball was recovered by the Chargers , but Hochuli ruled incomplete pass and blew his whistle during the play , signaling it dead .
He was standing roughly 7 yards from the play and knew right away that he'd made a mistake .
A peek at the replay monitor proved it .
But he could n't give possession to the Chargers because of the league 's " inadvertent whistle rule . "
He walked over to Chargers coach Norv Turner and told him that he had screwed up but there was nothing he could do about it .
Denver went on to score , converted a 2 - point conversion and won 39 - 38 .
Al Messerschmidt / Getty Images Hochuli relied on the other members of his crew to get him through the aftermath of the blown call .
" Forget about it , Ed , " Pereira said to Hochuli after the game .
" It 's a mistake . "
Nineteen years in the NFL , and one thing was sure : Hochuli rarely made mistakes , especially ones that turned games .
He had made the call hundreds of times -- nailed it , over and over .
What happened ?
He rewound the play in his mind and on video .
His position was good ; his focus was sharp .
It was almost as if he were dyslexic , he 'd say .
He saw what happened and reacted oppositely .
He did n't sleep for three days .
And back in Phoenix at his law firm , the phone lines had to be shut down for a day .
His colleagues knew he was hurting and gave him some space .
The NFL downgraded Hochuli for the call .
Petitions circulated in San Diego , their venom ranging from having Hochuli fined to banned from NFL games .
Banned !
Even WhatWouldEdHochuliDo.com , the whimsical Web site run by a young Chicago mother , took a beating .
" I mean , these people were out for blood , " says Jessica McCartney , who started the site .
" Even when I put something up on the site that I had nothing to do with Ed , it just kept coming , even two or three months later .
" I got a couple of people who threatened that if they were ever alone with Ed Hochuli , they would kick his ass or whatever .
I 'm a huge football fan , but to want somebody to lose their job or wish physical injury to them , that totally goes beyond the scope of normal fandom . "
The NFL undoubtedly wanted the controversy to go away , but Hochuli did n't help .
He responded to hundreds of angry e-mails , prompting stories in The San Diego Union - Tribune and USA Today about his public display of remorse .
Another 20,000 e-mails landed on his BlackBerry , causing it to freeze .
Here 's the shocker :
Most of them were positive .
" It was kind of eye - opening , " Hochuli says , " a commentary on society .
People were saying how great it was that I admitted I made a mistake .
Obviously , I was wrong .
Obviously , I felt terrible about it .
What 's so surprising about it ?
" Eventually , you start getting a little bit of sleep again , and I recognize that I 've got another game to work next weekend .
And I 've got a crew that is looking to me to see how I handle this . "
Paul Spinelli / Getty Images Chargers fans were merciless in reminding Hochuli of his September gaffe in Denver .
Resurrected by his crew
The men in his crew brought him back .
They teased him and checked on him .
It sounds clichéd , maybe corny , but when seven men spend their weekends together for an entire NFL season , counting on each other to get everything right , they almost become the third team on the field .
Family , Hochuli says .
They talk at least once a week in the offseason , holding each other up through divorces and job problems .
Old NFL referees see each other on the street and hug , even if they 've never worked together .
It 's a fraternity , a bond that only 120 men each season experience .
TWEET !
TWEET !
OOPS !
Inadvertent whistles do n't just happen in the NFL .
A whistling gaffe impacted an NHL playoff game Tuesday night .
E.J. Hradek has the details .
Final night of the 2008 season , Week 17 , and the Chargers and Broncos met again for a playoff berth .
Media types dubbed it as the game that could get Hochuli off the hook .
He and the others were a couple thousand miles away in Green Bay .
While they had their annual Christmas party , the Broncos - Chargers game was on TV in the background .
In a roomful of refs , a game is always on .
Hochuli occasionally glanced up to the screen to see what the score was .
" I did n't marry myself to the TV set , " Hochuli says of San Diego 's 52 - 21 victory that negated the effect of his gaffe .
" I do n't root for teams .
You can't root for teams .
In that game , whoever won was gonna win .
I had long before that come to peace with the fact that it was a defining moment in my life , and you deal with it and you have to move on . "

Playing against type , Hochuli has two small shih tzus roaming his home in San Diego .
All 's well that ends well
Life , in Southern California , goes on .
Playoff worries shift to concerns about LaDainian Tomlinson 's staying or going , then shift again to rookie camp .
It 's a Tuesday , and , as he does on many other days in the offseason , Hochuli is working at his beach condo .
His firm has about 150 cases with which he is involved at the moment .
But he says the law can be practiced anywhere , and he does much of his offseason work at his satellite office in San Diego .
He puts on a pair of old man 's glasses and bangs away on his laptop while Sadie and Sophie , his beloved shih tzus , lounge on the couch .
" I think if you were to ask what would be the most surprising thing that people do n't know about me , " Hochuli says , " it 's that I own two lapdogs , not scary Rottweilers .
But these dogs are very important to me . "
He got his first shih tzu years ago , when his youngest daughter , Rachel , begged for a puppy .
At first , he wanted nothing to do with the scruffy little beast .
But now the kids are gone , and the dogs are with Hochuli and his girlfriend , Cathie , all the time .
He drives the six hours from Phoenix to San Diego just so they can come along in the Mercedes , upholstery be damned .
When one of them slips past the gate leading to the beach , Hochuli sprints to track down the dog .
NFL.com video Hochuli's late call played a huge role in the Broncos ' 39 - 38 victory over the Chargers on Sept. 14 .
The first month or so after the Pro Bowl is Hochuli's " regeneration mode , " when he eats copious amounts of Cheetos , compulsively watches " Battlestar Galactica " and lays off the film study .
One night , his son Shawn came over , and they watched the chick flick " Love Actually " with their girlfriends .
Shawn is a major - college ref .
Only 30 , the kid is way ahead of where Pops was at that age .
Hochuli wants to stay in officiating for a few more years in the hope that someday father and son can work a game together .
He looks out the window , his Popeye arms covered by a long - sleeved surfer T - shirt .
But people on the boardwalk still recognize him and wave .
He wo n't deny it -- he likes that strangers know who he is .
Charles Barkley once approached him at the airport , and Hochuli thought that was " cool . "
Until , of course , he 's noticed for something he did wrong on the field .
You move on or you do n't recover , he says .
And Hochuli did .
His crew reportedly ended up receiving the highest grade in the NFL this past season , although the league wo n't confirm or deny that .
At the league meetings in late March , teams voted to expand replay review for quarterback pass / fumbles when the ruling is an incomplete pass .
It was referred to , in media circles , as the " Hochuli Rule . "
In the months since Sept. 14 , he has been asked a hundred times why he did n't just fix it , throw a flag for holding on Denver or make some other makeup call .
Make a mistake on purpose ?
To anyone who has worn the stripes , strived for perfect but settled for excellent , it sounds abhorrent , a desecration .
And it 's just not what Ed Hochuli would do .

Thousands of children suffered physical and sexual abuse over several decades in residential institutions run by religious congregations , the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse has found .
The report published yesterday describes how children lived in “ a climate of fear ” in the institutions and finds that “ sexual abuse was endemic in boys ’ institutions ” .
Cases of sexual abuse were hidden by the congregations that ran the institutions and offenders were transferred to other locations where they were free to abuse again , the report says .
The commission , which was chaired by Mr Justice Seán Ryan , heard from more than 500 witnesses who said they had been sexually abused .
There were also many reports of injuries , including broken bones , lacerations and bruising .
Eight chapters in the report are devoted to the Christian Brothers , the largest provider of residential care for boys in the State .
More allegations were made against the Christian Brothers than all other male orders combined .
The report sharply criticises the Department of Education for failing to carry out proper inspections .
“ The deferential and submissive attitude of the Department of Education towards the congregations compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty of inspection , ” the report says .
The commission , which was set up in 1999 , investigated industrial schools , reformatories , orphanages , institutions for children with disabilities and ordinary day schools .
It heard evidence covering the period from 1914 to the present but the bulk of its work addressed the period from the early 1930s to the early 1970s .
More than 1,700 men and women gave evidence of the abuse they suffered as children in institutions , with over half reporting sexual abuse .
Accounts of abuse given in relation to 216 institutions are detailed in the report , which runs to nearly 3,000 pages .
More than 800 priests , brothers , nuns and lay people were implicated .
The final cost of the commission may be over € 100 million .
Responding to the report , the Catholic primate Cardinal Seán Brady said he was “ profoundly sorry and deeply ashamed that children suffered in such awful ways ” .
He added : “ Children deserved better and especially from those caring for them in the name of Jesus Christ . ”
Reacting to the report , Minister for Education Batt O’Keeffe said “ the wrongs of the past ” could not be undone .
“ However , as a responsible and caring society , we must fully face up to the fact that wrong was done and we must learn from the mistakes of the past . ”
Mr O’Keeffe extended his “ sincere and profound sympathy ” to those who were abused .
Speaking in the Dáil , Taoiseach Brian Cowen said the Government would “ carefully study the findings and recommendations ” .
He acknowledged the report would show the “ great failings of the State and many others in the care of children . . . ”
The Christian Brothers , who are severely criticised in the report , also issued an apology .
“ We are deeply sorry for the hurt caused .
We are ashamed and saddened that many who complained of abuse were not listened to . . . ” they said in a statement .
“ We appreciate that no healing is possible without an acknowledgement of our responsibility as a Congregation for what has happened , ” they added .
The Catholic Archbishop of Dublin , Most Rev Diarmuid Martin , said the stories of abuse were “ stomach - churning ” .
All church organisations mentioned should seriously examine how their ideals had become debased by systematic abuse , he said .
There was a mixed reaction from victims groups .
The One in Four organisation , which offers support to victims of abuse , said publication of the report marked a “ shameful day ” for Ireland .
Chief executive Maeve Lewis said : “ We all turned our back on the children who were so shamefully treated in these institutions . ”
Child welfare organisations called for a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of the child .
Fergus Finlay , chief executive of Barnardos , said : “ We must guarantee that the voices of children are never silenced again . ”
The report recommends an overhaul of the inspection system for childcare services to include unannounced inspections and objective national standards .
It also proposes the erection of a memorial to victims of abuse in the institutions .
The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is separate from the Residential Institutions Redress Board , which has received some 15,000 applications .
It is expected the total cost of awards by the board will exceed € 1 billion , of which € 128 million has been contributed by 18 religious congregations .
Roland Reuß , der Initiator des umstrittenen " Heidelberger Appells " gegen die kostenlose Publikation staatlich geförderter Forschungsergebnisse im Internet , wehrt sich weiter vehement gegen das " Open Access " - Modell .
Er sehe bei der " Bewegung " im Wissenschaftsbereich zur freien Veröffentlichung urheberrechtlich geschützter Werke " die Gefahr eines großen Staatsverlags " , warnte der Philologe auf der Urheberrechtskonferenz des Bundesjustizministeriums vor einem " totalitären Kreislauf " .
Bei dem Ansatz werde " nicht dem öffentlichen Wettbewerb überlassen , was publiziert wird " .
Vor allem störe ihn die Anforderung der " entgeltfreien " Veröffentlichung , an der jedes normale Abonnementmodell scheitern werde : Kein Verlag werde etwas drucken , wenn es spätestens sechs Monate später kostenlos im Netz legal verfügbar sei .
Reuß ' Kritik beschränkt sich aber nicht nur auf das " Open Access " - Verfahren , bei dem er die " transformierte DDR im Publikationssektor " durchschimmern sieht .
Generell werde im Internet verstärkt die " Souveränität des Produzenten " in Frage gestellt durch " illegale Methoden " .
So finde er seine Werke eingescannt etwa über Googles US - Angebot " Book Search " oder auf andern Archiv- und Literaturseiten .
Hinter denen sieht der Kleist - Kommentator zum Teil vermeintlich dem Gemeinwohl verpflichtete " Irre " , die ganze Bücher abtippen .
Rainer Kuhlen vom Aktionsbündnis " Urheberrecht für Bildung und Wissenschaft " bezeichnete die Heidelberger Erklärung dagegen als " vergifteten Apfel " .
Der Spezialfall des singulären Autors , der allein " Wahrheit " produziere , dürfe nicht verallgemeinert und etwa auf die Naturwissenschaften übertragen werden .
Das Wissen sei Allgemeingut und freizugeben .
Die Gesellschaft finanzierte die Produktion von Wissen , sodass sie auch darauf zurückgreifen können müsse .
Es werde aber kein " Zwang " ausgeübt auf alle Forscher , ihre Ergebnisse gemeinfrei zu machen oder kostenlos zu veröffentlichen .
" Open Access " - Publikationen würden es Wissenschaftlern aber ermöglichen , schneller und schrankenfrei wahrgenommen zu werden .
Auch Googles Buchsuche wertete der Informationswissenschaftler als größtenteils " im Interesse der Wissenschaft " .
Dass der auch aus Reihen der Bundesregierung scharf kritisierte Suchmaschinenprimus nun 20 Prozent von digitalen Büchern im Internet zeigen dürfe , scheine durch die " Fair Use " - Bestimmungen in den USA gerechtfertigt zu sein .
" Wir wollen aber nicht , dass über diese Anzeige neue Pay - per - View - Modelle entwickelt werden und man das gesamte Buch elektronisch kaufen kann " , stemmte sich Kuhlen gegen eine damit einhergehende Kommerzialisierung von Wissen .
Google - Justiziar Arnd Haller warnte davor , eine Kluft zwischen Buchvermarktern und Digitalisierungsangeboten im Internet zu konstruieren .
Weltweit würden 20.000 Verlage " uns ihre Bücher schicken " , um sie in ihrem Auftrag einzuscannen .
In Deutschland würden zudem keine entsprechenden Werke digitalisiert , wenn dies nicht ausdrücklich gewünscht werde .
Ein Verbotsantrag des Börsenvereins des deutschen Buchhandels gegen Google , kleine Auszüge aus Büchern im Internet anzuzeigen , sei vor dem Landgericht Hamburg gescheitert .
Die Vorwürfe , dass sich Google rechtswidrig verhalte , sei somit schlicht abwegig .
Eine vermittelnde Position nahm Eric Merkel - Sobotta von Springer Science + Business Media ein .
" Wir haben nichts gegen Open Access " , erklärte der Vertreter eines der großen Wissenschaftsverlage .
" Gänzlich kostenfrei geht es aber nicht . "
Der " Mehrwert " der Verlage etwa beim Korrekturlesen oder der Vermarktung müsse bezahlt werden .
Gegen Vorwürfe aus der Wissenschaft und von Bibliotheken , dass die Wissenschaftsverlage ihre Gebühren ständig drastisch erhöhen würden , entgegnete er , dass die Preissteigerung bei Springer im vergangenen Jahr bei 8,7 Prozent gelegen habe , was er angesichts der Inflationsrate und der allgemeinen Kostenerhöhungen für angemessen halte .
Reto Hilty , Direktor des Max - Planck - Instituts ( MPI ) für geistiges Eigentum , monierte dagegen , dass die großen Wissenschaftsverlage 25 bis 30 Prozent Nettorendite einfahren würden .
Das MPI zahle allein jährlich für die Grundversorgung seiner Forscher mit Literatur 18 Millionen Euro .
Die drei führenden Verlagshäuser würden dabei etwa 95 Prozent der Kosten ausmachen .
Ernsthaft bedroht würden diese ihr Modell durch Open Access offenbar auch nicht mehr sehen , da die Preisforderungen wieder " so exzessiv " wie vorher seien .
Die Wissenschaft müsse daher einen Schritt weiter gehen und Inhalte noch stärker in Kooperation erstellen und frei online zur Verfügung stellen , verwies er auf den Erfolg von Wikipedia .
Dabei handle es sich um ein Instrument , das den Wettbewerb in hohem Maße beflügele .

WATER flows across the south - west could plummet in coming years , drying up rivers and lakes and robbing the region of some of its popular fishing spots .
While the region is renowned for its reliable rainfall , a State Government water research committee has revealed a grim future unless major action is undertaken .
The group released a draft report which predicts how the south - west 's water ways will cope under different climate change scenarios .
The Lake Corangamite basin will be the worst hit , if drought continues , with stream flows falling by as much as 84 per cent by 2055 .
Wannon
Water chief executive officer Grant Green said the was no cause for concern .
He said the water corporation had secured the region 's water supplies for the next 50 years .
Adam Pope , a researcher at Deakin University 's Warrnambool campus , said increasingly dry weather would have a devastating impact on our environment .
With decreased water flows , river mouths would stay closed for longer , he said .
" Some estuaries would become hypersaline which means they would become saltier than the sea , " Dr Pope said .
" There are fish and other aquatic creatures which would n't be able to cope .
" Dr Pope said it would be impossible to restore waterways .
" Even rivers in wilderness will change .
" It has nothing to do with land use .
" It 's not like this ( climate change ) has n't happened before .
" People used to be able to walk to Tasmania .
" It 's just happening a lot faster than what it has in the past .
" The Western Region Sustainable Water Strategy Consultative Committee prepared the draft report , which will help form State Government policy .
The study states that flows in the Hopkins , Glenelg and Portland Coast river basins could fall by between 40 and 65 per cent by 2055 .
The Otway Coast Basin , which supplies Warrnambool , Koroit , Camperdown , Cobden and Colac , could fall by 30 per cent .
Committee chairman Darryl Argall said it was too early to confirm if recent conditions were the start of climate change or a prolonged drought .
He said initiatives such as the Hamilton - Grampians and Wimmera - Mallee pipelines would help safeguard future water supplies .
" Understanding the range of pressures and threats to our water resources enables us to make decisions today that will secure our water resources for the future , " Mr Argall said .
"
The climate change scenarios support the State Government 's initiative to develop the strategy as a policy and planning framework to manage water resources in the Western Region for the next 50 years .
" Mr Green said Wannon Water had secured 2000 megalitres of groundwater licences for the Dilwyn aquifer which stretches from Port Campbell to the Mount Gambier .
" We wo n't have to access that until 2040 , " he said .
A final report on the region 's water flows is expected to be completed later this year .

May 13 , 2009  -- Former Vice President Dick
Cheney may have largely stayed under the radar during his time in the Bush administration , but he is not going softly into that good night , seemingly launching a one - man campaign to fight for his legacy and -- in his view -- the safety of the nation .
Cheney has taken the lead in assailing President Obama 's national security measures and defending his own administration 's policies on the treatment of detainees , among other issues .
He took his case to the airwaves again Tuesday , and lashed out at the Obama team 's decision to soon hand over 44 photos showing abuse of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan to the American Civil Liberties Union as a judge had ordered .
Cheney said releasing the photos would only make the country less safe .
" What I think is important is that there be some balance to what is being released .
The fact of the matter is the administration appears to be committed to putting out information that sort of favors their point of view in terms of being opposed to , for example , enhanced interrogation techniques , " Cheney said in a Fox News interview .
The photographs are part of a 2003 Freedom of Information
Act court case by the ACLU for all information relating to the treatment of detainees .
Courts had ruled in favor of releasing the photographs into public view even though Bush administration officials argued that releasing the photographs would violate the Geneva Conventions , which protect prisoners of war and detained civilians " against insults and public curiosity " and it would also violate U.S. obligations toward detainees and could even prompt outrage against the United States .
Cheney wants Obama to fight all the way to Supreme Court .
In recent weeks , the former vice president -- on what might be called a " President Obama is making us less safe " campaign -- has protested everything from Obama 's release of the memos outlining harsh interrogation techniques that the United Nations considers to be torture to the president 's more stringent rules on these techniques and his decision to close the detainee center at Guantanamo Bay .
According to Cheney , such interrogation techniques -- supported by him and former President Bush , and discontinued by Obama -- in many cases help yield valuable information , and he does n't consider the techniques to be torture .
The former vice president is so sure that he has taken the unusual step of seeking to de-classify memos that he said would validate his arguments .
A Family Affair
While Cheney has not stated directly whether he believes the United States is in for another terrorist attack , he did imply Obama 's policies were weakening the country 's defense .
" I think that we are stripping ourselves of some of the capabilities that we used in order to block , if you will , or disrupt activities by al Qaeda that would have led to additional attacks .
I think that 's an important debate to have , " Cheney said on Fox .
" I do n't think we should just roll over when the new administration says -- accuses of us committing torture , which we did not , or somehow violating the law , which we did not .
I think you need to stand up and respond to that , and that 's what I 've done , " he said .
The criticism of Obama 's policies has become a family affair .
Liz Cheney , the daughter of the former vice president and a former State Department official , joined the bandwagon Tuesday , lashing out at the administration on its decision to release detainee abuse photos as " siding with terrorists . "
" It is really appalling that the administration is taking this step . … I have heard from families of sevice members , from families of 9/11 victims , this question about , you know , ' When did it become so fashionable for us to side , really , with the terrorists ? ' "
Liz Cheney said on Fox News .
" You know , for us to put information out that hurts American soldiers ? "
" They seem only to be interested in releasing things that really paint America in a negative light and do n't give the American people a full picture of what went on , " she said .
The White House has responded by saying its predecessor 's policies inflamed the Muslim world against the United States , and by sending more troops to Afghanistan and focusing more on Pakistan , the president is taking on al Qaeda more aggressively .
White House Defends Policies
" Without putting words in everyone 's mouth , I think there 's been some agreement across party lines that Guantanamo Bay has not made us a safer country , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday , referring to the fact that Obama 's election opponent , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , also pledged to shutter Gitmo .
Gibbs also said that by increasing the troop level in Afghanistan , Obama is more aggressively fighting the terrorists who attacked the U.S. on 9/11 .
" I think the best way to keep this country safe is to go at the terrorist threat , something that the previous administration did n't do , " Gibbs said .
While the idea of a former vice president criticizing the current administration is not new -- Al Gore delivered scathing anti-Bush speeches and was a leading critic of Bush 's policies in Iraq -- it is unusual for a former veep to be so publicly critical this early in a new president 's term .
In March -- just weeks into the new administration -- Cheney provoked the White House by stating on CNN's State of the Union : " He [ Obama ] is making some choices that , in my mind , will , in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack .
The administration 's response : " I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal , " Gibbs said , adding that " not taking economic advice from Dick Cheney could be the best possible outcome of yesterday 's interview . "
Vice President Joe Biden has also made it clear his predecessor is " dead wrong " on Obama 's foreign policies .
" The last administration left us in a weaker posture than we 've been any time since World War II : less regarded in the world , stretched more thinly than we ever have been in the past , two wars under way , virtually no respect in entire parts of the world , " Biden said in an interview with CNN .
Hillary Clinton took it one step further and questioned Cheney 's credibility altogether .
When asked at a congressional hearing in April whether the secretary of state was in favor of releasing documents Cheney has requested , Clinton responded : " Well , it wo n't surprise you , I do n't consider him a particularly reliable source of information . "
Republican Response
While Cheney may be on the forefront , defending his position and decision during his time in office , other Bush - era officials have stayed relatively quiet .
Even some Republican supporters are not on his side .
Sen. Joe Lieberman , D - Conn. , who has been critical of the president 's national security policies and endorsed McCain last year , said Cheney is wrong on this subject .
" We 're not less safe , " Lieberman said on MSNBC .
" On balance , we remain as safe as we can possibly be in a world in which there is Islamist extremists who want to attack us . "
For now , the president has steered clear of making any direct comments about Cheney 's spot in the limelight , except for a joking stab at the White House Correspondents Dinner : " Dick Cheney was supposed to be here , but he is very busy working on his memoirs , tentatively titled ' How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People , ' " the president said jokingly .
As for Republicans , many of them say they wish the former vice president -- one of the least popular figures in the party -- would go back into an undisclosed location .

Drug adverts make up the vast majority of all spam mails
More than 97 % of all e-mails sent over the net are unwanted , according to a Microsoft security report .
The e-mails are dominated by spam adverts for drugs , and general product pitches and often have malicious attachments .
The report found that the global ratio of infected machines was 8.6 for every 1,000 uninfected machines .
It also found that Office document attachments and PDF files were increasingly being targeted by hackers .
Microsoft said people should not panic about the high levels of unwanted e-mail .
Cliff Evans , head of security and privacy for Microsoft in the UK , told BBC News : " The good news is that the majority of that never hits your inbox although some will get through . "
Ed Gibson , chief cyber security advisor at Microsoft , said the rise in spam was due to traditional organised crime figures moving away from exploiting software vulnerabilities and " targeting the weak link that is you and me " .
" With higher capacity broadband and better OS ( operating systems ) , and higher power computers it is easier now to send out billions of spams .
Three or four years ago the capacity was n't there . "
Malware ecosystem
See which countries are most infected Paul Wood , senior analyst at e-mail security firm Message Labs , said he was surprised the Microsoft figure for unwanted e-mail was so high .
" Our own analysis shows that around 81 % of e-mail traffic we were processing was identified as spam and unwanted , " he said .
MessageLabs said spam rates had fallen at the end of 2008 as an ISP which had been hijacked to send out spam mails to users had been taken offline .
" As a result of that , a number of developers in botnet technology at the end of last year were trying to regain botnet control and increase capacity and return to previous spam levels .
" It wo n't be far off before we see return to those levels . "
The report , which looked at online activity during the second half of 2008 , also pinpoints the countries that are suffering from the most infections of malicious software , or malware .
Russia and Brazil top the global chart of infections , followed by Turkey and Serbia and Montenegro .
It said that the type of malware varied from country to country .
" As the malware ecosystem becomes more reliant on social engineering , threats worldwide have become more dependent on language and cultural factors , " it reported .
In China , several malicious web browser modifiers are common , while in Brazil , malware that targets users of online banks is more widespread .
In Korea , viruses such as Win32 / Virut and Win32 / Parite are common .
Global average
The global average for infected machines is 8.6 for every 1,000 uninfected PCs .
The UK's infection rate is 5.7 , according to the Microsoft report .
The report highlighted the need to keep operating systems , web browsers and applications up to date with the latest versions .
Increasingly , hackers are using common file formats , such as Microsoft Office documents and Adobe 's PDF format as the carrier of malicious exploits or programs .
More than 91 % of attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office were using security holes that had been plugged by updates that had been available for more than two years .
Attacks using PDF files rose sharply in the second half of 2008 , the report noted .
The vulnerabilities all of the attacks exploited had already been fixed by Adobe , and were not present in the most recent versions of the software .
Mr Gibson told BBC
News people had to be aware that if they did not update their applications , such as Office and Adobe , they were not just putting themselves at risk , but others on the internet also .
" If you do n't update your software you are not just a hazard to yourself , you are hazard to others because you can be part of a botnet [ if your computer is hijacked ] . "
Mr Evans said Microsoft was very happy with the approach consumers were taking to updating applications via automatic updates .
" For consumers it is happening but for business less so .
We have encourage businesses to make more use of automatic updates . "
Scareware Mr Wood said malicious hackers were exploiting Office document attachments and PDF files in order to make more targeted attacks .
" They tend to be used in selective attacks to named individuals in organisations .
" A lot of social engineering will be used to appear legitimate and convince a user to open the attachment " Once opened , a vulnerability in the application used to open the document will be exploited and often a tiny piece of code will execute and then download a larger file from a rogue website .
" This program will then attempt to search the computer for a particular document or file and sent it to a remote PC . "
The report also highlighted the rise in the use of so - called scareware , fake security programs which falsely tell people they need to install software which does nothing other than attempt to steal personal details from a users '
PC .
" It 's criminals playing on people 's fears , " said Mr Evans .
" The advice remains the same - ensuring you have up to date software , whether that 's your applications , your browser or your OS . "

What are these ?

Last year , European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes raised questions about the strange state of the European music market .
" Why is it possible to buy a CD from an online retailer and have it shipped to anywhere in Europe , but it is not possible to buy the same music , by the same artist , as an electronic download with similar ease ? " she asked .
" Why do pan -European services find it so difficult to get a pan-European license ?
Why do new , innovative services find licensing to be such a hurdle ? "
This year , she intends to do something about the problem , which has resulted in low growth rates for digital content sales .
Kroes , who has already taken on Microsoft and Intel , wants to move Europe 's digital music business toward a common market that crosses country borders .
If a company like Apple wants to launch an online music store , it should n't need to open dozens of separate shops that can each serve only one country .
Instead , a single set of licenses ought to be good enough to provide service across Europe .
We 're a long way from that vision , but Kroes said today that progress was being made .
French licensing society SACEM and music label EMI have both agreed in principle to allow their works to be licensed more easily across Europe .
Kroes , who has been chairing the Online Commerce Roundtable at which such issues are discussed , said today , " There is a clear willingness expressed by major players in the online distribution of music in Europe to tackle the many barriers which prevent consumers from fully benefiting from the opportunities that the Internet provides . "
This " willingness " is n't surprising , since Kroes has held out the possibility of regulation or legislation should voluntary agreements fail to bear fruit .
Sugar water and SACEM
SACEM 's involvement has at least a symbolic importance , as it was the world 's very first collection society .
Organized in Paris in the 1850s , SACEM came about after composer Ernest Bourget stopped by a cafe with a friend in 1847 .
The cafe orchestra was playing a set of pieces and surprised Bourget by suddenly playing one of his brief tunes .
As one history of collecting societies puts it , " When the waiter presented the composer with the bill for the sugared water that he and his colleague had consumed as the fashionable luxury drink of the period , Bourget refused to pay , claiming that the orchestra had repeatedly played his music — without paying anything : and so sugared water in return for playing his piece . "
A Parisian court upheld Bourget 's claim that he deserved compensation for the performance of his works , and the world 's first public performance right was born .
SACEM was created soon after to collect these royalties on behalf of composers like Bourget .
But has the music business kept up with the times ?
Kroes does n't think so .
" Collecting societies and music labels have come a long way since 1851 , the time of Bourget and his sugared water , " she said last year , " but the world has changed around them .
Artists have changed , distribution has changed , and consumers have changed .
There is a perception , though , that the collecting societies and the music labels have not . "
The collecting societies did n't help matters last year , when the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers said in a statement , " Time and time again , the creator has pleaded that the Commission ’s proposed course of action will lead to a calamitous decline in artistic creation , cultural diversity and creators ' income . "
Translation : these border restrictions keep prices artificially high .
Which is , of course , exactly the sort of issue that a Commissioner for Competition looks into .
Why it matters
As Kroes tries to drag them into the Internet age , readers might be forgiven for thinking the whole issue to be minor , technical , boring .
But the upshot is that many Europeans can only buy digital content from stores within their countries , limiting choice and competition .
When the iTunes Store debuted in the US , people from Key West to Seattle could buy music at the first digital storefront to offer an appealing deal .
The legal growth of the online music market owes much to iTunes , but the European situation means that some new EU member states like Bulgaria and Slovakia do n't have access to Apple 's online store , even today .
That 's not great for consumers , who often see piracy as a simpler and more attractive solution , and it's not great for the music business .
As the European Commission 's new report on the subject ( PDF ) puts it , " The de facto impossibility to buy IP - protected content from any EU online store is particularly harmful to consumers from the new Member States , who currently have a very limited choice of what music they can legally buy on the Internet , even though the demand for such content is growing . "
Refuse to provide simple ways to access legal movies and music , and after a while , it may be difficult to create real markets in such countries at all .
For five glorious minutes , Paul Kusznirewicz thought he was a multi-millionaire .
A new house .
A new car .
College funds for the kids and their kids and their kids .
All of his dreams were going to come true .
It was Dec. 8 at the Georgian Downs casino in Innisfil , Ont .
The 55 - year - old sat stupefied , gawking first at the Buccaneer slot machine – Jackpot !
You 've won $ 42.9 million – then at his equally stunned wife .
" The lights and the sounds .
It was saying on the machine ' Call attendant .
You have won a jackpot of over $ 42 million , ' " he said .
" I could n't believe it . "
Amidst the bells and whistles , a casino employee arrived , at first offering congratulations on the win .
" Oh , " he remembers the attendant saying .
" But look at how big .
I 'll have to call a supervisor . "
Casino personnel rushed to the slots – two supervisors , security and several mechanics .
They took pictures .
A crowd began to gather .
Finally , someone said : " We can't pay you that money because that machine is broken . "
But as compensation , Kusznirewicz was offered four coupons for the casino 's dinner buffet .
Yesterday , just before 1 p.m. , Kusznirewicz 's lawyer , Bryan McPhadden , served the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation with legal papers .
Kusznirewicz , who lives in Wasaga Beach , believes he should be compensated .
OLG has countered that the maximum payout for the Buccaneer slot game – a 2 cent per play machine – is $ 9,025 .
" It malfunctioned .
It clearly malfunctioned , " said spokesperson Allison Sparkes .
" Each machine has a posted sign that says malfunction voids all pays and plays . "
But what was n't posted is the maximum prize amount , said McPhadden .
" The maximum payout of the machine is not clearly stated on the machine as is the case with many other ( slots in the casino ) , which bear stickers stating the maximum win .
Accordingly , it is not clear that that amount cannot be won on this machine , " he said .
Furthermore , McPhadden says that despite weeks of discussions with OLG 's legal team , the corporation has never provided evidence the machine malfunctioned .
Sparkes says a report compiled after the incident indicated that the machine never actually went into jackpot mode and that an error message flashed on screen .
" There was an error message , " she said , adding that the OLG deals with public money and must protect the public 's interests .
" The machine did not go into jackpot mode and the patron was informed there was a malfunction in the machine . "
To this , McPhadden says both Kusznirewicz and his wife know what they saw .
Neither noticed any error message .
" All the normal lights , bells and the like associated with a win were shown on the machine and this is what attracted the OLG floor attendant to go to the machine , " he said , adding that the gaming corporation took photos of the machine at the time .
" OLG should release those photographs now if it is taking this position .
Had OLG provided us with these long ago , as it has had ample opportunity to do , we may not have commenced the action or continued with it . "
Kusznirewicz , who immigrated to Canada from Poland in 1981 , has two children and three grandchildren .
" I have dreams , you know , " he said .
" Then boom , just like that , the dreams are gone . "
Kusznirewicz says he and his wife have enjoyed going to the casino a few times a month for the past five or so years .
In the past , he has won small jackpots – $ 500 once and a few $ 300 prizes .
" But I 've put much more money in , " he said .
The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario is investigating the allegations .
“ I think this is great stuff , ” said Mitchell Zuckoff , a Boston University professor who published a biography , “ Ponzi ’s Scheme , ” in 2005 and while using material from other McMasters writings had no idea that the publicist ’s memoir existed .
“ My gut tells me he did n’t get his due , but I ’m not sure he was a complete Lone Ranger , either , ” he said .
Mr. McMasters ’s granddaughter and closest living relative , Faith B. Dickerson , a psychologist in Baltimore , said she too had also been unaware of the completed work , though she had copies of various shorter versions .
“ His role has been shortchanged in Ponzi accounts going back to the 1920s , ” she said .
Mr. McMasters was a pre-eminent public relations man when he took on Ponzi as a client in July 1920 .
A lawyer who had served in the Spanish - American War , he had handled publicity for the campaigns of several Massachusetts political figures , including Calvin Coolidge , John F. Fitzgerald ( President John F. Kennedy ’s grandfather ) and James M. Curley .
Mr. McMasters himself ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1938 , wrote a play produced on Broadway and exposed a baseball betting scandal .
Ponzi , on the other hand , was already a convicted felon , though Mr. McMasters and the world did not find that out until later .
Born in Italy in 1882 , he arrived in 1903 and made his way to Montreal , where he served three years for check forgery .
He eventually returned to Boston and devised a novel scheme to build a financial empire based on prepaid coupons that nations issued for postal replies .
By buying the coupons at a fixed rate , he could exploit international currency fluctuations by redeeming them at a higher price .
But after offering depositors high interest rates , Ponzi never really dealt in postal coupons , which turned out to be too unwieldy for large - scale speculation .
Instead , he just paid off his first depositors with money from later investors who would also have to be repaid .
In the end , he was short as much as $ 10 million  the equivalent of more than $ 100 million now .
He pleaded guilty , was sent to prison , then was deported to Italy and died in Brazil in 1949 .
You waited all year and yes , it ’s finally back .
The 2009 Gumball 3000 race officially begins tomorrow May 2nd and runs until May 8th .
The festivities are kicking off today in Los Angeles with a large Gumball 3000 party at the Santa Monica Pier .
As the cars made their way down to the beach for the concert and show we were there to capture the action .
Please check out pictures of the 2009 Gumball 3000 cars in the gallery below .
For those unfamiliar , the Gumball 3000 is an annual international rally that runs on public streets and changes routes every year .
There are 120 cars that are allowed to compete and drivers run the gammit from the entertainment industry to business executives to nefarious characters .
If you can scrape together a good team and $ 44,000 , you can pay the entry fee .
There is actually no official time keeping , no prize for hitting each checkpoint first or finishing the race itself the quickest .
The true celebrated winner is the driver or drivers that embody the spirit and adventure of the event ; he / she is given the ‘ Spirit of Gumball ‘ trophy .
This usually does not end up in the hands of the guys or gals driving the Lambos and Ferraris but the hoopties and those that overcome adversity along the way to finish .
This year ’s Gumball 3000 is a ‘ coast to coast ’ rally from Los Angeles to Miami .
Along the way there will be parties and car showcases in Santa Monica , Las Vegas , Sante Fe , Dallas , New Orleans and Miami .
This year ’s notable entries include Bam Margera , Tony Hawk and David Hasselhoff .
However , the coolest dude on the road just might be Bill Wu rolling in a California Highway Patrol Car disguised as the CDC Swine Flu Tactical Emergency Response Interception Vaccination Vehicle .
Let ’s just hope a swarm of infected people do n’t slow them down .

Peru 's government says gay police officers damage the image of the force
Peru has announced that it will ban homosexuals from the police force for damaging the image of the institution .
The law is one of several new regulations put forward by the Interior Minister , Mercedes Cabanillas .
Ms Cabanillas is trying to shake up the institution , which has a dismal reputation among the general public .
But critics say some of the new laws , especially those regarding sexual orientation or activity , are unconstitutional .
The law states that any police officer who has sexual relations with someone of the same gender will be indefinitely suspended from the police force .
The same applies to officers who have extra-marital relations - their actions are also deemed to cause scandal and denigrate the institution 's image .
They are among a raft of new regulations , which also include provision for sacking police officers who accept bribes , organise or take part in strikes and protest marches .
Ms Cabanillas ' strong - arm tactics have earned her some public backing and the nickname " Thatcher " in the Peruvian media , after the former Conservative British Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher .
Traditional machismo means openly homosexual police men are extremely scarce , but gay rights activists are growing in strength and this new law will provoke a debate .
There are claims and then there are facts .
Sometimes the lines are blurred .
Such is the case with Intense Automotive Design ‘s new project , “ The Land Shark “ , based on the already awesome Mosler MT900 GT XX .
IAD has stated that their reworked version sheds 551 pounds , produces 2,500 hp with a top speed of 305 mph and a has a redline of 10,000 rpm .
Mosler Automotive uses the Corvette ’s LS7 engine with a pair of turbochargers .
And this is where things get dicey .
GM Performance Parts has an LSX engine that has theoretical horsepower thresholds matching those suggested by IAD , but not using the LS7 .
It will be interesting to see the real extent of the engine modifications which must be substantive .
The stardard 2009 Mosler MT900 GTR XX does 0 to 62 mph in 3.1 seconds and IAD ’s iteration claims a 2.5 second time .
In addition , IAD also claims a 0 to 150 mph time of 6.7 seconds , reaching 250 mph in just over 17.5 seconds .
And , there is another suspicious declaration …
Allegedly , the IAD Land Shark can perform the 0 - 100 - 0 task in 8.7 seconds .
The car actually has a theoretical top speed of 375 mph using racing fuel .
In the standard setup it runs four types of fuel – petrol , methanol , hydrogen and ethanol – making it officially a “ hybrid ” car .
Intense Automotive Design ’s Mosler MT900 GTR XX incorporates new aerodynamic modifications such as updated dive planes , a revised front splitter , air intakes and outlets installed on the sides and roof and an air duct channel added along the belly pan .
The car rides on front wheels measuring 11.5×19 inches and massive rear wheels at 14×20 inches .
Look for this IAD ’s modified Mosler MT900 GTR to be at the 2009 Bonneville Speed Week , which kicks off August 8th , in an attempt to get into the Guiness Book of World Records .
And shortly thereafter , if the car is n’t somewhere in the stratosphere , it will make an appearance at Nurburgring .

In what is likely the first of its kind in Canada , a Toronto mosque is offering a " detox " program for young Islamic radicals who are sympathetic to the terrorist group al Qaeda .
Muhammed Robert Heft , a team member of the Specialized De-radicalization Intervention program , says the program is based on the idea that Islamic extremism can be fought by incorporating traditional teachings of the Qur'an into a " 12 - step Extremist Detox Program . "
Among the steps in the program offered at Toronto 's Masjid El Noor mosque :
Finding common ground , " not fighting ground , " with other faiths
In the " Open society of Canada , " how to reconcile " dogmatic idealism with pragmatic realism "
Seeing the whole as one , and take into account " global challenges that affect us all . "
Actively countering extremist ideology through " education , public speaking and writing . "
" As Canadians of Muslim faith , it is our ardent desire to become leaders in the championing of anti-terror values , " says a document explaining the program .
Heft told CTV Newsnet 's Power Play on Wednesday that among the young radical Islamic followers the mosque is hoping to counsel are members of the notorious " Toronto 18 . "
In 2006 , a series of counter - terrorism raids in the Greater Toronto Area resulted in the arrest of 18 alleged members of a purported Islamic terrorist cell plotting a variety of attacks against targets in Ontario .
That case , along with that of Ottawa 's Momin Khawaja who was convicted for his role in a British terror cell , have raised concerns about home - grown terrorism .
Heft said there are many sects in Islam , and that " 99.9 " per cent of Islamic leaders across the country agree they must work together to combat extremism .
But he did admit there are a " small number of firebrand preachers " who try to persuade young Muslims to jump onto the extremist bandwagon .
" Unfortunately , a few emotional , Internet - surfing , like - minded individuals who do what I call ' Do - It - Yourself Islam , ' find themselves getting caught up in emotion and justify getting caught up in the hate that 's inside them , " Heft told Power Play host Tom Clark .
" They end up falling prey to people with deviant views of the religion . "
But he says if one studies the tradition of Islam , going back to the orthodox scholars , " you realize these are the teachings of Islam . "
And by incorporating these teachings into the mosque 's program , Heft claims he's had success converting those who formerly held radical , anti-Semitic views into " productive members of society . "
He says the program has also helped disenfranchised Muslims get jobs , and to get off welfare .
" We 're winning , " said Heft .

Dear Friends and Supporters ,
It ’s hard to believe our students have begun another school year !
I know we all appreciate our teachers and administrators for their hard work and dedication as they have prepared for our schoolchildren .
I also appreciate all of the parents and other adults who have gotten your children ready for another year of learning !
Governor Abbott made an excellent choice by appointing Donna Bahorich to succeed me as Chair of the State Board of Education ( SBOE ) on June 18 , and I applaud his decision .
I was term - limited after two consecutive terms as Chair but will continue to serve on the State Board of Education .
Governor Perry appointed me twice as Chair and for that I thank him .
It was an honor and I think the board made great strides in serving the schoolchildren of Texas .
I wholeheartedly support Donna and look forward to seeing how God uses her in this leadership role !
UPDATE ON SBOE ISSUES :
Same Ol’ , Same Ol ’
Once again , liberal critics and the media are spreading false statements that our state ’s history curriculum standards downplay slavery , overemphasize religion and Moses ’ influence in America ’s founding , and that Texas does n’t require students to learn about the Ku Klux Klan or the Jim Crow laws .
We ’ve heard this before .
Such statements not only reflect ignorance about the curriculum standards but also reflect a blatant disrespect for the hard - working review panels , comprised mostly of social studies teachers who diligently reviewed and updated the standards in 2009 - 2010 .
The state curriculum standards , the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills ( TEKS ) , provide teachers a framework that tells them what elements to teach , but teachers are free to decide how to present the curriculum .
The TEKS are not designed to list everything specifically .
On the other hand , as expected , textbooks are very comprehensive and contain detailed subject matter .
Both the TEKS and the textbooks undergo separate , rigorous reviews that are overseen by the SBOE .
Public input is a critical part of both processes .
Let ’s look at the truth about the TEKS .
Feel free to take a look for yourself at : http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter113/index.html
· First , slavery is not downplayed in the TEKS .
Starting in Grade 3 , students are introduced to slavery by learning about the abolitionist movement and the Emancipation Proclamation during Celebrate Freedom Week .
The Texas Education Code requires Celebrate Freedom Week in Grades 3 - 12 .
In addition , slavery is listed specifically in the TEKS for five different grade levels !
Our students most definitely learn about its role in the Civil War .
· The coverage of Moses and our nation ’s religious heritage is accurate in the TEKS .
The TEKS for U.S. Government require the study of individuals including Moses , William Blackstone , John Locke , and Charles de Montesquieu , “ whose principles of laws and government institutions informed the American founding documents . ”
In the World History TEKS , students are expected to “ identify the impact of political and legal ideas ” contained in documents including the Jewish Ten Commandments , the Declaration of Independence , the U.S. Constitution , and more .
One textbook accurately states , “ Moses was a lawgiver and a great leader .
Like the founders of the United States , he helped establish a legal system to govern his people .
The Ten Commandments have been a guide and basis for many legal and moral systems throughout the world . ”
To naysayers who insist this is a distortion of history , I would point out that Moses , a revered figure in Christianity , Judaism and Islam , is openly honored as a lawgiver in many of our nation ’s most public governmental buildings , including the U. S. Supreme Court , the Library of Congress , and the U. S. Capitol , among many others .
The textbooks do a fair , balanced job of covering the TEKS about our country ’s religious heritage and its influence on our nation 's Founders .
Publishers responded directly to critics ’ concerns .
For example in response to a comment about the role of religion on “ equality ” before the law , Pearson Publishing responded , " We believe that our presentation of the role of religion in favor of the American Revolution is accurate and clear for this grade level .
( A reference to support our position is “ Religion and the Founding of the American Republic ” on the Library of Congress website . ) ”
I went into greater detail about the coverage of our rich religious heritage in my December 2014 newsletter .

· The Ku Klux Klan and Jim Crow laws are covered in the TEKS through court cases and historical figures .
Many of the TEKS reference people or events that will prompt students to learn about other momentous topics in history even if the topic is not specifically listed .
For example , Ida B. Wells is in the U.S. History TEKS .
She was a founder of the NAACP and a leader in the anti-lynching movement to stop the Ku Klux Klan and other vigilante groups that terrorized African Americans .
So while the Ku Klux Klan is not listed specifically in the standards , teachers will certainly teach about it .
Another example in this course is the required study of the 13th amendment which outlawed slavery .
And while the Jim Crow laws are n't listed in the TEKS , students will learn about them in the landmark 1896 Supreme Court case , Plessy v. Ferguson , which is in the TEKS .
Also in the TEKS is Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka which overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson case .
This is one way that the teacher review panels ensured that students would be encouraged to think critically .
About the textbooks :
This past fall , after months of an extensive review process with input from thousands of people including appointed review panelists ( mostly history educators ) , citizen testifiers , and an influx of emails and phone calls , almost 90 social studies textbooks were approved by the SBOE .
The approved instructional materials met the requirement for covering over 50 % of the TEKS .
( Unfortunately , a change from requiring 100 % coverage was made by the legislature in 2011 . )
Thankfully , many of the textbooks do provide content for 100 % of the TEKS , and I encourage school districts to give those textbooks top consideration .
The list of SBOE - approved materials can be found at this link : http://tea.texas.gov/Curriculum_and_Instructional_Programs/Instructional_Materials/Review_and_Adoption_Process/Proclamation_2015_Pre-adoption_Samples/
Final thoughts :
I hope this information helps explain a few things .
It is rare for someone , especially liberal organizations and those in the media , to actually look at the textbooks or at the TEKS themselves before making " informed " statements about what is covered or not .
What a shame .
They might actually learn some history !
* Note : Did you know this ?
By law , for every student , school districts must provide instructional materials that cover 100 % of the TEKS ( TEC Section 31.004 ) .
So if a textbook only covers 55 % of the TEKS , the school district is required to provide additional instructional materials that cover the other 45 % .
Is your school district doing that ?
Find out , and get involved !
OTHER SBOE NEWS :
In June , while still Chair of the SBOE , I wrote to Texas Attorney General Paxton seeking guidance regarding the adoption and use of instructional materials , specifically textbooks chosen by school districts for TEKS coverage .
( Once appointed , Chair Bahorich agreed to keep the request in place . )
As stated in my letter to the AG , I sought to identify the extent of the SBOE 's rulemaking authority to ensure that , at the local level , appropriate process and safeguards exist with regard to the review and adoption of instructional materials by a public school .
Of great concern are the instructional materials that have not been vetted in the SBOE ’s review process .
Publishers have always had the option to bypass the SBOE ’s rigorous and transparent textbook review process ; but if they did , school districts could not use state dollars to purchase them .
This changed with the passage of Senate Bill 6 in 2011 ; school districts may now use state dollars for non-state approved instructional materials .
At the local level , there are no required guidelines and no specific “ best practices ” model ; thus , the local textbook review process varies in our 1,000 + school districts .
I will point out that many school districts have a good textbook review and selection process place ; however , we must ensure that this is true in every district .
Since the passage of SB 6 , many of us on the Board have been contacted by concerned parents and teachers with questions such as :
What types of textbooks are being sold directly to our schools , bypassing the board ’s review process ?
How are these instructional materials vetted by the districts ?
Do the textbooks align with the TEKS and provide error - free content ?
Are districts actively seeking parent review and input ?
Is there rigor and transparency in the local selection process ?
For the sake of our schoolchildren , all textbooks should be held to the same level of accountability as are the SBOE - approved textbooks .
You may see my actual 8.28.15 letter to the Attorney General here .
It takes about six months for the AG ’s office to release an opinion .

I started writing this post last August , and found it all too aggravating , so it ’s been sitting in the draft folder since then .
This week ’s publication by the UK Home Office of a survey on public attitudes towards violence against women has made it topical again .
These figures appear to actually show the situation is worse than we thought from that pivotal 2005 poll by Amnesty .
For example , Amnesty found about 1/3 of people think women who ’ve been flirting are responsible if they get raped , whereas the Home Office poll puts the figure at a shocking 43 % .
About 50 % believe that women in prostitution bear some or all of the responsibility if they ’re raped .
Elsewhere , grave doubt was expressed that attitudes of holding women responsible for sexual violence directed towards them was in fact a popular community view , to the extent that a position paper from an academic conference was mercilessly mocked for this sentence :
Women who are raped or who suffer domestic violence are somehow thought of in the popular imagination as a stereotype .
According to this , the women are asking for it , dressed inappropriately , provoking it – responsible for it .
Like quite a few other people , my response to this mockery and argument that no way is this a common attitude towards domestic and sexual violence was largely you have got to be kidding – but apparently not .
I offered to produce cites , and began to do so , and then the original thread went pear - shaped and I was so sickened that I did n’t complete it .
There was eventually some retreat on that thread from the mockers / deniers to claiming that no - one actually says in so many words that a woman is responsible for being raped or bashed , but they made no acknowledgement or analysis of the implications of common remarks about rape victims such as “ look at what she was wearing ” or “ she should n’t have been drinking like that ” or “ what did she expect when she went to a footballer ’s room ? ” ( I dunno , maybe to just have sex with that one footballer , instead of being surprised by a queue of his very large mates blocking the exit from the room ? ) .
One does n’t have to state an attitude directly for that attitude to be clearly implied by / inferred from the other things one says .
Another weird aspect of that particular discussion was an immediate assumption that the phrase “ in the popular imagination ” somehow only applied to a male view of sexual violence , and that it implied a universal male view at that .
Let ’s make two things very clear :
Nothing in the original report to which such objections were made implied that victim - blaming was only popular amongst men .
Many , many women also hold views that other women who are victims of sexual violence contribute to their own victimisation by behaving recklessly or unwisely ( this seems to be almost a totemic belief system – if women can believe that it is only those women who do “ the wrong things ” are victimised , then they feel safer so long as they themselves do n’t do “ the wrong things ” ) .
Popular does not mean universal .
Two very popular musical artists are Michael Jackson and Britney Spears , yet I have never owned a recording by either of them .
No one recording artist has ever had an absolute majority of the record - buying public buy one of their recordings , and yet enough people do buy recordings of certain artists that those artists are described as popular – it requires 1,000,000 “ sales ” in the USA to be awarded a “ platinum album ” by the RIAA , which means purchases by far fewer than 1 % of the adult population .
I ’m sure the perspicacious reader can come up with many similar examples from other fields of human taste and opinion .
So , let ’s lay that whole misrepresentation to rest , shall we ?
“ Popular ” simply refers to a noticeable proportion of the population .
The original report was in no way a slam against men as a whole when anyone who has done any study in this area knows that when it comes to jury trials it is both men and women who are critical of a victim ’s behaviour , and the report was aimed at a readership that could be expected to already know that ( especially in light of this recent Australian Institute of Criminology report , which found that pre-existing attitudes towards rape victims are the strongest determinant in jurors ’ assessment of witness credibility ) .
In the AIC 2007 report , jurors who were politically conservative men with lower - level educations are more likely to believe that the defendants are not guilty of rape than those jurors with higher educations , but despite many other jurors finding the witness credible uncertainties about what actually constituted consent and ensuing reasonable doubt meant that 75 % of the jurors felt that the appropriate response was a not - guilty verdict .
The study also showed that if victims , following a sexual assault , do not behave in ways that the jurors imagine rape victims should behave , then they tend to find them less credible regarding the issue of consent ( and that their general beliefs about how “ real ” rape victims behave were highly stereotypical ) .
I certainly find attitudes that are popular enough to result in a not - guilty decision from 75 % of the jury pool to be popular enough to be concerned about .
Summarising such attitudes about sexual violence against women as “ asking for it , dressing inappropriately , provoking it – responsible for it ” does not seem like too far a stretch to me .
A separate community survey in Victoria ( Taylor & Mouzos , 2006 ) showed the following ( as summarised by the AIC 2007 report ) :
one in 10 respondents believed that women are more likely to be raped by strangers and another one in 10 could n’t say
about one quarter disagreed that false claims of rape are rare and one in 10 could n’t say ( if a juror starts with the assumption that women often lie about rape , this will influence the way s/he interprets testimony )
fifteen percent agreed that women often say ‘ no ’ when they mean ‘ yes ’ and one in 10 could n’t say ( testimony that the complainant said ‘ no ’ is unlikely to convince jurors with this belief that she did not consent )
seven percent of males and four percent of females agreed that women who are raped often ask for it
forty - four percent of males and 32 percent of females believed that rape results from men not being able to control their need for sex ( responsibility for rape is therefore removed from men because it is not within their control )
A similar study in Ireland had broadly similar figures ( although they asked some different questions , including sexual history / revealing clothes ) and found that
Dramatic differences in empathy towards victims based on age and social class are revealed .
Gender , however , had little impact .
[…]
The results of the poll support the results of the ground - breaking Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland ( SAVI ) report in 2002 , which found 15 % of the population believed a raped woman was not an innocent victim .
Let ’s examine the shockingly high numbers of both men and women who agree that “ rape results from men not being able to control their need for sex ” and what that indicates .
Other studies show juries are unsympathetic to victims who have consumed large amounts of alcohol and that there is a wide assumption that it is reasonable to assume that silence equals consent , even when the victim is too intoxicated to speak .
Combine the attitudes that men cannot control their sexual urges and that women say no when they mean yes and that silence equals consent , and you essentially have a large proportion of the population holding the attitude , rarely openly expressed , that men should not be expected to resist any temptation to have sexual contact with unconscious women in their vicinity ( and that women should not expect to be safe if drunk in the company of men , therefore if women are drunk in the company of men and non-consensual sex takes place , they have contributed to their own assault by offering the opportunity to men who cannot resist ) .
This attitude towards alcohol consumption also presents women who are out drinking as unquestionably signalling sexual availability of a general definitely - tonight - with - anyone nature rather than just of a potential maybe - sometime - with - someone nature , and that men cannot be expected to tell the difference themselves or to respect those boundaries if they are expressed , no matter how directly and clearly .
This attitude that silence is assumed to mean consent means that a defence lawyer can bully a woman who was too drunk to remember into agreeing that she ca n’t be absolutely sure that she said no , and that a judge can then instruct the jury that the fully sober security guard who “ took advantage ” of her while so drunk that her friends had asked him to escort her to her room should thus be given the benefit of the doubt ( Ryairi Dougal was found not guilty ) .
This view of men as unable to resist an opportunity to rape is a popular community attitude , it is NOT a feminist view of men .
Feminists argue that men should be expected to be able to refrain from raping a vulnerable woman , and that is is unreasonable to exculpate men on the basis that they have no control over their sexual urges .
Men are right to feel insulted by the belief that they cannot resist sexual temptation , but it is wrong to blame feminists for this belief .
This widespread belief goes back centuries and even millennia before feminism , and is reinforced every time someone expresses the view that “ men ca n’t help themselves ” with regard to sexual continency .
( Catch 22 : when women actually do act on the assumption that any man cannot resist the sexual temptation of a woman too vulnerable or incapacitated to resist , they are described as paranoid despite having heard this message throughout their lives . )
So , below are more samples of academic articles , news reports and opinion columns which show that the idea that women are responsible for their own rapes – that they ask for or provoke sexual violence by dressing inappropriately or engaging in unsafe behaviours ( including behaviours at home with their partners ) – is very commonly held indeed .
Anyway , on with the cites :
Rape Myths
By far the most common rape myth is that the primary danger is from a stranger in the bushes .
Yet the fact is , that in study after study ( of rapes both reported to the police and community surveys of rapes that were not ) that most raped women report knowing their accused rapists socially .
In Australia in 2003 78 % of female victims knew their attackers and 65 % of sexual assaults took place in private dwellings rather than public places .
Yet there is still a perception that only stranger rape is “ real ” rape , that other incidents of sexual coercion are more likely to be viewed as misunderstandings within a relationship rather than being understood as a deliberate decision to employ or threaten force in order to gain sexual intercourse with a nonconsenting victim .
The second most common myth is that most acquaintance - rape attacks occur on women who have been drinking alchol , who have gone with their attacker willingly while intoxicated and later been coerced into sexual activity .
Yet official UK Home Office figures show that “ there was some evidence of alcoholic consumption by the victim prior to the offence ( although not necessarily intoxication ) in 31 per cent of cases ” , which while significant ( popular ? ) is not a majority .
Other research indicates that in most cases both people are drinking , and in cases where only one of the people has been drinking , it is more likely to be the man who is intoxicated .
Negative attitudes generally
Australia
The results demonstrated that a significant proportion of students held unfavorable attitudes toward rape victims , perceived the victims as being responsible for the rape , and perceived the victims as contributing to their assault .

Studies have shown that a disturbingly high level of teenage boys condone sexual violence , reinforcing the need for sexual violence prevention education in secondary schools ( Bateman 1991 ) .

From other countries :
In Hungary ( from an Amnesty International Report referenced in an Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault newsletter ) :
Significant proportions of people surveyed in a public opinion poll believed that women were responsible for being raped ( 40 % of men and 25 % of women ) , and over 15 % thought that domestic violence was an exaggerated social issue .
The same newsletter contains this quote :
At least 85 % of them are whores : but they do not manage to come to an agreement .
They are prostitutes : overtly or secretly … ( A police officer and expert on rape issues in Cries Unheard )
Police attitudes towards sexual assault in New Zealand ( Jordan , 2005 ) : this report shows continuing beliefs that women routinely lie about rape and that accusations of non-stranger rape are simply sexual misunderstandings rather than genuine sexual attacks .
Perceptions of consent , rape myth acceptance and whether a coerced sexual act was perceived as a sexual assault
Many studies have shown that often sexual acts which meet the legal definition or rape / sexual assault may not be labelled as such by either the victims or the perpetrators , if they have an acquaintance relationship .
This non-labelling is often claimed as evidence that no rape took place despite meeting the legal definition of such , and appears to reveal an attitude that women have more control in instances of acquaintance rape compared to stranger rape .
Was it rape ?
The function of women ’s Rape Myth acceptance and definitions of sex in labeling their own experiences
PETERSON Zoë D. , MUEHLENHARD
Charlene L. , Department of Psychology , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas
Sex roles , 2004 , vol. 51 , no3 - 4 , pp. 129-144
Abstract :
In a phenomenon called unacknowledged rape , many rape victims do not label their experience rape .
Does their level of rape myth acceptance influence this labeling process ?
In this study , 86 college women whose experience met the legal definition of rape described their experience , indicated how they labeled it , and completed the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale .
Logistic regressions indicated that , for 2 rape myths ( e.g. , if women do n’t fight back , it ’s not rape ) , women who accepted the myth and whose experience corresponded to the myth ( e.g. , they did not fight back ) were less likely than other women to acknowledge their experience as rape .
Women were also unlikely to acknowledge rape when they did not label the nonconsensual sexual behavior sex .
Gender role and attitudes toward rape in male and female college students
Sex Roles : A Journal of Research , July , 1993 by Lynda A. Szymanski , Ann Sloan Devlin , Joan C. Chrisler , Stuart A. Vyse
Kanin ( 1967 ) found that 26 % of the male undergraduates surveyed admitted that they had acted sexually aggressively on a date , which involved making a forceful attempt at intercourse causing their date to cry , scream , fight , or plead .
[…]
One in 12 men surveyed in this study admitted to acting in ways that satisfied the legal definition of rape or attempted rape , with 84 % of these men believing that what they had done was “ definitely not rape . ”
Perceptions that sexually successful men ca n’t be rapists because “ they do n’t need to rape , women are throwing themselves at them ”
This is a very , very common response any time an elite athlete or high status man is accused of rape , revealing a judgement that rape is purely a function of lust , and that a man who has regular sexual liaisons could therefore have no “ need ” to rape in order to have his sexual needs met .
It totally denies that rapists can and do decide to use sexual assault as an expression of power , that subjugating and humiliating a woman who said no to sex is a big part , perhaps the major part , of the thrill .
Kanin found that this view of rapists as acting from sexual “ need ” ( i.e. an extended period without sexual intercourse ) was certainly not the case in his study of 71 self - disclosed dape rapists ( according to the legal criterion “ sexual penetration accomplished on a nonconsenting woman by employing or threatening force ” ) .
The subjects were self - selecting college undergraduates responding to advertisements promising anonymity and counselling .
All of the incidents of self - disclosed date rape were with women who they had been dating for at least several previous dates .
All of these men had a generally high rate of sexual success and therefore a high rate of expecting continued sexual success .
Frustration of their expected success prompted the employing / threatening of force in order to gain sexual penetration .
Kanin et al used a control group initially consisting of 227 men ( white , unmarried , undergraduate students from 15 different classes ) to complete the same surveys regarding sexual behaviour as their 71 subjects , aiming to compare heterosexual non-rapists with heterosexual rapists .
When collating the survey they excluded men who disclosed as homosexual , and they also exluded another 36 men for disclosing that they had either attempted or succeeded in gaining coitus throught the use of force or threats .

President Barack Obama was warmly welcomed at Notre Dame ’s commencement today .
Obama used his speech to not only called for a reduction in abortions performed , and for two sides of a debate that will probably never agree on the issue , but they can have an open hearted and minded debate .
Obama said , “ Maybe we wo n’t agree on abortion , but we can still agree that this is a heart - wrenching decision for any woman to make , with both moral and spiritual dimensions .
So let ’s work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions by reducing unintended pregnancies , and making adoption more available , and providing care and support for women who do carry their child to term .
Let ’s honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion , and draft a sensible conscience clause , and make sure that all of our health care policies are grounded in clear ethics and sound science , as well as respect for the equality of women . ”
He continued , “ Understand — I do not suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go away .
No matter how much we may want to fudge it — indeed , while we know that the views of most Americans on the subject are complex and even contradictory — the fact is that at some level , the views of the two camps are irreconcilable .
Each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction .
But surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature .
Open hearts .
Open minds .
Fair - minded words . ”

Obama certainly did n’t sound like the baby killing radical that religious right has painted him to be .
Obama once again demonstrated that the worst thing his political opponents can ever do is to paint him as a radical .
He excels in the middle .
Obama emerged as the real winner of this controversy today .
He used the radical right ’s protests as an opportunity to position himself in the middle of America ’s toughest cultural issue .
The protests and outrage were an outside manufactured creation , which did n’t materialize inside the university community .
Before the speech some experts said that Obama ’s remarks could hurt him with Catholics , but I do n’t think that is what happened here .
By voicing his desire to reduce the number of abortions performed in the country , while calling for a respectful dialogue , Obama appealed to the people on both sides of the debate that are n’t zealots .
His position may not be popular on the fringes , but it works quite nicely for those in the middle .

Flu Shots
Home
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service , October 23 , 2008 Flu Shots For The Elderly Are Ineffective ( OMNS , October 23 , 2008 )
Have the elderly people in your family missed their flu shot ?
If so , they may have made the right decision .
The New York Times recently reported that " A growing number of immunologists and epidemiologists say the vaccine probably does not work very well for people over 70 , " and that previous studies may have shown " not any actual protection against the flu virus but a fundamental difference between the kinds of people who get vaccines and those who do not . . . simply because they went to the doctor more often . "
( 1 ) Influenza vaccination has been widely touted even though evidence of effectiveness is lacking .
One large scientific review looked at 40 years ' worth of influenza vaccine studies .
It found that flu shots were ineffective for elderly persons living in the community , and flu shots were " non-significant against influenza " for elderly living in group homes .
( 2 ) The authors of another major review " found no correlation between vaccine coverage and influenza - like - illness attack rate . "
( 3 ) Author Dr. Thomas Jefferson said , " The vaccine does n't work very well at all .
Vaccines are being used as an ideological weapon .
What you see every year as the flu is caused by 200 or 300 different agents with a vaccine against two of them .
That is simply nonsense . "
( 4 ) Indeed , he commented , " What you see is that marketing rules the response to influenza , and scientific evidence comes fourth or fifth . "
( 5 ) Some still claim that flu vaccinations , even though they do not prevent the flu , may help prevent more serious complications such as pneumonia , so dreaded and so often deadly for the elderly .
But the authors of the study discussed in the NY Times article specifically noted that " influenza vaccination was not associated with a reduced risk of community - acquired pneumonia . "
( 6 ) As with all immunizations , flu shots can have harmful side effects .
Vaccines may contain , among other things , ingredients such as mercury and aluminum , which are widely regarded as toxic .
The elderly are more likely to be injured by , or even die from , flu vaccine side effects .
Such incidents may remain unreported by hospitals or physicians .
One man , aged 76 , had a flu shot and immediately had to be hospitalized for a week .
When family members suggested to the hospital staff and physicians that it was probably a reaction to the shot , their views were disregarded .
Two years later the man had another flu shot , and was promptly hospitalized a second time .
Family members once again said it was a reaction to the flu shot .
The hospital said it was a low - grade infection , probably a bladder infection .
The man died .
There are indications that vaccination side effects are underreported .
The US Food and Drug Administration 's Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System receives around 11,000 serious adverse reaction reports each year , mostly from doctors .
( 7 ) FDA states that " VAERS tracks serious vaccine reactions , not common fevers and soreness from shots .
Serious reactions include death , life - threatening illness , hospitalization , and disability resulting from a vaccine . "
( 8 ) However , FDA admits that they probably receive reports for only about 10 percent of all adverse vaccine reactions .
( 9 ) The National Vaccine Information Center estimates the reporting percentage to be far lower , perhaps under 3 percent .
( 10 ) The exact contents of each year 's flu shot is an educated guess .
Sometimes this guess is wrong , as it was for 2008 , where the vaccine " does n't match two of the three main types of flu bugs now in circulation .
. . .
The predominant type A flu virus this year is the H3N2 strain ; 87 % are the " Brisbane " strain .
And 93 % of this year 's type B flu bugs are from the " Yamagata " lineage .
The current flu vaccine 's H3N2 component is the " Wisconsin " strain ; the type B component is from the " Victoria " lineage . "
( 11 ) Even when the guess is correct , flu viruses frequently mutate and become resistant all over again .
The flu vaccine , notes the NY Times , has not been double - blind , placebo - control tested .
Faith in vaccination appears to be greater than the scientific evidence to justify vaccination .
Senior citizens already take far more medications than any other segment of the population .
The elderly have weaker immune systems .
The risk of immunization adverse effects rises accordingly .
Increased side effect danger , along with low effectiveness , is a bad combination .
Is their an available alternative ?
Yes , there may be : give the elderly more nutrients , rather than more needles .
Older people often have inadequate diets .
With ageing and illness , their bodies ' need for vital nutrients goes up , yet frequently their intake actually goes down .
Nutritional supplements help fight the flu .
Vitamins and minerals have been shown to significantly reduce incidence and duration of influenza .
This was already known back when many of today 's elderly were still middle - aged .
32 years ago , twice Nobel - Prize winner Linus Pauling reviewed the nutritional literature and determined that high doses of vitamin C reduce the frequency and shorten the severity of influenza .
( 12 ) Orthomolecular ( nutritional ) physicians have repeatedly confirmed this .
Robert F. Cathcart , MD , successfully treated thousands of viral - illness patients with massive doses of vitamin C. ( 13 ) Vitamin D also increases resistance to influenza ( 14 ) , as do the minerals selenium and zinc .
( 15 ) With good nutrition bolstered with supplemental vitamin and mineral intake , the human body 's natural defenses are strengthened and can rapidly adapt to resist new flu strains .
Clinical evidence indicates that nutrition is more significant that vaccination .
Malnutrition is far more dangerous than not getting vaccinated .
No , there is not a vaccination for every illness .
It might be nice if there were , but no shot can make up for poor nutrition .
Over -reliance on vaccinating the elderly ignores their fundamental problems of poor diet and vitamin / mineral deficiencies .
These are underlying reasons for a susceptible immune system .
Supplemental nutrition is the " other " immune system booster .
It is time to use it .

Orthomolecular Medicine News Service , March 19 , 2008 Vitamins Reduce the Duration and Severity of Influenza ( OMNS , March 19 , 2008 ) Vitamins fight the flu by boosting the body ’s own immune response and by accelerating healing .
Individuals can be better prepared for an influenza epidemic by learning how to use vitamin supplements to fight off ordinary respiratory infections .
The most important vitamins are vitamins C , D , niacin , and thiamine .
Vitamin D
Vitamin D has known anti-viral properties [ 1 ] and has been directly associated with fighting influenza in a recent scientific review . [ 2 ]
Extensive evidence now shows that vitamin D serves as an important regulator of immune system responses . [ 3 ]
The most dramatic evidence is a recent double - blind trial proving that vitamin D prevents cancers [ 4 ] , supported by two recent epidemiological studies . [ 5,6 ]
Vitamin D has been part of a supplement combination proven effective against HIV in a recent double - blind trial . [ 7 ]
During a viral infection , the body can draw on vitamin D stored in the body to supply the increased needs of the immune system .
The withdrawn supplies of vitamin D are quickly replenished with 4,000 to 10,000 IU / day doses for a few days .
Due to biochemical individuality , we recommend vitamin D blood testing as a routine part of a yearly physical exam .
Niacin
Niacin has known anti-viral properties .
The most persuasive evidence comes from recent work with HIV patients . [ 8 - 12 ]
Niacin is required for cells to generate the energy they use to perform virtually all biological functions .
Niacin ’s effectiveness fighting viruses may have to do with accelerating wound healing as well as improving immunity .
Accelerating tissue repair limits collateral damage and minimizes the risk of secondary infection .
Niacin has been proven to promote healing of damaged skin in double - blind trials . [ 13 ]
Other recent findings ( niacin reduces injury to the brain after strokes and reduces inflammation in general ) also provide evidence of healing .
[ 14,15 ]
Niacin , 500 to 2,000 mg / day in divided doses , is generally well tolerated during periods when the immune system is fighting viral infections .
One takes such doses for several days starting at the onset of a viral infection .
Dividing the dose reduces flushing .
Using " no- flush " form niacin ( inositol hexaniacinate ) eliminates the flushing side effect .
Vitamin C
Strong evidence shows that high doses of vitamin C prevent common colds and reduce a cold ’s severity and duration . [ 16 ]
Given the similarities between cold and influenza viruses , the scientific case for treating influenza with vitamin C has been investigated and shown to have merit . [ 17 ]
Fighting influenza with vitamin C has been tested in the clinical setting and reported to be effective at very high doses . [ 18 , 19 ]
Extraordinary quantities of vitamin C , between 20,000 and 100,000 mg/day , are surprisingly well tolerated during periods when the immune system is fighting viral infections .
These large daily amounts are best taken divided up into as many doses per day as possible , beginning immediately at the first sign of a viral infection .
To achieve maximum effect it is necessary to maintain high concentrations of vitamin C in the body .
Large , very frequent oral intake of vitamin C can maintain much higher blood plasma concentrations of vitamin C than is generally believed .
[ 16 , 19 , 20 ] Thiamine ( Vitamin B1 )
Two items of recent scientific research have shown that the B- vitamin thiamine has anti-viral properties .
TTFD , one of the fat - soluble forms of thiamine , was recently proven to be a potent inhibitor of HIV virus replication [ 21 ] .
Thiamine was shown to be an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B . [ 22 ]
Influenza killed more people in the two years following World War I than all soldiers killed on both sides in four years of machine - gun warfare .
Influenza has been and remains a serious threat to human health .
There is a great deal of public concern about the possibility of a repeat of the 1918 influenza pandemic .
Vitamin C , niacin , vitamin D , and thiamine act together to strengthen the immune system , and to optimize health .
Intelligent , high - dose vitamin supplement use can do much to eliminate the risk of death and disability for individuals with average health , and dramatically reduce the hospitalization and death rates amongst the most vulnerable members of the population .

Microbes have been trapped in an icy capsule cut off from the world beneath this glacier for more than 1.5 million years .
In the summer a gush of water dyed red from the iron compounds trapped with them manages to escape ( Image : Benjamin Urmston / Science ) Analysing DNA fragments from the “ blood falls ” has revealed that the bacteria survive on organic compounds trapped with them all those years ago that will eventually run out .
( Image : Ralph Maestas / Science )
A bacterial lost world trapped beneath Antarctic ice may help explain how life persisted during the “ snowball Earth ” period when almost all of the globe ’s surface was frozen over .
Advertisement
Isolated for at least 1.5 million years from close relatives that live in the ocean , the Antarctic microbes live in a super - salty lake sealed with a 400 - metre slab of ice , called Taylor Glacier .
But each summer , the temperature warms enough for a trickle of extremely cold water to flow to the surface .
Antarctic explorers and scientists noted the deep red colour left by these flows , created by iron in the water , and called them “ blood falls ” .
“ ‘ Wow ’ moment ”
“ When I came on the scene , I was definitely determined to see whether there was life associated with this feature or not , ” says Jill Mikucki , a geomicrobiologist at Dartmouth College in Hanover , New Hampshire , who led a new study into the blood falls .
Her team ’s first look at the water turned up bacterial DNA and living cells .
“ That was a ‘ wow ’ moment , when you could actually see the microbes , ” she says .
DNA sequence analysis suggested that most of the bacteria were related to marine microbes .
After proving that bacteria were living in the lake , Mikucki ’s team turned their attention to explaining just how life could flourish in such an inhospitable spot .
Hard life
During the Pliocene epoch plummeting sea levels isolated the lake from the ocean before falling global temperatures during concentrated its salt content through evaporation to several times that of the sea .
An advancing Taylor Glacier completed the lake ’s total isolation , leaving it sealed off from the world for the last 1.5 to 2 million years .
The bacteria inside are lodged nearly half a kilometre beneath a glacier , making photosynthesis impossible .
The sulphurous metabolic reactions that sustain bacteria in other ecosystems independent of the sun – for example , in deep - sea cold seeps – are not an option because the lake ’s abundant iron minerals would interfere , reacting with the sulphur to make the inert mineral iron pyrite .
Instead , the bacteria use the sulphur compounds as chemical catalysts to shuttle energy - bearing electrons from organic compounds in their icy prison to iron leached from bedrock surrounding the lake .
The organic feedstock was probably sealed in the lake when the bacteria were locked in by the Taylor Glacier , while the iron comes from surrounding rock .
It ’s a way of sustaining life believed to be unique .
“ Trust microbes to do something clever given an unusual niche , ” says Julia Foght , a microbiologist at the University of Alberta , Canada , who was not involved in the study .
Death sentence
With no other source of energy , the bacteria will eventually eat all of their food , says Ann Pearson , a team member at Harvard University .
“ This is eventually going to run down to nothing . ”
Mikucki ’s team has no way to know how long the bacteria will survive .
A similar situation may have occurred roughly 600 to 800 million years ago when snow caps extended to the tropics – perhaps even to the equator – during a period often referred to as “ snowball Earth ” .
Photosynthesis probably ground to a halt across the planet , and marine bacteria may have only managed to eke out a living in the same way as those living under Taylor Glacier , Pearson says .
“ Life in sea water , as we know it , could maintain reasonable continuity through an event like this . ”
Ron Ormeland , a microbiologist at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park , California , told New Scientist that this theory is reasonable , if somewhat speculative .
“ It is intriguing to extrapolate the data to the early Earth , ” he says .
“ That and whatever is in the rock record are the only bits of evidence we have . ”

First of all , what is a brand ?
A brand is a symbol .
Symbols are designs which represent something else , and a brand is meant to package all of the associations , experiences and characteristics into an abstract construct .
This construct can be evoked using consistent imagery , sounds , phrases and logos with which people come into contact .
Brands are very important as they help you win customers and they also help you to keep them .
They do this by awakening the associations and experiences you previously had with the brand , or have seen through advertising , when you come into contact with the brand at key stages .
For example , when deciding what product to purchase out of a selection of similar items .
Here are 9 tips to help you to build a brand with web design .
Brands set expectations , and when faced with uncertainty people tend to pick the safer option .
People know what to expect from a brand they know .
Branding is a complex process that is performed across all types of media , from product packaging , TV commercials and magazine ads to interior store decoration and logotype design .
Of course branding also applies to web design .
It does n’t matter if you ’re building a website for a multi-million dollar brand or a personal blog , branding still matters for the reasons outlined above .
In the case of a personal blog , branding will help set you apart and make your site memorable .
1. Color
The choice of a good color palette is very important in branding .
Color is n’t just aesthetics — it stimulates various emotions and carries with it subconscious associations to various things and characteristics .
For example , the color red may actually increase blood pressure , pulse and respiration .
It ’s a color that symbolizes passion , energy , power and excitement .
Because of this , it ’s usually a good color choice for brands in the entertainment industry .
Other colors carry different associations and effects .
Green symbolizes nature , environment , profit , money and health .
It ’s also a calming color , which is why hospitals usually paint their walls pale green .
When picking a color for your brand , research its effects and associations to see if it is an appropriate fit for the type of things your brand represents .
Also note that different cultures may associate the same colors with different things , so it ’s a good idea to check that your colors mean what you think they do in the markets you operate in .
Logitech use teal as the brand ’s main color .
Various shades of teal are used around their website , from background colors to headings and links :
2. Character
Does your brand have character ?
Infusing your brand with a little personality can help you define what it stands for .
Is the brand all about stability and safety so that your customers can be sure to rely on you ?
Is the brand fun and down to earth ?
Many people in commercialized societies use products and brands to define themselves , so shape your brand ’s character towards something which your audience will like to associate themselves with .
Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human qualities and characteristics to other things , like animals or objects .
Infusing your brand with anthropomorphic elements is a good way to give it character .
Think about the icon for the “ Finder ” application on Mac OS X .
It ’s a blue square with a distinctive smiling face drawn with a few black lines .
The program it represents is a file browser , but by giving it human characteristics the designers give it a soul .
Another great example is the Outlaw Design blog which sticks to a strong Wild West theme throughout the design with a unique mix of wooden textures and flat illustrations , branding itself very effectively :
Twitter ’s little blue bird mascot has proven very effective ; all of the custom media and websites that Twitter fans create usually feature their own variation of it .
They may all look a little different , but are still instantly recognizable :
3. Emotion
Emotion is another factor to consider when building your brand .
What feelings and emotions do you want people to experience when they visit your site ?
What sort of things do you want them to associate with your brand ?
Crafting the aesthetics of your site should n’t be about following the latest design trends , it should be about deciding on the emotions and ideas that you want your brand to project , and then working on a design that will do just that .
Studio 7
Designs uses vibrant colors and beautiful imagery to create a rich and exciting brand , which is very important for a design agency :
4. Consistency
To build a successful brand you need to make it memorable .
What do you do to make people remember things ?
You repeat them .
Consistency throughout your web design will build on the choices you ’ve made earlier regarding selecting the right personality for the brand and evoking the appropriate emotions .
Keep consistent colors , visuals and typography throughout to ensure your website projects a uniform image .
Skype consistently integrate several branding elements throughout all of their marketing media , which include the color palette with a dominant blue , white 2D clouds with illustrations sitting on top of them and multicolored rainbows :
5. Reusing code and visuals
Consistent visuals and layout allows you to reuse more of your content , be it stylesheets or images .
This means that your site will load faster as the user ’s browser does n’t need to download as many things — old images and CSS are already stored in its cache .
Apple.com integrates their logo with the navigation bar , infusing their brand into the page design :
6 . Size and position of the logo
The accepted norm when positioning your site ’s logo is to put it in the upper left area of the page .
That ’s the area where most people will look at to see what site they ’re on .
Additionally , it ’s best practice to link the logo image to the site ’s home page .
But position is only one element — size is also important .
Ensure your logo is big enough to be the second or third thing that people will notice when they arrive on your site .
UX Booth has a nice , large logo in the top left area of the page , which is one of the first things that you notice when you arrive at the site :
7. Value proposition
When a visitor arrives on your site for the first time they take the first few seconds to orient themselves .
Is this the right site ?
Does this look interesting ?
What is this all about ?
To answer these questions you should provide a clear and concise value proposition to your visitor .
This value proposition should be a short statement in a prominent location on your page .
It should preferably be located next to the site ’s logo so that when a new visitor reads the title of the site or business they ’ll follow on to the value proposition .
In a few words explain exactly what benefit your site provides to the visitor , so that they ’ll know not only what your site is about , but why they should keep using it .
Rob Sartain ’s Prime Cut Design has a great value proposition in the header of their site .
It ’s highly visible , concise , and clear ; and it covers both , the ‘ what ’ and the ‘ why ’ :
The ReportBox website features a clear value proposition underneath the logo and navigation .
The large font size ensures that it ’s one of the first things that you ’ll read :
8 . Tone of voice
The language you use on your website needs to reinforce your brand ’s character and personality .
If your brand is a friendly and down to earth , and your audience are young , tech savvy people , then informal and fun tone of voice may work well for you .
On the other hand , if you ’re making a website for an investment bank , the tone of voice should reflect that by being much more formal .
It ’s not just about what you say — it ’s about how you say it .
You can say the same thing in different voices and get the same meaning across , but the personality that this voice emanates will be different ; so choose a tone of voice that suits your brand ’s character and audience .
Matt , a simple web app that helps you use multiple Twitter accounts , features hand drawn illustrations and a friendly tone of voice , ideal for the young , tech savvy audience :
37signal ’s Basecamp website takes a more formal , yet simple and concise tone , focusing on their business audience :
9. Uniqueness
Getting all of the above elements will only get you so far though , because there is another very important thing to consider when building your brand : uniqueness .
If your website looks just like the competition , then is it really memorable ?
How would potential customers differentiate between the two ?
By putting in that extra effort to create a unique image you ’ll not only stand out from your competitors , you ’ll be more memorable , and that means a better chance that your visitors will come back for more .
Carbonica ’s website features many recycled paper textures , hand drawn fonts and cut - out style illustrations .
This earthy imagery helps promote the sustainable image that Carbonica strives for and is different enough to be memorable :
Conclusion
Building a strong brand is important not only for big corporations , but also for small companies and even personal websites and blogs .
Branding helps people differentiate between competition and quickly judge quality .
The web is an excellent platform to build your brand , so it ’s important not to ignore branding when working on your website .
Make sure to utilize all the various techniques to make it powerful and effective .

Press Release :
Paul Kasmin Gallery is pleased to announce the upcoming exhibition Andy Warhol Still - Life Polaroids , comprised of unique photographs of objects and arrangements taken by Andy Warhol between 1977 and 1983 .
This selection of 70 Polaroids will be on view at 511 West 27th Street .
Famous for his contributions to Pop Art , Warhol used photography as an integral part of his art making process .
He referred to his Polaroid Big Shot camera , which he purchased in 1970 , as his “ pencil and paper . ”
The Polaroid prints , instantaneously tangible records of the transitory , served as subjects for Warhol ’s drawings , silkscreens , and paintings .
Meticulous arrays of bananas , knives , and crosses contrast with jumbled assemblages of shoes and other commercial products , including Warhol ’s iconic soup cans and Brillo boxes .
Warhol often deploys multiplication and varying degrees of order to alter and enliven quotidian objects .
In other compositions , such as a single gray human heart presented on a vibrant red plate , individual subjects in the picture frame gain potency in isolation .
Recurrent themes of desire , consumption , and mortality run throughout .
The rarity of these works , coupled with the dwindling production of Polaroid film , dually capture a specific time in both Warhol ’s practice and the history of photography .

Only yesterday liberals stood back in awe of the mighty power and precision of conservative media .
In the 1990s , talk radio came into its own , rallying conservatives from coast to coast and hammering the Clinton White House for sins real ( Monica Lewinsky ) , imagined ( Vince Foster ’s “ murder ” ) , and sundry places in between ( Paula Jones et al . ) .
Then along came Fox News .
For conservatives ,
Fox was n’t just the antidote to a media environment they viewed as poisonously liberal , it was a staging area .
With a network essentially at their disposal , Republican leaders could launch communications strategies and conservative activists could unleash attacks on the opposition from a secure base .
With the White House and Republican National Committee dispensing the talking points , no one on the Right or Left questioned whether talk radio and Fox were assets to the Republican cause :
Their strategic value in disseminating a consistent message was obvious .
That was then .
Since 2006 , Republican leaders have ceded vast tracts of electoral terrain to the Democrats .
Since November , they have compounded that loss , ceding the airwaves of talk radio and Fox News to a cavalcade of entertainers , ideologues , and back benchers who probably could n’t be more damaging to Republican prospects if they were an android army under the command of David Axelrod .
The problem goes well beyond Rush Limbaugh .
The recent “ tea parties , ” which senior Republican leaders generally avoided , were organized by media personalities in the hunt for ratings , not Republican operatives in the hunt for political leverage .
Of course , it ’s possible that Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell , who failed to make time for tea , is a clueless dolt and the guy who was holding up the picture of Obama with a Hitler mustache is a political genius .
But I ’m guessing otherwise .
Similarly , Republican leaders largely failed to join in the premature denunciations of Obama as a lily - livered weakling over the Somali pirate affair .
Instead , Fox ’s Glenn
Beck led the charge , transforming the saga of three Somali teenagers and an American captain bobbing at sea into the second coming of the Cuban Missile Crisis .
This , Beck told his audience , was “ a critical test ” of Obama ’s presidency , a national security crucible of such high stakes that the White House simply must prevail .
By the time the scrawny pirates were dead , and the captain rescued , Beck and his cohorts had handed Obama a major “ military ” victory , quite a prize to fashion from a soggy hostage - taking on the other side of the world .
Along the way , GOP strategists lost a battle they never even waged .
Throughout the Bush years , the conservative media gang was more than simpatico to Republicans ; it was a political workhorse .
Now , in the wake of November ’s defeat , the GOP has lost the reins .
Conservative media , driven by the corporate appetite for ratings and the egos of television stars , has become a showhorse .
Because of the fractured Republican leadership , however , the showhorse is setting the agenda .
I did a double take reading this Wall Street Journal news story ( paywall ) on “ Republican reactions ” to Obama ’s plan to cap salaries at companies receiving TARP funds .
The first “ Republican leader ” quoted in the story was Fox host Sean Hannity .
Comments from House Minority Leader John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader McConnell followed .
In addition to promoting themselves as conservative leaders , Hannity , Limbaugh , Beck and their imitators have given public platforms to zesty stars like Michele Bachmann , a previously obscure Republican congresswoman whose sunny ramblings on conspiracy theories and such have made her a YouTube hit for all the wrong reasons .
Every time Bachmann gets a television booking , somewhere a Republican strategist gets a migraine .
Political parties lose elections .
Then they regroup , retool , and fight their way back to power .
Sooner or later , the clouds will break and the GOP will figure out how to do battle in the era of Obama .
If only their friends in conservative media will let them .

Rep. Michelle Bachmann called it an “ interesting coincidence ” that the United States is dealing with another outbreak of the swine flu , because , according to her the last one occurred under a Democratic president , which it did n’t unless Gerald Ford was a Democrat .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Like any good conspiracy theorist Bachmann points out that she is not blaming President Obama , “ I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under Democrat President Jimmy Carter .
And I ’m not blaming this on President Obama , I just think it is an interesting coincidence . ”
( In other words , she ’s not saying Obama ’s behind it , but we only seem to get swine flu when Democrats are in charge ) .

The last time that I wrote something about Michelle Bachmann it was raining , and as I write this now it is also raining .
Now , I am not saying that Michelle Bachmann controls the weather .
I just find it to be an interesting coincidence that it rains when I write about her .
This is the kind of logic that Bachmann is using .
The only problem is that she does n’t have her facts straight .
The last outbreak of swine flu occurred in 1976 , when Gerald Ford , a Republican , was president , which means that there are no correlations between the party that controls the White House and the swine flu .
You would think that the people of Bachmann ’s district would be so embarrassed by her that they would never reelect her , but they did .
It makes me wonder what kind of people live in the 6th District in Minnesota ?
Are they even aware of what their representative is saying ?
It is fitting that on the same day in which Arlen Specter left the GOP , Bachmann comes out with this .
If Specter was an example of the old Republican Party , then Bachmann is the face of the new GOP .
Microsoft is adding Netflix to the list of content providers in its Windows Media Center feature for Vista PCs as part of the company 's drive to give people more entertainment options on their computers .
Microsoft already has a deal to deliver movies from Netflix through its Xbox game console , but people can only play back movies that are available for instant streaming on that platform .
The Netflix application in Windows Media Center allows people not only to instantly stream movies that are available that way , but also to manage their own physical disc queue for DVDs they receive from Netflix in the mail , said Ben Reed , senior product marketing manager at Microsoft .
Like Netflix 's " Watch Instantly " application -- which allows people to watch titles available for streaming from Netflix via a Web browser -- the Windows Media player application uses Silverlight to deliver the video .
People with a Netflix account have access to more than 12,000 videos on demand via the Netflix application in Windows Media Player in Vista ; they also can manage their physical disc queue , which gives them access to 100,000 titles , Reed said .
However , they can't view those instantly :
They still have to receive physical DVDs in the mail to watch those titles .
Windows Media Center used to be a distinct version of Windows , but Microsoft made it a feature in premium versions of the OS when it released Vista .
This was part of an overall move to add more multimedia - delivery capabilities to PCs .
Delivering entertainment on PCs -- an increasingly popular way for people to watch content -- is also a way for Microsoft to deliver advertising and further monetize the platform .
Windows Media Center also will be built into Windows 7 , with new features to make it even easier for people to find entertainment they want to watch , Reed said .
One of those is a guide for both Internet TV channels and broadcast channels , differentiating between the two by displaying them in different ways in the guide .
Microsoft also has added a " Turboscroll " feature to Windows Media Center in Windows 7 , which makes it far faster for people to scroll through and find specific entertainment content they 're looking for , Reed said .
Microsoft has said it plans to make Windows 7 available in time for the holiday shopping season , which is typically the end of November and December .
Reed would not comment on whether the Netflix application would be available in Windows 7 .

1. Exaggerating the threat .
An Afghan army foot patrol was attacked by guerrillas in Helmand Province on Wednesday , according to AP .
US and Afghan soldiers responded , engaging in a firefight .
Then the US military called in an air strike on the Taliban , killing 20 of them .
On Tuesday , a similar airstrike had taken out 30 guerrillas .
It is this sort of thing that makes me wonder why the Taliban ( or whoever these guys in Helmand were ) are considered such a big threat that the full might of NATO is needed to deal with them .
They have no air force , no artillery , no tanks .
They are just small bands , apparently operating in platoons , who , whenever they mass in large enough numbers to stand and fight , can just be turned into red mist from the air .
2 . The US has actually only managed to install a fundamentalist government in Afghanistan , which is rolling back rights of women and prosecuting blasphemy cases .
In a play for the Shiite vote ( 22 % or so of the population ) , President Hamid Karzai put through civilly legislated Shiite personal status law , which affects Shiite women in that country .
The wife will need the husband ’s permission to go out of the house , and ca n’t refuse a demand for sex .
( Since the 1990s there has been a movement in 50 or more countries to abandon the idea that spouses cannot rape one another , though admittedly this idea is new and was rejected in US law until recently ) .
No one seems to have noted that the Shiite regime in Baghdad is more or less doing the same thing .
In Iraq , the US switched out the secular Baath Party for Shiite fundamentalist parties .
Everyone keeps saying the US improved the status of women in both countries .
Actually , in Iraq the US invasion set women back about 30 years .
In Afghanistan , the socialist government of the 1980s , for all its brutality in other spheres , did implement policies substantially improving women ’s rights , including aiming at universal education , making a place for them in the professions , and so forth .
There were socialist Afghan women soldiers fighting the Muslim fundamentalist guerrillas that Reagan called “ freedom fighters ” and to whom he gave billions to turn the country into a conservative theocracy .
I can never get American audiences to concede that Afghan women had it way better in the 1980s , and that it has been downhill ever since , mainly because of US favoritism toward patriarchal and anti-progressive forces .
3 . The US is building a mass of hardened bases costing over $ 1 bn. in Afghanistan .
That ’s about the annual budget of the Afghanistan government .
4 . It begins .
The US is creating local militias in Wardak called the Afghan Public Protection Force .
You wonder how long it will be before the Karzai government is engaged in firefights with them ( cf. Fadl in Baghdad earlier this week ) .
5 . Now thousands of private security contractors ( i.e. mercenaries ) will be hired in Afghanistan .
But they wo n’t be Americans for the most part .
Children , can you say “ Hessians ” ?
I do n’t understand the concept of paying someone $ 200,000 a year to guard armed GIs being paid a fraction of that .
Would n’t it be better to expand the size of the army if you need more troops ?
Would n’t it be more efficient to have one line of command ?
Are n’t these essentially high - priced MPs ?
6 . The secretary of defense is predicting that the US military will be in Afghanistan indefinitely and will only achieve limited goals there . (!)
I ask myself , “ why ? ”
7 . An attempt by officials in the Obama administration to replace Guantanamo with Bagram in Afghanistan has been shot down by a Federal judge .
The government actually argued that the three men ( 2 Yemenis and a Tunisian ) did not have habaeus corpus rights because they are in a war zone .
Why are they in a war zone ?
Because the US government transported them there !
8 . The president is corralling a coalition of the reluctant for troop contributions in Afghanistan .
9 . While militaries spend tens of billions on fighting disgruntled Pashtun tribesmen , a fifth of pregnant women or women with newborns are malnourished in Afghanistan .
In Iraq , as well , public health crises took a back seat while hundreds of billions were spent on weapons and warfare .
10 . A new Friedman unit .
It was always the “ next six months ” that would be “ crucial ” for Iraq .
It is now “ this year ” that is crucial for Afghanistan .
By the math of Friedman units , does this mean the Afghanistan occupation will last twice as long as the Iraq one ?

I Hate My Life – White Tigers Are NOT Natural
By Paige
Would you inbreed for a change of color ?
As we are doing our research for this website , we have come to realize the sad fact that even the kings of the animal world can be subject to animal abuse .
Playing With Mother Nature
These images really need no more words , they speak volumes .
However the artist who drew the image below really knows her stuff and goes on to give an in - depth explanation about why white tigers are really sad business .
“ The white gene is a double - recessive one caused mostly by inbreeding ( in a natural mating , there is only a one in 10,000 chance that a tiger will be white ) , which is why they say that it exists ‘ only in captivity ’ .
Zoos are not willing to wait for this one in 10,000 miracle tiger , and so find that the only other way to produce them is through inbreeding . ”
Wrong On So Many Levels
This is just an excerpt from the page , she goes into very specific detail about the problems associated with this type of breeding and it ’s effects on conservation efforts for tiger species .
( White tigers are n’t protected because their bloodlines are such a mishmash of species and genetics ) .
In fact , their breeding is discouraged and only done by zoos and circuses looking to attract more visitors .
Do it For The Tigers
We certainly hope that the drawing and image above is reason enough to make you avoid zoos that continue unhealthy breeding practices .
Inbred animals live a sad life of confusion and pain .
In short , their whole life is abuse .
Boycott zoos with white tigers .
In fact , we are well on the way to telling you to boycott zoos altogether .

The charity has a chain of more than 130 books - only shops Donations to Oxfam 's network of 714 UK shops have fallen by 12 % so far this year - the first drop in eight years .
The charity said the recession meant families bought less , replaced less and therefore had less to give away .
Furniture donations fell by 13 % , crockery , china and glass by 7 % , and clothes would have dipped 8 % if Marks & Spencer had not provided 900,000 items .
It comes after research showed a rise in the number of people cancelling direct debits to charities .
Average monthly cancellations rose from 3.32 % in 2007/08 to 4.64 % in 2008/09 , said Rapidata , which handles payments for charities .
Oxfam , which relies on donations for 80 % of its income , said 2009 could see a total fall of 1.2 million items donated .
Director of trading , David McCullough , said : " We ca n't sell fresh air ... without continued donations of everything from clothing to cookware , Oxfam shops could not continue to play such a key role in communities across the UK . "
The fall in donations also varied by region , Oxfam said .
Our fear is not about customers coming in but whether we keep getting the donations through , which is our life blood
Thomas Brindle
Oxfam manager , Nottingham Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire were among the areas with the biggest falls , while shops in Tyneside and South Wales were among the least affected .
Caroline Jackson , who manages 24 shops in Nottingham and Lincolnshire , said donations of furniture , bric - a - brac and vinyl records were all badly hit .
" Music is down about 15 % across the board .
It accounts for about 8 % of all sales , but you can get valuable stuff , " she told the BBC .
" Vinyl is one of the things that brings people in to the shops ... but people are selling it at car boots and on eBay . "
She said furniture donations were down by half because people were not moving house , and bric - a - brac had shrunk by between 25 % and 35 % .
The charity said demand nationally remained high - at the same level as last year - with sales up 5 % on 2008 .
AREAS WITH BIGGEST FALLS North Yorkshire North London Nottinghamshire Devon and Cornwall Source : Oxfam Thomas Brindle , manager of a newly - opened Oxfam bookshop in Nottingham , said : " Our fear is not about customers coming in but whether we keep getting the donations through , which is our life blood . "
Oxfam has a chain of 130 bookshops and plans to open more fashion boutiques across England , Scotland and Wales .
It has been running a successful clothes exchange programme with high street retailer Marks & Spencer for a year .
The last time donations fell was in the economic downturn of 1999 / 2000 .
Mr McCullough said last year 's £ 20 m profit could fund a year 's work in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Tanzania , Uganda , Ethiopia and Somalia .
" They of course rely on the generosity of the public for their stock , " he added .
" The effects of the credit crunch are being felt all over the world - whether it's on the high street in the UK or rising food prices across Africa , few are left untouched . "

The problem is more widespread than you might think :
First lofted into orbit in the 1970s , the FLTSATCOM bird was at the time a major advance in military communications .
Their 23 channels were used by every branch of the U.S. armed forces and the White House for encrypted data and voice , typically from portable ground units that could be quickly unpacked and put to use on the battlefield .
As the original FLTSAT constellation of four satellites fell out of service , the Navy launched a more advanced UFO satellite ( for Ultra High Frequency Follow - On ) to replace them .
Today , there are two FLTSAT and eight UFO birds in geosynchronous orbit .
Navy contractors are working on a next - generation system called Mobile User Objective System beginning in September 2009 .
Until then , the military is still using aging FLTSAT and UFO satellites — and so are a lot of Brazilians .
While the technology on the transponders still dates from the 1970s , radio sets back on Earth have only improved and plummeted in cost — opening a cheap , efficient and illegal backdoor .
To use the satellite , pirates typically take an ordinary ham radio transmitter , which operates in the 144 - to 148 - MHZ range , and add a frequency doubler cobbled from coils and a varactor diode .
That lets the radio stretch into the lower end of FLTSATCOM ’s 292 - to 317 - MHz uplink range .
All the gear can be bought near any truck stop for less than $ 500 .
Ads on specialized websites offer to perform the conversion for less than $ 100 .

Jim Balsillie expanded his own personal NHL power play Friday , announcing a pair of corporate sponsors were on board for his bid to bring the Phoenix Coyotes to southern Ontario .
The BlackBerry billionaire unveiled his expanded makeitseven.ca website , bringing Labatt Breweries and Home Hardware into the fold as his first two " anchor corporate partners . "
" What began as a grassroots movement to support bringing a seventh NHL club to Canada is now attaining critical mass , with these two iconic Canadian brands proudly joining the effort , " Balsillie said in a statement .
Balsillie said more than 120,000 Canadians have logged onto his site to show their support for his bid to bring a seventh NHL franchise to Canada .
The co-CEO of Research In Motion has made a $ 212.5 - million US bid for the financially ailing Phoenix Coyotes , an offer conditional on moving the franchise to southern Ontario .
A Phoenix bankruptcy judge will hear arguments Tuesday over who is currently in control of the Coyotes — majority owner Jerry Moyes , who favours the Balsillie bid , or the league , which argues Moyes signed over control to the NHL in exchange for money advanced to the franchise .
Outside the court , Balsillie said he now has a couple of corporate heavyweights on his side .
" Labatt has a long history of supporting grassroots hockey in Canada , " Charlie Angelakos , vice - president of corporate affairs for Labatt Breweries of Canada , said in a statement issued by the Balsillie group .
" Like many Canadians , we love NHL hockey and we want more of it here .
Let 's get behind Make it Seven and let 's make it happen . "
" A new franchise will be a source of pride for all Canadians and we are excited by the possibility of creating more opportunities for Canada 's best players to play on their home ice , in front of hometown fans , " added Paul Straus , vice - president and CEO of Home Hardware Stores Limited .
The website also features Make it Seven clothing for sale , with net proceeds donated to minor hockey programs .
I fire up my trusty RSS reader at least once a week to catch up with the atheist blogosphere .
Every time I do , I can count on finding at least a few stories in either the mainstream news media or various theist - generated sources claiming that atheism is a religion or that atheism requires as much faith as any religion .
While easily dismissed , the frequency of such claims is starting to irritate me .
Magic in the Garden
I am about to tell you something I have never told anyone .
My next - door neighbor has a small garden gnome of the sort you 've probably seen before .
The thing is , my neighbor 's gnome comes to life for one evening a month , always on the twelfth day of the month , between 8:00 and 11:00 pm .
The gnome explores the yard and has even climbed the fence to come into my yard .
I know this not because my neighbor told me but because I have personally experienced it .
I asked my neighbor about it once , and he looked at me like I was crazy .
But I 've seen the gnome spring to life many times , and I 'm confident I was awake , not intoxicated , and of sound mind .
Thus , I have no question that the gnome is real .
Do you believe that my neighbor 's gnome springs to life on a regular schedule as I have described ?
No ?
Well , I suppose you are entitled to your opinion .
But how can you know for sure ?
Is n't it at least possible that what I am describing is real ?
To doubt that my neighbor 's gnome is real requires as much faith as is needed for someone else to believe that it is real .
Deconstructing Belief
The mistake is fairly obvious , is n't it ?
When I assert that the gnome is real , I am making a claim .
I am asking you to accept my claim with no evidence whatsoever .
That is , I am asking you to take it on faith that the gnome is real .
When you refuse to accept my claim , you do not need to offer a counter claim that you are 100 % certain that my neighbor 's gnome does not behave as I describe it or that other gnomes could never do the same .
You are rejecting my claim because I have not come close to meeting my evidentiary burden , right ?
Your rejection of my claim requires no faith .
Rejecting my claim is precisely what the rational person must do because I have offered no evidence to support it .
To insist that faith is required for one to reject claims about my neighbor 's gnome , unicorns , fairies , Santa Claus , angels , or gods misses the mark completely .
The individual who refuses to accept such claims need not offer any sort of claim of his or her own .
All he or she is doing is pointing out that the evidentiary burden has not been met .
If we refer to the belief that garden gnomes routinely spring to life as " gnomism , " then " agnomism " refers simply to the lack of " gnomist " belief .
An " agnomist " is one who does not accept the " gnomist " claim that garden gnomes routinely spring to life , etc .
No faith is required , and insisting that " agnomism " must be a religion is absurd unless you really want to argue that we are all " agnomists . "
Atheism is no different .
An atheist is someone who does not accept the theistic claim ( i.e. , a god or gods exist ) .
Like the " agnomist , " the atheist requires no faith because he or she is not offering any sort of belief claim .
In fact , it is precisely the tendency to seek evidence rather than to rely on faith that typically leads one to atheism .
Postscript
I recognize language evolves and that dictionary definitions change over time to reflect the usage of words in addition to their classic derivation .
If you look up atheism in a dictionary , you may find something about atheism involving active disbelief or even positive assertions that gods certainly do not or cannot exist .
Most atheists refer to this as " strong atheism " and do not consider it synonymous with atheism .
This was not part of the original definition of atheism , but it appears in some dictionaries now because usage of the word has changed .
I use the word atheist in the classic sense and with the original meaning because I believe this is far more accurate .

It s going to be a real disaster
The current administrations economic strategy will create an unmitigated disaster  not only our countrys worst financial calamity , but the greatest economic disaster in recorded history .
I first warned my readers about what was happening last December , in a letter titled The End of America :
 The coming great inflation will destroy Americas economic leadership .
It will lead  eventually  to the return of settling international obligations in gold instead of paper dollars .
And this will happen much faster than anyone expects .
 By the time Obama leaves office , you will not be able to exchange dollars for any sound currency in the world without permission from the U.S. government .
The price of gold will be well over $ 2,500 per ounce .
Most importantly , commodities will no longer be priced in dollars either , but instead in the currencies of the leading producer .
Americans havent experienced anything like this since the Great Depression . 
Since I wrote that first warning , I have become much more concerned and much more afraid .
What the president has done is actually worse  much worse  than even the dire scenario I had envisioned .
Not only is the administration planning on enormous deficit spending this year , but the current plan calls for increasing deficit spending for the next decade  spending that will more than double our entire national debt during his presidency .
The Congressional Budget Office produced the following graphic , which compares the deficits of the 1980s and 1990s to the current and future budgets .
Assuming Obama remains in power over the next eight years and assuming these deficits arent actually much larger ( which almost always happens ) , the Congressional Budget office estimates the presidents budget will add more than $ 10 trillion to the total federal debt by 2019  approximately as much total debt as was outstanding at the beginning of 2007 .
Obama plans to borrow more money over the next eight years than all of the other presidents  combined .
It s very hard to put this in perspective .
The numbers have become so large they re almost meaningless .
 Twenty trillion has 13 zeros : $ 20,000,000,000,000 .
Nobody can think about a number that large .
But consider this In 1980 , the entire federal debt totaled $ 930 million .
Assuming were paying 5 % on our debt in 2019 , we will spend more money on interest than our entire national debt of 1980 .
This level of debt is going to be a huge problem because no one will want to pay the money back  ever .
And it cant be financed forever .
The poor will blame the rich .
The rich will leave and take their wealth offshore .
And absolute chaos will follow .
The dollar will be completely destroyed .
Now I know you re thinking ,  Ive heard all of this before .
But the end of the world somehow doesnt happen .
We find a way out . 
Not this time .
In fact , when I wrote last year that the dollar would cease to be the worlds reserve currency much faster than anyone expects , I m sure no one took me seriously .
But since then , weve heard two of the worlds leading powers  China and Russia  both openly suggesting a new world reserve currency must be created .
Putin is even talking about using gold to settle international trade .
It will happen because no one will want to be a creditor to the United States .
As more and more people try to get out of the dollar , the government will be forced to forbid the free exchange of dollars into other currencies  and perhaps even to forbid the purchase of gold bullion .
This will happen .
I guarantee it .
And it will happen during the Obama administration .
That s why its critical for you to take precautions now , while you still can .
The first thing you should do , if you havent yet , is buy gold bullion .
It s easy :
You just call a few coin dealers , find out who offers the lowest premium on bullion , and wire them the money .
Once you have the coins , they re easy to hide , easy to store , and easy to transport .
Theres no law ( yet ) saying you cant take bullion out of the country .
If things start moving that way , you should have enough time to get the bullion out before the law passes .
If not well you can clip your coins easily and use the gold to pay for whatever you might need .
I also believe you should immediately buy gold stocks .
In fact , I m convinced youll never have a chance to buy gold stocks this cheaply again Gold stocks have never been cheaper compared to the price of gold itself .
This is an amazing , once - in - a - lifetime opportunity .
I truly hope youll capitalize on it .
The second thing you should do is move as large a percentage of your financial assets as possible out of the country .
Unfortunately , I dont know enough about this yet to offer any good advice .
I m working on it .
And the third thing you ought to do is to build a stimulus package for yourself .
I realize its paradoxical .
But the coming crisis will make lots of people rich .
It s not hard to generate a paper fortune in a huge inflation .
All you have to do is own the most important economic assets : energy , communication , and transportation .
Thing to do right now is buy the assets you know the government has to have for the economy to function .
These assets will remain in private hands , and their values will increase the most .
I can tell you what happens to countries that go bankrupt .
Ive been to Argentina .
Im familiar with the history of Mexico and Great Britain .
Well see the same things here , shortly : inflation , huge tax increases , capital flight and , eventually , capital controls .
It will probably take decades for Americans to realize socialism doesnt work .
But that clarity might not happen during my lifetime .
And I dont want my assets to be stuck inside a banana republic in the midst of a huge socialist experiment .
Im graveyard serious :
If you do not take precautions and prepare yourself and your family for the inevitable collapse of our currency , you will suffer incredibly over the next decade .

There are circumstances under which the police might need to use reasonable force to subdue political demonstrations that turn violent .
But what is so damning about the video footage that has emerged from last week 's G20 protests in London is that there is nothing in the slightest bit reasonable about the force that was used against Ian Tomlinson .
Mr Tomlinson was plainly walking away from riot officers when he was struck .
It is impossible to say for certain that this assault by a baton - wielding riot officer brought on Mr Tomlinson 's heart attack only a few minutes later .
But most people will find it impossible to disconnect the two events .
It would , of course , be foolish to second guess every decision made by police officers in the heat of such an engagement .
But that cannot mean that anything goes .
This incident looks like a serious breakdown in discipline .
It also serves to underline broader concerns voiced about the police tactics at last week 's demonstration .
Officers corralled protesters into separate enclosed areas and then forcibly dispersed them .
It was in just such a " kettling " operation that Mr Tomlinson was assaulted .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Almost as disturbing as the assault itself was the misleading response of the police when they were first probed on the incident .
They made no mention of contact between Mr Tomlinson and their officers before he collapsed and briefed that other protesters had impeded police medics in their efforts to help him .
It was only when this new footage emerged that the police admitted they might have a case to answer .
As for their attempts to present their involvement as merely shielding Mr Tomlinson from an angry mob , this was reminiscent of the false information circulated in the wake of the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in London in 2005 .
The public were told on that occasion that Mr Menezes ' behaviour and clothing had given them cause for suspicion .
These lies were exposed by CCTV footage from Stockwell Underground station , just as the police 's account this week has crumbled in the light of these latest images .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an inquiry into the apparent assault on Mr Tomlinson and will decide whether charges should be brought against officers .
But this terrible case reflects deeper problems in the police , the most glaring of which is an entrenched culture of unaccountability .
No police officer has been convicted of a firearms offence in 15 years , despite the deaths of 30 individuals , many of whom were unarmed .
Rather than learning from this poor record , the police have relaxed their guidelines for firearms officers .
New rules of engagement were introduced several years ago ( without a sniff of public consultation or parliamentary debate ) allowing the police to shoot suspected suicide bombers without issuing a warning or identifying themselves .
This unaccountability is accompanied by reflexive secrecy .
Revelations of incompetence , such as the bungled investigation into the murderer Robert Napper , are invariably met with a closing of ranks .
If individuals are disciplined for their failings , we do not hear about it .
Deficient leadership is , of course , responsible for these ills .
The Metropolitan Police force was politicised by its previous commissioner , Sir Ian Blair .
We await an answer to the question of whether his successor , Sir Paul Stephenson , will prove a reforming commissioner .
It is hard to see much impetus for change coming from the Government .
Indeed , ministers seem determined to see the powers of the police grow , rather than diminish .
A law potentially making it illegal for a member of the public to photograph a police officer came into force earlier this year .
The person who took this video of Mr Tomlinson being attacked could , in a ghastly irony , be prosecuted themselves .
But the answer to the lack of police accountability , in the end , does have to be political .
The London Mayor , Boris Johnson , showed that he is prepared to stand up to the powerful policing lobby when he demanded the resignation of Sir Ian last year .
It is vital that Mr Johnson uses the powers available to him to bring the nation 's principal force under control .
And whichever party forms the next government should make police reform on a national level a priority .
The police are right to point out they do a difficult job .
But this complaint misses the point .
The days when officers could rely on the unquestioning trust and respect of the public are over .
There has been too much misconduct , dissembling and secrecy over the years .
Only an injection of accountability and wholesale reform can restore faith in those charged with delivering our safety .
Jan 14 , 2004 ( CIDRAP News ) –
One of the worst fears of infectious disease experts is that the H5N1 avian influenza virus now circulating in parts of Asia will combine with a human - adapted flu virus to create a deadly new flu virus that could spread around the world .
That could happen , scientists predict , if someone who is already infected with an ordinary flu virus contracts the avian virus at the same time .
The avian virus has already caused at least 48 confirmed human illness cases in Asia , of which 35 have been fatal .
The virus has shown little ability to spread from person to person , but the fear is that a hybrid could combine the killing power of the avian virus with the transmissibility of human flu viruses .
Now , rather than waiting to see if nature spawns such a hybrid , US scientists are planning to try to breed one themselves — in the name of preparedness .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) will soon launch experiments designed to combine the H5N1 virus and human flu viruses and then see how the resulting hybrids affect animals .
The goal is to assess the chances that such a " reassortant " virus will emerge and how dangerous it might be .
CDC officials confirmed the plans for the research as described recently in media reports , particularly in a Canadian Press ( CP ) story .
Two ways to make hybrids
The plans call for trying two methods to create hybrid viruses , CDC spokesman David Daigle told CIDRAP
News via e-mail .
One is to infect cells in a laboratory tissue culture with H5N1 and human flu viruses at the same time and then watch to see if they mix .
For the human virus , investigators will use A ( H3N2 ) , the strain that has caused most human flu cases in recent years , according to the CP report .
The other method is reverse genetics — assembling a new virus with sets of genes from the H5N1 and H3N2 viruses .
Reverse genetics has already been used to create H5N1 candidate vaccines in several laboratories , according to Daigle .
The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) said recently it would soon launch a clinical trial of one of those vaccines .
Of the two methods , the co-infection approach was described as slower and more laborious , though closer to what happens in nature .
Any viable viruses that emerge from these processes will be seeded into animals that are considered good models for testing how flu viruses behave in humans , according to Daigle .
The aim will be to observe whether the animals get sick and whether infected animals can infect others .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has been " pleading " for laboratories to do this research , because it could provide some evidence to back up the agency 's warnings about the risk of a flu pandemic , according to the CP report .
Klaus Stohr , head of the WHO 's global influenza program , was quoted as saying that if none of the hybrids caused disease , the agency might be inclined to dial down its level of concern .
But if the experiments produce highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses , the agency will be more worried , he said .
Safety precautions
Because of the obvious risks in creating viruses with the potential to spark a pandemic , the work will be done in a biosafety level 3 ( BSL - 3 ) laboratory at the CDC in Atlanta , Daigle told CIDRAP News .
" We recognize that there is concern by some over this type of work .
This concern may be heightened by reports of recent lab exposures in other lab facilities , " he said .
" But CDC has an incredible record in lab safety and is taking very strict precautions . "
Daigle said the US Department of Agriculture requires that highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ) viruses be treated as " Select Agents " and that research on them must be done in BSL - 3 labs with " enhancements . "
These include " special provisions to protect both laboratory workers and the environment . "
BSL - 3 is the second highest level of laboratory biosecurity .
It is used for work with pathogens that may cause serious or potentially lethal disease if inhaled , such as tuberculosis or St. Louis encephalitis , according to the CDC .
CDC experiments with HPAI viruses have to pass reviews by the agency 's Institutional Biosafety Committee and Animal Care and Use Committee , Daigle said .
The facilities involved are inspected by the USDA and the CDC's Office of Safety and Health , and staff members who work with Select Agents require special clearance .
It 's been done before
The upcoming experiments will not break entirely new ground for the CDC , the CP story revealed .
The agency already has made hybrid viruses with H5N1 samples isolated from patients in Hong Kong in 1997 , when the virus first caused human disease .
The results of that research have not yet been published , and the CDC has said little about them .
In the CP report , Dr. Nancy Cox , head of the CDC 's influenza branch , commented only , " Some gene combinations could be produced and others could not . "
Daigle added little to that .
He said , " The reassortment work with the 1997 isolate was intermittently interrupted with SARS [ severe acute respiratory syndrome ] and then the 2004 H5N1 outbreak .
We are currently concentrating our efforts on understanding the pathogenicity of the 2004 strains ( non-reassortants ) in mammalian models . "
He said the CDC hopes to prepare a report on that research " in the near future . "

Swimming pools , tennis courts , piles of manure , lawnmowers : what have n't we paid for ?
No wonder MPs are so reluctant to cut taxes .
How could we afford them if they did ?
Should I want to vote Conservative at the election – and stranger things have happened – I should need to vote for Sir Alan Haselhurst , who finishes off a fine left and right for the Commons by also being its deputy speaker .
Sir Alan has spent £ 12,000 on a gardener , something no doubt imperative for the successful commission of his parliamentary duties .
How should I , and the other electors of the Saffron Walden division , regard him when – or if – he offers himself next time ?
It 's a devil of a job to get staff in the country , so perhaps if his chap finishes early one day he might nip round and tidy up some of Mrs Heffer 's flower beds for us ?
After all , we have paid his wages .
And perhaps Sir Alan might like to help out with our mortgage , too ?
He does n't have one , and yet has claimed £ 142,000 on his property in the past eight years .
I doubt I will be the only one hoping for a dividend from this massive investment we have funded – not that that would inspire us to vote for him even then .
A fire started at Centrepoint tower in Sydney 's CBD this morning , sending thick plumes of smoke over the city skyline .
The blaze started when construction workers accidentally set alight a cooling tower on the podium level of Westfield Centrepoint shopping centre , one level below the tower .
The fire started at 8.29 am and was put out about 8.50 am , a NSW Fire Brigades spokesman said .
Let 's look beyond the current financial crisis for a moment .
Let 's think not about the long run , but the foreseeable medium run in which we are , for the most part , still alive .
For the foreseeable future , China alone will , on net , be buying more than $ 300 billion a year in dollar - denominated assets .
But that is just the tip of the foreign - exchange iceberg .
Governments worldwide now hold more than $ 5 trillion of dollar - denominated assets as their foreign - exchange reserves .
The big fear used to be that they — or a substantial fraction of them — would try to dump their dollar - denominated foreign - exchange reserves , causing a collapse of the dollar , the bankruptcy of Wall Street , and a major depression .
We have already experienced the bankruptcy of Wall Street without the collapse of the dollar ( or , so far , a major depression ) .
Foreign governments now have a greater incentive to prevent a collapse of the dollar than does the government of the United States .
As Nixon 's treasury secretary , John Connolly , told the world in a previous era , " The dollar is our currency , but it is your problem . "
Although the dollar will surely lose value in the future , it is unlikely to collapse , so the value of foreign governments ' foreign - exchange reserves will continue to grow .
After this financial crisis and recession are over , what will these governments do with all their foreign - exchange reserves ?
Interest rates on U.S. Treasurys are likely to stay quite low — a percentage point or so above inflation — for a long time to come .
Returns on stock investments , by contrast , are likely to be as high as in the glory days of the 1980s and 1990s .
The long - run stock - market - return regressions of John Campbell and Robert Shiller predict stock - market returns of 10 percent per year plus inflation , or more .
If foreign governments leave their enormous reserves in U.S. Treasurys and similarly safe assets , they will be presenting the U.S. taxpayer with an enormous financial gift : extremely cheap financing for the U.S. government as it borrows , while the high - return investments in U.S. corporate securities are left to fatten the portfolios of American investors .
Because governments , like people , do not like leaving a fortune on the table , they are unlikely to follow this course .
The next generation , therefore , will see a very interesting dance .
Call it reverse finance colonialism ?
Call it something .
Foreign governments will be seeking high - return assets for their enormous portfolios without selling dollar - denominated wealth .
Consequently , they will have to focus on U.S. corporate securities .
With such large - scale investment comes ownership and with ownership comes control .
No government will want to play the role of passive investor , with the attendant risk that its partners will tunnel the wealth out from under its grasp , leaving an empty corporate shell .
So what is likely to come to pass is not the socialism feared by the Right — at least not ownership of the means of production by the U.S. government .
Instead , it will be ownership of U.S. companies by foreign governments — and on a scale we ’ve never before seen .
Can anything stop this progression ?
Yes .
A collapse of world economic growth — which would create a very dangerous and angry world .
Or a sudden return to thrift on the part of American consumers — so that we can finance the industrialization of the rest of the world rather than having them finance our consumption .
But neither is likely .
That will leave Americans confronting a new and unprecedented phase of globalization .
Government agencies in Beijing , Dubai , and Brazilia will have a large financial interest in everything from the health - care policies of American factories to the compensation packages of corporate executives and the apportionment of seats on corporate boards .
And their interest will matter :
They will , after all , be the people who have the money — just as Americans were the people who had the money in the years after World War II .
It 's not that proxy contests will be initiated in Mandarin ( although youngsters in Britain and America may well find themselves being sent to finishing schools in Maharashtra to purge themselves of their hillbilly Oxford or Boston accents and acquire the high - class English tones of Mumbai ) .
But corporate bankruptcy will become a branch — probably the major branch — of international intrigue as governments find themselves dealt in whether they like it or not .
And for the rest of us , " working for the man " will take on a brand - new — and foreign — dimension .

Good news for all OSX users , a build of MonoDevelop that integrates with OSX is now available :
For the impatient among you , click and run MonoDevelop.app.zip .
It requires Mono 2.4 for OSX , on the upside , you can use this to develop ASP .
NET MVC apps on the Mac .
Some Background
Back in February I showed a screenshot of MonoDevelop 2.0 for the Mac , it looked like this :
Super - Alpha -Preview of MonoDevelop on OSX .
It was basically the Gtk# based MonoDevelop IDE binary executing on the Mac .
There was no porting involved , just the same executable running under Mono / OSX .
The code works , but it did not feel like a Mac app :
The Menu bar was embedded in the window .
The keyboard accelerators were the Linux ones .
They felt unnatural for OSX users , and also did not take advantage of the spare key ( Command ) to liberate the control key for other uses .
The editor behaved like a Linux editor .
There is a vibrant Mono on OSX community out there , and it will only grow larger .
We wanted to make sure that all of the work that is going into creating a great IDE is available for folks on the Mac in a way that is actually comfortable to use .
So working with folks in the Mac Community and with folks at Unity Michael has been working on tuning up MonoDevelop on the Mac to become an editor that does not get in the way of Mac users and developers and integrates better from the " feel " perspective with other tools in the OS .
For instance , not only does the new MonoDevelop for MacOS use the Mac menu bar , and the Mac accelerators ( a combination of XCode and Textmate accelerators ) , but even the text editor has been altered to support the way selection and navigation works on the Mac .
I figured that for every 100 users of MonoDevelop one of them will contribute patches back to the effort .
If you happen to be that 1 % hacker that will contribute back , you might want to look at a list of ideas to improve MonoDevelop on the Mac .
MonoDevelop on Windows .
MonoDevelop on Windows is on a similar boat : the 2.0 release works " out of the box " on Windows , but again , it is a GNOME IDE in a Windows land .
Stay tuned for news from the MonoDevelop community as to what will happen there .
Update : Lluis posted an update on the progress of MonoDevelop on Windows .
It ’s not on the front pages of what is left of U.S. newspapers .
The headlines are dominated by violence in Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iraq , by Miss America ’s semi-nude photo scandal , and by the Chrysler fiasco .
But just about everyone who is anyone is talking about nuclear weapons this week .
At the United Nations , representatives from the world ’s 190 or so nations are meeting ( in typical fashion ) to prepare to meet .
The preparatory meeting of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) is taking place the first two weeks of May to get ready for the Review Conference of the Treaty , which will happen next year .
Closer to home this week , Congress heard from its Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States .
And the Department of Energy released its budget for 2010 requesting $ 6.4 billion for nuclear weapons programs out of an overall budget of $ 26.4 billion .
In all of this nuclear attention , there is good , bad , and mixed news , all of which is taking place against the background of President Barack Obama ’s historic Prague speech , in which he pledged to work for a world free of nuclear weapons .
The president also identified immediate , concrete measures toward that goal , including negotiating a new treaty with Russia involving deep cuts in our respective nuclear arsenals ; seeking ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; accelerating spending designed to eliminate “ loose nukes ” and bomb - making materials ( plutonium and enriched uranium ) in Russia and beyond ; and ending all new production of bomb - making materials worldwide .
The Good News
Over the last eight years , the United States all but dropped out of the NPT process .
The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty entered into force in 1970 .
It sets up a bargain between the nations that possessed nuclear weapons at the time – the United States , the Soviet Union , France , China , and the United Kingdom – and the rest of the world .
While nuclear - haves work to dismantle their arsenals , the nuclear - have - nots wo n’t pursue nuclear weapons programs .
The carrot in the mix was the “ peace atom ” : allowing non-nuclear states access to nuclear technologies for energy .
The NPT regime has been under assault by the slow pace of nuclear disarmament and the spike in nuclear proliferation outside the treaty by Israel , India , North Korea , and Pakistan .
Iran appears to be close behind , and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission warns that as many as a dozen other nations have the ability to develop nuclear weapons capabilities within the next decade .
Given all of this , there was palpable relief following Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller ’s presentation at the 2009 preparatory meeting , which began on Monday , May 4 .
The head of the U.S. delegation read a message from Obama in which he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the treaty and called for collaboration , saying , “ we must define ourselves not by our differences , but by our readiness to pursue dialogue and hard work to ensure the NPT continues to make an enduring contribution to international peace and security . ”
Gottemoeller then described U.S. support for the each of the three pillars of the treaty : disarmament , nonproliferation , and nuclear energy .
Perhaps most dramatically , she called on all countries to abide by the NPT , singling out India , Pakistan , Israel , and North Korea by name as nations not in compliance with the treaty , and calling the development of effective consequences for treaty violators a priority .
Her statement and full participation in the meetings stands in marked contrast to the track record over the last eight years and signals U.S. seriousness about international cooperation .
The Mixed News
Congress gave a blue ribbon collection of strategic sages – former lawmakers and nuclear laboratory directors , retired Pentagon and Department of Energy officials , and representatives from research institutions like the National Institute for Public Policy – the task of examining the long - term strategic posture of the United States and making recommendations about what the future shape of that posture should be .
Those recommendations were released this week in a 360 - page report .
While nothing in the report purports to set policy for the Obama administration , the commission ’s recommendations will be taken into consideration as the administration begins work on its Nuclear Posture Review scheduled to be released late this year or early next year .
Read with an eye toward the future of nuclear policy , against the backdrop of Obama ’s pledge to seek a world free of nuclear weapons , the report offers up a somewhat confused picture .
On the one hand , the commission acknowledges the “ final abolition of nuclear weapons ” as a goal and asserts that the use of nuclear weapons should be a “ defensive last resort . ”
It also observes that the “ moment appears ripe for a renewal of arms control . ”
The Bush administration ’s nuclear posture asserted the possibility of a first use of nuclear weapons , failed to mention abolition , and as a rule took a dim view of arms control regimes .
But on the other side of the ledger , the commission could n’t reach consensus on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty – seen by the rest of the world as a critical litmus test of the U.S. commitment to eventual nuclear disarmament .
Just as alarming , within the context of promoting a “ lead and hedge ” policy , in which the United States simultaneously leads disarmament efforts and maintains a strategic hedge of nuclear weapons , the commission asserts the necessity of the nuclear laboratories ’ warhead “ life - extension program , ” calling on the laboratories to maintain the ability to design new nuclear weapons .
This can be understood as a back door to new weapons designs because the nuclear labs have used “ life extension ” to introduce new design elements into at least two types of nuclear warheads .
In the same vein , the commission ’s urging that the labs maintain their weapons - design capabilities opens the door to billions of dollars in spending on a veritable wish - list of high - tech computer modeling , lasers , imaging systems , and new facilities .
The Bad News
Secretary of Energy Steven
Chu announced his department ’s budget requests for fiscal year 2010 .
Amid a lot of fanfare about renewable resources and sustainability was a Bush - like $ 6.4 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration ’s continued work on nuclear weapons technologies , facilities , and designs .
This request is in line with the NNSA ’s longer term plans for upgrading the nuclear weapons complex over the next two decades , an endeavor that could cost tens and tens of billions of dollars .
Besides being expensive , the plan for so - called complex transformation was crafted during the Bush administration and is obsolete now that the Obama administration has pledged to dramatically accelerate the reduction of the U.S. nuclear stockpile .
A $ 6 billion - plus budget for moving forward on nuclear weapons research and development while negotiating for nuclear nonproliferation and pledging a nuclear - weapons - free world sends mixed signals to allies , provides political cover to adversaries , and makes it more difficult to persuade Iran and North Korea to roll back their nuclear programs .
Another Chance
Obama cannot unilaterally get rid of all the United States ’ nuclear weapons tomorrow – even if that ’s what he wanted to do .
But he can halt these expensive and shortsighted nuclear weapons plans with a stroke of his pen when the budget comes back to him in a few months .
In that way , he can reconcile the U.S. nuclear weapons budget and U.S. nuclear weapons policy .
And that would be good news from Washington for the whole world .

Physics discussion ends in skateboard attack SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO
A homeless man is on trial in San Mateo County on charges that he smacked a fellow transient in the face with a skateboard as the victim was engaged in a conversation about quantum physics , authorities said Wednesday .
Jason Everett Keller , 40 , allegedly accosted another homeless man , Stephan Fava , on the 200 block of Grand Avenue in South San Francisco about 1:45 p.m. March 30 .
At the time , Fava was chatting with an acquaintance , who is also homeless , about " quantum physics and the splitting of atoms , " according to prosecutors .
Keller joined in the conversation and , for reasons unknown , got upset , authorities said .
He picked up his skateboard and hit Fava in the face with it , splitting his lip , prosecutors said .
Fava also fell and broke his ankle , although how this happened was n't known , authorities said .
MARFA , Texas – " It ’s a matter of what I ’m willing to live with , " Specialist Victor Agosto of the U.S. Army , who is refusing orders to deploy to Afghanistan , explained to IPS .
" I ’m not willing to participate in this occupation , knowing it is completely wrong . "
Agosto , who returned from a 13 - month deployment to Iraq in November 2007 , is based at Fort Hood in Killeen , Texas .
While in Iraq , Agosto never left his base , located in northern Iraq .
" I never had any traumatic experiences , never fired my weapon , " Agosto told IPS in a phone interview .
" I mostly worked in information technology , working on computers and keeping the network functioning well .
But it was in Iraq that I turned against the occupations .
Through my reading , and watching what was going on , I started to feel very guilty . "
Agosto added , " What I did there , I know I contributed to death and human suffering .
It ’s hard to quantify how much I caused , but I know I contributed to it . "
Having served three years and nine months in the U.S. Army , Agosto was to complete his contract and be discharged on Aug .
3 . But due to his excellent record of service and accrued leave , he was to be released the end of June .
Nevertheless , due to the stop - loss program , the Army decided to deploy him to Afghanistan anyway .
Stop - loss is a program the military uses to keep soldiers enlisted beyond the terms of their contracts .
Since Sept. 11 , 2001 , more than 140,000 troops have had tours extended by stop - loss .
A copy of his counseling form from the Army , dated May 1 , reads , " You will deploy in support of OEF [ Operation Enduring Freedom ] on or about [ XXXXX ] with 57th ESB .
This is a direct order from your Company Commander CPT Michael J. Pederson . "
Agosto posted copies of the counseling statements issued by the Army on his Facebook page .
Counseling statements outline actions taken by the Army to discipline Agosto for his refusal to obey a direct order from his company commander .
On one of them , dated May 1 , Agosto ’s written statement appears : " There is no way I will deploy to Afghanistan .
The occupation is immoral and unjust .
It does not make the American people any safer .
It has the opposite effect . "
In another , dated May 18 , he wrote : " I will not obey any orders I deem to be immoral or illegal . "
On that day , Agosto was ordered to get his medical records in preparation to deploy to Afghanistan .
He refused to do so .
The Army threatened to take punitive measures , but Agosto wrote on the counseling statement , " I am not going to Afghanistan .
I will not take part in SRP [ Sealift Readiness Program ] . "
If Agosto continues to refuse orders , he almost assuredly will face court martial , and likely jail time .
When IPS asked Agosto if he is willing to take whatever consequences the Army is prepared to mete out , he replied , " Yes .
I ’m fully prepared for this .
I have concluded that the wars [ in Iraq and Afghanistan ] are not going to be ended by politicians or people at the top .
They are not responsive to the people , they are responsive to corporate America . "
Agosto added , " The only way to make them responsive to the needs of the people is if soldiers wo n’t fight their wars , and if soldiers wo n’t fight their wars , the wars wo n’t happen .
I hope I ’m setting an example for other soldiers . "
Agosto has overtly refused to follow any order that has anything to do with his taking an action that would support the occupation of Afghanistan .
For a time , according to Agosto , he was given simple orders to clean the motor pool or pull weeds .
" They switched that recently , " he told IPS , " I ’ve continued to be fairly defiant , so on Tuesday I have to meet with Trial Defense Services , which then begins the process of getting an Article 15 , which is movement toward being court - martialed , if these reprimands continue . "
" If I take the Article 15 , I ’ll take a reduction in rank and pay .
I do n’t ’ know what is going to happen .
I agreed to sweep the motor pool and pull weeds , but nothing else that I feel directly supports the war .
I ’m not going to follow orders I ’m not comfortable with . "
Agosto ’s case is not unique .
The group Courage to Resist , based in Oakland , Calif. , actively engages in assisting soldiers who refuse to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan .
" Although the efforts of Courage to Resist are primarily focused on supporting public GI resisters , the organization also strives to provide political , emotional , and material support to all military objectors critical of our government ’s current policies of empire , " reads a portion of the group ’s mission statement .
IPS spoke with Adam Szyper - Seibert , an office manager and counselor with Courage to Resist .
" Currently we are actively supporting over 50 military resisters like Victor Agosto , " Szyper - Seibert told IPS , " They are all over the world , including André Shepherd in Germany , and several people in Canada .
We are getting five to six calls a week just about the IRR [ Individual Ready Reserve ] recall alone . "
U.S. Army Specialist André Shepherd , who went AWOL after serving in Iraq , has applied for asylum in Germany after refusing military service because he is morally opposed to the occupation of Iraq .
The IRR is composed of former military personnel who still have time remaining on their enlistment agreements but have returned to civilian life .
They are eligible to be called up in " states of emergency . "
The Army is currently undertaking the largest IRR recall since 2004 , despite the recent inauguration of a so - called antiwar president .
Szyper - Seibert said that the number of soldiers contacting Courage to Resist has been increasing dramatically in the last year , and particularly in recent months .
" The number of soldiers contacting us is increasing , " he explained , " With five to six IRR ’s contacting us a week , plus others going absent without leave [ AWOL ] , the numbers are all climbing , as compared to a year ago .
Since May 2008 , we ’ve had a 200 percent jump in how many soldiers are contacting us . "
According to Courage to Resist , there have been at least 15,000 IRR call - ups since Sept. 11 , 2001 , for deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq .
Sgt. Travis Bishop , who served 14 months in Baghdad and is also stationed at Fort Hood , recently went AWOL when his unit deployed to Afghanistan .
Like Agosto , Bishop feels it is immoral for him to deploy to support an occupation he morally opposes .
" I love my country , but I believe that this particular war is unjust , unconstitutional , and a total abuse of our nation ’s power and influence , " Bishop ’s blog reads .
" And so , in the next few days , I will be speaking with my lawyer , and taking actions that will more than likely result in my discharge from the military , and possible jail time and I am prepared to live with that . "
The reason he made this decision is addressed in his blog .
" My father said , ‘ Do only what you can live with , because every morning you have to look at your face in the mirror when you shave .
Ten years from now , you ’ll still be shaving the same face . ’
If I had deployed to Afghanistan , I do n’t think I would have been able to look into another mirror again . "

DHS Announces Repeal after Texas Weighs In
AUSTIN - Texas legislators previously concerned about compliance deadlines may heave a sigh of relief as Department of Homeland Security announced it 's move to repeal the federal Real ID
Act last week .
Other legislators like , Rep. Carl Isett ( TX - Lubbock ) , continue to join the national trend of states moving legislation to reject the federal mandate .
Lack of federal funding , serious privacy and civil liberties concerns over Real ID 's regulations provoked 25 states to move legislation against the national ID program .
Representative Isett sponsors the Texas legislation opposing the comprehensive national ID program .
Isett sponsored identical legislation last session .
Real ID , passed as a rider on a Tsunami relief bill in 2005 , suffered from a big brother reputation , technical networking inadequacies and state 's sticker shock over the price to build a centralized federal identity database from state fusion centers .
According to a report released last month from the DHS Inspector General , fusion centers across the U.S. are inadequately networked , non-existent or vastly underfunded to comply with the federal mandate for identity storage and national identity sharing .
" DHS did not provide timely and specific guidance on how REAL ID - compliant driver 's licenses and identification cards must be marked , best practices for the physical security of facilities , or information on the systems that will be used for verifying applicant documentation .
To achieve full compliance with REAL ID standards by 2011 , states must connect with electronic verification systems to verify identification documents .
Several of the systems needed do not yet exist .
Specifically , 18 of 19 states , or 95 % , reported that available grant funding was insufficient .
Several states referred to the amount received as a " drop in the bucket . " - - DHS Inspector Generals Report
During Texas 81st session legislators field concerns about Texans being refused passage into federal buildings and airports based on the program 's federal extension status .

Hi , guys .
It ’s PW .
My friend Ryan has graced us with this sticky , delectable , and surprisingly simple recipe for …Monkey Bread .
- PW
That ’s right … Monkey Bread .
Although I ’m almost certain there are no actual monkeys in this recipe , it ’s still very good .
I snagged the recipe from my mother - in - law Tracy , after I regained consciousness the first time I ate this strange , pull - apart , breakfast , lunch , or dinner bread thing .
I ’d simply call it amazing , but since it also involves monkeys , I ’d have to say it ’s superhuman .
And you know the best part about this here Monkey Bread ?
It ’s easy .
Hard to mess up , honestly .
You ’ll be just fine .
Here ’s what you need :
* holds hands up in paper - football goal posts to find the “ L ” *
From left to right we have :
* Brown Sugar // 1/2 cup will be needed
* 2 sticks of butter ( 1 cup )
* Bundt Cake Pan ( feel free to use dorky shapes )
* Cinnamon // 2 - 3 teaspoons
* 3 cans of Buttermilk Biscuits ( the non-flaky ones )
* Sugar ! // 1 cup
Now before you do anything … go ahead and preheat that oven to 350 .
You ’ll need this in about 10 minutes .
* BWOP !! * —
That was the sound of the biscuit can popping open .
You did n’t know I was a sound effects master , did you ?
Now open up all three cans of biscuits and cut each biscuit into quarters .
At this time you ’ll want to combine the 1 cup of regular sugar with 2 - 3 teaspoons of cinnamon .
I use 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and this gives it a fairly strong cinnamon flavor .
If you ’re not so hot on cinnamon , cut it back to 2 teaspoons .
Dump these into a 1 gallon zip bag and shake to mix evenly .
Drop all of the biscuit quarters into the cinnamon - sugar mix .
Go ahead … all of them .
Yes , they ’re sticking together right now , but just trust me .
Once all the biscuit quarters are in the bag , seal it and give it a vigorous shake .
This will get all those pieces unstuck from one another and nicely coated with the cinnamon - sugar .
You might have some excess sugar left over and that ’s okay .
Feel free to eat one of these right now .
I wo n’t look .
Spread these nuggets out evenly in your bundt pan .
I suppose you might want to grease this pan before doing this , but I ’m pretty sure the gallon of butter we are about to add will keep it safe .
Un - greased always works for me .
At this point , you ’re going to want to melt those two sticks of butter together with 1 /2 cup of brown sugar .
This can be light or dark brown sugar .
Stir together over a medium - high heat until the two become one .
Sure , you could do this in the microwave , but it would be way less cool .
Once the brown sugar butter has become one color , you can pour it over the biscuits .
Try to avoid sticking your finger under this heaven - sauce as it ’s really , really hot .
(* Knows from experience * )
At first …it ’s going to look like too much .
It ’s okay though .
Did I mention that this is not a low - calorie snack ?
Bake this @ 350 degrees for about 30 - 40 minutes until the crust is a deep brown on top .
It should look like this .
If you have the willpower , allow this to cool for about 15 - 30 minutes before turning it over onto a plate .
If it does n’t slide right down onto the plate , give it a few love - taps until it plops .
It ’ll hold .
The smell is to die for , but the taste is life itself .
I would endorse this Monkey Bread as the next presidential candidate .
Pull off pieces by hand …
… Or if you ’re civilized , feel free to use utensils .
Now , I ’m not completely sure why this stuff is called “ Monkey Bread , ” but I think it has something to do with the fact that people seem to stand around it making primitive noises , jumping up and down , and picking at it incessantly .
Taste it and you ’ll know what I ’m talking about .
Love Wins ,
Ryan
The 17,000 m² scheme will sit on a 0.64 hectare site between Stockwell Street , Nevada Street and King William Walk and will also house the university ’s 7,000 m² library which currently occupies the former infirmary building designed by James ‘ Athenian ’ Stuart ’s ( built 1794 ) .
Professor David Wills , the university ’s deputy vice - chancellor , believes the contest - launched through the European tender process ( OJEU 2009 / S 84-121373 ) – will attract a wealth of talent .
He said : ‘ In any circumstances we would expect this to be popular with architects : it ’s a high profile project , in London , based within a World Heritage Site [ Maritime Greenwich ] and with a lot of scope to come up with interesting ideas for a new school ofaArchitecture & construction and a university library .

‘ In the current environment , with a downturn in the building industry , of course we are expecting especially high levels of interest in a development on this scale . ’
He added : ‘ On the whole , we welcome that – increased competition will enable us to ensure that we get the very best architectural design for the site .
The university hopes to attract a broad range of talent . ’
Wills did not rule out smaller firms entering .
He went on : ‘ There is no limit on the size of the practices that we will consider for this opportunity , we will judge bids on their capability and capacity to deal with this complex project .
‘ Where smaller practices may not be able to achieve this on their own , we are happy to consider bids from small practices in collaboration with larger ones . ’
He concluded : ‘ We hope that this opportunity will produce innovative ideas for an inspiring piece of contemporary architecture . ’

Today has been dominated by news and excitement surrounding Google Wave , Google 's new real - time communication platform that will launch to the public on September 30th .
In fact , there 's been so much buzz that you might just not have enough time to read the thousands of articles being released on Google 's biggest product launch in recent memory .
To make sense of it all , we have compiled key information , definitions , and links related to the launch of Google Wave .
This in - depth guide provides an overview of Google Wave , discusses the terminology associated with it , details information on Google Wave applications , ( i.e. the Twitter Wave app Twave ) , and goes over ways to keep yourself informed .
We know you 're excited about Google Wave , so here 's what we think you should know :
What is Google Wave ?
While we suggest reading our article on the launch of Google Wave for more detailed information , here 's the sum of it : Google Wave is a real - time communication platform .
It combines aspects of email , instant messaging , wikis , web chat , social networking , and project management to build one elegant , in - browser communication client .
You can bring a group of friends or business partners together to discuss how your day has been or share files .
Google
Wave has a lot of innovative features , but here are just a few :
- Real - time :
In most instances , you can see what someone else is typing , character - by - character .
- Embeddability : Waves can be embedded on any blog or website .
- Applications and Extensions : Just like a Facebook application or an iGoogle gadget , developers can build their own apps within waves .
They can be anything from bots to complex real - time games .
- Wiki functionality : Anything written within a Google Wave can be edited by anyone else , because all conversations within the platform are shared .
Thus , you can correct information , append information , or add your own commentary within a developing conversation .
- Open source : The Google Wave code will be open source , to foster innovation and adoption amongst developers .
- Playback :
You can playback any part of the wave to see what was said .
- Natural language : Google
Wave can autocorrect your spelling , even going as far as knowing the difference between similar words , like " been " and " bean . "
It can also auto - translate on - the - fly .
- Drag - and - drop file sharing :
No attachments ; just drag your file and drop it inside Google Wave and everyone will have access .
While these are only a few of the many features of Google Wave , it 's easy to see why people are extremely excited .
Google Wave was the brainchild of a team based out of Sydney , Australia .
The core team members are two brothers , Jens and Lars Rasmussen , and lead project manager Stephanie Hannon , all of whom were involved in Google Maps previously .
Google Wave was announced today at Google 's I/O Developer conference , although the product will not be available to the public for several months .
We detail even more of these features in our article The Top 6 Game - Changing Features of Google Wave .
Terminology
Google
Wave actually has its own lingo - yes , you have to learn a few definitions if you 're going to really understand this new communication platform .
Having knowledge of these terms will help you understand more about Google 's newest project .
- Wave : A wave , specifically , refers to a specific threaded conversation .
It can include just one person , or it can include a group of users or even robots ( explained below ) .
The best comparison I can make is that it 's like your entire instant messaging ( IM ) history with someone .
Anything you 've ever discussed in a single chat or conversation is a wave .
- Wavelet : A wavelet is also a threaded conversation , but only a subset of a larger conversation ( or a wave ) .
It 's like a single IM conversation - a small part of a larger conversation and a larger history .
Wavelets , though , can be created and managed separately from a wave .
- Blip : Even smaller than a Wavelet , a Blip is a single , individual message .
It 's like a single line of an IM conversation .
Blips can have other blips attached to them , called children .
In addition , blips can either be published or unpublished ( once again , it 's sort of like typing out an IM message but not yet sending it ) .
- Document : A document actually refers to the content within a blip .
This seems to refer to the actual characters , words , and files associated with a blip .
- Extension :
An extension is a mini-application that works within a wave .
So these are the apps you can play with while using Wave .
There are two main types of extenisons : Gadgets and Robots - Gadgets :
A gadget is an application users can participate with , many of which are built on Google 's OpenSocial platform .
A good comparison would be iGoogle gadgets or Facebook applications .
- Robots : Robots are an automated participant within a wave .
They can talk with users and interact with waves .
They can provide information from outside sources ( i.e. Twitter ) or they can check content within a wave and perform actions based on them ( i.e. provide you a stock quote if a stock name is mentioned ) .
- Embeded Wave :
An embeded wave is a way to take a Google Wave and the conversation within it and place it on your website .
Users could use this as a chatroom , as a way to contact you , or for something more .
Wave Gadgets
A Wave Gadget is one of two types of Google Wave extensions .
Gadgets are fully - functional applications .
According to Google , gadgets are primarily for changing the look and feel of waves , although this seems to only scratch the surface of the potential of a wave gadget .
First : almost any iGoogle or OpenSocial gadget can run within Google Wave .
That means thousands of applications that have been already created will work in Google Wave .
Second : a gadget built within Google Wave can take advantage of live interaction with multiple users .
This means something like a live online game with active participation from all users .
In that way , it has similarities to Facebook or MySpace applications , which take advantage of your friend network to make games , quizzes , and applications more meaningufl and useful .
Gadgets are specific to individual waves , rather than to specific users .
Thus , it 's not like having a Facebook app on your profile - the gadget belongs to everyone within the wave .
They also do not have titles , to better integrate with the actual conversation .
Some of the gadgets already built include a Sudoku gadget , Bidder ( which turns your wave into an auction ) , and Maps ( which allows for collaboration on a Google Map ) .
For a more technical explanation , be sure to check out Google 's Wave Gadgets Tutorial .
Wave Robots
Robots are the other type of Google Wave extension .
Robots are like having another person within a Google Wave conversation , except that they 're automated .
They 're a lot like the old IM bots of the past , although far more robust .
Robots can modify information in waves , interact with users , communicate with others waves , and pull information from outside sources .
Because it acts like a user , you can define its behavior based on what happens in the chat .
You could build one as simple as " change the word dog to the word cat " or one as complex as a fully - functional debugger .
We 'll probably start seeming some very advanced robots in the near future .
Some of the robots already in service include Debuggy ( an in - wave debugger ) , Stocky ( which pulls stock prices based on stock quote mentions ) , and Tweety ( the Twave robot , which displays tweets inside of a wave ) .
A more advanced explanation is available at Google 's Wave Robots Overview .
We also have an inside look at Google Wave extensions and robots .
Wave Embeds
Wave embeds are a little more complex than embedding a YouTube video onto your blog , yet in the end , that 's really what Google Wave Embeds are : a way to take Google Waves onto a third party website .
Embedded Waves support many of the functions of the actual Google Wave client , including dragging - and - dropping files .
While the Wave Embeds is still very early stage , Google has already built two : YouTube Playlist Discuss and Multiple Extensions Embed .
The former allows you to discuss a YouTube video via a wave and the latter allows for interaction with multiple waves on the same page .
One possibility : Google Wave Embeds may be a real - time replacement to static comments .
If Google perfects wave embeds , you could even see YouTube.com comments replaced with waves , although it is way too early to make any calls on the potential of this .
Google 's Wave Embed Developer 's Guide has more advanced information embedding waves .

The multi-award winning moladi construction system was founded in South Africa in 1986 as a method of
building cast in place reinforced monolithic structures .
The moladi technology was developed as a means to
alleviate many of the cumbersome and costly aspects associated with conventional construction methods without
compromising on the quality or integrity of the structure .
The moladi system constitutes the use of a removable , reusable , recyclable and lightweight plastic formwork
mould , which is filled with a South African Bureau of Standards approved and Agrément Certified aerated mortar
to form the wall structure of a house in as little as one day .
Each set of moladi formwork panels can be re-used
50 times making the technology cost effective due to its repetitive application scheme , reducing the cost of
construction and transportation significantly .
The moladi system produces durable and permanent structures ,
which have been subject to numerous tests and independent reports .
Adel Berwari , a Kurdish member of the security and defense committee in Parliament , blamed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia for the attacks , as well as other extremists trying to sow chaos after recent improvements in security .
None of the bombings were suicide attacks , which have been a signature of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , a homegrown Sunni extremist group with some foreign leadership .
“ It is an attempt to sabotage what has been achieved by the Iraqi government , ” he told Al Iraqiya , the government television network .
A prominent Shiite legislator , Abbas al - Bayati , suggested a link between the violence and members of the Sunni Awakening movement , made up of former insurgents who joined with American and Iraqi forces beginning in 2006 .
A simmering dispute over pay for the Awakening members and the arrest of an Awakening leader last month in the Fadhil neighborhood of Baghdad led to clashes between the group and Iraqi forces .
He also blamed remnants of Saddam Hussein ’s Baath Party for the violence .
Monday ’s bombings occurred three days before the April 9 anniversary of the fall of Baghdad in 2003 , a day those who remain loyal to the Baath Party view as the beginning of a struggle against foreign occupation .
Also , Tuesday is the anniversary of the party ’s founding in Iraq .
“ The Baath Party , as an organization , is weak here in Iraq , and this party may take some advantage of the violence , but they do not have the ability to affect the situation , ” Mr. Bayati said .
Shortly after the first attack , another bomb in a parked car exploded in what appeared to be an assassination attempt against a convoy carrying an Interior Ministry official .
The official , identified by the ministry only as Brigadier Sadoon , escaped injury , but a guard and a bystander were killed and four others were wounded , the ministry said .
Still another car bomb exploded in a market in Husseiniya , a suburb northeast of Baghdad , killing 4 and wounding 20 .
Two other bombings struck in Um al - Maalif , in the southern section of the city .
At least 12 died and more than 25 were wounded in those blasts .
The first struck a market , the second a clinic nearby .

The dissidents ' real targets appear to be the republican leaders Northern Ireland is said by some politicians to be staring into the " abyss " again , after a decade of peace , following the shooting dead of a police officer and two British soldiers .
I think that is premature .
The " abyss " in Northern Ireland has a tendency to be moved just as we all think we are about to fall into it .
The killers are dissident republicans belonging to disparate offshoots from the old Provisional IRA .
We will need to see if collectively the dissidents can sustain the momentum of the last few days .
Success in their terms would see British troops back on the streets , and high profile anti-terrorist operations by overt and covert branches of the security forces .
But whilst the blood of police officers and soldiers is being shed once again , the real target of the dissidents appears to be their former comrades in arms , Martin McGuinness - now joint first minister of Northern Ireland 's devolved government - and Gerry Adams .
Much will depend on how they react to this crisis , the support they give to the security forces and the language they use .
Under scrutiny
These shootings represent the first major test for Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness of the real world responsibilities that go with being in government : the security arm of the British state needs to be allowed to stop , if necessary kill , and certainly arrest the gunmen .
If there are mistakes , as inevitably there often are , Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness will need to keep the republican rump on board whilst not using language that is so mealy - mouthed it gives scope to unionist opponents that when their mettle was tested , they were found wanting .
A visit to the Masareene Barracks is likely to be seen as a step too far Reaction to the murder of the police officer has brought swift condemnation from Sinn Fein but , as with their statement following the murder of two young soldiers , these have been carefully calibrated - referring to " actions " being " counter - productive " and avoiding until pressed the word " murder " .
The difficulty for Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness is that , whereas the Police Service of Northern Ireland is a new and therefore " legitimate " creature of the peace process which they signed up to , the British Army is not , and never will be .
It is regarded by all republicans - dissident and pro-peace alike - as an " army of occupation " .
This helps explain that while condemnation swiftly followed the shooting of the police officer , in the case of the soldiers it did not come for 14 hours .
Altered images
The symbolism of Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness volunteering the ' M ' word unsolicited , or even making a hospital visit or trip to the scene of the soldiers ' shooting , would in some ways be even more remarkable than some of the events thrown up by the peace process - themselves so remarkable they have poleaxed many of us who spent much of the 70s reporting the Troubles .
Paisley and McGuinness became known as the Chuckle Brothers Perhaps the most abiding image of that transformation is that of Dr Ian Paisley , whose impassioned defence of Protestant unionism attracted epithets like " malign colossus " and " man of wrath " , standing side by side with Mr McGuinness .
These men had replaced a lifetime of visceral loathing with laughter and jokes to such an extent that they became known - not a little affectionately - as The Chuckle Brothers .
Mr McGuinness has continued to extend the hand of friendship to Mr Paisley 's successor as first minister , Peter Robinson .
He has been seen standing at his side referring to him as " Peter " alongside the PSNI chief constable .
Inevitably , however , unionists and republicans still squabble over symbolism - there is still a distressingly large tribal element to politics in Northern Ireland , and probably will be for another generation or two .
Republicans have also tried to re-write history , with Mr Adams recently claiming the " use of armed actions were never about building the United Ireland , they were always about protesting or standing up to British policy " .
Brave step
Well , that is not how some of us remember it .
I think back to Mr Adams ' formulation of " The Long War " in the mid-1970s when he and Mr McGuinness said that if they just kept going , they would win by sickening the British .
That held for another decade before Mr Adams realised that a lot of people were going to their graves for no good reason .
Having seen this ahead of almost everyone in the republican movement , it took some courage on the part of Mr Adams and Mr McGuiness to lead some 90 % of republicans out of their cul - de-sac .
The Omagh bombing cost the Real IRA a great deal of support Today , Provisional IRA leaders have committed themselves to pursuing a united Ireland by peaceful democratic means .
But those few republicans who did not follow Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness have never forgiven them for their multiple acts of heresy , splitting in 1997 and taking some Provisional IRA munitions with them .
What little traction the Real IRA had was soon lost in 1998 by planting a 500 lb car bomb in Omagh that killed 29 people and two unborn children .
Since emerging from their purdah , the dissidents have largely confined their attacks to members of the security forces .
They had relied on the spectacle of Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness " selling out " to deliver them young recruits to ramp up their campaign .
It has not worked out like that - even after Mr McGuinness visited the sickbed of a police officer who survived a dissident booby car bomb last May .
Shaking the foundations
But visiting injured young police officers , and especially a new Catholic recruit to the new Police Service of Northern Ireland , the most virile symbol of a new Northern Ireland order , could still be squared with the republican faithful .
After all , former IRA members now on the Northern Ireland Policing Board get to appoint senior police officers to probably the most transparent and accountable force in the world .
The strength of the peace process will be sorely tested if the attacks continue The British Army , though , is different .
The symbolism of IRA leaders giving legitimacy to the organisation in such an intimate way through a visit to the crime scene or a hospital bed probably remains a bridge too far .
Just before the weekend attack , we learned that Army special forces were again operating in Northern Ireland , at the behest of the PSNI chief constable to keep " eyes on " what he describes as " extremely dangerous people " .
Mr Adams warned Sir Hugh
Orde that while he could " count on the popular support of the vast majority " of republicans , this would only apply " provided he does the right thing " - which is a peacetime version of the IRA 's wartime " Troops Out " slogan .
And yet , if anything , Sir Hugh is now more likely to call for reinforcements of those undercover troops .
For once the Real IRA has its hated former comrades right where they want them : in the crosshairs of the Faustian pact Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness have made with their former enemy , the British , and unionists .
Make no mistake , this attack against the police officer and the young sappers , the youngest of whom would still have been at primary school when the last British soldier was shot by the IRA , was aimed right at the heart of the republican leadership .
The fact that , so far , their unionist opponents seem to have cut them some slack bodes well for the peace process .
Quite how enduring is the strength of its foundations , however , will only become apparent if the dissidents maintain the bloody momentum of the last few days .
My guess is that the foundations will hold .

Justice Department political appointees overruled career lawyers and ended a civil complaint accusing three members of the New Black Panther Party for Self - Defense of wielding a nightstick and intimidating voters at a Philadelphia polling place last Election Day , according to documents and interviews .
The incident - which gained national attention when it was captured on videotape and distributed on YouTube - had prompted the government to sue the men , saying they violated the 1965 Voting Rights
Act by scaring would - be voters with the weapon , racial slurs and military - style uniforms .
Career lawyers pursued the case for months , including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as “ the most blatant form of voter intimidation ” that he had seen , even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half - century ago .
The lawyers also had ascertained that one of the three men had gained access to the polling place by securing a credential as a Democratic poll watcher , according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Times .
The career Justice lawyers were on the verge of securing sanctions against the men earlier this month when their superiors ordered them to reverse course , according to interviews and documents .
The court had already entered a default judgment against the men on April 20 .

A Justice Department spokesman on Thursday confirmed that the agency had dropped the case , dismissing two of the men from the lawsuit with no penalty and winning an order against the third man that simply prohibits him from bringing a weapon to a polling place in future elections .
The department was “ successful in obtaining an injunction that prohibits the defendant who brandished a weapon outside a Philadelphia polling place from doing so again , ” spokesman Alejandro Miyar said .
“ Claims were dismissed against the other defendants based on a careful assessment of the facts and the law . ”
Mr. Miyar declined to elaborate about any internal dispute between career and political officials , saying only that the department is “ committed to the vigorous prosecution of those who intimidate , threaten or coerce anyone exercising his or her sacred right to vote . ”
Court records reviewed by The Times show that career Justice lawyers were seeking a default judgment and penalties against the three men as recently as May 5 , before abruptly ending their pursuit 10 days later .
People directly familiar with the case , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retribution , said career lawyers in two separate Justice offices had recommended proceeding to default judgment before political superiors overruled them .
Tensions between career lawyers and political appointees inside the Justice Department have been a sensitive matter since allegations surfaced during the Bush administration that higher - ups had ignored or reversed staff lawyers and that some U.S. attorneys had been removed or selected for political reasons .
During his January confirmation hearings , Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that during his lengthy Justice Department tenure , the career lawyers were “ my teachers , my colleagues and my friends ” and described them as the “ backbone ” of the department .
“ If I am confirmed as attorney general , I will listen to them , respect them and make them proud of the vital goals we will pursue together , ” he said .
Justice officials declined to say whether Mr. Holder or other senior Justice officials became involved in the case , saying they do n’t discuss internal deliberations .
The civil suit filed Jan. 7 identified the three men as members of the Panthers and said they wore military - style uniforms , black berets , combat boots , battle - dress pants , black jackets with military - style insignias and were armed with “ a dangerous weapon ” and used racial slurs and insults to scare would - be voters and those there to assist them at the Philadelphia polling location on Nov. 4 .
The complaint said the three men engaged in “ coercion , threats and intimidation , … racial threats and insults , … menacing and intimidating gestures , … and movements directed at individuals who were present to vote . ”
It said that unless prohibited by court sanctions , they would “ continued to violate … the Voting Rights
Act by continuing to direct intimidation , threats and coercion at voters and potential voters , by again deploying uniformed and armed members at the entrance to polling locations in future elections , both in Philadelphia and throughout the country . ”
To support its evidence , the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull , a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy ’s 1968 presidential campaign .
Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick .
Inexplicably , the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case , according to the files .
“ In my opinion , the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll , ” he declared .
“ In all my experience in politics , in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi … I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location . ”
Mr. Bull said the “ clear purpose ” of what the Panthers were doing was to “ intimidate voters with whom they did not agree . ”
He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher : “ You are about to be ruled by the black man , cracker . ”
He called their conduct an “ outrageous affront to American democracy and the rights of voters to participate in an election without fear . ”
He said it was a “ racially motivated effort to limit both poll watchers aiding voters , as well as voters with whom the men did not agree . ”
The three men named in the complaint - New Black Panther Chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz , Minister King Samir Shabazz and Jerry Jackson - refused to appear in court to answer the accusations over a near - five month period , court records said .
Justice Department Voting Rights Section Attorney J. Christian
Adams complained in one court filing about the defendants ’ failure to appear or to file any pleadings in the case , arguing that Mr. Jackson was “ not an infant , nor is he an incompetent person as he appears capable of managing his own affairs , nor is he in the military service of the United States . ”
Court records show that as late as May 5 , the Justice Department was still considering an order by U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell in Philadelphia to seek judgments , or sanctions , against the three Panthers because of their failure to appear .
But 10 days later , the department reversed itself and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal from the complaint for Malik Zulu Shabazz and Mr. Jackson .
That same day , the department asked for the default judgment against King Samir Shabazz , but limited the penalty to an order that he not display a “ weapon within 100 feet of any open polling location on any election day in the city of Philadelphia ” until Nov. 15 , 2012 .
Malik Zulu Shabazz is a Washington , D.C. , resident .
Mr. Jackson was an elected member of Philadelphia ’s 14th Ward Democratic Committee , and was credentialed to be at the polling place last Nov. 4 as an official Democratic Party polling observer , according to the Philadelphia City Commissioner ’s Office .
Efforts to reach the Panthers were unsuccessful .
A telephone number listed on the New Black Panthers Web site had been disconnected .
The complaint said that the three men were deployed at the entrance to a Philadelphia polling location wearing the uniform of the New Black Panther Party and that King Samir Shabazz repeatedly brandished a police - style nightstick with a contoured grip and wrist lanyard .
According to the complaint , Malik Zulu Shabazz , a Howard University Law School graduate , said the placement of King Samir Shabazz and Mr. Jackson in Philadelphia was part of a nationwide effort to deploy New Black Panther Party members at polling locations on Election Day .
The New Black Panther Party reportedly has 27 chapters operating across the United States , Britain , the Caribbean and Africa .
Its Web page said it has become “ a great witness to the validity of the works of the original Black Panther Party , ” which was founded in 1966 in Oakland , Calif .

With the recent dramatic collapse of the ice bridge to the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica , climate change is back in the headlines .
But Malcolm Turnbull and Coalition environment spokesman Greg
Hunt think they have an answer : biochar .
Many of the world ’s top climate scientists , including James Hansen , agree with them .
So what exactly is biochar ?
Will it work , and can it save us ?
Essentially , biochar is charcoal — the burnt remains of organic material .
The CSIRO has published a handy fact - sheet which explains that biochar is " a type of charcoal which results from the thermal treatment ( heating ) of natural organic materials ( eg crop waste , wood chip , municipal waste , or manure ) in an oxygen - limited environment .
This process is referred to as pyrolysis . "
The pyrolysis is the important part .
Merely burning organic matter on a big bonfire wo n’t give you biochar ; limited oxygen and very high temperatures are required .
What biochar can do is sequester carbon .
By turning typical organic molecules into carbon - containing aromatic rings , pyrolysis has the potential to be " carbon negative " .
This means the process can actually take up more carbon than it gives out , potentially reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere .
It ’s the holy grail of climate change mitigation .
No wonder Tim Flannery is into it .
But will it work ?
Proponents point to native Amazonian slash - and - burn farming practices , which appear to have produced the dark soils called terra preta that remain rich in soil carbon for thousands of years .
Biochar can be produced quite easily using current technologies , and small - scale pyrolysis systems for use on farms are commercially available : the NSW Department of Primary Industries is researching a pilot biochar reactor in Gosford .
Indeed , one of the biggest benefits of biochar might be to help subsistence agriculture in developing nations , for example in Central America .
But much research remains to be done .
Dr Evelyn Krull , the author of the CSIRO ’s biochar fact sheet , told the ABC ’s Anna Salleh that it will take three to five years before CSIRO can recommend it to farmers .
" What we do n’t know is what the safe upper limits of biochar applications are for different soil types , " she told Salleh .
And , as with nearly all renewable energy technologies , there is the problem of scale .
There is a vast difference between small - scale research plants and the kind of large - scale , industry - wide solutions that can make a difference to climate change .
One of biochar ’s chief proponents , Cornell University ’s Johannes Lehmann , admits that the big question about biochar is " whether this approach can be scaled up to national and regional , or even global , scales . "
The CSIRO ’s Evelyn Krull appears to agree , telling the ABC that estimates on how much carbon can actually be trapped using biochar are rubbery , at best .
" I do n’t know where these numbers come from , " she said .
One source of these optimistic figures is a 2009 paper by UK meteorologist Tim Lenton ( based on work by Lehmann ) , which estimated that biochar technology might be able to sequester as much as 0.56 gigatonnes of carbon a year , globally .
This really would make a big impact .
At the moment , though , it ’s only a figure in a scientific paper .
So can biochar save us ?
Probably not .
As George Monbiot has pointed out in The Guardian , the biggest problem with the biochar campaign may well be its allure as a miracle solution to global warming .
This has been a common human response to gigantic problems that threaten to overwhelm us .
Ever since the Reverend Thomas Malthus wrote his gloomy tome An Essay on the Principle of Population , the standard retort of pragmatic conservatives and Panglossian optimists has been that humanity ’s ingenuity will enable us to innovate our way out of ecological disasters .
The " game - changing " ability of technological innovation has indeed been a key factor in saving the world from starvation since Malthus ’ time — but at the cost of significant environmental degradation in many parts of the globe .
In the 1970s , we saw a re-run of the Malthusian debate with the publication of the Club of Rome ’s groundbreaking report , The Limits to Growth .
Authored by a group of analysts from MIT , The Limits to Growth famously predicted that global ecosystems would eventually be overwhelmed by a " business - as- usual " approach to economic growth .
It foreshadowed the depletion and exhaustion of crucial energy resources , and the " overshoot and collapse " of global population .
Enjoying blockbuster sales at the time , the survey soon attracted strong criticism from economists such as Julian Simon , and has often been dismissed by skeptical optimists like Bjorn Lomborg as a case - study in the perils of doom - laden prediction .
Unfortunately , the Cassandras are looking more prescient than the Panglossians just now .
A recent research paper by the CSIRO ’s Graham Turner looked at the projections of The Limits to Growth 30 years on , in the light of three decades of accumulated data .
He found that the Club of Rome ’s business - as - usual ( or " standard run " ) model was surprisingly accurate , giving essentially correct figures for things like global population , non-renewable resource depletion and global pollution .
One of the key criticisms of the Club of Rome ’s models was that technological innovation would solve many of the resource constraints it predicted .
So far , this has n’t happened with fossil fuels like oil .
Likewise , a series of renewable energy technologies have been mooted as the saviour of the global economy and environment .
First it was solar energy .
Then wind .
Then more exotic renewables like geothermal and tidal power .
And finally the mirage of " clean coal " , or Carbon Capture and Sequestration , motivated governments and politicians ( including in Australia ) to invest billions in the hope of allowing humanity to burn dead trees forever .
Time and again , commercial realities , political complacency and vested interests have defeated the promise of renewable energy industries .
Biochar is , in this sense , simply the latest in the long line of such false dawns .
None of this is to say we should n’t pursue biochar technology .
As Chris Goodall wrote in The Guardian in response to Monbiot , " yes , we do n’t yet understand fully why biochar works but this is not an argument to ignore it or rule it out . "
Clearly , if we are to seriously address the global crisis of anthropogenic global warming , we need every shot in the technological armoury .
But biochar will never be enough .
If we are to stave off ecological catastrophe this century , we are going to have to stop burning carbon .
The new limits are predicted to have a big effect President Barack Obama has signed into law extensive new restrictions on the ability of US credit card companies to charge fees or raise interest rates .
" With this bill we are putting in place some common sense reforms designed to protect consumers , " he said .
The bill is designed to protect credit card users from unexpected fees or increases to their interest rates .
Some of the major US banks have warned the changes may reduce the amount of credit available to some card holders .
They say this is because the new rules will make it more difficult for them to set rates based on the risk customers pose .
Americans currently owe nearly $ 1 trillion ( £ 630 bn ) on their credit cards .
" This cements a victory for every American consumer who has ever suffered at the hands of the credit card industry , " said Senator Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate banking committee .
The US government has been concerned to tighten its regulation of the banking system in the light of the credit crunch and banking crisis .
Big changes
The new law , described as a credit card holder " Bill of Rights " , is the first of a series of law changes designed to help stave off further financial crises .
Among the main provisions of the new law are ones that : • stop arbitrary interest rate increases and " universal default " on existing balances .
In universal default , a lender can change a cardholder 's account to costly " default " terms from normal terms when the lender learns the cardholder missed a payment on an account with another lender , even if the cardholder has not defaulted with the first lender • stop card issuers from raising rates for a cardholder in the first year after an account is opened , and require that promotional rates must last at least six months • stop issuers from charging fees for spending beyond their limits , unless the cardholder chooses to allow the issuer to process the excess spending , and restrict any " over - limit " fees • require penalty fees to be reasonable and proportional to the cardholder 's omission or violation • require that cardholders be told how long it would take , and the interest cost involved , in paying off a card balance if they make only the minimum monthly payments • require that cardholders must get 45 days ' notice of interest rate , fee and finance charge increases Backing off
One important exception to the new restrictions on rate changes are people who are one month or more behind with their repayments .
US borrowers in this position will continue to run the risk that their card issuer can decide they are now a bad risk and levy a higher interest rate .
" We will watch to see how the situation in the US develops , " said Sandra Quinn of the UK card association Apacs .
" Many of the new US policies already exist in the UK under the Banking Code and have done for four years , " she said .
In March , the UK government said it would bring in legislation to stop card firms from raising the credit limit of customers who had not asked for it .
It also wants to ban firms from sending out unsolicited credit card cheques to their customers .
In December , the credit card industry gave in to government pressure and agreed a new set of " fair principles " which would see card companies backing off from raising interest rates when customers fall into arrears on their payments .
" We continue to talk regularly to consumer groups and the credit card industry and these discussions , along with proposals to provide further help to people in difficulty with their finances , will be reflected in the forthcoming Consumer White Paper , " said the Consumer Affairs Minister , Gareth Thomas .

The thing that scares me the most about this one is that I am afraid it came from my family photos .
I got my folders all mixed up and these are either hilbillies or my cousins .
And no , I do n’t think they can be both .
I am pretty sure I do n’t have any hillbilly cousins .
If I did , though , I would so be nailing them .
Well , if they were hot .
Maybe .
I do n’t know .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Internet search engine Google said it would reshoot all Japanese pictures for its online photo map service , Street View , using lower camera angles after complaints about invasion of privacy .
Google ’s Street View , which offers 360 - degree views of streets around the world using photos taken by cruising Google vehicles , has already run into privacy complaints in other countries and activists have tried to halt the service in Japan .
Google said in a statement on Wednesday it would lower the cameras on its cars by 40 cm ( 16 inches ) after complaints they were capturing images over fences in private homes .
But it said it would continue filming in Japan , where it has so far covered 12 cities .
“ It is certainly a fact that there have been concerns , ” said Yoshito Funabashi , a spokesman at Google ’s Tokyo office .
“ We thought of what we can do as a company and tried to be responsible . ”
Google said it has also blurred car number plates in the pictures , as it has done in Europe , but the new steps did not convince Japanese campaigners .
“ They are just trying to get through at the technological level ...
The question is , can we allow for them to shoot ( images ) unselectively ? ” said Yasuhiko Tajima , a professor of constitutional law at Sophia University in Tokyo .
Britain ’s privacy watchdog has rejected calls to shut Street View down there , where concerns have ranged from images such as someone throwing up outside a pub to media reports that a woman filed for divorce after her husband ’s car was pictured outside another woman ’s house .

Both Google Maps and a related mapping service , Google Earth , have also been criticized by some countries for providing images of sensitive locations , such as military bases .

AKRON --
He 's long been a hometown hero , now he 's a hometown MVP .
Ten years ago , LeBron James started getting roars at St. Vincent - St. Mary 's gym on the edge of downtown Akron .
Monday he got one more huge ovation in a moment that can only be described as unforgettably unique .
James accepted the NBA Most Valuable Player Award , which he won in a landslide , on the same floor where he first became a star .
With his Cavaliers teammates and coaches in the crowd -- which was stocked with family members , former teachers , former coaches , longtime friends and hundreds of current students -- James accepted the award with humility .
Well , as much humility that can come with arriving at his old school in a Ferrari with a police escort .
But before he got there , he drove through his old neighborhood and took the same route he took to school as a teen .
The trip seemed faster this time , almost as speedy as his rise from phenom to the highest individual honor in the sport .
At midseason , the MVP looked like a three - way race between James , Lakers ' star Kobe Bryant and Heat star Dwyane Wade .
As the Cavs surged to the finish behind James -- who won four Player of the Month Awards to tie a single - season record -- to 66 wins , it quickly became lopsided .
James received 109 of the possible 121 first - place votes to record the sixth - largest victory margin in history .
Bryant finished second overall but had just two first - place votes .
Wade was third but had seven first - place votes .
At a podium set up right below the state championship banner from his senior season in 2003 , James thanked his current teammates and coaches , telling them " this award is going to be like the both of ours but I 'm going to keep it at my house . "
Then he thanked his longtime friends and former teammates and coaches , especially SVSM coach Dru Joyce .
Talking about his team and swearing he would n't cry , James also spoke about his admiration for his mother .
" I 'm 24 years old and I 'm receiving this award , I never thought it would happen this fast , " James said .
" I never dreamed about being MVP , but if I said I did n't enjoy this award I 'd be lying to you .
Hard work pays off and dreams do come true . "
To show extra attention to his teammates , James gave each a pricey camera in part to signify their " family portraits " that became a staple during the season .
But he was quick to remind all of his bigger goals this season .
" I still I have a lot of things I want to do this season , " James said .
" I want to have another celebration in June . "
It was James ' choice to have the ceremony at SVSM .
Normally players accept the award at practice facilities or home arenas .
He will have another celebration before Tuesday 's Game 1 in the conference semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks , where NBA Commissioner David Stern is expected to be on hand to give him the Maurice Podoloff Trophy in front of a sellout at The Q .
So the TV trucks lined up along West Market Street in Akron and police directed traffic and dignitaries , business partners and media members got themselves to James ' turf , the only place he could imagine getting the award .
" This is where I learned my dreams could come true really , there 's not a better place , " James said .
" This school , I just graduated six years ago , this school helped me become the man I am today standing up here receiving this award . "
With the trophy came an SUV from Kia , the NBA annual awards sponsor , which James immediately donated to the Akron Urban League .
" He 's never forgotten where he came from , " said James ' mother , Gloria .
" I 'm very proud of him , it is long overdue and he 's real deserving of it . "
Cavs owner Dan Gilbert , who spoke to the crowd along with General Manager Danny Ferry , surveyed the scene and then tried to re-name the award .
" The ' P ' stands for person , it goes beyond player , " Gilbert said .
" To a lot of people , he 's a most valuable person .
He gives to his team , his friends , the City of Akron , St. Vincent - St. Mary ; he has given in so many ways . "

It was one of the thorniest questions of the 20th Century and it remains a conundrum today .
Are all " ordinary " people potentially violent ?
The human race is both appalled and fascinated by violence .
Man 's aggression spans the globe - from terrorist attacks to guerrilla wars to gang - related crime .
It is everywhere , and it binds all nations and races together .
But where does it begin ?
Do we learn it or is it something instinctive ?
Most of us think of ourselves as calm and peaceful people .
FIND OUT MORE ... Horizon 's How Violent Are You ? is on BBC Two at 2100 BST on Tuesday , 12 May Or watch it later on the BBC iPlayer
We 're brought up to try and resolve all conflict peaceably and tend to think that violence is something that " other " people commit , not ourselves .
But is it ?
Is it possible that you , or your mother or daughter or son , could ever be driven to commit a dreadful crime ?
Do we have that level of violence in ourselves ?
The answer is yes .
Contrary to popular belief , we are born violent .
Until the age of three , our impulses run riot .
There is no stopping the urges which come from the emotional centre in our brains .
But as we grow up , we start to develop the part of the brain that allows us to control our aggression - the pre-frontal cortex .
Yet crucially , how well this control mechanism works depends on our experiences .
Festival of violence Being taught to share and take turns rather than resolve conflict with violence actually changes the physical structure of the brain and therefore makes us less aggressive .
But trying to resolve conflict peaceably is not something all cultures subscribe to .
In the Bolivian Andes , one tribe settles disputes which arise over the year in an annual festival of violence , known as the Tinku .
The way people with no history of violence committed atrocities during World War II has provoked much discussion
Their warrior tradition dictates that men , women and even children should learn to fight and deaths are not unheard of .
Neuroscientist Maria Couppis argues that their brains are different from the norm because they were socialised to resolve conflicts this way .
This suggests that although we are all born with a violent potential , our upbringing and the environment play a key part in creating violence controls in our brain .
Not only are we born violent , we are also chemically programmed to love it .
Inside the brain a pleasure - inducing chemical called dopamine is released when we fight .
Dopamine informs the brain that we 're having a good time .
But the problem does n't stop there - the rush we get from dopamine can get us physically addicted to violence .
The more we have it , the more we want it .
Primeval pleasure Danny Brown , a former hooligan , knows better than most just how far one can go to get this " hit " .
He was sent to prison for stabbing a rival fan but even that did n't stop him .
The rush of hooliganism was too strong to resist .
" I was never into drinking or drugs .
Fighting was my heroin . "
It 's only when your violent impulses are triggered that you realise you are out of control
Prof Charles Golden Fighting is a primeval pleasure controlled by the frontal part of the brain .
But how easy is it for us to lose control ?
Crimes of passion are an everyday occurrence and perpetrators often do n't know what came over them .
How is this explained ?
What is it that drives them to lose it ?
Neuro - psychology expert Prof Charles Golden says we can all easily lose control and commit an extreme act of violence .
All we need is for there to be a breakdown in the pre-frontal cortex and that can be triggered by anything from a car accident or repeated blows to the head in a game of rugby .
In fact , physical injury is not the only way to cause the cortex to shut down .
Depression , alcohol abuse , drugs , lack of sleep and even the natural ageing process can all injure our violence controls .
Control mechanisms
" One of my patients is a priest , " says Prof Golden .
" He spent all his life helping people and one day he had a car accident .
In the hospital , the doctors sent him home saying he was completely fine .
" For a month he did n't notice anything was wrong .
But then he had a fight with his wife and completely lost it .
He very nearly killed her .
So much so that she left him straight away .
Many are forced into violent action and desensitised " The scary thing is that in your everyday life you just do n't notice there 's anything wrong .
It 's only when your violent impulses are triggered that you realise you are out of control .
But by then it 's probably too late . "
It 's hard to accept that we 're born violent , that we enjoy it , and that all our control mechanisms can easily be broken .
But if we think about why most people get killed , it is n't because of a crime of passion or a sudden rush of violence - it is because of war and genocide .
It is because someone deliberately decided to kill another person .
Emmanuel Jal , a former child soldier in the Sudan , has personal experience of how a traumatic experience can lead you to deliberately want to kill another human being .
He had a healthy and happy childhood until one day war tore his hopes for a normal life .
His mother disappeared , his village was burnt down and he lost everything he had .
Justified aggression
He became convinced that the people who did this to him deserved to die , and joined the rebel army .
With them , he killed and tortured many people .
He is now trying to re-build his life and share with the world the idea that violence only creates more violence .
Emmanuel Jal 's experience is extreme .
But how extreme does a situation need to be for you or I to be convinced that violence is justified against another person ?
Sometimes violence is explained by alcohol consumption or other factors
Most of us can imagine that if someone harmed our children or loved ones , we might engage in violence .
But could we ever harm someone who has n't caused us any harm , merely because of an idea or ideology ?
The much - cited Milgram experiment of 1961 suggests the answer might be yes .
Members of the public were asked to give a shock to a " volunteer " every time they got an answer from a multiple questions test wrong .
The shocks were to be increased incrementally , up until the lethal 450 v shock .
What the participants did n't know was that the " volunteer " was acting and had n't been receiving shocks .
But still two - thirds were prepared to deliver the " fatal " 450 v shock because of the supervision of a white - coated authority figure .
The experiment has often been used as the proof that we are all capable of violence within a certain framework .
We struggle to accept this , but the science seems to suggest we are wrong .
A selection of your comments appears below .
If violence was n't such a kick for people war would not exist .
We may not like to admit it , but war is attractive for a lot of people .
The primitive tribal side comes out and people often find it hard to settle back into " normal ' society after the kick of war .
Only when we have emotionally developed will we learn to curtail our violence instincts .
John Murphy , Amsterdam I KNOW that I am capable of violence and it scares me , particularly as with Army & martial arts training I could mete it out effectively .
But I also choose not to react violently , partly because I know I could if it became necessary .
That 's the key : ' Necessary . '
Not because something or someone has annoyed me , but because my life or that of someone else is threatened and the only recourse is to use violence in protection .
Megan , Cheshire UK
There 's a very interesting alternative perspective to this in " On Killing : The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society " by Colonel Dave Grossman .
He argues , backed by a lot of convincing historical evidence , that most people are intrinsically reluctant to kill others .
However this reluctance can be overcome by appropriate conditioning .
Unfortunately , one of the best ways to do this , is to condition people by exposing them to realistic violent computer games , rather as many teenagers are administering to themselves nowadays .
Alan Y , Oxford , UK
The proposition that we are [ all ? ] born to be violent is spurious and / or irrelevant because the vast majority of us for the vast majority of the time [ if not all of the time ] are not violent .
The question is not ' why are people violent ? ' but ' Why are SOME people not passive ? '.
Psycho - social experiments examining violence have tended to generalise from small scale non-naturalistic settings .
Historical examples of mass violence have to be understood in terms of the cultural contexts not the behaviour of individuals .
Neuroscience is not only in infancy in this area but has major problems in separating cause from effect and in sampling .
Moreover , the issue of actual violence can and perhaps should be de-coupled from that of fascination with violence .
Dr Peter Morrall , York , UK
There is much research both within the social sciences and beyond ( population genetics , for example ) studying the innate basis for altruism .
Articles such as yours give a one - sided picture when they do not address the other side of the coin .
There are just as many biological arguments for the empathic , cooperative side of humanity .
A case in point for the potential bias caused by not seeing this , is your citation of Milgram .
The whole point of that experiment , was that authority can make people do things they emphatically DON'T want to do , and indeed avoid doing without immediate authoritarian influence .
Milgram reports two participants having full - blown seizures , because of the stress caused by the conflict of interest .
You are misrepresenting Milgram 's work by using it as evidence for innate bloodthirstiness - Milgram himself was in fact arguing the opposite and blaming obedience to authority for the expression of aggression .
Ben Brown , Brighton I 'm honestly surprised this could be considered news .
The human capacity for violence is blatantly obvious and I 'm quite astonished that someone could be so naive that they 're suprised that we 're all capable of violent acts .
John Kingston , Hertford , UK
The article is correct in its assertion that we are all capable of violence , The worst potential for violence , however , occurs when a charismatic leader grooms a country and its citizens to use violence against a group or for the purpose of territorial expansion .
Recent examples of this are Hitler and General Tojo .
Joe Roberts , psychologist , Jackson USA
From studying the diaries of those who perpetrated some of the most brutal and personally involved killings in the Holocaust , the one thing that has stuck with me is how shockingly normal most of those who took part in the killings were - and how eager many participants were .
It was n't just desensitised and committed Nazis , but people you would consider everyday workers who personally killed others in cold blood .
One particular incident where railway workers took part in a mass execution of Jews in Poland because they were bored stands out .
When you read their accounts of what took place , there is no place for remorse , but instead a giddy excitement untinged by ideology .
So much for clear , rational and objective thought ruling human behaviour ...
Jonny McQuitty , Oxford Have to think about this one for a while .
Would like to think it is reversed and that we are mostly all benevolent people who under the worst circumstances can become violent .
Seems that my thinking is not along the lines of this article .
We have all had experiences where people we know do bad things that we never thought them capable of .
So this lends credence to what is said here .
But I am still not totally convinced .

( Reuters ) - Anticipating restrictions on bonuses , officials at Citigroup Inc and Morgan Stanley are exploring ways to sidestep tough new federal caps on compensation , the Wall Street Journal said .
Executives at these banks and other financial institutions that received government aid are discussing increasing base salaries for some executives and other top - producing employees , the paper said , citing people familiar with the situation .
The discussions are at an early stage , partly because the government has not yet issued specific rules on the bonus payments that will be allowed at companies that received aid under the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , the paper said .
The report comes on the heels of widespread outrage that insurer AIG , kept alive on a government bailout of up to $ 180 billion , was paying its employees bonuses of $ 165 million .
In February , President Barack Obama set a $ 500,000 annual cap on pay for top executives at companies receiving taxpayer funds .
Citigroup officials have considered designating which 25 executives will be subject to bonus limits , the paper said , citing people familiar with the discussions .
In that scenario , the new rules might not apply to lower - ranking yet still highly lucrative traders and investment bankers , the people told the paper .
“ We will comply with the restrictions , in addition to the substantial changes we have already made to our compensation structure , ” a Citigroup spokeswoman told the paper .
A Citigroup spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters .
Wall Street compensation has come under intense scrutiny , especially at banks that have received taxpayer money from TARP .
Citigroup has received $ 45 billion of TARP money .
Morgan Stanley has received $ 10 billion .
Morgan Stanley could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters .
The bonus forms a large part of salaries of traders and bankers on Wall Street , the paper said .
Wells Fargo &
Co , which took $ 25 billion of capital last year under TARP , disclosed last week that it increased the base salaries of CEO John Stumpf and two other executives , the paper said .
Raising base pay at J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co is n’t being discussed , the paper said , citing people familiar with the matter .

UPDATE : Almost 40 percent of Americans with student loans may default on them by 2023 , a new study says .
Default rates are much higher among those who have attended a for - profit college .

We already have class warfare in the U.S. — do we really need generational warfare , too ?
Millennials worry that their future is not bright , with continuing trends toward low - wage jobs , high health care costs , and a Social Security system that may not be there when they need it .
The cost of going to college is astronomical , and working millennials are finding it difficult to buy a house .
Sometimes , because of student loan debt or just the kind of bad financial decisions that people across all age groups make , their credit scores are so low they can barely qualify to rent an apartment .
The statistics keep pouring in , and they do n’t look good .
Writing for Huffington Post ’s Highline magazine , Michael Hobbes , explained “ Why millennials are facing the scariest financial future of any generation since the Great Depression . ”
He says millennials have taken on 300 percent more debt than their parents , are half as likely as their parents were to own a home when they were their age , and are saddled with a stunning poverty rate of 20 percent .
“ Based on current trends , ” he says , “ many of us wo n’t be able to retire until we ’re 75 . ”
It ’s an impressive analysis , especially his conclusion that fundamental changes in the job market — that over the last 40 years , companies have shifted from long - term investment in employees and infrastructure to short - term profit - making and stock run-ups — have taken a heavy toll on millennials .
“ The Olds ” ( the term younger folks use to describe older people who “ do n’t quite get it , ” the Washington Post explains ) believe that the millennials ’ problems “ are all our fault , ” he says .
“ We got the wrong degree .
We spend money we do n’t have on things we do n’t need …
We killed cereal and department stores and golf and napkins and lunch .
Mention ‘ millennial ’ to anyone over 40 and the word ‘ entitlement ’ will come back at you within seconds , our own intergenerational game of Marco Polo . ”
A Q&A on Vox was more bitter , running under the headline : “ How the baby boomers — not millennials — screwed America . ”
It ’s an interview with Bruce Gibney , author of “ A Generation of Sociopaths : How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America . ”
“ The boomers inherited a rich , dynamic country and have gradually bankrupted it , ” Gibney said .
“ They habitually cut their own taxes and borrow money without any concern for future burdens .
They ’ve spent virtually all our money and assets on themselves and in the process have left a financial disaster for their children . ”
On his show , Morning Joe , host Joe Scarborough basically echoed the sentiment in a whack at the recently passed tax cut .
“ Millennials , you just had $ 1.5 trillion stolen from you , ” he said .
“ Past Congresses have stolen $ 20 trillion from you , and over the next ten years , they ’re going to steal another $ 10 trillion from you .
And they ’re going to die , and then you ’re going to be left holding the bill . ”
Gibney blames boomers for electing officials responsible for the tax cut — and the “ fantasy about trickle - down economics ” used to promote the tax package .
“ They ’re still clinging to this dogma , and indeed the latest tax bill is the latest example of that , ” he said .
It should be noted , though , that the Pew Research Center reported in summer that millennials and generation Xers — people age 36 to 51 — represented the majority of voters for the first time in 2016 .
According to NPR , 69.6 million millennials and gen Xers cast votes in 2016 , compared with 67.9 million baby boomers and older generations .
And so apparently enough of the younger folks agreed that trickle - down economics deserved another shot , even after the historic flop of the Bush tax cut a decade - and - a - half ago .
Most people think millennials trend Democrat .
But NPR says another 2016 study found that young people born between 1980 and 1994 were more likely to identify with conservatives than boomers and Xers at the same age .
The millennials — and to perhaps to a lesser extent the Xers — have legitimate beefs .
The cost of college is a national disgrace , and loading college graduates down with crushing debt as they start their careers is a terrible injustice .
Politicians , and a lot of “ The Olds ” too , will tell you that young people waste their time with unusable degrees .
But that ’s not true .
We do n’t need the university system to churn out an endless stream of graduates with degrees in business , management and marketing .
In a society that desperately lacks perspective , the world needs art history majors more than ever .
But the costs of getting that perspective have reached new levels of absurdity .
Forbes calls student loan debt “ a $ 1.3 trillion crisis ” and notes that total student debt is now higher than credit card debt and car loans .
It ’s second only to mortgages .
The magazine says 44.2 million U.S. borrowers are dealing with student loan debt .
Everyone ’s heard anecdotal accounts of people finishing a bachelor ’s degree more than $ 50,000 in debt , or a law or medical degree with $ 250,000 worth of debt .
Helping people get this under control should be one of the top five issues in national campaigns .
Democrats did bring it up in 2016 , but it never gained much traction .
On the other hand , as a boomer myself , it wo n’t surprise anyone that I think Social Security and Medicare should be saved .
And not just for The Olds , but for the younger people coming up the line who have already figured out that defined benefit pension plans wo n’t be around to see them through their senior years .
Ditto for retirement health care programs ; hence the argument for Medicare .
These programs — which workers pay into — should be around for everybody , not just the silent generation and the boomers .
So I would propose that like - minded boomers join forces with Xers and millennials to address a whole range of social issues , not just those peculiar to one age group .
Class warfare is dog - bites - man .
It ’s something that has roiled societies , and governments , since the first civilizations were created 5,000 years ago .
It waxes and wanes .
It certainly seems to be on the increase these days .
But really — is there any reason why a more just society should n’t be a cross-generational effort ?
Are you Building an Everyday App? ( the Linked In problem )
Linked
In wants its ~ 40 million users to come back every day .
Problem is , LinkedIn is n’t an everyday app .
In a recent interview , LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman describes moving away from day to day to a more strategic role in the company he founded :
I want to be able to sink my mind around a couple of problems and work through them .
For example , many professionals still do n’t understand how Linked In can be valuable on a daily or weekly basis ”
Another way you could phrase this is : “ people do n’t use Linked In everyday … we need to figure out how to change that ” .
The fact is that Linked In , in its current incarnation , is not an everyday app .
An everyday app is one that is used every day ( or most days ) by its users .
This means that each and every day they do something with the app .
Maybe they ’re communicating with coworkers , or creating wireframes , or sharing what they ate for breakfast .
Everyday apps in theory are as plentiful as bees in a blossoming apple tree .
In practice , however , everyday apps are exceedingly rare .
( my friend Dave Lifson says that the folks at Amazon call returning to the site daily the “ daily habit ” )
So how many everyday apps are there ?
Well , it ’s hard to tell , but probably not many .
Check out the following slide from a study of teens and technology done by MTV Asia ( hat tip : M. Arauz ) .
This study suggests that teens in the U.S. only visit 7 sites regularly , while the numbers in other countries are n’t much higher .
That ’s not many !
In general , most people think they ’re building an everyday app , but they ’re not .
When the actual use patterns are discovered , most apps will be used every few days or less .
Designers have to ask themselves a very hard question : “ How often are people really going to use our web application ? ” .
The answer is important … it will even help drive design decisions .
Whether or not you have an everyday app affects the entire design of what you ’re building , including the screens , notifications , and frequency of the service .
For example , only everyday apps really need to use real - time technology to update streams .
If you find out that you ’re not building an everyday app , you probably do n’t need to invest in making it real - time .
But …you might invest in a notifications system that can alert users to when something very interesting happens .
You do n’t have to be an everyday app to be successful .
Netflix , for example , is not an everyday app .
It ’s an every - few - days app .
Most people go back every few days to update their queue .
There is really no need to go back more often .
Another example is Freshbooks , which is not an everyday app for independents ( it ’s probably an everyday app for companies with a dedicated finance person ) .
As an independent , you only use Freshbooks when you need to send an invoice or send estimates .
But , Freshbooks did realize that if they added time tracking , then it became an everyday app …
Falsely believing that one has an everyday app is partially why advertising has failed to support so many entrepreneurs who envisioned financing their app that way .
When people do the math and try to figure out how much engagement they ’ll need to make a profit off the ads run on their site , they too often assume that they ’re building an everyday app .
They calculate the number of users times the number of days , when in fact they should be calculating a fraction of that .
When it becomes clear that people are n’t using their app everyday , their advertising strategy falls to the ground …hard .
LinkedIn is not used every day by most of the people who use it .
Many of the 38 million registered users use it infrequently .
Personally , I only use it to respond to requests for connections or some other email notification I receive ( sad but true ) .
Other than pruning it as a weak - ties network , Linked In really is n’t that useful for me .
A lot of folks I ’ve talked to share this sentiment …it ’s basically used as a souped - up contacts manager .
Now , there may be a subset of folks who use Linked In everyday , like people looking for a job or headhunters trying to find good candidates .
But once people find a job they stop using it so much .
They then become like the majority of professionals who have jobs ( even in this economy ) and do n’t have time to actively look for new opportunities .
So contrast engagement on LinkedIn with the crazy engagement of Twitter and Facebook .
Those sites are just waiting in the wings to start eating LinkedIn ’s lunch .
And they already might be .
Most of the folks I talk with on Twitter are using it for professional purposes in one way or another …purposes which Linked In could in theory be well - positioned to help out on .
I ’ve long wondered about this problem with LinkedIn .
How can they increase engagement when they are often used ( for better or worse ) as a job hunting application ?
I think its an interesting problem because they certainly have enough users to play with …it ’s just a matter of finding out what features can be valuable enough to get those folks coming more often .
Here are a couple thoughts :
Linked
In seems to weigh social value over personal value .
They focus on connecting people more than providing value regardless of connection .
I will say that their Answers feature is one good exception to this , but in general the messaging I get from LinkedIn is all about who is connected to whom .
The emails in particular make me cringe … I do n’t care who my contacts are connected to unless I know how that other person can benefit me .
My Inbox and network updates are filled with connection information … as if I want to spend time managing this stuff .
To be the world ’s best professional app you need to make people better at their profession !
This is straight out of Kathy Sierra ’s School of Passionate Use .
The best way to make people passionate about your business is to make them better at what they ’re already passionate about .
In other words , users will get passionate about LinkedIn if Linked In can help them do their work better .
Now , Linked
In knows what I do because I ’ve told them .
Why is n’t their goal to make me a better freelance consultant / interface designer ?
Give me some tools to do my business better , give me great content that helps me do my work better .
There are places to find great content around this …it ’s just a matter of curating it and publishing it .
Now , it ’s possible that Linked In should n’t be an everyday app but I doubt that is the case .
People are busy being professionals every day so why could n’t an app that makes them be better professionals be a part of that ?
But at the present moment it still feels like LinkedIn is too focused on the connection part and not enough on the profession part .
Until LinkedIn can make us better at our profession , it wo n’t be an everyday app .

Microsoft Live Search is changing
Microsoft is re-launching its search engine , promising to make search simpler , and aiming to overhaul Yahoo .
Re-named and re-branded Bing.com , the search engine will go live first in the US and launch in beta elsewhere .
Google has more than 64 % of the search market in the US , followed by Yahoo at 20 % and Microsoft at 8.2 % .
Bing offers to make search more relevant by understanding the intention of searches , and grouping more related information to the original query .
For example , searches for a product will also bring links to reviews , accessories , and online shops , as well as information about the item .
Searches for flight information will pull schedules and times from websites , as well as linking to hotels and weather .
Microsoft wants to reduce the amount of clicking a user has to do to find specific and related information .
Paul Stoddart , Microsoft UK search lead , " Forty percent of search queries go unanswered .
There is something missing here and a big consumer need . "
Google have n't been able to innovate a lot of the UI
Paul Stoddart , Microsoft
He added : " We can see it in the logs [ of searches ] .
When searching using existing search engines I have to keep re-querying things - adding more words , clicking on a site , going back because it is not the right site , and ultimately abandoning their queries . "
He added : " We are pulling information that we know people use every day . "
He said Microsoft was hoping to build an " emotional connection " between users and its search engines , as well as brand loyalty .
Bing has a much softer , less clinical feel than previous Microsoft search engines and rivals , with a daily changing backdrop image .
" Google have n't been able to innovate a lot of the UI ( user interface ) because they have to display their ads as that 's how they make their revenue .
We can try things a bit differently , " said Mr Stoddart .
Users are also able to save their searches to avoid having to remember on which site they found a particular piece of information .
Microsoft is forming partnership with a host of different online services which Bing can then trawl to aggregate specific information around searches - such as flight deals , reviews and holidays .
Mr Stoddart said the UK version of Bing was launching later than the US because Microsoft was busy finding the " best of breed " in web services specific to the UK that it could add into search engine results .
" People keep building global search engines but doing something for the UK is important , " he said .
He denied that Microsoft 's goal of overtaking Yahoo lacked ambition .
" Second place would be a great place .
And once we 're in second place we will go for first place .
" Microsoft has a great tradition of coming from behind . "

A carpenter bee forages for pollen on an azalea shrub in Wilmington , Del. , May 8 .
Global warming is making the pollen season last longer and attracting insects , scientists say .
QUICK QUESTION QUICK QUESTION
Climate change is n't only bad for the Earth , it may be bad for your health — especially if you have allergies or asthma .
Global warming is making pollen seasons last longer , creating more ozone in the air , and even expanding the areas where insects flourish , putting more people with bee allergies at greater risk , experts say .
10 STEPS : Minimize impact of spring allergies on you ON THE WEB : Track pollen levels near you with National Allergy Bureau " Climate change will cause impacts in every area .
Wet areas will get wetter , and drier climates are getting drier , " said Dr. Jeffrey Demain , director of the Allergy , Asthma and Immunology Center of Alaska , and a clinical associate professor at the University of Washington .
Those changes will mean more people with allergies and asthma will suffer .
In wet areas , mold allergies will spike , while in drier areas pollens and other airborne irritants will become more of a problem , he said .
Last month , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it believes carbon dioxide and five additional greenhouse gases are dangerous to human health .
This finding may eventually lead to environmentally friendly changes , such as regulations for cleaner energy and more fuel - efficient cars .
But , right now , problems caused by climate change are already evident , especially in Alaska , Demain said .
" There 's been a significant shift in the ecosystem because of the rises in winter temperatures , " he said .
" On average , Alaska 's temp has risen 6.4 degrees in winter and 3.4 degrees overall .
And , the earlier the snow melts , the earlier the pollen cycle begins . "
In addition to longer pollen seasons , the plant and tree life is changing along with the warmer temperatures .
Demain said it 's estimated that 90 % of the Alaskan tundra will be forested by 2100 , and that the types of trees that are most common are changing , too .
The warmer temperatures are also attracting insects .
In the past , Alaska has n't had too many stinging insects .
But , said Demain , northern Alaska has recently seen a 620 % increase in the number of people seeking care for bee stings .
Although Alaska 's experience may be more dramatic than the rest of the United States , it 's definitely not the only region that 's experiencing change .
" We 're having warmer , wetter winters , which lead to long springs and an increase in seasonal allergens , " said Dr. David Peden , director of the Center for Environmental Medicine , Asthma and Lung Biology at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill .
Peden also said that ozone levels are higher , which causes more asthma symptoms .
So , what can you do to protect yourself ?
Both Peden and Demain said that just being aware of the problem is the first step .
Next , is to be sure you know specifically what you 're allergic to , and then be aware of pollen and mold cycles so you can properly adjust your behavior when those levels are high .
" Pollens are usually highest in the mornings , but grass is elevated in the morning and evening .
If you 're tree - or weed - allergic , plan outdoor activities for the afternoon or evening .
If you 're grass - allergic , you might want to plan to be outside midday .
Warm , sunny , dry days are usually the ones with the greatest pollen , " Demain said .
Of course , it 's not always possible to stay indoors , and treatments are available that can help you live with allergies and asthma .
" As mundane as this sounds , if you have allergic disease or asthma , consult with an allergist so that you have maximal therapy and information on seasonal concerns .
If you 're in an area with lengthy pollen seasons , allergy shots might be useful , " Peden said .
" The climate is changing , and it 's changing at an unprecedented rate .
Whether it's a natural cycle , or whether humans are the cause , we have to recognize that this is happening , " said Demain , who added , " Every small step [ such as using compact fluorescent bulbs or driving less ] is important .
If we all take that step , we can have a big impact . "

In practice , two kinds of halfway - models have been used , shown in Fig. 1 . The first , used by Shapiro and by Phillips ( see Fig. 2 , left ) , is a Boy 's surface , which is an immersed projective plane .
In other words it is a way of immersing a sphere in space such that antipodal points always map to the same place .
Thus there are two opposite sheets of surface just on top of each other .
If we can succeed in pulling these sheets apart and simplifying the surface to a round sphere right - side - out , then pulling them apart the other way will lead to the inside - out sphere .

Earlier , we took a look at some notably gorgeous natural caves .
Here we take a look at what happens when equally beautiful caves get mated with the architectural and artistic abilities of our ancestors ( which , sadly , still seem to outdo us by leaps and bounds ) .
Everyone loves a nice old castle , an old temple buried in the jungle , or a gargantuan stone idol devoted to an ancient deity , but it is truly spectacular to see it in all come together inside a mountain .
Some Windows are Bigger than Others …

The Predjamski Grad ( that ’s Slovenian for Castle in Front of the Cave , literally ) dates back to the 12th Century , and sits in front of what ’s called Erazem ’s Cave .
Aside from being stunningly gorgeous on the outside , the site reeks of historical value and traditional folklore .
Because of its inherent stronghold - status , being the castle built into a mountain - cave that it is , Predjamski Grad has been through more than its fair share of sieges .
Classic stories about this tell show humor , as they describe the confusion of attacking armies at the staying power of those holed up in the castle .
They were unaware of the huge network of caves lurking inside the mountain , which actually lead to an exit on the other side .
Big Enough for the Masses
The Batu Caves in Malaysia are nothing short of mind - bogglingly huge .
Meaning “ Cave of Rocks , ” this location is the hosting site every year for millions of Hindu pilgrims attending Thaipusam , a Hindu New Year celebration .
This has been going on for far longer than we ’ve been a country ( so long in fact , that it does n’t really matter where you are reading this right now , because it ’s still true ) , and the colossal caves have served the celebrants well .
A 242 - step flight of stairs leads up to the mountain entrance , where once inside , visitors are greeted by what ’s probably the largest room they ’ll ever set foot in .
Not only is the cave gorgeous , but it ’s open and airy , with skylights the size of buildings letting in natural light during the day .
The Batu Caves are one of the most visited tourist sites in all of southeast Asia today .
What Once Was Lost …
Most of what we know now in terms of archaeology was either discovered or recovered in the last 200 years , and we think we ’re pretty hot stuff for it .
We should never forget that people actually built this stuff .
One nice tradition for locals in Laos is to make a pilgrimage to the Pak Ou Caves , and visit the collection of nearly 3,000 Buddhas .
Whole families will make the journey , and leave their own Buddha statue as a contribution .
The photo on the right shows ancient steps leading down into the Khao Luang Cave Temple , in Phetchaburi , Thailand .
Situated in Thailand ’s largest national park , this beautiful cave - temple is only 100 miles south of Bangkok , and worth the expedition if anywhere near the area .
Lastly , rediscovered by accident in 1819 by the british in India , the Ajanta Caves are simply beyond amazing .
29 different Buddhist temples set into a horeshoe - shaped cliffside make up the hugely popular tourist site , some of them dating as far back as the 2nd Century BCE .
Nobody knows how long the monks spent carving the extraordinary temples into the cave - walls , or why they were suddenly abandoned so long ago .
To be in India and not experience these caves would simply be a crime .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 10/4/2009 ( 4190 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Opinion
The poor state of the global economy might provide a further reprieve from what now seems like the inevitable breakup of Canwest Global Communications Corp .
But it probably will not be enough to preserve the Asper family 's control of the company , which is sinking under a $ 3.7 - billion pile of debt , declining revenue and virtually no hope of a market turnaround in anywhere near enough time to save it .
The company has until Tuesday to make a $ 30.4 - million interest payment on US $ 761 million in bonds at eight per cent interest that is a month overdue .
Bondholders have the right to demand payment of the full amount on that date and the company has no way of making that payment short of selling significant assets at fire - sale prices .
Canwest has negotiated extensions in the past and is furiously attempting to get another extension to recapitalize , but circumstances are conspiring against it .
It is also on the verge of breaching its covenants on another silo of debt -- $ 1.4 billion -- on its publishing assets , and the company reported on Thursday that operating profits on that unit were down 46 per cent for the quarter ending Feb. 28 .
The rapid decline of advertising revenue in virtually all its markets , including Canadian conventional television stations , Canadian newspapers and Australian television -- the only profit growth came from specialty television -- means there is no excess cash to meet the mounting debt obligations .
However , were creditors to demand payment , it would mean the company would have to sell assets at very low prices , ensuring that loss to bondholders .
" They ( the bondholders ) want to get the hell out of there and they want to maximize their dollars , but they probably do n't want to be sellers at the bottom of the bear market , " one Bay Street analyst said .
That could mean creditors might be inclined to keep the company together as a going concern during the global economic downturn , waiting for prices to come back .
Canwest has recently sold non-core assets like its stake in The Score specialty sports channel and The New Republic magazine and has put its five secondary conventional television stations in the E !
Network up for sale in a desperate attempt to keep the company out of bankruptcy .
But regardless of the decision the creditors make , the Aspers ' control of the company is effectively over .
CP Adrian Wyld / The Canadian Press Archives
" The market cap is just over $ 50 million ; there is no equity left , " one analyst said .
" The bondholders already own it .
In terms of converting ( bondholders ' ) debt to equity , they are already there .
It 's semantics .
The Aspers are already out .
The equity has been wiped out . "
In its second - quarter results released Thursday , Canwest took another $ 1.4 - billion writedown , this time against its newspaper publishing assets .
Total revenue was down nine per cent for the quarter -- 16 per cent in the publishing division -- and operating profit before the impairment charge was down 31 per cent .
Despite the poor financial results , Canwest stock was up five cents on Thursday to 32 cents .
At a time when additional liquidity could forestall the inevitable , the exact opposite is occurring for the company .
Its 57 per cent stake in the Australian Network Ten had provided the parent company with $ 100 million in annual dividends in the past .
But earlier this month it reported that a $ 10 - million dividend from Australia was all that Canwest Global could expect this year .
The company 's publishing division , which includes virtually all the largest papers in Canada other than the Winnipeg Free Press , the Globe and Mail and the Journal de Montreal , had also been contributing cash to help make payments on the parent company 's debt .
But the gloomy newspaper advertising market is not likely to improve quickly enough to prevent that division from breaching its own debt covenant in coming weeks , making another group of bondholders eligible to demand payment on another $ 1.4 billion in debt .
" It 's a sad story .
The company is done , " the analyst said .
" Listening to Leonard ( Asper , Canwest 's CEO ) on the call ... he sounded like a defeated man .
I felt sorry for him .
He is disheartened .
I am disheartened just watching him on the sidelines . "
Another analyst suggested that the best - case results for the company and the Aspers might be some scenario whereby the specialty channels , the newspaper division and the Australian operations were sold or taken over by the creditors .
It would leave the Aspers and existing shareholders in control of the Canadian conventional television channels and bring the company right back to where it started .

Is there a way out now ?
What options does Canwest have in dealing with its creditors ?
It has been negotiating virtually non-stop with creditors and bondholders .
It has won a couple of reprieves and might be able to continue to do so because the forced sale of assets ensures losses for everyone .
What else can Canwest do to improve its situation ?
The company has been cutting costs , including the elimination of close to 500 jobs at its publishing operations and the removal of $ 25 million in operating expenses from its broadcast division in the first six months of the fiscal year .
It can keep doing more of the same , as well as continue to seek buyers for its media assets .
Is there any assistance the company can hope for from the Canadian government ?
There has been talk of the possibility of some bailout assistance for the broadcast sector .
Canwest is also about to start licence - renewal hearings for its Canadian conventional channels .
It has made it clear that it will once again seek fees for the carriage of its channels from cable and satellite carriers , as well as alterations to its local programming obligations .
The genes were found on chromosomes six and nine Scientists say they have begun to crack the genetic code that helps determine when a girl becomes a woman .
A UK - led team located two genes on chromosomes six and nine that appear to strongly influence the age at which menstruation starts .
The Nature Genetics study also provides a clue for why girls who are shorter and fatter tend to get their periods months earlier than classmates .
The genes sit right next to DNA controlling height and weight .
PUBERTY
The two to three - year transition from childhood to adult body size and sexual maturity Complex multi-staged process involving growth acceleration , weight gain and the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics
Can happen earlier in overweight and obese chidlren Early puberty associated with increased risk for obesity , diabetes and cancer A second paper , published in the same journal , also concludes that one of the two genes highlighted by the first study plays a key role in the timing of puberty in both girls and boys .
Reproductive lifespan is closely linked to the risk of developing conditions such as heart disease , breast cancer and osteoporosis .
It is thought that the female sex hormone oestrogen - produced at higher rates during a woman 's reproductive life - raises the risk of these diseases .
Therefore , the earlier a woman goes through puberty , the more risk she may be at .
So the researchers say their work not only improves our understanding of the genetics underpinning development , it may ultimately aid the fight against disease .
However , they also accept that the onset of puberty is influenced by factors such as nutrition and exercise , and the effect of a single gene is likely to be relatively small .
Developing earlier
In the western world children are reaching puberty at younger and younger ages - some girls at the age of seven .
This study provides the first evidence that common genetic variants influence the time at which women reach sexual maturation
Researcher Dr Anna Murray from the Peninsula Medical School Many blame rising obesity rates because , generally , girls who achieve menstruation earlier in life tend to have greater body mass index ( BMI ) and a higher ratio of fat compared to those who begin menstruation later .
From its analysis , a team led by Exeter 's Peninsula Medical School predict one in 20 females carry two copies of each of the gene variations which result in menstruation starting earlier - approximately four and half months earlier than those with no copies of the gene variants .
In collaboration with research institutions across Europe and the US , they studied 17,510 women from across the world , including women of European descent who reported reaching menstruation of between nine and 17 years of age .
When they split the women up according to the age they began menstruating , certain gene patterns appeared .
Scanning the whole genome enabled them to hone in on these differences and pinpoint the exact genes most likely accountable .
Researcher Dr Anna Murray said : " This study provides the first evidence that common genetic variants influence the time at which women reach sexual maturation .
" Our findings also indicate a genetic basis for the associations between early menstruation and both height and BMI . "
Biological mechanisms Co-worker John Perry said : " Understanding the biological mechanisms behind reproductive lifespan may also help inform us about associated diseases that affect a lot of women as they get older , including diabetes , heart disease and breast cancer . "
The second paper , led by the MRC Epidemiology Unit at Cambridge , analysed genetic information from thousands of people .
It linked a specific variant one of the two genes highlighted by the Exeter team - LIN28B - with earlier breast development in girls , and earlier voice breaking and pubic hair development in boys .
Lead researcher Dr Ken Ong said : " LIN28B works by controlling whether or not other genes are active .
" There are a number of such ' master switch ' genes known , but this is the first evidence linking such a gene to growth and physical maturation . "
Dr Aric Sigman , psychologist and fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine , said : " Early menstruation is a health issue because beyond being an inconvenient surprise for a girl and her parents , it 's also associated with a higher risk of a variety of diseases and psychological problems .
" Girls maturing earlier are more likely to become depressed , delinquent , aggressive , socially withdrawn , suffer sleep problems drinking , smoking , drug abuse , lower self - esteem and suicide attempts .
" They 're also more likely to exhibit poor academic performance in high school than on - time or later maturing peers .
" It is important that we understand why early menstruation occurs and these findings bring us closer to explaining this in some girls . "
Three other papers , also published in Nature Genetics , throw up other candidate genes which appear to be involved in the onset of puberty .

If you happen to stumble upon the Governor ’s website , you will see a ticker showing the number of days that the legislature has failed to act .
We are now approaching day 100 and there is another number just below the day showing how much money has been squandered by this boondoggle .
So what is the solution to the massive California budget deficit ?
Secret closed door meetings !
This is their idea of “ democracy ” in action .
See , our dysfunctional state government needs a basic lesson in negotiations and compromise .
First , even I realize that I wo n’t get everything I want in life .
Heck , I think most of you who interact with the world and people understand that .
Yet our state politicians operate in a parallel universe where everyone gets what they want and money never runs out .
“ ( LA Times ) Reporting from Sacramento —
Under the gilded dome of the state Capitol , the Cone of Silence has descended .
A veil has been drawn .
Secrecy has prevailed as the wizards have labored behind the green curtain to find a way out of California ’s $ 42 - billion budget hole .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the top four legislative leaders have again been meeting behind closed doors as California teeters at the brink of fiscal insolvency .
Rank - and - file lawmakers , special interest groups and the public have been shut out of the bargaining process .
There have been no public hearings , no chance for input — and that has some folks riled . ”
Now the rubber is meeting the dreaded road .
So the solution has now shifted to backroom negotiations since that is the only way things will move .
One side is adamant about no tax hikes yet does n’t have the guts to publicly bring the axe to tens of thousands in a state with unemployment already nearing double - digits .
They just keep uttering this tired old mantra with no real solutions .
The other side is not helping either .
They want to keep running up massive deficits and fail to realize that our current economy is now in a different world .
They want to maintain the same spending yet fail to realize that the sources of revenue have dried up .
It would appear no one wants to make the hard decisions and that is why our state has now resorted to backroom dealing .
Bottom line , our budget deficit is so bad that we can all expect tax hikes and spending cuts .
We knew this years ago but everyone wanted to believe in the housing bubble fairy and based their future expectations on this obviously flawed model .
If you had asked people back in early 2008 if they envisioned people moon walking away from their mortgages in mass , they would have said that you were out of your mind .
Yet they are .
If you had asked people back in late 2007 if California housing could fall 50 percent in one year , they would have thought you mad .
50 percent is already here .
With all that is going on , we ’ve almost forgotten about the source of this dismay , the housing market .
Let us take a look at some data :
Even with the above data sources , we are looking at 48 to 52 percent drops from the peak back in 2007 .
It is interesting that both data sources had wildly different peaks ( a difference of $ 113,640 while the current median price is only off by $ 32,100 .
It would seem that we are converging to a single data point .
The crashing housing market has affected the California economy profoundly because our state arguably had the biggest bubble of them all .
A $ 600,000 median home price for a state with a median household income of $ 60,000 ?
There was no happy ending to this story .
Let us do a quick check on the overall California housing market .
For the latest month of home sales we see that 37,836 homes sold in the state .
Monthly Sales : 37,836
Percent previously foreclosed : 57.5 %
December 2008 Data
Notice of Defaults : 42,290
NTS : 27,598
REO : 19,561
Total : 89,449
Bottom line is more and more troubled assets are hitting the market at the most inopportune time .
Keep in mind we are only at the beginning of the massive pay option ARM fiasco that will hit in full force in 2009 .
So prices will be coming down further and are still in line with my bottom call of summer of 2011 .
This was n’t some random made up number , I picked this date because this is the time we should be washing out the last wave of the option ARMs from the market .
What many pundits fail to factor in is the shift in psychological calculus hitting the state .
I do n’t go around preaching doom and gloom all day and that is why I use this blog as a spot to discuss these issues .
Yet I ca n’t tell you how many people now come up to me and ask me , “ what is going on with the economy ? ” or “ I just do n’t see how we will get out of this . ”
This was unheard of even last year .
In fact , I think I am now the optimist .
Look , things will get bad but we will come out of this .
Yet many of these people are still fixated on the notion of those sky - high bubble home prices that we saw in 2007 .
Those are not coming back .
The quicker people can accept this fact the faster they will be able to appreciate the new reality .
I was watching a camera in a trading pit when current U.S. Treasury Sectary Timothy Geithner announced the new terms for the failed TARP and other ideas of how the market was going to deal with the situation .
As you know , the market tanked and while red was all over the floor you could hear someone in the background scream out , “ bring back Paulson ! ”
Of course , these people have little appreciation of the 3.6 million people that have lost their jobs and here we are now deciding how we can avoid a Japan scenario or a Great Depression .
A year ago , it was insanity to even utter the Great Depression while now it is brought up everyday .
A few months ago , we heard very little about the lost decade in Japan , now we hear our current President talking about it .
Things are changing very quickly at the moment .
Let me say something about what occurred with the market falling .
This coupled with the floor trader yelling to his god , exemplified the crony capitalistic system that is currently failing on an epic scale .
The market did n’t react in a positive move because what they wanted to hear was this :
“ Yes , the U.S. taxpayer will be buying every toxic asset from corrupt Wall Street and its puppet lenders and not even ask how or why they got into the mess .
We will put more trillions at risk so you can go on and find another bubble to fleece the American people . ”
Remember CNBC had wet dreams about the bad bank that was a stunningly preposterous notion .
Now , we get a semi private and public option of buying these toxic assets .
The market did n’t like that .
They did n’t like the “ stress test ” option either .
In a way , it is stunning how deep the system has been infiltrated by a self - destructive financial delusion that is quickly fizzling out .
The spectacle of the CEOs on Wednesday should show you how out of touch these people are .
They live in a reality completely disconnected from what is currently going on .
They think the troubles of Americans started only a short while ago yet we all know that these troubles have decades of history ( at least to prudent Americans ) .
The debt culture is running on a 30 - year sprint and is now collapsing .
Another stunningly stupid notion going around is this idea for a stop to “ mark to market ” action .
In a few words , this group is arguing that you should n’t force institutions to put a value on an asset that would have to be sold in a brutal market and be taken at most likely , a fire sale price .
What they really are asking of you is for you to bite into a dirt sandwich and pretend it is the greatest thing you have ever eaten .
Trust us , that dirt will become ham and cheese in a few years .
How interesting that during the boom they had no urgency to stop mark to market when assets were inflated to bubble prices .
Another crony capitalistic mentality .
So going back to California , the once almighty Westside is now having a taste of the economic tornado :
“ ( LA Times ) The Southern California real estate crash has finally reached the high - end areas of the Westside .
Home prices in Beverly Hills , Santa Monica and Malibu – which continued to soar well into 2008 – finally tanked at the end of the year , losing between 26 % and 30 % of their value in just a few months , the latest data show .
The sudden drop came as a surprise to Shelley Conn , who remained a believer in the myth that the wealthier parts of the Westside were immune until she put her Santa Monica house on the market last spring . ”
I cannot tell you how many times , even when I highlighted homes in Santa Monica and Malibu that people were reluctant to believe that the Westside would ever see major price cuts .
It was as if there was first , one large delusion bubble for the state of California and then hyper - bubbles in these select areas that kept these people believing the good times still were rolling .
The housing crash is now uniform in destruction .
Many of you may be wondering how could it be that we missed such a big problem coming our way ?
Well first , you have to understand how California gets its money :
Let us spend a few minutes on this chart .
California draws money largely from 2 sources , the personal income tax and the sales tax .
In fact , approximately 80 percent of the state revenues come from these 2 sources .
Take a wild guess how off we were ?
Well for the personal income tax , we were off almost $ 10 billion !
The error is the size of the budget of many states in the country .
Then you ’ll see the sales tax which has n’t adjusted much which of course makes no sense .
They are heading into another problem .
Well at least we have the liquor tax which is going to double in the next fiscal year ?
Excellent , we ’ll drink our way out of this budget deficit .
Look at the estimates of 2009 - 10 .
They go up !
Really ?
Who is going to be spending tons of money in 2009 - 10 ?
I saw a recent survey that had nearly 1 in 2 people who are currently working worried about their employment .
This is why we are in this mess .
Imagine if you and your family made a budget with $ 200,000 in expenses yet only brought in $ 120,000 .
Do you see potential problems ?
A solution is n’t getting a credit card and a HELOC and sucking out $ 80,000 .
We are going to have a tough few years .
It is important to get a grasp of what is going on so you are better prepared to debate the merits of what is going on .
I find it troubling that many people make up their mind before hearing a debate because of the label of “ Democrat ” or “ Republican ” or “ Independent ” which is insane .
It is time we are equipped with the data and do what is best for our country no matter who brings the solution to the table .
The crony capitalist have had their share and it is time we stop handing them blank checks .
That is , unless you enjoy backroom deals .

" Dieu ( selon toute vraisemblance ) n'existe pas . "
Plaqué sur les flancs de trois autobus , le slogan aurait dû circuler pendant trois mois dans les rues de Berlin .
Objectif : faire de la capitale allemande le nouveau point de chute de la vaste campagne de publicité lancée par un collectif d'athées , début janvier , en Grande - Bretagne .
Celle - ci a déjà essaimé avec succès au Canada , en Australie , en Italie et en Espagne ( Le Monde du 15 janvier ) .
Pourtant , malgré plus de 20 000 euros de dons , rassemblés en quelques jours de collecte , l'initiative " Buskampagne " est au point mort en Allemagne .
La régie des transports berlinois ( BVG ) n'a pas voulu délivrer d'autorisation .
Les militants athées ont bien imaginé diffuser leur message sur les autobus d'autres grandes villes du pays .
Peine perdue .
Munich , Brême , Leipzig , Stuttgart , Dresde , Potsdam , Hambourg ...
Dans toutes ces municipalités , les refus tombent , les uns après les autres .
Les compagnies font toutes valoir le même argument : la " publicité idéologique " n'a pas sa place dans les réseaux de transport en commun .
" Sinon , demain , on risquerait de voir des organisations telles que la scientologie se présenter à leur tour chez nous " , justifie Klaus Wazlak , le porte - parole de la BVG .
La référence fait bondir les initiateurs de la Buskampagne .
" Cela revient à nous mettre sur le même plan qu'une secte , s'énerve Philipp Möller , professeur de mathématiques et porte - parole du projet .
A Dortmund , c'est pire encore : la régie de transports a indiqué qu'elle n'acceptait aucun slogan sexiste , raciste et antireligieux .
Comme si on pouvait comparer les trois ... "
Selon des statistiques de 2005 , plus de 32 % des Allemands se revendiquent sans confession , mais les églises chrétiennes restent des acteurs de poids de la vie sociale et politique .
Leurs hauts responsables se sont pour l'instant tenus à l'écart du débat sur la " propagande " athée .
" DEUX POIDS DEUX MESURES "
" En réalité , nous sommes traités avec deux poids deux mesures : alors que nous sommes empêchés de mener notre campagne , on trouve de la publicité religieuse un peu partout " , s'indigne M. Möller .
Le porte - parole rappelle l'exemple de Pro Reli , une association qui milite pour faire inscrire les cours de catéchisme au programme des écoles publiques berlinoises .
Leurs affiches ont été placardées durant tout le mois de janvier dans les couloirs du métro de la capitale , sans que la BVG y trouve à redire .
Très remontés , les militants athées ne désarment pas , et envisagent de s'offrir un ou plusieurs bus privés pour délivrer leur message .
Une idée dont ils n'ont pourtant pas la primeur .
A Dortmund , justement , une association catholique a affrété , il y a déjà plusieurs semaines , un bus orné d'une pancarte affirmant :
" Pas d'inquiétude , Dieu existe !
Alors bonne journée . "

News Flash : Taliban Waterboards Captured U.S. Soldiers -- Claims " Not Torture " Brian Tamanaha According to reports out of Kabul , the Taliban announced that they have waterboarded three U.S. soldiers taken prisoner .
The Taliban commander asserted that waterboarding is not torture and does not violate the Geneva Convention or U.S. law .
He assured everyone that a medical officer monitored all waterboarding sessions to insure that no permanent damage was done to the soldiers .
In addition , he said they were careful to follow the directions on waterboarding in a SERE training manual they found posted on the internet .
In support of his assertion that waterboarding is not torture , the Taliban commander cited legal analysis produced by the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice .
He pointed out that the authors of this legal analysis are a respected federal judge on the second highest court in America and a professor at a top American law school .
The Taliban commander also referred to the careful legal analysis of a Distinguished Professor of Law who concluded that waterboarding is not torture because U.S. trainers did it to their own troops " hundreds and hundreds of times . "

Zeno Clash 2 is currently in super - early stages , but as soon as there ’s more details we ’ll grab ACE by the collar , punch them three times , then knee them in the face until they tell us all about them .
( CNN ) --
Everything you know about the world of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's most famous character has changed .
Thomas Dekker , Lena Headey and Summer Glau star in " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles . "
In the season finale of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , " John Connor , the boy destined to lead humanity 's battle against Armageddon , gets jolted into the future -- the one he was supposed to lead .
But here , he has no identity .
No one has heard of him .
In this new future , he 'll be fighting alongside his father , his uncle and a girl who looks just like the robot he came into the future to save .
None of them has any idea who he is .
Confused ?
Do n't be .
It was a daring , surprising , brilliant cliffhanger for a show that 's gained a loyal following , particularly among people like me who are in awe of it .
It also opens the door to anyone who has n't discovered this show yet , allowing for a fresh start .
Unfortunately , it may be too late .
For fans , the big question is whether the " Chronicles " will be back , or canceled for inadequate ratings .
We find out in a couple of weeks when Fox announces its schedule .
The speculation online does n't look good .
Ending on this Season 2 cliffhanger would be a shame .
When Fox picked up this " Terminator , " it took on one of the most successful sci- fi franchises in modern entertainment history .
It courted " Terminator " fans , as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep , high - quality TV storytelling .
Ending on this " what happens now " cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise 's history .
But of bigger concern , of course , is that " The Sarah Connor Chronicles " is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last .
And that 's thanks to Josh Friedman , the inspired executive producer .
For him , " Terminator " is n't about special effects and metal monsters .
It 's a family drama ; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future , no matter what the cost .
Without clobbering you with messages , Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know , about living with trauma and moving forward , about the strength and fragility of teenagers , and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children .
Sarah is parental adrenaline personified .
It 's also a show about cancer .
We know Sarah can successfully battle robots , evil people and well - meaning authorities who want her locked up .
But will cancer ultimately do her in ?
Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real - life battle against cancer .
Fans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah ( Lena Headey ) in the new reality .
Did she follow her son into the future ?
If not , what happened to her ?
Friedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now .
He packs episodes with twists you do n't see coming but make sense in retrospect .
He changes up his style , drops lead characters for entire episodes , uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that 's simultaneously believable and eloquent .
He lets major characters die .
And the show 's directors coax subtle , nuanced performances from the actors .
You would n't guess any of this from Fox 's promotions , which have focused too heavily on Cameron ( Summer Glau ) , the robot who helps protect John Connor ( Thomas Dekker ) , sending the signal that it 's a show just for teenage fanboys .
Cameron and John 's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize : the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life .
It 's in some ways the reverse of " Buffy . "
Speaking of which ,
Fox may have done better promoting " Chronicles " as a family drama and then pairing it with one , rather than " Dollhouse , " the latest from " Buffy " creator Joss Whedon .
( Insider question for fans : Is Josh Friedman the new Joss Whedon ?
Weigh in here or here . )
It 's also not clear how , or if , the new movie " Terminator : Salvation " affects the show 's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines , there 's apparently no overlap and no conflict .
The weekly adventures of Sarah and John Connor just are n't done .
There 's too much unanswered , too much left to explore .
So here 's my pitch to network heads :
You can still change the future .
Do n't terminate these " Chronicles " before their time .
What are your thoughts ?
Think Josh is right -- or misguided ?
Weigh in at Facebook or Twitter .

Instead , reports of Afghan civilian casualties

Yesterday 's killings are now in the self - investigation phase , in case
you 're wondering .
The denial phase was short because villagers who
survived the attack trucked about 30 mangled corpses of children , women

land on people .
You do n't deliberately do something with a known

Cheney Confirms Iran-Contra Cover-Up
In a new article by Stephen " W.W. Beauchamp " Hayes , former Vice President Cheney gripes extensively about the Obama administration .
It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
But what you might not expect is that Cheney ( seemingly inadvertently ) confirms that there was a massive cover -up of the Iran - Contra scandal by the Reagan administration :
" I went through the Iran - contra hearings and watched the way administration officials ran for cover and left the little guys out to dry .
And I was bound and determined that was n't going to happen this time . "
Considering that two national security advisers ( Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter ) and the Secretary of Defense ( Caspar Weinberger ) were some of the " little guys " who were prosecuted for Iran - Contra , it 's obvious who Cheney is talking about as hanging them out to dry : President Reagan and Vice President Bush .
Here 's how Robert Parry describes the conclusions of Iran- Contra Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh :
According to Firewall , the cover - up conspiracy took formal shape at a meeting of Reagan and his top advisers in the Situation Room at the White House on Nov. 24 , 1986 .
The meeting 's principal point of concern was how to handle the troublesome fact that Reagan had approved illegal arms sales to Iran in fall 1985 , before any covert-action finding had been signed .
The act was a clear felony -- a violation of the Arms Export Control Act -- and possibly an impeachable offense .
Though virtually everyone at the meeting knew that Reagan had approved those shipments through Israel , Attorney General Edwin Meese announced what would become the cover story .
According to Walsh 's narrative , Meese " told the group that although [ NSC adviser Robert ] McFarlane had informed [ Secretary of State George ]
Shultz of the planned shipment , McFarlane had not informed the president .
... " [ White House chief of staff Don ] Regan , who had heard McFarlane inform the president and who had heard the president admit to Shultz that he knew of the shipment of Hawk [ anti- aircraft ] missiles , said nothing .
Shultz and [ Defense Secretary Caspar ]
Weinberger , who had protested the shipment before it took place , said nothing .
[ Vice President George ]
Bush , who had been told of the shipment in advance by McFarlane , said nothing .
Casey , who [ had ] requested that the president sign the retroactive finding to authorize the CIA - facilitated delivery , said nothing .
[ NSC adviser John ]
Poindexter , who had torn up the finding , said nothing .
Meese asked whether anyone knew anything else that had n't been revealed .
No one spoke . "
When Shultz returned to the State Department , he dictated a note to his aide , Charles Hill , who wrote down that Reagan 's men were " rearranging the record . "
They were trying to protect the president through a " carefully thought out strategy " that would " blame it on Bud " McFarlane .
It really is considerate of Cheney to tell the truth about this .
Here 's an interesting story from Parry 's book Lost History about how he saw firsthand the kind of thing Cheney may be reacting to :
How quickly the investigative space was closing down hit home to me on March 10 , 1987 .
I had been asked to attend a dinner at the home of bureau chief Evan Thomas in an exclusive neighborhood in northwest Washington .
The guests that night were retired Gen.
Brent Scowcroft , who was one of three members of the Tower Commission [ set up by Reagan to investigate Iran - contra ] , and Rep. Dick Cheney , R - Wyo. , who was the ranking House Republican on the congressional Iran - contra committee .
At the table also were some of Newsweek 's top executives and a few of us lowly correspondents .
As the catered dinner progressed and a tuxedoed waiter kept the wine glasses full , the guests were politely questioned .
Scowcroft , a studious - looking man , fidgeted as if he wanted to get something off his chest .
" Maybe I should n't say this but , " he began with a slight hesitation .
He then continued , " If I were advising Admiral Poindexter and he had told the president about the diversion , I would advise him to say that he had n't . "
It 's nice when people at the highest levels of government confirm what everyone already knew , even if it takes a few decades .

ソーシャル化す るOSS開発者たち
ロング・テール理論の名付け親で、雑誌「 Wired」の編集長としても知られるクリス・アンダーソン氏が3月12日付けのブログでオープンソースソフトウェア（OSS）プロジェクトの運営体制に関する誤解を指摘をしている。
アンダーソン氏によれば、多くの人はオープンソースプロジェクトというのは草の根から立ち上がり、自律的に組織化し、民主的に運営されているという誤った認識を持っている。ところが現実はまったく逆で、1人か2人の「慈悲深い独裁者」によって運営されている、という。
これはオープンソースプロジェクトに参加していたり、あるいは日常的に成果物を利用している人であれば、そういうものだと首肯するかもしない。メーリングリストで客観データに基づいて議論したり、リーダーを民主的に選ぶようなプロジェクトもあるかもしれないが、おおかたのオープンソースプロジェクトには、それを開始し、中心に位置し続ける“独裁者”がいるものだ。どの機能や修正の提案を受け入れ、どれ（あるいは誰）を排除するかは、ほんの1人か数人が決める。
「 国家vs企業」とオープンソースの関係
アンダーソン氏の指摘が面白いのは、OSSプロジェクトとソーシャルメディアの違いを、国家と企業の違いとして説明しているところだ。
氏によれば、組織運営における20世紀初頭のパラドックスとして、こういうものがある。国家は民主的に運営するとき一番うまく行くのに、企業というのは独裁的運営がベストであるように見える。これはなぜか？
この問いに対してアンダーソン氏は、マネジメント理論者のチャールズ・バーナード氏の組織論を引いて、こう答えている。企業（OSSプロジェクト）では、“共有された目的”が存在しているのに対して、国家（ソーシャルメディア）というのは、純粋に国民（参加者）に奉仕するためだけに存在している。目的の共有のためには、単一のビジョン、リーダーシップ、トップダウンの管理といったものが必要となる。一方、国民への奉仕は、ボトムアップによるニーズの認識と、集団による政策決定（投票）が有効だというものだ。
OSS プロジェクトというのは企業のようなもので、優れたリーダーが存在するプロジェクトが成功する、というわけだ。
Linuxは開発スタイル自体でイノベーションを持続
OSS プロジェクトはトップダウン――。アンダーソン氏の指摘は、「オープンソース」と聞いても具体的イメージがわかない人に対しての説明としては要を得ているかもしれない。ただ、もしかすると、これは少しずつ古い見方になっていくのではないかと最近感じている。特にLinuxの開発コミュニティは“慈悲深い独裁者”が存在するのとは異なる開発モデルとなっているようにも見える。
Linuxカーネルの開発者として知られる米グーグルのアンドリュー・モートン（Andrew Morton）氏は、2008年7月に来日した際の講演で、こんなことを言った。
Linux開発コミュニティは開発プロセス自体も常にイノベートし続けている。互いに顔を見たことがないこともあるような数千人の参加者が、ネットワーク上で分散して開発を行うというのは、これまで歴史上に1度もなかったことで、これは技術上の問題とは別のチャレンジとなっている。
これは正確な引用ではないが、開発プロセスへの言及が多かったのは私の印象に強く残った。ただ、私には彼が具体的に何を言っているのかよく分からなかったので、そのとき書いた記事はLinuxカーネルにまつわる技術的なコメントを拾ったものとなっている（参考記事：Linuxの次世代ファイルシステムは「バターFS」!?）。
Linuxコミュニティの人々には旧聞に属するかもしれないが、リーナス・トーバルズ氏が2007年5月に米グーグル社内で行った講演（YouTube動画）を見て、ようやくモートン氏が指摘していたことが、いくらか腑に落ちた。この講演はリーナス自身が開発して、Linux開発でも使っている「Git」（ギット）という分散ソースコード管理ツールに関するものだ。同ジャンルのツールと何が違うのか、そしてツールの特性の違いが開発プロセスにおいて重要な意味を持っていることなどを、きわめて明快に説明している。
GitHubととも にGitがブームに
一部 のOSS開発者の間で、この1年ほどGitがブームとなっている。Gitはもともと、Linuxカーネル開発のために、それまで使っていたソースコード管理システムのBitKeeperを置き換える目的でリーナス・トーバルス氏が2005年に作ったものだが、すでにPerl、GNOME、Ruby on Rails、Android、Wine、Fedora、Samba、X.org、VLC、Prototype.jsなど多くの名だたるOSSプロジェクトがソースコードをGit管理へと移行している。明示的にGitを使っていないプロジェクトでも、利用者の便宜を図るためにGitリポジトリを用意していたり、個々の開発者がローカルPCでGitを使っていたりといったことも増えているようだ。
gitはイギリス英語の俗語で、愚か者とか役立たず、嫌なヤツといったほどの意味のようだ（例えば、YouTubeのモンティ・パイソン公式チャンネルで「 Argument Clinic」というコメディを見ると「stupid git！」という用例が聞ける）。リーナスは自嘲気味に「ぼくは自己中心的なクソ野郎で、自分のプロジェクトにはすべて自分の名前にちなんだものを付けるんだ。最初はLinux、次はGit」としている。
そのリーナスが口を極めて罵倒するのが、Git以前からソースコード管理ツールのデファクトスタンダードとなっている「Subversion」（以下、svn）だ。
集中型ソースコード管理システムが抱える問題
リーナスは、svnやその前身といえるCVSのような集中型ソースコード管理システムには、根本的な問題があったという。
「 Subversionほど的外れなプロジェクトはない。スローガンは、正しく作られたCVSというものだけど、CVSを正しくやるなんてできないんだから」。
リーナス はSubversionチームは5年間もの間、ずっとどうでもいい問題領域ばかりを見ていて、本当に大事なものは手つかずだったと批判する。彼によれば、技術上の一番大きな問題はブランチ作成とマージに関するもの、特にマージのほうだ（ソースコードを分岐させて開発の目的や機能ごとに仮の別バージョンを作ることを「ブランチング」とか「ブランチ作成」、「ブランチを切る」と呼び、逆にブランチへ分岐したソースコードを元に開発した改変や修正、追加などを差分としてオリジナルに反映することを「マージ」と呼ぶ）。
「 ブランチを作ることなんて問題じゃない。マージこそが重要なんだ。マージしようとしたある日、巨大で解決の難しいコンフリクトが発生する。Subversion設計者たちは、真性のバカだよ。ああ、この部屋にもいるかもしれませんね……、あんたはバカだ！ （笑） 」
にこやか に 「はっきりと強い意見を言う。それがぼくなんだよ」と話すリーナスに嫌みなところはあまりないが、それにしても集まったグーグル社員に向かって、ものすごい物言いである。
リーナスの指摘は、あちこちのサーバや開発者のPC上にソースコードを管理するレポジトリ（置き場所）がある分散型ソースコード管理こそが唯一の正しいやり方で、特定のサーバ上など単一の中央レポジトリが存在する集中管理方式は、どのようにやったところで多くの問題を抱えることになる、というものだ。
リーナスは、svnプロジェクトがブランチ作成の容易さを喧伝してきたことを批判していう。
「 svnではブランチ作成はO（1）オペレーションだって言うけど、（中略）、たとえブランチ作成に100万分の1秒しかかからないとして、そんなの誰が気にする？
計測するものが間違ってますよ。ブランチ作成なんて、マージができなきゃ意味がないんだから」
svnでは1度はマージができるものの、マージの履歴をすべて保存しないため、次回のマージでは何らかのコンフリクトが発生するのだという。svnではブランチ上で開発した差分のマージは、「とてつもなく悲惨だ」（リーナス）という。特に多くの人が関わるsvnプロジェクトには「絶対に失敗するので、ぼくは近づかない」と話している。
そもそもコミットが困難になりがち
リーナスはsvnのような中央レポジトリを使った開発では、典型的には次のようなことが起こるという。あるアプリケーションの新機能を5人で開発する場合、ブランチを切って、5人がそのレポジトリに対して“コミット”（ソースコードを改変）する。それを最終的に元のマスターソースコードにマージすることになる。ところがこのとき、一般的には非常に厳格なコミット権限の運用ルールがあるものだという。下手をすればマスターのソースコードが壊れて、修復に多くの時間がかかってしまうからだ。
ソースコードに変更を加えたときに、意図せぬバグが入り込んだり、修正した場所以外で不具合が顕在化することがある。こうしたことを防ぐため、中央リポジトリの運用では、コミット権限を限定する。そしてコミット時には必ずテストスイートを走らせて、すべてにパスしなければ絶対にコミットさせないようにするという。
「テストに完全にパスするまで絶対にコミットは許されないんだよね。ところで、テストを実行するには2時間かかるんだよ……、キツイよ」。
「簡単にコミットさせるわけにはいかない。これはどんな会社でもあることで、ここグーグルでも絶対あることでしょう。現実はどうかというと、開発者は1行だけ変更したとき、テストスイートを無視するんです。だって、たった1行の変更で壊れるわけないじゃない！ ……、これは本当にひどいモデルですよ」。
厳格すぎるルールや、守るコストが高すぎるルールは、むしろルール破りの「例外」を多く生むという矛盾をはらむのが世の常だろう。
コンフリクトを誰が解消するのか
2週間にわたって同じサンドボックスで開発していたとしたら、ほかの人が加えた変更が見えない。このため、マージのときにコンフリクトが発生して、その解決に時間がかかる。
「 svnでブランチをマージするときには、1週間前から計画するもんです。これはひどすぎる」
分散ソースコード管理システムでは、各人が自分のレポジトリを管理しているため、互いに他人が作成したパッチを常に取り込んでいくことができる。何かコンフリクトがあっても、問題が小さい間に、そのコードに詳しい開発者が問題を解決できる。リーナスは、Linuxカーネルの開発モデルとして、これが非常にうまく機能すると指摘している。
本質的にコンフリクトは避けようがない。リーナスがパッチを適用するのはたまたまメールが先に届いた順だったりして、そうすると後から届いたパッチが素直に適用できないということが起こるのだという。すでにオリジナルが変わってしまっているからだ。ちなみに、リーナスは過去2年でGitを使って2万2000のファイルを含むLinuxカーネルを管理していて、これまで1日平均4.5回のマージを行っているという。
こうしたとき 、Gitを使った分散開発モデルでは、もう1度そのパッチをリーナスが管理するツリーごと開発者に戻してコンフリクトを解決してもらうことができるのだという。「ネットワーク関連のモジュールとか専門外のものだと、ぼくには判断はできないし、テストもできない。だからぼくにコンフリクトを解決しろなんて土台無理な話」。こういうときリーナスは、パッチを送ってきた人たちにコンフリクトの解決を依頼するのだという。それは単純作業などではないが、何しろパッチを作った本人なので、どうすればいいのかは一番よく分かっている。こうして問題を解決してもらったパッチを再び自分のツリーに取り込めばいい、というわけだ。
分散管理によって消失する 「 政治」というムダ
Gitのような分散管理は、単にミラーがたくさんあるというのとはかなり違う。リーナスはこう言う。「開発者たちのデータを追跡する中央の場所というのはどこにもなく、どこか特定の場所が、ほかのどこかと比べて重要ということはないんです」。
これは、リーナスが管理するLinuxカーネルのソースコードのレポジトリも、それをクローンして私が手元に置いたソースコードのレポジトリも、まったく等価であるという意味だ。ネットワーク上に“オレオレレポジトリ”が増殖することになるが、むしろこれが好都合なのだという。
中央レポジトリのモデルでは、レポジトリにアクセスできる“コミッター”を厳密に管理することになる。これが諸悪の根源となる、というのがリーナスの論理だ。
「 誰もかれもがレポジトリに書いてしまっては困りますよね、ほとんどの人はバカだから。それで表面上バカっぽくなさそうな人たちのグループを作って、そのグループを小さく保つことになるわけです。誰が優秀かなんて簡単に分かりませんからね」
こうして誰にコミット権限を与えるか、誰が何をコミットできるのかということを巡って、心理的なバリアが生まれたり、不毛で終わることのない政治的駆け引きが延々と行われることになるのが、中央レポジトリを使った多くのOSSプロジェクトの姿なのだという。
「分散ソースコード管理では、この問題はなくなるんです。みんな自分のブランチを持つ。なんでも好きなプロジェクトをやればいい。いい仕事だろうと、くだらない仕事だろうと、誰も気にしません。もし優れた仕事だということであれば、後から、“ねえ、これぼくのブランチ、ほかの人のブランチより10倍速いよ。ここからpullするってどう？”と言えばいい。それで実際、他の人はpullするんです」
「こうして、われわれは政治問題を完全に回避……、いや完全にとはいかなくてまた別の政治が出てくるわけですが……、少なくともコミットアクセスに関する諸問題はなくなります。これは非常に大きな問題なので、たとえこの1点だけであっても、あらゆるOSSプロジェクトは下手な分散モデルを利用するべきじゃないんですよ」
独裁者の特権が消え る
各自が自分のレポジトリに対して何らかの作業を行い、それがいいものであると認められれば、それをほかの人が取り込む。これは、冒頭の“独裁者”モデルとは明らかに異なる。よい機能や改変であれば、多くの開発者が取り込み、一般化するという意味で、きわめて民主的なモデルだ。
リーナスが示した中央レポジトリによる開発（左）と分散型レポジトリによる開発（右）の違いの模式図
例えば、リーナスが時間とともに過度に独善的になっていったり、技術的判断が鈍っていくようなことがあれば、いつでもプロジェクトの中心人物は変わりうる。これまで属人的な信望やコミュニティ内の力関係だけでなく、アクセス権というシステム上の仕組み（パスワードやパーミッション）で保証されていた「特権」というものが、分散管理システムでは、まったく消えてなくなってしまう。
これは、自分が始めたプロジェクトですら、そのお株を誰かに奪われてしまう可能性があるということで、一見怖いモデルだ。しかし一方、やっぱり自分のレポジトリをほかの誰かが乗っ取ることも決してできないわけで、これはプロジェクト創始者にも、結果としてプロジェクトの中心の座を奪うことになる開発者にとっても、どちらにとっても悪いことは何もない。「プロジェクトの中心にいる」ということは、あくまでもどれだけほかの開発者から参照され、中心であると思われるかということだけにかかってくる。すでに現在でも、設計・実装能力の高い人や調整能力が高い人が認められる傾向にあるとはいえ、それがよりドラスティックに、システム的な意味で保証されるという意味で、これは非常に健全なモデルかもしれない。
問題は、あちこちに同一プロジェクトのレポジトリが多数あって、そのどれもが本質的に平等である場合、どのように重要なプロジェクトと、そうでない学生の実験プロジェクトのようなノイズを見分けるかということだ。この辺りの妙を、リーナスは「信頼の輪」という言葉を使って説明する。
信頼の輪による分散開発モデル
「非常に多くのブランチがありますが、99.9％は無視していいんです。マージというのは、セキュリティのようにやるものです。信頼の輪。それこそがセキュリティへの唯一のアプローチであり、ソフトウェア開発への唯一のアプローチです」
「 ぼくは誰でも信用するわけじゃない。ほんとのところ、シニカルで疑り深い人間で、ほとんどの人はまったく無能だと思ってるわけです（笑）。分散ソースコード管理のポイントというのは、（自分が管理するレポジトリに対する）コミット権を与えないことにあります」
「ただ、大勢の平均的な群衆の中にも、際だっている人、信頼できる人がいる。5人、10人、15人ほどもいればいい。彼らは傑出しています。ぼくは彼らからpullできるのです」
こうして、各開発者は、それぞれが信頼できる思う優秀な人を見つけることで、全体として信頼のネットワークが構成される。われわれは結局のところ、自分がよく知る人が言うこと、やることを信用して行動したり、情報の取捨選択をする傾向がある。リーナスは、このモデルは社会的動物としての人間の本性に根ざしていると論じる。
「これは単に技術的に簡単だというばかりでなく、この部屋にいるすべての人が非常に深いところでプログラムされている行動の仕方です。われわれの思考方法そのものです。誰も、100人の人間を知ることはできません。5人……、7人、10人とかの親しい友人がいるでしょう、あっ、われわれはギークだから2人ですが（笑）、まあ、ともかくそれが基本的な人間の動き方です。（分散ソースコード管理ツールを使うために）何らかの心理モデルを持ち合わせている必要なんてないんです、われわれはそのようにプログラムされているのですから。これは非常に大きなアドバンテージです」
こうしたことから、リーナスは、Git、Mercurial、BitKeeperなど一連の分散コード管理ツールには大きなメリットがあるという。
Linuxカーネルは最初の10年間はあらゆるファイルを1つの圧縮ファイルにするtarボールで配布していた。その後、商用の分散ソースコード管理ツール「BitKeeper」を使っていたが、ライセンスの問題などから自作のGitへ移行した。Linuxコミュニティは、カーネルそのものの開発だけでなく、開発モデルやリリースプロセス自体も改革を重ねてきた。それが、冒頭に挙げたアンドリュー・モートン氏の発言の意味だと思う。例えば、リリース用のレポジトリを管理する人がいれば、開発者は常にリリースのタイミングに関係なくプロジェクトを進めることができる。
オフラインでも開発継続が可能
これほど分散管理のメリットを喧伝するリーナスも、svnのような集中管理型がうまくいくケースがあることは認めている。そもそもリーナスは前提として「オープンソースこそ正しくソフトウェア開発を行う唯一の方法だ」と言い切っているので、世の中には彼の論理が当てはまらないケースが多いのは当然だ。
「厳密に管理された企業環境であれば、中央レポジトリのほうがうまく行くというのは明らかに真実でしょう。過去35年もうまく行っていました。分散管理ほどでないにしろ、ちゃんと使える」
こう指摘した上で、ローカルPCに各人がレポジトリを持てることのメリットも改めて強調する。
「 異なるロケーションに複数の開発グループがあると、中央レポジトリが問題を抱えるようになるのは不可避です。光ファイバもあるかもしれませんが、いやホントに、ネットワークを見に行かなくていいというのは、めちゃくちゃ大きなパフォーマンス上のメリットです」
自分のレポジトリに対して仕事をするということは、飛行機に乗っていても、まったく通常通りに開発を継続できるということだという。
これ はLinuxカーネルのように数千人が関わるプロジェクトではさらに重要な意味を持っているという。インターネットで“つながっている”といっても、現実問題として実はそこまで“つながって”もいないからだ。ノートPC利用者が増えたことで、むしろオフラインの時間をどうするかは大きな問題だろう。
中央レポジトリではなく、分散型ではローカルPCに好きなだけブランチを作れることから、名前の衝突がなく「test」など、すぐに誰でも付けなくなるような名前をブランチに付けることができるのもメリットだという。また、中央レポジトリ上にブランチを作ると、それはプロジェクトメンバ全員から見えるという、場合によってあまり都合のよくない問題も起こりうる。
Git人気の理由：速さ
Gitを公式に採用するプロジェクトがある一方、こっそり現場がGitを使っているケースも多いのではないかとリーナスは言う。サーバが不要で、いくつかコマンドを叩くだけで、手軽にブランチが作れて、しかも非常に速い。単に新しくブランチを作るだけなら、1つあたり41バイトのファイルが生成されるだけなので、ブランチングは処理的にも心理的にもコストが低い。Git利用者はブランチが大好きで、10個や15個のブランチを平気で作るという。
Gitは複数のコマンドラインツール群からなっており、古き良きUnix文化のにおいがする。Git人気が高まっている理由の1つに、ゴリゴリにCで書かれていてパフォーマンスと小回り重視で書かれたツールであること、というのはあるかもしれない。リーナスも、パフォーマンスへの徹底したこだわりを、分散モデルの重要さと同じぐらい強調している。
0.5秒で差分が取れるのか、同じ作業に30秒かかるのかでは、まったく仕事のやり方が変わってくるという。例えばPythonで書かれたMercurialというものがある。これはGitと同様の分散ソースコード管理ツールでリーナスも評価はしているのだが、パフォーマンスの点でGitがベターだと訴える。「コミットや差分作成に30秒かかるかもしれない。30秒というと、そんなに悪くないと思うかもしれないけど、まじめな話、10分の1秒というのに慣れてしまったら30秒なんて最低なんです」。
大きなプロジェクトで分散開発を行うには、こうしたツールのパフォーマンスが非常に重要になるという。Gitはマージしたときに、デフォルトで、どこに何行の変更が加えられたかなどの統計情報を表示する。そのために、ソースコード全体を走査する。これは比較的重たい処理で、規模が大きいと1、2秒かかるという。しかし、このデフォルトの機能をオフにすることをリーナスは勧めない。「彼らのことは信じていますよ、でも、クスリ飲むのをやめたかもしれないじゃないですか。正直に言いましょう、昨日彼はオッケーなヤツだったかもしれないけど、今日はそうじゃないかもしれないよね」。だから、信頼している開発者から取り寄せたパッチの適用であっても、それによってどういう変更があったかを毎回確実に確認できることは重要だという。だから、差分が1秒で取れるか30秒かかるかというパフォーマンスの違いはクリティカルで、それは開発スタイルを変える重要な要素であるのだ、という。
コミット管理を厳格に行っている開発プロジェクトで、テストケースの実行に時間がかかるために「この程度のコード変更がほかに影響を及ぼすわけがない 」
と
“ 例外 ” に目をつぶってしまうのと同様に、 「 あいつが寄こしたパッチなんだから、まあ……、大丈夫だろう、差分を取るのに30秒かかるとタルいし、今回だけは……エイヤ」という例外に陥る、ということだろうと思う。
リーナスや多くの開発者にとっては、これ以上のパフォーマンスは望めないというぐらい、ローレベルでアルゴリズムやコードを最適化することには大きな意味があるのだろう。Gitのソースコードは読みづらい、そもそもC++じゃないし、文字列処理を自前でやるのはムダなばかりかエラーが入りやすいのではないか、という苦情をメーリングリストで述べた人に対して、リーナスがこてんぱんにやりこめている議論を見れば、どれほどパフォーマンスにこだわっているかということが、よく分かる（ついでに百戦錬磨のハッカーと、コンピュータサイエンスの理論家の違いに関するリーナスの冷めた見方も分かる）。
リーナスによれば、多くのソースコード管理ツールにはチェックサム程度しかないのだという。一方、Gitはソースコードやコミットのログを対象としたハッシュ（SHA1）を取ることによって、ディスクエラーなどでコードのどこかが壊れてしまっていないかや、余計なコードや変更が混入していないこと、これまでの変更履歴が自分が思っているものと確実に同一であることを保証してくれるという。リーナスはバックアップは取らない（なぜなら他人がどんどんミラーしてくれるから）と公言しているが、この160ビットのSHA1の値だけを管理していれば、1000万行を超えるソースコード全体に目を光らせていなくても、夜よく眠ることができるのだという。
多くの開発者 はLinuxカーネルほど大きなプロジェクトに携わっていないかもしれない。しかし、「Gitは軽い」というのは体感できる違いで、それがGit人気の理由の1つになっているのかもしれない。
開発者向 けSNS 、「 GitHub.com 」
Git人気が高まった理由は、処理の軽快さ、モデルの分かりやすさ、ブランチ作成の容易さ、基本的な使い方の簡単さなど、いくつかあるだろう（私はg-i-tがキーボードでタイプのしやすいこととか、ソフトウェア名とコマンド名が一致していて音の響きにインパクトがあるという覚えやすさも重要なのではないかと思う）。
そうし たGit自体の特質もあるが、2008年2月にスタートしたGitレポジトリのホスティングサービス「GitHub.com」の存在抜きにGitの流行は語れないだろう。GitHubは「ソーシャルコーディング」という言葉を自ら冠しているが、これは開発者向けSNSと呼ぶべき興味深いサービスだ。Gitが開発モデルを改革したように、GitHubもまたオープンソースのあり方を変えるポテンシャルを持っているように思う。
GitHubは、単 にGitのレポジトリをホスティングすることで、開発者がバックアップや公開目的で使えるようにしてくれているだけではなく、開発者同士の交流を促すソーシャルな場として成り立っている。アカウントを取得してログインすると（ちなみに作成できるレポジトリの数や容量によって無料、有料さまざまある）、表示されるのは、まるでSNSのマイページだ。
GitHubの画面例
GitHubには、SNSやTwitterなどで一般化したソーシャルな機能が数多く実装されている。気になる開発プロジェクトをウォッチできるだけでなく、特定の開発者を“フォロー”することで、その人がコミットしたり、ほかの人のコミットに対してコメントした内容がライフストリームとしてタイムラインに表示されるようになる。注目されている開発者、例えばRuby on Railsで知られるデビッド・ハイネマイヤー・ハンソン氏などは500人以上のフォロワーを集めている。
その開発者のページに飛べば、どのプロジェクトに対してどのぐらいの頻度でパッチをコミットしているかとうことがグラフで一覧表示される。つまり、誰がどのプロジェクトに、どれぐらいコミットしているか（文字通り注力という意味でもコミットだし、パッチを書いて投稿するという意味でもコミット）がひと目で分かるようになっている。これは裏返して言えば、プロジェクトありきの従来のOSSプロジェクトのあり方が変わっているのだとも言える。これまでは、プロジェクトの周囲に開発者が集まるものと見るのが一般的だったと思うが、GitHubでは開発者という「人間」に対してプロジェクトが紐付いているという印象が強い。開発者たちは、修正や機能追加のためのコードの塊や、たまたま思いついたコードの断片を陰に陽に互いに投げ合うことでコミュニケーションを取ることができる。何かいい機能を開発したと思えば、オリジナルの開発者に対して“
取り込み要求”
を送ることもできる。
もう1つ、GitHubで興味深いのは、プロジェクトのページのかなり目立つ部分に「fork」（分岐）のボタンが付いていることだ。プロジェクト名の横に「fork、watch、download」と並んでいる。ウォッチリストへの追加やダウンロードより、むしろフォークのほうが先にあるのは示唆的だ。ふつうに考えれば、ダウンロードやクローンによってオリジナルを手元に持ってくるだけで十分なケースでも、あまりにも手軽なので、ちょっといじってみたいという程度でもフォークさせることができてしまう。人気の高いプロジェクトでは、フォークだらけになってしまうが、むしろそれがGitの正しい運用スタイルなのだろう。例えばRuby on Railsは、GitHub上でもっとも知られたプロジェクトの1つだが、586個のフォークが存在し、3449人がウォッチリストに入れている。
プロジェクトではなく、人間が主役に
先日、こんな経験をした。リリースされて間もないRuby 1.9.1で、HTMLパーサライブラリとして知られる「Hpricot」を使おうとしたときのことだ。Ruby 1.9.1から標準添付となったライブラリ管理ツールのRubyGemsを使って入れたのだが、どうもうまく動かない。その時点ではHpricotは1.9系に対応していなかったようだった。ところが少し調べると、1.9系に対応済みのHpricotのレポジトリがGitHub上にあることが分かった。
GitHub上に はHpricotのレポジトリを持つ開発者が3人いる。私はwhy氏が管理するものを入れたのだが、このとき、コマンドラインから明示的に開発者名を入れるようになる。「sudo gem install why - hpricot -- source http://gems.github.com」というように。
単 に「 hpricot」ではな く「 why - hpricot」だ。これはwhyさんが開発・管理しているhpricotをインストールする、ということであって、よく顔が見えない「開発者」が作ったhpricotを入れるのとは、かなりニュアンスが異なる。
この辺りの事情を、日本Rubyの会の高橋征義氏とRubyのユーザー会「Asakusa.rb」の松田明氏は、共同執筆した雑誌の特集記事の中でこう記している。
「 （ライブラリ名に開発者名を付けるというGitHubの利用方法を指して）この命名には『パッケージ名のユニーク性を保つための名前空間』という以上の意味があります。今まで単に便利だからで使っていたプロダクトも、『誰が』作っているかをインストール時に強制的に意識させられるのです。さらに、同じプロジェクトにさまざまな変種が存在する場合もあるので、間違った変種をつかまないためにも、プロダクトの進化の歴史を人物ベースで理解する必要が出てきます。このことは、『オープンソースソフトウェアは人が作っているものだ』という原点を強く意識させます」（「 WEB＋DB Press」、技術評論社、vol.48、p22〜p23）。
開発者を名前で認識することが、相応のリスペクトと感謝の気持ちを持つきっかけになる、という。
Git/GitHubというツール・サービスによって、開発者たちがネットワーク上で、今まで以上に柔軟につながり、そのつながりの情報を軸としてプロジェクトを進めたり、分岐させたり、進化させたりしていく。確かに冷静に考えれば、これまでのオープンソースプロジェクトのあり方と、それほど本質的な違いがあるわけではないかもしれない。結局のところ、リーナスが管理するレポジトリに入らない機能はLinuxといえない。
しかし、ツールの速度の違いが、仕事のやり方を変えてしまうという話と同様に、人と人とのつながりが容易になり、レポジトリを作成、維持するコストも劇的に下げてしまうツールの登場は、これまでの開発プロセスに大きな影響を与えていく可能性があるのではないだろうか。私には、Git/GitHubの流行が、非常に大きなトレンドの変化を示しているように思える。あらゆる情報系サイトがソーシャル化し、そのことによって参加者がメリットを得ているのと同様に、開発者コミュニティも、よりソーシャルなツールや概念を取り入れていくことが増えるのかもしれない。

‘ RESPECTING ’ THE OFFICE ….
Former Bush White House chief of staff Andrew Card complained to right - wing talk - show host Michael Medved that President Obama is insufficiently respectful of the presidency .
Apparently , one demonstrates respect for the presidency by their choice of attire :
“ … I found that Ronald Reagan and both President Bushes treated the Oval Office with tremendous respect .
They treated the Office of the Presidency with tremendous respect .
And some of that respect was reflected in how they expected people to behave , how they expected them to dress when they walked into the symbol of freedom for the world , the Oval Office .
And yes , I ’m disappointed to see the casual , laissez faire , short sleeves , no shirt and tie , no jacket , kind of locker room experience that seems to be taking place in this White House and the Oval Office . ”
“ Locker - room experience . ”
Card was n’t kidding .
I think there are two general angles to this .
The first is that Obama is n’t especially concerned about the formality of one ’s clothing .
He was photographed at his desk wearing a shirt and tie , and some of the political establishment gasped because he was seen sans jacket .
( Obama , a Hawaii native , reportedly prefers a warm office .
David Axelrod said , “ You could grow orchids in there . ” )
Suits are common on weekdays , but the president issued an informal edict for “ business casual ” on weekends .
That , apparently , means slacks and a buttoned - down shirt .
Traditionalists may not approve of Obama ’s easy - going style , but we ’re a long way from a “ laissez faire locker - room experience . ”
A frat house it is n’t .
The other thing to consider here is exactly how one “ respects ” the presidency .
For Card and others who served with Bush , it ’s about choice of clothing .
For those who serve with Obama , it ’s about honoring institutional limits and the rule of law .
Or , put another way , where exactly does a loyal Bushie get off talking about “ respecting ” the presidency ?
Did George W. Bush always wear a coat and tie ?
Sure .
Good for him .
But while he was wearing nice clothes and demanding that his staff do the same , he also oversaw a scandal - plagued White House that trashed constitutional norms and routinely ignored the laws that the president twice swore to faithfully execute .
One respects the office by honoring its place in a constitutional system , not by wearing a suit .
If you 've used Windows for any amount of time , you 've already had to deal with the dreaded ( Not Responding ) frozen application — so instead of using task manager , why not create a shortcut to auto - kill them ?
Advertisement
The HaxAttack weblog writes up a great tip to create a batch file that automatically kills any applications with a status of Not Responding , but you can actually just create a shortcut directly , omitting the batch file altogether .
To create your own quick - killing mechanism , just create a new shortcut anywhere , using this as the location :
taskkill.exe /f / fi " status eq not responding "
Once you are done , you can change the icon , or even assign a shortcut key in the properties dialog — just make sure the shortcut is on your desktop or in the start menu if you want the hotkey to work , since Windows hotkeys do n't work in the Quick Launch .
Thanks , Cyrus !

Good for Shepard Smith , said Rod Dreher in Beliefnet .
Fox News ’ star anchor went “ ballistic ” in a webcast this week , saying , “ This is America !
We do not f--- ing torture ! ”
And he ’s not the only one on the Right who ’s realizing “ we have to face the ugly truth about what we did ” in the name of fighting terrorism .
( Watch Shepard Smith call torture un-American on Fox News Channel )
Smith said he does n’t “ give a rat ’s ass ” whether a harsh interrogation method works , said Noel Sheppard in Newsbusters.org .
“ Even if it helps save lives , Shep ? ”
It ’s amazing how the farther we get from 9/11 , the more people “ are forgetting that we are indeed at war with terrorists . ”
People are n’t forgetting , said David Quigg in The Huffington Post , they just do n’t buy into the Dick Cheney mind - set that the ends justify barbaric means .
Even if waterboarding and other forms of torture extracted useful information — and that ’s definitely debatable — it ’s “ wrong . ”
Cheney wraps himself in the flag , but Shepard Smith — “ of the dreaded Fox News ” — is the one who ’s being “ patriotic . ”

When the Israelis ’ controversial twenty - two - day military campaign in Gaza ended , on January 18th , it also seemed to end the promising peace talks between Israel and Syria .
The two countries had been engaged for almost a year in negotiations through intermediaries in Istanbul .
Many complicated technical matters had been resolved , and there were agreements in principle on the normalization of diplomatic relations .
The consensus , as an ambassador now serving in Tel Aviv put it , was that the two sides had been “ a lot closer than you might think . ”
Iran is a crucial factor motivating renewed Israeli - Syrian negotiations .
Illustration by Guy Billout
At an Arab summit in Qatar in mid-January , however , Bashar Assad , the President of Syria , angrily declared that Israel ’s bombing of Gaza and the resulting civilian deaths showed that the Israelis spoke only “ the language of blood . ”
He called on the Arab world to boycott Israel , close any Israeli embassies in the region , and sever all “ direct or indirect ties with Israel . ”
Syria , Assad said , had ended its talks over the Golan Heights .
Nonetheless , a few days after the Israeli ceasefire in Gaza , Assad said in an e-mail to me that although Israel was “ doing everything possible to undermine the prospects for peace , ” he was still very interested in closing the deal .
“ We have to wait a little while to see how things will evolve and how the situation will change , ” Assad said .
“ We still believe that we need to conclude a serious dialogue to lead us to peace . ”
American and foreign government officials , intelligence officers , diplomats , and politicians said in interviews that renewed Israeli - Syrian negotiations over the Golan Heights are now highly likely , despite Gaza and the elections in Israel in February , which left the Likud Party leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , at the head of a coalition that includes both the far right and Labor .
Those talks would depend largely on America ’s willingness to act as the mediator , a role that could offer Barack Obama his first — and perhaps best — chance for engagement in the Middle East peace process .
A senior Syrian official explained that Israel ’s failure to unseat Hamas from power in Gaza , despite the scale of the war , gave Assad enough political room to continue the negotiations without losing credibility in the Arab world .
Assad also has the support of Arab leaders who are invested in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani , * the ruler of Qatar , said last month when I saw him in Doha that Assad must take any reasonable steps he can to keep the talks going .
“ Syria is eager to engage with the West , ” he said , “ an eagerness that was never perceived by the Bush White House .
Anything is possible , as long as peace is being pursued . ”
A major change in American policy toward Syria is clearly under way .
“ The return of the Golan Heights is part of a broader strategy for peace in the Middle East that includes countering Iran ’s influence , ” Martin Indyk , a former American Ambassador to Israel , who is now the director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy , at the Brookings Institution , said .
“ Syria is a strategic linchpin for dealing with Iran and the Palestinian issue .
Do n’t forget , everything in the Middle East is connected , as Obama once said . ”
A former American diplomat who has been involved in the Middle East peace process said , “ There are a lot of people going back and forth to Damascus from Washington saying there is low - hanging fruit waiting for someone to harvest . ”
A treaty between Syria and Israel “ would be the start of a wide - reaching peace - implementation process that will unfold over time . ”
He added , “ The Syrians have been ready since the 1993 Oslo Accords to do a separate deal . ”
The new Administration now has to conduct “ due diligence ” : “ Get an ambassador there , or a Presidential envoy .
Talk to Bashar , and speak in specifics so you ’ll know whether or not you ’ve actually got what you ’ve asked for .
If you ’re vague , do n’t be surprised if it comes back to bite you . ”
Many Israelis and Americans involved in the process believe that a deal on the Golan Heights could be a way to isolate Iran , one of Syria ’s closest allies , and to moderate Syria ’s support for Hamas and for Hezbollah , the Lebanese Shiite group .
Both Hamas and Hezbollah are listed as terrorist organizations by the U.S. State Department .
There is a competing view : that Assad ’s ultimate goal is not to marginalize Iran but to bring it , too , into regional talks that involve America — and perhaps Israel .
In either scenario , Iran is a crucial factor motivating each side .
These diplomatic possibilities were suggested by Senator John Kerry , of Massachusetts , the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , who met with Assad in Damascus in February — his third visit since Assad took office , in 2000 .
“ He wants to engage with the West , ” Kerry said in an interview in his Senate office .
“ Our latest conversation gave me a much greater sense that Assad is willing to do the things that he needs to do in order to change his relationship with the United States .
He told me he ’s willing to engage positively with Iraq , and have direct discussions with Israel over the Golan Heights — with Americans at the table .
I will encourage the Administration to take him up on it .
“ Of course , Syria will not suddenly move against Iran , ” Kerry said .
“ But the Syrians will act in their best interest , as they did in their indirect negotiations with Israel with Turkey ’s assistance — and over the objections of Iran . ”
President Assad was full of confidence and was impatiently anticipating the new Administration in Washington when I spoke to him late last year in Damascus .
Trained as an ophthalmologist , partly in London , he took over the Presidency in 2000 , after the death of his father , Hafez Assad , who amassed enormous personal power in thirty years of brutal rule .
Bashar had not expected a life as the Syrian leader — his older brother , Basil , who was killed in an accident in 1994 , had been groomed to replace their father .
Bashar , thirty - four when he became President , was said to be a lesser figure than either of them .
He has since consolidated his position — both by modernizing the economy and by suppressing domestic opposition — and , when we spoke , it was clear that he had come to relish the exercise of power .
Assad said that if America ’s leaders “ are seeking peace they have to deal with Syria and they have to deal with our rights , which is the Golan Heights . ”
In the Six - Day War , in 1967 , Israel seized the Golan Heights , about four hundred and fifty square miles of territory that is rich in Biblical history and , crucially , in water .
It includes part of the Jordan River Valley and a plateau overlooking the river which extends to Mt. Hermon , in the north .
Syria was left with no access to the Sea of Galilee and the upper Jordan River .
Roughly twenty thousand Israeli settlers live there , and they have built towns , vineyards , and boutique hotels in its valleys and strategic heights .
Assad said , “ The land is not negotiable , and the Israelis know that we are not going to negotiate the line of 1967 . ”
But he suggested that compromises were possible .
“ We only demarcate the line , ” he said .
“ We negotiate the relations , the water , and everything else . ”
Many who are close to the process assume that an Israeli - Syrian settlement would include reparations for the Israelis in the Golan Heights , and , for a time , the right of access to the land .
Assad said , “ You discuss everything after the peace and getting your land .
Not before . ”
If Israel wants a settlement that goes beyond the Golan Heights , Assad said , it will have to “ deal with the core issue ” — the situation in the West Bank and Gaza — “ and not waste time talking about who is going to send arms to Hezbollah or Hamas .
Wherever you have resistance in the region , they will have armaments somehow .
It is very simple . ”
He added , “ Hezbollah is in Lebanon and Hamas is in Palestine . . . .
If they want to solve the problem of Hezbollah , they have to deal with Lebanon .
For Hamas , they have to deal with Gaza .
For Iran , it is not part of the peace process anyway . ”
Assad went on , “ This peace is about peace between Syria and Israel . ”
In his e-mail after the Gaza war , Assad emphasized that it was more than ever “ essential that the United States play a prominent and active role in the peace process . ”
What he needed , Assad said , was direct contact with Obama .
A conference would not be enough : “ It is most natural to want a meeting with President Obama . ”
If the Netanyahu government is to trade land for peace , it needs to be assured of domestic political support — and help from Washington .
In September , 2007 , Israel destroyed what it claimed was a potential Syrian nuclear - weapons reactor during a cross - border raid , an action that won the approval of the Israeli public .
( Syria insisted there was no reactor on the site . )
At the time , the two countries were already laying the groundwork for the indirect negotiations .
In December , 2008 , Ehud Olmert , who was then Prime Minister , flew to Ankara , Turkey , and conducted more than five hours of intense talks on the return of the Golan Heights , with the mediation of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who was often in direct telephone contact with Bashar Assad .
But Olmert ’s standing was tarnished , both inside Israel , by a series of criminal investigations that led to his resignation ( he has denied any wrongdoing ) , and outside Israel , by the Gaza war , which began days after he left Ankara .
Netanyahu ’s coalition government will include , as Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , the head of the Israel Beytenu Party , who has argued for a measure , aimed at Israeli - Arabs , requiring citizens to take loyalty oaths or forfeit many of their rights , and has rejected any land - for - peace agreement with Syria ( though he is open to trading other territories ) ; and , as Defense Minister , Ehud Barak , the Labor Party leader , who has consistently supported talks with Syria .
Current opinion polls indicate that the majority of Israelis do not support a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights .
Netanyahu himself — in what was widely seen as a plea for votes — declared two days before the elections that he would not return the Golan Heights .
“ I thought you were my gay best friend . ”

Daniel Levy , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation , who served on Israeli peace delegations in 1995 and 2001 and also as an adviser to Prime Minister Barak , said that Netanyahu “ may have huge coalition problems , not least within his own Likud Party , ” and that he “ may have to publicly disavow any land - for - peace agreement , given his political position .
Can the Syrians swallow that ?
If they can ’t , it means that the only option left will be secret talks . ”
Levy added , “ Barak ’s appointment does not change the fundamental dynamics of the coalition , but it means that Bibi [ Netanyahu ] has a Defense Minister who will be on board for dealing with Syria , who wants to deal with Syria — and who also will be on board for doing it in secret . ”
Itamar Rabinovich , a former Israeli Ambassador to Washington , who was Israel ’s chief negotiator with Syria under Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and informally advises his government on Syrian issues , argued that the war in Gaza had not changed Israel ’s essential interest in a Golan Heights settlement : “ Gaza is Gaza , and I say that Bashar Assad definitely wants to go ahead with the talks .
And he may find a partner in Bibi Netanyahu .
Bibi would prefer to make a deal with Syria rather than with the Palestinians . ”
But if the talks are to proceed , Rabinovich said , “ they will have to be transformed to direct negotiations . ”
This would require the support and involvement of the Obama Administration .
Rabinovich said that he thought Obama , like Netanyahu , “ after weighing the pros and cons , will see a Golan Heights settlement as being more feasible ” than a deal with the Palestinians .
“ The talks are serious , and there is a partner . ”
The former American diplomat , who is an expert on the Golan Heights , said that it would take between three and five years to evacuate Israelis living there .
“ During that time , if there is a party moderating the agreement — the U.S. , perhaps — it would be necessary for that party to stay engaged , to make sure that the process stays on course , ” he said .
This factor may explain why Assad wants the U.S. involved .
“ The key point is that the signing of an agreement is just the beginning — and third parties are needed to reinforce the agreement . ”
Obama ’s Middle East strategy is still under review in the State Department and the National Security Council .
The Administration has been distracted by the economic crisis , and impeded by the large number of key foreign - and domestic - policy positions yet to be filled .
Obama ’s appointment of former Senator George Mitchell as his special envoy for Middle East diplomacy , on January 22nd , won widespread praise , but Mitchell has yet to visit Syria .
Diplomatic contacts with Damascus were expanded in late February , and informal exchanges with Syria have already taken place .
According to involved diplomats , the Administration ’s tone was one of dialogue and respect — and not a series of demands .
For negotiations to begin , the Syrians understood that Washington would no longer insist that Syria shut down the Hamas liaison office in Damascus and oust its political leader , Khaled Meshal .
Syria , instead , will be asked to play a moderating role with the Hamas leadership , and urge a peaceful resolution of Hamas ’s ongoing disputes with Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
The Syrians were also told that the Obama Administration was reëvaluating the extent of Syria ’s control over Hezbollah .
( The White House did not respond to requests for comment . )
The United States has been involved in negotiations over the Golan Heights before , notably those brokered by Bill Clinton in Shepherdstown , West Virginia , in 2000 .
Those talks , despite their last - minute collapse over border disputes , among other issues , provided the backbone for the recent indirect negotiations .
Martin Indyk , who advised Clinton at Shepherdstown , said that those talks were about “ territory for peace . ”
Now , he said , “ it ’s about territory for peace and strategic realignment . ”
During the long campaign for the White House , Obama often criticized Syria for its links to terrorism , its “ pursuit of weapons of mass destruction , ” and its interference in Lebanon , where Syria had troops until 2005 and still plays a political role .
( Assad dismissed the criticisms in his talk with me : “ We do not bet on speeches during the campaign . ” )
But Obama said that he would be willing to sit down with Assad in the first year of his Presidency without preconditions .
He also endorsed the Syrian peace talks with Israel .
“ We must never force Israel to the negotiating table , but neither should we ever block negotiations when Israel ’s leaders decide that they may serve Israeli interests , ” he said at the annual conference , last June , of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
“ As President , I will do whatever I can to help Israel succeed in these negotiations . ”
The differences between Obama ’s Syria policies and those of the Administration of George W. Bush have attracted relatively little attention .
In December , 2006 , the Iraq Study Group called for direct talks with Syria .
In a speech soon afterward , Bush explained why he disagreed .
“ I think it would be counterproductive at this point to sit down with the Syrians , because Syria knows exactly what it takes to get better relations , ” he said .
The President then provided a list : stop its support for Hamas and Hezbollah ; stop meddling in Lebanon ; coöperate in the investigation of the murder , in 2005 , of Rafik Hariri , Lebanon ’s former Prime Minister ; and stop serving as “ a transit way for suicide bombers heading into Iraq . ”
( The Bush Administration accused Syria of failing to monitor its long border with Iraq , and , last October , staged a raid into Syria , killing eight people , one of whom was said to be a senior Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia operative .
A huge number of Iraqi refugees have also fled to Syria , straining the economy . )
Bush added dismissively , “ When people go sit down with Bashar Assad , the President of Syria , he walks out and holds a press conference , and says , ‘ Look how important I am .
People are coming to see me ; people think I ’m vital . ’ ”
An official who served with the Bush Administration said that late last year the Administration thought it was unrealistic to engage Syria on the Golan Heights .
“ The Bush view was , if we support the talks , with no preconditions , what are we going to say to our supporters in Lebanon who are standing up to Hezbollah ?
‘ You stood up to Hezbollah ’ — and where are we ? ”
Assad noted late last year that the Bush White House did not “ have to trust me , because they are not involved in peace anyway .
. . . They created a lot of problems around the world and they exacerbated the situation in every hot spot [ and ] made the world more vulnerable to terrorism .
This is the most important thing , ” he said .
“ Nobody can say the opposite . ”
As the Bush era wound down , U.S. allies were making their own openings to Syria .
In mid-November , David Miliband , the British Foreign Secretary , distressed the White House by flying to Damascus for a meeting with Assad .
They agreed that Britain and Syria would establish a high - level exchange of intelligence .
Vice - President Dick Cheney viewed the move by Britain — “ perfidious Albion , ” as he put it — as “ a stab in the back , ” according to a former senior intelligence official .
In his e-mail , Assad praised the diplomatic efforts of former President Jimmy Carter .
“ Carter is most knowledgeable about the Middle East and he does not try to dictate or give sermons , ” Assad said .
“ He sincerely is trying to think creatively and find solutions that are outside the box . ”
Carter ’s calls for engagement with Hamas have angered many in Israel and America .
In “ We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land , ” published in January , Carter described Syria as “ a key factor in any overall regional peace . ”
Last December , Carter visited Syria , and met not only with President Assad but with Khaled Meshal , the Hamas leader .
A senior White House official confirmed that the Obama transition team had been informed in advance of Carter ’s trip to Syria , and that Carter met with Obama shortly before the Inauguration .
The two men — Obama was accompanied only by David Axelrod , the President ’s senior adviser , who helped arrange the meeting ; and Carter by his wife , Rosalynn — discussed the Middle East for an hour .
Carter declined to discuss his meeting with Obama , but he did write in an e-mail that he hoped the new President “ would pursue a wide - ranging dialogue as soon as possible with the Assad government . ”
An understanding between Washington and Damascus , he said , “ could set the stage for successful Israeli - Syrian talks . ”

FAIRFAX COUNTY , Virginia ( CNN ) --
When she was as low as she thought she could go , welfare recipient Rosslin Davis found herself going high - tech .
Davis is part of an experimental welfare program that is turning the down - and - out into computer programmers to help tackle the year 2000 bug .
Called TekAid , the program combines the resources of Virginia Tech , the government and Mitretek -- a technology think tank .
Davis , a widowed mother of four , had lost her job in a department store and her house before she was chosen to join the first group of 51 welfare recipients to undergo TekAid 's intensive , two - month training .
" It 's not so hard for me , because I really want to know how to debug a computer , " said Davis , who has already received one job offer .
Davis said her children are as excited as she is about her progress .
Davis , a widow , is raising four children
" I promised my son , Joshua , when I started that every day I would teach him what I learned , and we 've been doing that every night , " she said .
" So he 's going to be the youngest programmer ever . "
Suzanne Blevins , a divorced mother of five , said she was unable to support herself before going through the TekAid training .
She recently accepted a job with Computer Science Corporation after meeting with company recruiters at a TekAid job fair .
TekAid " helped me to find a better career so I can become self - sufficient and not have to be on the welfare system , " Blevins said .
Employers are also praising the program .
" I think these folks , once you get them , would be more loyal to you than folks who take life and everything for granted , " said Pat Pascucci , a recruiter for American Systems Corporation .

SYDNEY ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Wine connoisseurs who turned their noses up at screwtop caps replacing corks now have a new innovative to sniff at -- plastic wine bottles designed to resemble glass but with a 29 percent smaller carbon footprint .
Australian wine maker Foster ’s is going green by bottling two of its Wolf Blass brand wines in recyclable ( PET ) 750 ml bottles using a new technology that it hopes will overcome previous resistance to wine bottled in lightweight plastic .
A crisp dry white blend and a shiraz cabernet sauvignon will go on sale in plastic bottles across Australia next week priced at $ 17 each and marketed under the name “ Green Label . ”
Oliver Horn , global brand director of Wolf Blass wines , said new technology called diamond clear enabled the company to make clear plastic bottles that looked like glass and had a shelf life of 12 months .
But he admitted it was a “ communications challenge ” to get consumers to accept wine in plastic bottles , so Foster ’s was spending $ 1 million on an campaign showing that tests had proved these bottles cut greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent .
“ Wine is a very traditional product .
People were skeptical about the change from corks to screwtops , ” Horn told Reuters .
“ But if we can prove that these bottles are not just more convenient but also a greener alternative then I think consumers may accept them . ”
For although higher - end wines are often meant to be kept for years , Horn said that research showed 92 percent of wine was consumed within 48 hours of purchase .
“ So this is not about niche consumers .
This is targeted at the vast majority of wine consumers as everyone now is environmentally aware , ” said Horn .
Horn said previous attempts in Canada and Britain to sell wine in plastic bottles had not done that well as the bottles were a darker color and only had a nine - month shelf - life .
The earlier bottles also did not have scientific backing of their greener status but were justified in terms in convenience and reduced packaging waste .
“ But this time we have monitored the carbon emissions and ascertained how much difference the PET bottle makes , ” said Horn .
“ Our campaign aims to build awareness on how we have cut 29 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while there is no trade off in quality or taste . ”
Horn said Foster ’s would be testing the new products in the Australian market over the next year before making any decisions on trialing these bottles in the export market .

Two days ago , during an interview on Fox News Sen .
Joe Lieberman proclaimed his support for waterboarding , but on Wednesday he , John McCain , and Lindsey Graham signed a letter to President Obama that stated their opposition to waterboarding .
The letter argued against prosecuting the authors of the memos , and also opposed waterboarding , “ We disagree , however , with Administration statements suggesting that the lawyers who provided such counsel may now be open to prosecution .
Some of the legal analysis included in the OLC memos released last week was , we believe , deeply flawed .
We have also strongly opposed the overly coercive interrogation techniques , including waterboarding , that these memos deemed legal .
We do not believe , however , that legal analysis should be criminalized , as proposals to prosecute government lawyers suggest . ”
Here is the video of what Lieberman said two days ago :

Yep , that is the same Joe Lieberman arguing that the effects of waterboarding are psychological , so the government should be allowed to use it .
I do n’t get it .
Waterboarding is torture on one day , but not the next ?
Does Lieberman even know his position ?
I understand that Lieberman signed the letter because he does n’t want Obama to prosecute the attorneys , but he should have read it first .
If Lieberman supports torture , then he should not have signed McCain ’s letter .
McCain clearly opposes waterboarding , so Joe should have known that some statement of McCain ’s position on the issue would be included .
Lieberman has done so much flip - flopping between the two parties that no one should be surprised if Lieberman himself does n’t know his position on waterboarding .
I think that if the Democrats get over 60 seats in the Senate next year , they ought to help Lieberman end his confusion by showing him the door .
The only reason he is caucusing with the Democrats is so that he can keep his committee chairmanship .
He belongs with the GOP , so the Democrats should send him there .

The Federal Opposition says the Government should consider offering temporary protection visas to Sri Lankan Tamils affected by the civil war in their country .
Since the war ended , aid groups have warned that hundreds of thousands of civilians are homeless and refugee camps are struggling to cope under the strain .
The Australian Government says it too is concerned but so far it is refusing to say whether there are any plans to offer Tamils asylum in Australia outside of the existing refugee program .
Opposition immigration spokeswoman Sharman Stone told The World Today Australia needs to consider responding as it did in the Balkans crisis and in East Timor by offering temporary protection to Tamils .
" When we were in government in May 1999 we responded to the Balkan war crisis and we brought out 4,000 Kosovars under what are called ' safe haven visas ' , " she said .
" There 's a lot of options for this Government ... to think about and it really staggers me that they do n't seem to be talking about the options which are on the statutes in Australia . "
She said the Migration Act 1958 has provisions for the " safe haven visas " .
" These visas give you a period of time in Australia while your country settles , " she said .
" For example with the Kosovars , they came out in May 1999 and they returned on special flights in April 2000 . "
She said the Tamils have integrated into Australian society as well as immigrants from other countries have .
" We have one of the most successful multicultural countries on earth , " she said .
" Not only have our Tamils been great Australians ; we have our people from the Punjab , our people from Africa now .
" We are a place that has extraordinary success in offering a tolerant , safe country for new settlers .
" I 'm quite staggered that this Government does n't seem to be entertaining any of the options that are available in Australian law and just seems to be talking about , 'oh we need to work out why these people want to leave the country ' . "
Security concerns
Ms Stone said any worries that members of the rebel Tamil Tigers may infiltrate Australia are unfounded because of the Department of Immigration 's procedures .
" That 's always the risk , when you talk about any migration program or refugee humanitarian program , " she said .
" That 's why our own Department of Immigration has to be very good at identifying people according to their security , health and of course identification factors .
" We did n't do so well it would seem after the second World War where it appears that numbers of people who were in fact war criminals ... a few [ got ] into Australia .
" It 's extraordinarily hard to be 100 per cent successful in your screening , but every country has to do that . "
A better Sri Lanka
She says assisting the Tamils now could help contribute to a better unified Sri Lanka when it rebuilds itself as a new , democratic country .
" After 25 or 27 years of the most terrible civil war , one can only hope that this Government is serious and has real convictions about a future united and multicultural country , " she said .
" That 's why it 's important that if this Government does offer a temporary safe haven it would be just that , a temporary safe haven so the Tamils could go back home and enjoy that united country , using their skills , their business acumen , their professional skills if they have them , to help rebuild that country .
" That 's very important . "
The 1842 book , the first volume of WFP Napier 's four - volume " History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France From the Year 1807 to the Year 1814 " , was returned to a Washington and Lee University library in Lexington , Virginia by a friend of one of the soldier 's descendants .
In a " Solomonic decision , " said Ed Morrissey in Hot Air , California 's Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld Proposition 8 , reversing the same court ’s earlier declaration of gays ' right to marry .
“ The court split the baby , figuratively speaking , ” by letting stand 18,000 same - sex marriages conducted before voters approved Prop .
8 . The court did the right thing — the constitutional amendment banning gay marriage passed fair and square , but that ’s no reason to dissolve marriages conducted before it became law .
Leaving 18,000 gay marriages on the books assures that the Supreme Court will have to revisit the issue , said John Arovosis in AmericaBlog .
The fact that those marriages can exist without destroying society “ will call into question , if not outright destroy , the bigots ' argument for why the state has an interest in banning gays from getting married . ”
“ Politically , ” the court 's Prop. 8 decision was perfect , said Andrew Sullivan in The Atlantic .
“ It would have been dreadful if voters were retroactively told their valid vote was somehow null and void , ” and “ equally dreadful if those couples lawfully wed were subsequently forced into divorce by the court . ”
Now these couples and their families will become the focus of the debate , “ as they should be . ”
( CNN ) -- Around 1,000 people accused of being witches in Gambia have been locked up in secret detention centers and forced to drink a dangerous hallucinogenic potion , according to human rights organization Amnesty International .
Amnesty claims Gambian President Yahya Jammeh , pictured in 2006 , invited " witch doctors " to the West African nation .
At least two people have died after drinking the liquid while many more have suffered serious kidney problems .
Others suffered injuries as a result of being severely beaten , Amnesty said Wednesday as it called on authorities to " put an immediate stop to the witch - hunting campaign . "
Amnesty claimed Gambian President Yahya Jammeh had invited " witch doctors " -- believed to be from neighboring Guinea -- to the West African nation following the death of his aunt .
Jammeh , a former soldier who has ruled Gambia since leading a military coup in 1994 , is reported to believe that witchcraft was involved in her death , according to Amnesty .
CNN contacted State House , the presidential residence in the Gambian capital , Banjul , but no - one was available to comment .
" I have no information , " a woman told CNN .
Victims and their relatives tell Amnesty that " witch doctors " accompanied by police , soldiers and security forces have been visiting villages and seizing people accused of being witches by force and at gunpoint .
Members of Jammeh 's personal guard , known as " green boys , " are also alleged to have taken part in the campaign .
In the most recent incident on March 9 , 300 people from the village of Sintet were forced to go to a farm owned by Jammehk , Amnesty said .
One of those seized said he had been held for five days and forced to drink " dirty water " containing poisonous herbs which caused instant diarrhoea and vomiting .
" I experienced and witnessed such abuse and humiliation .
I cannot believe that this type of treatment is taking place in Gambia .
It is from the dark ages , " the victim told Amnesty .
Hundreds of Gambians have also fled to neighboring Senegal following attacks on their villages , according to Amnesty .
It also said it was concerned that a prominent opposition lawmaker , Halifa Sallah , who was arrested earlier this month after investigating the witchcraft claims for a newspaper , could be at risk of being tortured while in custody .
Halifa , a former presidential candidate , heads the People 's Democratic Organization of Independence and Socialism and is minority leader in Gambia 's national assembly .
Although the successful campaign to keep Amb. Charles " Chas " Freeman out of a top intelligence post marked a surface victory for the pro-Israel hardliners who opposed him , the long - term political implications of the Freeman affair appear far more ambiguous .
Freeman ’s withdrawal has provoked growing  if belated  media scrutiny of the operations of the so - called " Israel Lobby , " and aroused protests from a number of prominent mainstream political commentators who allege that he was the target of a dishonest and underhanded smear campaign that , among other things , accused him of shilling for the governments of Saudi Arabia and China .
For the neoconservatives who led the charge against Freeman ’s appointment , his withdrawal may therefore prove to be both a tactical victory and a strategic defeat .
At the same time , the Freeman affair has highlighted the yawning disconnect between the career professionals in the intelligence and diplomatic communities , from whom Freeman enjoyed strong support , and political leaders in Congress and the White House , none of whom came to his defense publicly .
Freeman , a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia who has been a vocal critic of Israeli policies in the occupied territories , withdrew from consideration as chairman of the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) on Tuesday .
He did not go quietly into the night , however , releasing a statement in which he struck back at his critics .
" I do not believe the National Intelligence Council could function effectively while its chair was under constant attack by unscrupulous people with a passionate attachment to the views of a political faction in a foreign country , " Freeman wrote .
" There is a special irony in having been accused of improper regard for the opinions of foreign governments and societies by a group so clearly intent on enforcing adherence to the policies of a foreign government  in this case , the government of Israel . "
The motives for the anti-Freeman campaign are themselves a matter of debate .
Virtually all of his chief attackers were neoconservatives , whose views generally reflect those of the Israel ’s right - wing Likud Party , and other reflexive defenders of Israeli government policies .
Many observers viewed it as self - evident that their hostility to him was based on his often bluntly - spoken belief that U.S. and Israel ’s interests in the Middle East were not necessarily convergent .
In the media , the campaign against Freeman was waged mainly by neoconservative organs , such as the Weekly Standard and the National Review , and by The New Republic , a generally liberal weekly that , however , routinely attacks Israel ’s critics .
In Congress , it was led by politicians such as Sen. Chuck Schumer , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , and Rep. Mark Kirk , all of whom have strong ties to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , a powerful lobby group whose members range from far - right supporters of the militant settlement movement in Israel to more moderate factions sympathetic to the relatively centrist Kadima and Labor Parties .
Freeman ’s critics sought to portray their attacks on him as rooted not in his criticisms of Israel but in his allegedly compromising ties to Saudi Arabia and China , including his leadership of a think tank that was partially funded by a member of the Saudi royal family and his service on an advisory board of China ’s largest oil company .
In the mainstream media , however , few seemed to buy into these claims .
The most widely read U.S. newspapers , which had all but ignored the controversy as it raged in the " blogosphere , " attributed his withdrawal to the unacceptability of his views on Israel policy  in the process going further than ever before in putting the Israel lobby in the national spotlight .
The New York Times headlined its story " Israel Stance Was Undoing of Nominee for Intelligence Post , " while the Washington Post confirmed that AIPAC , which had insisted it had no position on Freeman ’s appointment , had indeed quietly provided critical material about him to inquiring reporters .
A Los Angeles Times editorial explicitly referenced " the Israel lobby " as the force behind Freeman ’s withdrawal , adding , " We do not believe that Israel should be immune from criticism or that there is room for only one point of view in our government . "
And while the Post ’s editorial page , like the neoconservative Wall Street Journal , had hosted anti-Freeman op - eds early in the campaign against him , its veteran political columnist , David Broder  long viewed as the embodiment of Washington centrism  praised the former ambassador as " an able public servant " and wrote that " [ t ] he Obama administration has just suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the lobbyists the president vowed to keep in their place . "
Broder was not the only prominent centrist to react harshly to the anti-Freeman campaign .
Others included the Broder ’s fellow Post columnist , David Ignatius , The Atlantic ’s Andrew Sullivan ( who called the campaign " repulsive " ) , Time ’s Joe Klein ( " assassination " ) , and Foreign Policy ’s David Rothkopf ( " lynching - by - blog " ) .
Freeman has also been invited as the guest of Fareed Zakaria , a regular columnist for Newsweek and the Post , on his regular Sunday CNN program on foreign policy , " GPS . "
In the end , the attempts by Freeman ’s critics to make the story about anything but Israel may have backfired .
Instead , discussion of the role of the Israel lobby in forming U.S. foreign policy appears to have acquired more mainstream legitimacy than ever before .
The long - taboo subject became a matter of public debate in 2006 , when two prominent political scientists , the University of Chicago ’s John Mearsheimer and Harvard University ’s Stephen Walt , published their article " The Israel Lobby , " later expanded into a book .
The two argued that a powerful lobby , centered on but not limited to AIPAC , exerts a " stranglehold " on U.S. foreign policy debates and stifles any criticism of Israeli policies , to the detriment of both the U.S. and Israel .
Mearsheimer and Walt ’s thesis was instantly controversial .
Critics accused them of perpetuating age - old anti-Semitic tropes about the covert Jewish domination of politics .
Mainstream critics of Israel have been reluctant to align themselves with the two , even when they have reached some of the same conclusions .
In the wake of the Freeman affair , however , Mearsheimer and Walt appear to be getting a new hearing .
The Los Angeles Times went to far as to suggest that the attacks on them may have been overstated .
" [ T ] he battle over Freeman …seems to have exposed more sympathy for a Walt / Mearsheimer view of U.S. - Israel relations than one might have expected to be out there , " wrote Michael Goldfarb of the Weekly Standard , one of Freeman ’s harshest critics .
" People like Joe Klein and Andrew Sullivan are now fairly indistinguishable from Stephen Walt . "
Goldfarb intended the comment as an insult , but it may nonetheless have contained a kernel of truth .
While the Freeman affair may have shifted the parameters of debate on Israel policy , it has also exposed fissures and resentments between the national security bureaucracy and the U.S. political leadership .
Some veteran observers , such as the " Nelson Report , " an influential private newsletter , compared Freeman ’s treatment to the McCarthy era when long - time government Asia experts were deemed responsible for " losing China " to the Communists and hounded out of the foreign service by the so - called " China Lobby . "
Col .
Pat Lang , the former top Middle East analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency who signed a letter of support for Freeman , told IPS that the saga had caused a " tentative feeling of disappointment " about the new administration within the intelligence community .
" It ’s very disheartening for people who viewed Freeman ’s appointment as the return to some standard of intellectual excellence or integrity , " he said , adding that Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) Adm .
Dennis Blair , who went to the Senate and strongly defended his appointee , may be the next target for Freeman ’s antagonists as they push for alarmist intelligence on Iran .
" I ’m concerned about what these characters are going to do about Blair , because Blair really stood up to them , and their general reaction to that is to wage a war of annihilation against people who do that , " Lang said .
Spy chiefs are already spending hundreds of millions of pounds on a mass internet surveillance system , despite UK home secretary Jacqui Smith 's announcement earlier this week that proposals for a central warehouse of communications data had been dumped on privacy grounds .
The system - uncovered today by The Register and The Sunday Times - is being installed under a GCHQ project called Mastering the Internet ( MTI ) .
It will include thousands of deep packet inspection probes inside communications providers ' networks , as well as massive computing power at the intelligence agency 's Cheltenham base , " the concrete doughnut " .
Sources with knowledge of the project said contracts have already been awarded to private sector partners .
One said : " In MTI , computing resources are not measured by the traditional capacities or speeds such as Gb , Tb , Megaflop or Teraflop ... but by the metric tonne !.. and they have lots of them . "
The American techology giant Lockheed Martin is understood to have bagged a £ 200 m deal .
The BAE - owned British firm Detica , which has close links to MI5 and MI6 , as well as to GCHQ , has also been signed up to help on MTI .
A spokeswoman for GCHQ said the agency does not comment on individual contracts .
" GCHQ works with a broad range of industry partners to deliver a complex portfolio of technical projects , " she said .
Detica also declined to comment , and Lockheed Martin did not return calls .
Sources said MTI received approval and funding of more than £ 1bn over three years in the October 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review .
GCHQ , like MI5 and MI6 , is funded out of the opaque Single Intelligence Account .
For 2007 / 8 the planned budget for the three agencies was over £ 1.6bn .
GCHQ began work on MTI soon after it was approved .
Records of job advertising by the agency show that in April 2008 it was seeking a Head of Major Contracts with " operational responsibility for the ‘ Mastering the Internet ’ ( MTI ) contract " .
The new senior official was to be paid an annual salary of up to £ 100,000 .
The advertisement also indicated that the head of Major Contracts would be in charge of procurement on MTI and be expected to forge close links with the private sector .
According to sources , MTI is a core piece of the government 's Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) .
On Monday of last week , the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that under IMP , rather than build a central warehouse , responsibility for storing details of who contacts whom , when and where will be imposed on communications providers .
The news was welcomed by privacy advocates and civil liberties campaigners , but sources described it as a " side show " compared to the massively increased surveillance capability that MTI will deliver .
It will grant intelligence staff in Cheltenham complete visibility of UK Internet traffic , allowing them to remotely configure their deep packet inspection probes to intercept data - both communications data and the communication content - on demand .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : " We opposed the big brother database because it gave the state direct access to everybody ’s communications .
But this network of black boxes achieves the same thing via the back door . "
GCHQ 's spokeswoman said : " GCHQ does not discuss ' how ' we use data , as this may lead to revelations about our capability which damage national security .
" GCHQ is constantly updating its systems in order to maintain and renew its capability . "
Advocates of MTI and IMP say they are essential if intelligence agencies are to maintain their capability to monitor terrorist and other criminal networks .
A Home Office consultation on the storage of communications data is now open .
Meanwhile , work and spending on the all - seeing system to intercept and retrieve it is already underway . ®
PINOS ALTOS , N.M. 
It has taken four months of racing on three continents , and one harrowing crash , but amid the pine forests surrounding this high - altitude town came the first true sign that Lance Armstrong ’s comeback may not achieve its stated aim of an eighth Tour de France title .
Until now , Armstrong had been working his way back into shape after his three - and - a - half - year hiatus , focusing on helping his teammates and recovering from a broken collarbone he sustained in a spill last month in Spain .
Winning was not important .
But on Sunday , despite a game plan that called for two of the country ’s best cyclists  his teammates Levi Leipheimer and Chris Horner  to carry Armstrong to the finish line of a grueling , crash - filled 105.7 - mile final stage of the Tour of the Gila , he could not cross it first .
Philip Zajicek , a 30 - year - old journeyman , made his break with 200 yards to go and Armstrong , 37 , did not have enough to answer , pulling up with Leipheimer , the overall winner .
They crossed the finish line 12 seconds later , Armstrong sitting up in his saddle .
He was second over all .
Samoo Architecture PC , with the project lead Samsung C & T Corporation and Samoo Architects & Engineers in Seoul , Korea , have been awarded first prize and the building / construction commission for the new Taekwondo Park World Headquarters in Muju , Korea .
To be located on 570 acres of beautiful old growth woodlands , natural streams and valleys , the Park and associated building complexes are to become a world cultural heritage site emphasizing the spirit , beauty and sport of Taekwondo as well as the culture of Korean .
The Park will be the home to the Taekwondo Promotion Foundation , World Taekwondo Headquarters , World Taekwondo Federation , Korean Taekwondo Federation , CISM Taekwondo Committee Headquarters , Taekwonjeon , Myungingwan , a sports arena , visitor and exhibition centers , a premier training and lodging facility and a cultural tourist destination for visitors to discover the artistry and spirit of Taekwondo in its birthplace of Korea .

Embarrassing disclosures about the vast expenses claims of British members of parliament amount to a “ McCarthy - style witch - hunt ” that risks driving politicians to suicide , a lawmaker warned on Friday .
Nadine Dorries , a member of the opposition Conservative party , wrote on her blog that the two - week scandal , in which the Daily Telegraph newspaper has drip - fed details of how members of parliament have abused their generous expense allowances , was forcing politicians to the brink …
European and local elections to be held on June 4 are expected to reflect the level of popular disgust , with lower voter turnout and a move toward fringe parties predicted .
“ The atmosphere in Westminster is unbearable , ” Dorries wrote on the blog ( blog.dorries.org ) .
“ People are constantly checking to see if others are OK .
Everyone fears a suicide .
If someone is n’t seen , offices are called and checked . ”
Asked about her comments on BBC radio on Friday , she sought to back away from the suicide suggestion , but said the disclosures , including that politicians charged for duck ponds , horse manure , bath plugs and pornographic films , were forcing members of parliament to breaking point …
“ I have to say the last day in parliament this week was completely unbearable .
I have never , ever been in an atmosphere or an environment like it , where everyone walks around with terror in their eyes .
People are genuinely concerned . ”
Dorries , whose own use of expenses to buy household goods was exposed by the Telegraph , joins a number of politicians who have attacked the disclosures rather than apologizing .
Is this a threat of suicide – or a promise ?
Losing corrupt politicians by whatever means is a praiseworthy goal .
If they enhance and accelerate the process – by their own hand – that ’s just the icing on the cake .

Furious Renault boss Flavio Briatore plans to propose to fellow Formula 1 teams that Brawn GP is blocked from being given any television rights money for the 2009 season .
As the successor of the Honda Racing team , Brawn GP has a theoretical claim to the estimated 30 million Euros of money that would have been due to the Japanese manufacturer for competing this season - a move that was supported by the Formula One Teams ' Association ( FOTA ) .
However , on the back of the diffuser controversy and the extra costs teams are now facing in developing the concept , Briatore instead wants the money to be shared equally among Brawn GP 's rivals .
Speaking to Italian media in the Shanghai paddock , Briatore said he would make an official proposal to FOTA to prevent Brawn GP getting hold of the payments .
" Despite some being against it , [ Luca di ] Montezemolo kept the FOTA united in supporting Brawn GP , and so did McLaren , in supplying engines , " said Briatore .
" But since [ Ross ] Brawn was our technical delegate , and he forces me to spend money I do n't have in my budget , and since Honda 's money have luckily not been shared yet , we 'll have a meeting .
" My proposal will be as follows .
Brawn is richer than anyone else , because he's had his team paid for in full by Honda , plus he's had 130 millions given to him [ by Honda ] : he 's certainly richer than I am .
" I do n't want to be a Robin Hood , but when there 's a situation where everyone is transparent then it 's fine .
" At this moment my position is , since I need to find the money in the budget somewhere and the season can't end up with [ everyone ] being one second behind the Brawn cars , then the money share will have to be reviewed in full .
I think it 's around 30 million Euros . "
Brawn GP has no guarantee of getting the Honda money because it was made a totally new team by the FIA .
Had it been a simple renaming of the outfit , then rival teams would have had no call for the payments .
Briatore added that he would also push for Brawn GP to not receive any entitlement to transport costs - which are only guaranteed for established teams .
" Let 's go with what the FIA said , " he explained .
" Since the FIA said it 's a new team , then for once we agree with the federation .
This is a new team , it 's true : Honda officially said it left F1 , and this is n't called Brawn Honda , it 's Brawn alone .
At this point I think the federation is right .
" Bernie refused that point because Bernie wants to send the money to the teams and the teams would transfer it .
Brawn was very good in the appeal , so the federation said he 's right .
" As FOTA commercial chairman I 'll propose that we follow the FIA 's indications that it's a new team and for three years it has no rights with regards to transportation , nothing . "
When asked about the previous stance of FOTA members ensuring Brawn GP got all the money it was entitled to , Briatore said : " That was at Christmas , though .
Now that Christmas has gone , we 'll talk about it again next Christmas .
" Since it 's a new team , it has to follow all the regulations we followed when we entered with new teams .
I will propose that to FOTA , then we 'll see . "

Brookings Institution 's study
The Brookings Institution ranked metropolitan areas based on the percentage of jobs located more than 10 miles from downtown .
Most job sprawl
Detroit 77.4 %
Chicago 68.7 %
Dallas 66.9 %
Los Angeles 65.6 %
Philadelphia 63.7 %
Ohio areas
Cincinnati 52.3 %
Cleveland 45.7 %
Youngstown 45.6 %
Columbus 35.7 %
Akron 30.9 %
Dayton 21.9 %
Toledo 19.9 %
The closer you live to downtown in Northeast Ohio , the farther you may be from a job , concludes a national study to be released Monday .
The Brookings Institution 's " job sprawl " study lists three Northeast Ohio areas high among communities where jobs moved farther from city centers between 1998 and 2006 .
The Cleveland area , including Elyria and Mentor , ranked 22nd worst of 98 large metro areas studied .
Brookings classified the cluster as showing " rapid decentralization , " referring to the movement of jobs located more than 10 miles beyond the central business district .
The Youngstown - Warren - Boardman area ranked third worst among 53 small metro areas , but the study said the spread of jobs had slowed .
Akron , which ranked 15th among small metros , was shown as having " moderate decentralization . "
Elizabeth Kneebone , the report 's author , said many people realize that urban sprawl hurts the environment and the tax base of cities .
" Now we must recognize what job sprawl means for the economic health of the nation , " she wrote .
Robert Puentes , a Brookings senior fellow , added : " Allowing jobs to shift away from city centers hurts economic productivity , creates unsustainable and energy inefficient development and limits access to underemployed workers . "
Cleveland Councilman Roosevelt Coats said some of these workers are residents of his South Collinwood ward .
Many do n't have cars to get to suburban jobs , or they face bus rides of nearly two hours to places like Solon .
Long commutes with bus changes leave these workers vulnerable to fatigue and tardiness , which could cost them their jobs - especially in a recession .
The Brookings study assessed communities in three areas : jobs within three miles of downtown , those within three to 10 miles of downtown and jobs beyond 10 miles of downtown .
Nationally , only about one in five employees works within three miles of downtown in the largest metro areas , the study found .
The Detroit metro area , followed by Chicago and Dallas , led big city job sprawl .
The metro areas with the least job sprawl were Virginia Beach - Norfolk followed by New York City and its suburbs , including Long Island and northern New Jersey .
Salt Lake City had the third least amount of job sprawl .
Residents in older cites have higher unemployment rates .
For example , February 's unemployment rates , the latest state figures available , show that while Cuyahoga 's rate was 9.3 percent , Cleveland 's was 11.5 percent , Mahoning 's 12.6 percent and Youngstown 's 13.7 percent .
The study does n't say job sprawl causes unemployment , but it suggests that the mismatch between where people live and where the jobs are plays a role in their ability to find work .
Larry Benders , executive director of the Cleveland / Cuyahoga County Workforce Investment Board , which does job training and placement , has seen this first hand .
" We can invest in training and get the job seeker ready for work , but it often comes down to this question : " Can the job seeker get to the workplace ? "
Coats , chairman of Council 's Employment , Affirmative Action and Training Committee , said public officials have to work harder at getting companies to create jobs in Cleveland and better enforce laws requiring companies that receive subsidies to hire city residents .
He said RTA needs to find more efficient routes between Cleveland neighborhoods and suburban jobs .
Joel Freilich , RTA 's assistant director of service management , said the agency already has programs in place .
The work access van service picks up riders at their jobs when there is no bus service and carries them to an RTA connection .
It provided 30,724 passenger trips in 2008 .
George ,
You do whatever you want to do it 's your board .
Remember , YOUR assertions and your behavior is what puts your credibility into play in discussions about polygraph .
You have ignored every single personal attack made against me by your boorish ill - informed yes men and yet chide me publicly for what you perceive to be the slightest infraction of some code of conduct that you evidently feel only applies to those who disagree with your point of view .
If you will go back and review my posting history you will find that I initially confined my comments to civil discourse .
You should also note that when attacks against me on this board began , YOU failed to act or even respond to my complaints even when I contacted you both privately and publicly .
Thus ignored , I determined I should be absolved of any consequences if I decided to respond in kind .
Right now I am the only person appearing regularly on this board to present an opposing point of view .
Everyone else has written you off after 8 years of " nothing has changed " as ineffective and inconsequential , in your quest to alter the laws or substantly affect procedure regarding polygraph .
I tend to agree with them on most of that .
The only real difference is I care that the potential careers of people scared enough or foolish enough to follow your ill - conceived plan are being destroyed by your bad advice and immoral position that lying on a polygraph is justifiable because years ago you got your feelings hurt when you failed an exam .
If you grow tired of hearing my same old responses maybe all of you should just stop making the same old tired comments and asking the same silly questions .
Sancho Panza
After rumors sprang up across the blogosphere of a Windows 7 build 7048 , we debunked them and along with all the other Windows 7 users , we looked hungrily for information on new builds .
Microsoft is currently compiling pre-RC builds of Windows 7 , the latest build being 7046 .
Many beta testers are frustrated that they have not received a build since build 7000 , which was released to everyone on January 9 , 2009 .
Unfortunately , Ars has learned that this trend may continue .
When I asked Steven Sinofsky , senior vice president for the Windows and Windows Live Engineering Group , if Microsoft Connect testers as well as MSDN and TechNet subscribers will get the RC exclusively , Sinofsky told me no : " The build will be available broadly . "
When will this occur ?
Well , sources are continuously pointing to a release of the RC build in April , and now that timeframe has been further narrowed down .
According to Neowin , " the official release date is set for April 10 , 2009 . "
Whether the Windows development team will be able to meet this date is another story entirely , but development is going quite well I 'm told , so as of right now , I 'm optimistic that the release date will be met .
Sinofsky has also been talking to Geeksmack , sending them an e-mail yesterday dispelling the buzz that Microsoft was n't paying attention to what testers were saying : " We have received an amazing amount of feedback , many suggestions for new features too , during the beta — over 500,000 suggestions just from the Send Feedback button ( which is only one of many feedback mechanisms ) .
Putting that in perspective it is 500 suggestions for each and every developer on the Windows team , just since beta ! "
That is a lot of feedback to go through , and it looks like Sinofsky is up to the challenge .
Swine flu : Real danger or media hype ?
Just over two weeks after the outbreak of swine flu , sorry , H1N1 , most of us have come round to the idea that a pandemic does n't always necessitate panic .
The infection is spreading steadily , but in most people it 's relatively mild and only a very small number of people have died outside Mexico .
In an editorial last week the medical journal The Lancet praised the British media , and the general public , for their " balanced and rational " reaction to the outbreak .
Perhaps we 're learning how to be on alert without losing our heads .
The Lancet was responding to a piece by the Guardian 's Simon Jenkins ( who has been previously noted on Plus ) who dismissed initial coverage of the outbreak as exaggerated by media and scientists to sell papers and drugs .
But according to The Lancet , Jenkins got hype confused with scientific uncertainty : in the face of the many unknowns that come with this new virus , scientists play out a range of different scenarios , including worst - case ones .
If these do n't happen , then this does n't necessarily invalidate their methods — it might even mean that interventions made as a result of the predictions have worked .
But how do scientists make these predictions in the face of so many uncertainties ?
The biological side — understanding the virus and producing vaccines — is down to life scientists , but understanding how it will spread is a matter for mathematicians .
They build mathematical models that mimic the progress of an infection .
There is a range of tried - and - tested epidemiological models , but the devil is in the detail : the predictions of any one model depend crucially on the assumptions made about the nature of the virus .
Hence the uncertainty .
Two times two times two ...
As an example , imagine that a person infected with a new virus infects , on average , two other people a day .
Starting with one sick person , we have two new sick people the next day , four new sick people the day after that , and so on .
Assuming that people do n't recover and become immune , it takes just over three weeks until the number of sick people is larger than the population of Britain .
If a sick person infects three people a day on average , then the whole of Britain will be infected within just over two weeks .
The exponential growth means that one extra infection a day per sick person makes the disease spread a lot faster .
One number does ( almost ) everything
The basic bit of information here — the average number of people a sick person will infect in a population that has no immunity against the virus — is the most important parameter in disease modelling .
It 's called the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease .
It measures how fast the disease will spread , and , consequently , how hard it is to control , and it's therefore one of the first bits of information scientists will try and estimate when a new disease has broken out .
The reproductive number measures how fast a disease spreads .
Getting that estimate right is hugely important , but it 's no easy feat , because data from the beginning of the outbreak is n't always readily available .
The first analysis of H1N1 data from Mexico , published this week in Science , uses sophisticated mathematical machinery to make sense of incomplete information .
The authors stress that " there are uncertainties about all aspects of this outbreak " , and their estimate of the reproductive number for H1N1 is correspondingly vague , between 1.2 and 1.6 .
This compares to a value between 1.5 and 3 for normal seasonal influenza and between 12 and 18 for measles .
The H1N1 number may seem low , but it's in the same range as reproduction numbers of previous flu pandemics .
Assuming that the infection rate stays constant , only a reproduction number of less than 1 guarantees that the disease will die out of its own accord .
The reproduction number can also tell you quite a few things about possible interventions to control a disease .
For example , it gives you a way of working out what proportion of the population should be vaccinated to prevent the infection from spiralling out of control .
If an infected individual normally passes the disease to four others , then you should immunise just over 3 /4 of the population : out of the four that would normally have been infected by one sick person , more than three would now be immune ( on average ) , bringing the infection rate down to less than 1 , and causing the disease to eventually die out .
Similarly , for a general reproductive number R 0 , you can achieve so - called herd immunity by vaccinating a proportion of 1 - 1/R 0 of the population .
Challenging models
Taking aside the difficulty of getting good estimates of important numbers , there 's the question of how to model the spread of a disease .
The simple exponential model above is far too crude , as it ignores the fact that people can recover , become immune , or die .
Accordingly , the model predicts that any disease with a reproduction number greater than 1 will continue to spread forever .
More sophisticated models divide the population into groups .
In the SIR model , for example , people are either susceptible to the disease ( S ) , infected and contagious ( I ) , or have recovered and are immune ( R ) .
Every day ( or whatever the unit of time you 're using ) a certain number of susceptible people become infected and a certain number of infected people recover .
For example , if b is the average number of contacts a person has a day and S is the proportion of the population that is susceptible to the disease , then an infected person meets bS susceptible people a day on average .
Assuming that the disease is passed on to all of them , bSI people pass from the susceptible to the infected class every day , where I is the current number of infected people .
The number of people who pass from the infected to the recovered class is worked out in terms of the average number of days a person is sick .
If this is equal to d , then the chance of recovery on a given day is 1/d , so out of I infected people I /d pass over into the recovered class every day .
Mathematical models can be used to test interventions .
This simple model can be made more mathematical by rewriting it in terms of differential equations .
Throwing in some general assumptions on the rate of births and deaths in the population , you can then run your model on a computer to simulate the long - term behaviour of the disease .
All you need in this simple case are estimates of the average number of contacts a person has a day , b , and the average duration of the disease d.
The reproductive number , according to this model , is bd / N , where N is the total size of the population .
If this number is less than 1 , then the disease will eventually die out .
If it 's greater than 1 , then the model predicts that epidemics occur periodically for a while , until the proportion of infected people settles down to a constant value — the disease has become endemic .
The great thing about this type of compartmental model is that you can add extra compartments to make it more realistic .
For example , you can add a group of people who are incubating the disease , but are n't yet contagious , or people who are contagious but do n't yet show symptoms .
You can also play around with the transition rates between compartments to predict the effect of interventions .
For example , you can model the effect of antiviral drugs by reducing the average duration of the sickness , or you can predict the effect of quarantine by varying the contact rate .
Once you can mimic how a disease spreads between people who physically meet , you can combine this with models that describe people 's travel behaviour to predict how and if a disease will spread around the globe .
You can also use these more sophisticated models to find out what kind of interventions would be most effective .
A study published last year , for example , used a compartmental model coupled with a travel model to show that traffic restrictions would have little effect on the evolution of a pandemic , a possible reason for the World Health Organisation 's refusal to recommend a complete ban on travel in the face of H1N1 .
More encouragingly , the study found that treating 5 % of the population with antiviral drugs would mitigate a pandemic for diseases with a reproductive number up to 1.9 .
Effective as these epidemiological models may be , they are only ever as good as the underlying assumptions .
If you 're not sure about the basic characteristics of a virus , for example its reproductive number , then the predictions of any model will be necessarily vague .
Even a relatively small change in one of the parameters can lead to significantly different predictions .
Any good epidemiologist is explicit about the underlying assumptions of a model and the uncertainties concerning parameter estimates .
But once the predictions hit the headlines , these caveats are often lost , leading casual readers to mistake uncertainty for falsity .

A follow - up to Wednesday night ’s Kinsleyan gaffe :
He ’s sorry , he ’s just not sure why he ’s sorry .
The closest we get to an explanation is that the decision to drop the bomb was “ complicated , ” but of course that ’s why Cliff May brought it up — to draw a parallel with the decision to waterboard terrorists .
The moral calculus about how far to go in roughing up jihadis to save how many lives is difficult , as was the calculus about how many lives would be saved in the long run by incinerating Japanese kids in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war .
The fact that Stewart is a hard no on the former yet considers the latter iffy suggests a mentality I simply can’t fathom .
Is it just a matter of Truman having been a Democrat , whose motives were therefore pure , as opposed to Bush supposedly getting his Republican rocks off by torturing terrorists ?
Or is it that Truman ’s already been vindicated by history and is n’t safe to criticize the way Bush still is ?
He could have tried explaining but instead he mugs his way through the whole bit .
Which is what he always does when he gets in a jam while playing serious pundit : Clown nose off , clown nose on .

In this , the fourth of the series , Dr. David Luke explores the extraordinary realm of ‘ dream psi ’ and how the counter - culture experiments of the 1960 ’s are coming back with a sexy vengeance .
Or something .
Read Part 1 here
Read Part 2 here
Read Part 3 here
The research of dream psi has long been fruitful in generating successful results [ 19 ] , as has research with partial sensory deprivation environments known as the Ganzfeld , to some degree .
But aside from a few projects looking into meditation there has been very little research done recently into psi with other altered states .
Revisiting the hopeful days of the 1960s , one of the areas of research I ’ve been working on , in virtual solitude , is the parapsychology of psychedelic experiences [ 20 ] .
So far , about a dozen experimental programs using LSD , psilocybin , ayahuasca , cannabis or Amanita muscaria have provided promising evidence for the inducement of psi with psychedelics , under certain conditions , albeit with some methodological difficulties [ 21 ] .
Not least of which was that most of these experiments , primarily conducted in the 1960 ’s , gave psychedelics to inexperienced trippers and then got them to do long series of boring card - guessing tasks while they wrestled with their first numinous experience .
More recently a number of surveys [ 22 ] looking at drug use and paranormal experiences have provided results consistent with the idea that psychedelics in particular can induce psychic experiences , but this probably is n’t news to most trippers .
Occultist Julian Vayne [ 23 ] notes that among psychedelic explorers of inner space , dubbed psychonauts , the telepathic experience is so common that it is hardly remarked upon .
Shamans too have been using these substances for millennia for clairvoyance , telepathy , precognition , psychic diagnosis , psychic healing , hunting , warfare , magical combat and a host of less easily definable esoteric activities .
Personally , I think it is these other magical activities and apparently paranormal phenomena that occur after a gaze into one ’s medicine bag that most deserve investigating .
Take the relatively common occurrence of entity encounters with the endogenous psychedelic N,N - dimethyltryptamine ( or simply DMT ) , those classic meetings with self - transforming machine elves or alien praying mantis - neurosurgeons .
Outside of my own research , contemporary parapsychology has virtually nothing to say about these encounters .
This appears to be largely because parapsychology has yet to recover from its untimely split with the psychedelic research community in the late 1960 ’s when psychedelics became illegal and all human research with these substances terminated .
Since then anybody working on the fringes of science , be it with psychedelics or psychic abilities , has already become too marginalized to risk being further ostracised by their proximate scientific community .
On the weird edges of science where funding thins out like oxygen at high altitudes , nobody wants to be a maverick in an already maverick field and researchers on both sides are wary of being seen to discredit their own field by joining the other ( though occasionally fools rush in ) .
Meanwhile monstrous be -tentacled beasts with thousands of eyes regularly terrify naÃ¯ve psychonauts as they burst through the veil to inner dimensions – apparently at least [ 24 ] – and parapsychologists , let alone psychologists , have nothing much to say about it .
Up and till now parapsychology has largely confined itself to the study of psi , psychic healing , near - death experiences , out - of - body experiences , mediumship , the survival of the personality after bodily death , hauntings , ghosts , apparitions , and other ostensible communications from the spirits of the dead , such as electronic voice phenomena .
Whatever conservatism has kept the field back from scientifically researching more esoteric activities and phenomena over the last 125 years , it would seem like an appropriate time to expand these activities to include the weirder phenomena found with shamanism , magic ( not the illusory stage magic kind ) , and the use of psychedelics .
Lets face it , 2012 or not , things are looking set to get quite a lot weirder in the coming years .
A glance over at the world of genetics alone indicates that pretty soon we may all be living in a kind of surreal Neuromancer - type reality .
Recent news suggests that scientists are on the verge of creating purely synthetic genes that can be injected into cells and brought to life – if you believe that life can be created from non-life .
Similarly , in 2007 , geneticists were granted ethical approval to create hybrid human - animal foetuses , purely for stem - cell research of course and not to go to full term and give birth to hybrid human - animal babies .
Given that this kind of technology is available now , the creation of real mutant humans and hybrids the likes of your favourite comic book hero or heroine , is only the thickness of an ethics committee away from being a reality in the near future .
And what strikes me as poetic about this is that all those ancient therianthropic images of centaurs , griffons , and mermaids adorning art and myth for millennia may have been more than just the outpourings of imaginative minds , and could have been genuine insights into our mythological mutant future .
I , for one , sure would n’t mind a set of wings or a pair of goaty pan legs .
So what does modern science have to fear about investigating the mutant gods and demons that lurk within certain neurohacking molecules ?
Especially molecules like DMT that have long since being naturally occurring in our own brains .
Surely with centaurs , neurofeedback control of computers , space travel , nanotechnology and all the other really weird stuff happening in science there ’s a genuine need for psychology to catch up by overcoming its taboos about drugs and the paranormal and to really start mapping the weirder realms of the mind .
After several years of experimentation with altered states the scientist John C. Lilly said he looked forward to the day when parapsychology was just another branch of psychology .
That day never came in John ’s lifetime and , given the resistance to non-materialist thinking still current in the mainstream , that day appears to remain a long way off .
Perhaps 2012 will change all that .
Perhaps not .
Coming back to the start of this essay , one thing that seems apparent , however , is that psi research wo n’t be starting a revolution in advertising just yet .
Rest assured that although there seems to be some good evidence emerging recently for an essentially constant and unconscious psychic awareness in all people , albeit very subtle , there seems to be little indication that the desire to buy a specific product – be it yoga classes or the latest phone – can be psychically ‘ planted ’ in one ’s unconscious mind .
The bad news is that in principal such “ psiverts ” are completely feasible and resemble much of the work that has occurred in parapsychology over the years .
Thankfully , however , psychic advertising appears to have been totally overlooked by both researchers and marketing executives alike for the last 125 years .
And although psychical research seems to suggest that psychic information can be picked up unconsciously , whether or not this has an effect on spending habits has yet to be researched .
This lack of research probably has more to do with good taste and the difficulty replicating individual results in parapsychology than with any lack of imagination .
The other problem for psiverts of course is that psychic abilities , if we assume they are real , are concerned with accessing truths that are not known whereas advertising really wishes to gloss over the warts and present a shining “ whiter than white ” hyperbole that keeps the truth hidden .
Yet , its seems unlikely that the corporate and capitalist machinery in all its manifestations has so far overlooked this area for boosting profits , and it ’s possible that at least some organisations may have already conducted such activities covertly .
Furthermore , if psychic piracy were at work the fact that psi seems to work unconsciously most of the time means that we would be unlikely to suspect anything at all , so there may already be corsairs costcutting in our cortices and buccaneers billboarding our brains trying to gain that vital extra sales edge on their competitors .
Meanwhile , I wo n’t let it keep me awake at night but I am determined to try and remember that phone number in the yoga advert next time I dream it and give it a call anyway .
Real or not , all this speculation has left my pineal gland feeling like the cerebral equivalent of the Somalian coast and I think all this psychic piracy floating on the aethers has ruptured one of my charkas , so a spot of yoga certainly seems in order .
As Eddington said , “ The Universe is not only stranger than we imagine , but it is stranger than we can imagine . ”

Languages
Ongoing work on these languages must be funded in such a way as to avoid product lock - in .
Funding them by tying them to specific technologies will only fracture development communities , and likely damage any existing open - source contributor base .
There must be paid support offerings for these languages outside of specific products .
For people interested in running JRuby on Rails , Grails , or Liftweb , there must be support channels they can follow , regardless of product bundling attempts .
In the JRuby world , for example , we receive many requests for paid support , either in the form of hired guns to optimize an application or through targeting resources to critical bugs .
And so far , we have been unable to offer such support .
We must continue the work started on the OpenJDK and MLVM projects .
OpenJDK has enabled such projects as Shark ( Hotspot on LLVM ) and the MLVM ( JVM extensions for non-Java language features ) , and we must see these efforts through to completion .
Finally , we need a " languages czar " that can coordinate the technical aspects of these various projects and help direct resources where needed .
This would largely be a community - cultivating role , but as a sort of " open - source manager " to ensure development efforts are both cooperating and not being needlessly duplicated .
I believe it 's absolutely vital that these tasks be met , or we risk the future of the platform entirely .
And losing must not be an option , lest we fall back into proprietary alternatives controlled by a single entity .
More to come .
There 's been a lot of supposition about the future lately , and I 've certainly read and succumbed to the temptation of the prognosticator .
I 'm not going to comment on any of the players or put forward my own suppositions about what might happen .
What I will do here is talk about what * should * happen .
It 's apparent that the Java platform is at a crossroads .
One path leads to irrelevance , be it through general apathy that important technologies are getting sidelined , or through active emigration due to bureaucratic processes and waterfall platform evolution .
The other path leads to a bright , open future , where polyglots romp and play with fresh new languages and developers have freedom to use whatever tools they feel are necessary for a given job .
Given the large investment many of us have in this platform , we need to start talking now about which direction we want to go .
I 've been doing a lot of thinking about the future of the Java platform and my future developing for it , and I 've come up with a few things I believe must happen soon to ensure the future of the JVM and the applications and languages built for it .
As you might expect from me , the first area involves supporting many languages on the JVM .
Over the past three years we 've seen a spectacular transformation take place .
The " Java " VM has become a truly multi-language platform .
People are putting into production applications running all sorts of languages , often writing absolutely no Java to do so .
And this is how things must be ... this is how the platform is going to survive .
As I see it there are currently three primary players in the language domain : JRuby , Scala , and Groovy ( in no particular order ) .
I include these three due to the relative completeness of their implementations , vague popularity metrics , and availability of production use cases .
These three languages , one static and two dynamic , bear further exploration .
JRuby represents the promise of off - platform languages being brought to the JVM .
Rather than creating a language specifically tailored to fit well into the JVM 's type system and limitations , we have managed to take a drastically different language and implement enough of it to be the only " alternative " implementation realistically considered for production applications .
And in doing so we 've had to stretch the platform .
We 've created native binding libraries , wired in POSIX functions the JDK does n't provide , implemented our own core types like Strings , Arrays , and regular expressions , and done all this while managing to deliver the best performing compatible Ruby implementation available .
And where the other two primary language contenders largely pull developers from other areas of the Java platform , JRuby actually brings in many developers that might not otherwise ever use the JVM .
JRuby stretches and grows the platform .
Groovy is the second dynamic language under consideration .
Groovy represents taking the best features of a number of dynamic languages and wiring them into a Java - like syntax that 's easy for existing Java developers to learn .
Groovy provides a solid dynamic language foundation without breaking Java type - system requirements like ahead - of - time compiled classes and static method signatures , allowing it to enlist directly in newer APIs that depend on those requirements .
And while many developers come to Groovy from other areas of the Java platform , they might also have completely left the platform if not for Groovy .
Groovy provides for Java developers a " dynamic layer " that does n't require them to learn a new platform and a new set of libraries .
And so Groovy 's strength is in maintaining the platform and stemming the bleeding of developers to off - platform dynamic languages .
Scala , it must be stated , is the current heir apparent to the Java throne .
No other language on the JVM seems as capable of being a " replacement for Java " as Scala , and the momentum behind Scala is now unquestionable .
While Scala is not a dynamic language , it has many of the characteristics of popular dynamic languages , through its rich and flexible type system , its sparse and clean syntax , and its marriage of functional and object paradigms .
The supposed weakness of Scala as being " too complicated " or " too rich " can be countered by developing coding standards , creating more robust editors and tools , and by better educating polyglots on how best to use Scala .
Scala represents the rebirth of static - typed languages on the JVM , and like JRuby it has also begun to stretch the capabilities of the platform in ways Java never could .
Among the secondary players I include language implementations like Jython , Clojure , and Rhino .
While still in early days of adoption ( or in Jython and Rhino 's cases , early days of re-awakening ) , they represent similar aspects to the primary three languages .
For purposes of discussion , we 'll leave it at that for now .
In order for the platform to embrace these and many future languages , several things need to happen :
AWARE that the EU is seen as distant and imperious , its officials have been trying to persuade Britons to vote in the elections for the European Parliament next week .
A series of Euro - posters ( some about tricky subjects like energy , others about more banal things such as product packaging ) have popped up here and there .
The Eurocrats will be pleased with predictions that turnout will be about as high as in the previous European ballot in 2004 , as vote - inducing outrage over MPs ' expenses cancels out vote - reducing lack of interest in Europe .
They may be less pleased with the outcome .
Polling commissioned from YouGov by The Economist suggests that Britain is gradually becoming a more Eurosceptic place .
Over the past quarter - century the proportion of people who think Britain 's membership of the EU is a good thing has fallen from 43 % to 31 % ( with a spike in 1990 after sterling 's ill - fated entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism ) .
The share of those who think it a bad thing has risen from 30 % to 37 % .
Support for greater integration has dropped , from one in three in 1995 to one in five today ( see chart ) .
Those within that group who favour a fully - fledged European government make up only 5 % of the total , down from 10 % in 1995 .
Over the same period support for loosening Britain 's ties to the EU has risen from 36 % to 51 % , and those who want Britain to withdraw from it have almost doubled , from 12 % to 21 % .
Attitudes split roughly along party lines .
Conservative voters are the most Eurosceptic ( as well as , by a small margin , the most likely to vote ) .
Liberal Democrat supporters are , surprisingly , slightly less keen on Europe than their Labour counterparts , even though the Lib Dems are officially the most Euro - friendly party .
There is also a correlation with age , with older voters leerier of Brussels than their younger compatriots .
One explanation is that a cohort of greybeards have fond memories of life with a less powerful EU .
Another , says Peter Kellner , head of YouGov , is that , like conservatism , Euroscepticism may come with age .
Such poetic irony , do n't you think ?
The deaths of the little people working for corporate behemoths goes to pay bonuses to their company 's top earners .
Hey , it may be legal - but it sure lacks class .
Banks are using a little - known tactic to help pay bonuses , deferred pay and pensions they owe executives :
They 're holding life - insurance policies on hundreds of thousands of their workers , with themselves as the beneficiaries .
Banks took out much of this life insurance during the mortgage bubble , when executives ' pay -- and the IOUs for their deferred compensation -- surged , and banking regulators affirmed the use of life insurance as a way to finance executive pay and benefits .
Bank of America Corp. has the most life insurance on employees : $ 17.3 billion at the end of the first quarter , according to bank filings .
Wachovia Corp. has $ 12 billion , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has $ 11.1 billion and Wells Fargo & Co. has $ 5.7 billion .
( Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia at the end of last year . )
The insurance policies essentially are informal pension funds for executives : Companies deposit money into the contracts , which are like big , nondeductible IRAs , and allocate the cash among investments that grow tax - free .
Over time , employers receive tax - free death benefits when employees , former employees and retirees die .
Though not improper , the practice is similar to what is known as " janitors insurance , " an insurance - on - employees technique that has long been controversial .
Critics say the banks ' insurance contracts are a way for companies to create tax breaks for funding executive pensions .
And some families have complained that employers should n't profit from the deaths of their loved ones .
Fondant is like edible modeling clay .
It can be shaped , colored , cut or molded .
It can turn a plain cake into a work of art .
This pliable icing used to be something seldom used by amateurs , but with the advent of cake shows , fondant and other culinary ideas once relegated to professionals have moved right into our living rooms .
If you 've seen Ace of Cakes or Cake Boss you 've seen some in use .
A baker can make real works of art with the use of a little modeled sugary decoration .
However , commercial , pre-made fondant can be expensive and frankly does n't taste very good .
With some experimentation , much of it very messy , quite unappetizing and downright dangerous , I 've arrived at a simple and inexpensive alternative to the commercial version that is surprisingly easy to work with .
This recipe costs under $ 10 per cake even including the initial outlay for a multicolor box of food coloring .
Typically , I spend less than $ 5 per cake on fondant ingredients , even for cakes with a dozen colors of it !

I want you to know that this thing that you have done is a good thing .
I would like there to be more things similar but not identical to this thing .
These more things should be made by you since you have shown that you can make these things .
Please make more of these things .
Thank you .
Ancient aliens and UFOs , or “ unidentified flying objects , ” have been the stuff of legends for centuries .
Modern “ eyewitness ” accounts began to surface as early as the latter part of the 19th century with reports of “ mystery airships ” appearing in U.S. newspapers .
During WWII , allied airmen 's eerie tales of encountering mysterious “ foo fighters ” captured our collective imagination , but it was after the Cold War that UFO sightings really took off .
While the U.S. government started monitoring the skies for evidence that the Soviets might be developing secret stealth aircraft , many people believed — and continue to believe — that unexplained flying phenomena were of extra terrestrial origin .
Pictures of so - called UFOs were touted as proof that alien visitors had made their way to Earth but even in the dark ages before Photoshop , it was easy enough to manipulate photographic technology .
The following stories tell of possible UFO sightings , with photographs that may — or may not — prove that real close encounters may be closer than you think .
01 of 20 Los Angeles , California ; February 25 , 1942 1942 - Los Angeles , California .
The legend :
At 2:25 p.m , alarm sirens installed in the event of a Japanese air raid sounded as flying objects were spotted in the skies above Los Angeles .
A blackout was declared and anxious , terrified citizens followed the instructions to extinguish all lights .
At 3:16 p.m. , searchlights swept the skies and anti-aircraft guns opened fire on the unidentified flying objects over the Pacific .
Witnesses recount the formation of small red or silver - plated objects high - speed flying at a high altitude was untouched by the anti-aircraft salvos .
The larger craft pictured flew off without sustaining damage as well .
02 of 20 McMinnville , Oregon ; May 8 , 1950 1950 - McMinnville , Oregon .
Paul Trent
The legend : Photographed by Paul Trent after his wife spotted a strange object in the sky , these images were published in a local newspaper in McMinnville , Oregon .

She passed away in 1994 .
05 of 20 Santa Ana , California ; August 3 , 1965 1965 - Santa Ana , California .
Rex Heflin
The legend :
This photograph was taken by highway traffic engineer Rex Heflin while driving near the Santa Ana freeway .
Heflin did not report his sighting , however , his pictures were published by the Santa Ana Register on August 20 , 1965 .
The photos were reportedly confiscated and controversy arose regarding their authenticity .
06 of 20 Tulsa , Oklahoma ; 1965 1965 - Tulsa , Oklahoma .
Life Magazine
The legend :
In 1965 , a series of strange low - flying objects were reported almost nightly by people of all ages and walks of life across the United States .
As the year progressed , the number of these reports rose dramatically .
On the night of August 2 , 1965 , thousands of people in four Midwestern states witnessed spectacular aerial displays by large formations of UFOs .
That same night , a multi-colored disc was photographed in Tulsa , Oklahoma as it was observed performing low - altitude maneuvers .
This picture was extensively analyzed , pronounced authentic , and later published by Life magazine .
07 of 20 Provo , Utah ; July 1966 1966 - Provo , Utah .
United States Air Force
The legend :
The pilot of a twin - engine USAF C - 47 " Skytrain " transport aircraft took this photograph at approximately 11 a.m on a July morning in 1966 as he was flying over the Rocky Mountains , about 40 kilometers southwest of Provo , Utah .
The Condon Committee ( a University of Colorado group funded by the United States Air Force to study unidentified flying objects ) analyzed the negative and concluded that the photograph depicts an ordinary object thrown in the air .
Many ufologists disagreed with their conclusion .
08 of 20 Woonsocket , Rhode Island ; 1967 1967 - Woonsocket , Rhode Island .
Harold Trudel
The legend :
This daytime photograph of a slightly asymmetrical hubcap - shaped object with a small dome and aerial extending from the bottom was taken in East Woonsocket , Rhode Island by Harold Trudel .
Trudel also believed he was in mental contact with space people , who were sending him telepathic messages to let him know where and when they would appear .
09 of 20 Costa Rica ; September 4 , 1971 1971 - Costa Rica .
Costa Rican Government
The legend :
An official mapping aircraft of the Costa Rican government took this photograph in 1971 .
The aircraft was flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet over Lago de Cote .
An investigation was unable to identify the object as a " known " aircraft .
No " earthly " criteria have ever been given to explain the object .
Debunkers took some stabs at it , but the photograph is still recognized as authentic by most investigators .
10 of 20 Apollo 16 / Moon ; April 16 - 27 , 1967 1972 - Apollo 16 .
NASA
The legend :
The UFO is pictured at just right of the top center of the photo .
No explanation has been given for the object .
11 of 20 Tavernes , France ; 1974 1974 - Tavernes , France .
Anonymous French Medical Doctor
The legend :
This classic image was taken by an anonymous French medical doctor in Var , France .
Skeptics tried to discredit the picture on the grounds that " luminous rays cannot end like this . "
Normally , they do not , however , there are other possible explanations , such as these are not luminous rays at all but light emissions resulting from ionized air .
Many still believe the object in the photograph is a UFO .
12 of 20 Waterbury , Connecticut ; 1987 1987 - Waterbury , Connecticut .
Randy Etting
The legend : Randy Etting , a commercial airline pilot with over 30 years ' experience , spent a lot of time looking at the sky .
On the night he took this photograph , he 'd witnessed a number of orange and red lights approaching from the west .
He got his binoculars and called his neighbors to come outside .
By this time , the object was a great deal closer and seemed to be over I - 84 , just east of Etting 's home .
He reported that the lights were shimmering like distortion from engine heat , but he could hear no sound .
" As the UFO passed over I - 84 , cars in both the east and westbound lanes began pulling over and stopping , " he stated .
" The UFO displayed a semi- circular pattern of very bright multicolored lights .
Five motorists reported that as the object became visible a number of cars lost power and had to pull off the highway . "
13 of 20 Gulf Breeze , Florida ; 1987 1987 - Gulf Breeze , Florida .
Ed Walters
The legend :
In November 1987 , the Gulf Breeze Sentinel published a group of UFO photos they ’d gotten from a local contractor named Ed Walters .
Shortly after Walters ' photos hit the local newspaper , more UFO photographers came forward with stories or sightings and more images , both still and moving .
However , thanks to a subsequent Pensacola News Journal feature by reporter Craig Myers the Sentinel 's coverage was dismissed as " uncritical " and " sensationalist . "
Using a Styrofoam UFO model ( found in the attic of the house where Walters was living when the Sentinel photos were first published ) , Myers was able to duplicate the original photos almost shot for shot .
14 of 20 Petit Rechain , Belgium ; 1989 .
1989 - Petit Rechain , Belgium .
Photographer Anonymous
The legend :
The photographer of this famous Belgian UFO photograph remains anonymous .
Taken on an April night during a well - documented UFO wave , the photo shows a triangle - shaped object with lights .
As the original photo was too dark for the outline of the object to be seen clearly , it was subsequently enhanced , but that is supposedly the only correction made .
15 of 20 Puebla , Mexico ; December 21 , 1944 1994 - Puebla , Mexico .
Carlos Diaz
The legend : Carlos Diaz , a photographer with an extensive collection of UFO images , shot this image while taking photos of the eruption of Mt. Popocatepetl in Puebla , Mexico .
The photo shows a glowing , yellowish , disc - shaped object with a red hue toward the top , and windows or portholes .
It has since been authenticated by many photographic experts and published in numerous magazines , newspapers , and books .
16 of 20 Phoenix , Arizona ; 1977 1997 - Phoenix , Arizona .
CNN News
The legend :
This photograph is one of many depicting one of the most publicized UFO events in history .
First observed in a hexagram pattern at about 7:30 p.m. over the Superstition Mountains area east of Phoenix , the characteristic 8 + 1 formation of amber orbs was next seen in two separate arc patterns with " trailing lights " over the Gila River area at about 9:50 , and again at 10 p.m. at the southern edge of Phoenix .
Thousands reported seeing these objects and a handful of witnesses videotaped them on camcorders .
17 of 20 Taipei , China ; 2004 Taipei , China .
Lin Qingjiang
The legend : Lin Qingjiang , a worker in Hualian County of Taipei , saw what he believed to be UFO at about 10 p.m. as he was resting outside his home .
Lin was quoted as saying that the object , shaped like a large bamboo hat , flew east and west five times within 10 minutes , during which time he as able to capture this photo on his cell phone .
18 of 20 Kaufman , Texas ; January 21 , 2005 2005 - Kaufman , Texas .
lawwalk
The legend :
The photographer states : " I was out today taking pictures of the chemtrails at 11:35 a.m.
I was aiming my camera at a scrawny little cloud .
As I was snapping the picture , I noticed a flash in the sky through the viewfinder .
When the picture came on the screen , I noticed a gold - colored object at the top of the cloud I had captured also .
I looked back where it was and of course , it was gone .
I really could n't tell much of what it [ might ] be until I downloaded it to my computer .
I zoomed in on it and nearly fell out of my chair .
It appears to be a craft of some kind with maybe windows or ports on the right side , in the middle .
It also appears to be emanating a gas or some type of energy field around it , mainly at the top . "
19 of 20 Valpara , Mexico ; 2004 2004 - Valpara , Mexico .
Mercury newspaper - Mexico
The legend :
This image was taken by Valpara newspaper reporter Manuel Aguirre who noticed a band of glowing lights in the distance over the city skyline .
This photograph has not been debunked , and to date is considered legitimate .
The unknown object appears to be circular or spherical in shape .
" We do not need legislators who think like him because some of the people who voted for him could be positive , why is he then discriminating them ? "
Technology.am ( May 20 , 2009 ) — Scientists report that a memory device is capable of storing data for more than one billion years .
The 10 to 100 gigabits of data per square inch on today ’s memory cards has an estimated life expectancy of only 10 to 30 years .
Packing more digital data onto these memory cards makes it less life expectancy .
The denser you pack , the quicker it spoils .
Now scientists have an idea to rectify this situation with a new computer memory device that can store thousands of times more data than conventional silicon chips with an estimated lifetime of more than one billion years .
Alex Zettl and colleagues said that some of today ’s highest - density experimental storage media can retain ultra - dense data for only a fraction of a second .
Scientists describe about an experimental memory device consisting of an iron nanoparticle ( 1/50,000 the width of a human hair ) enclosed in a hollow carbon nanotube .
In the presence of electricity , the nanoparticle can be shuttled back and forth with great precision .
It creates a programmable memory system that , like a silicon chip , can record digital information and play it back using conventional computer hardware .
Theoretically , the researchers showed that the device had a storage capacity as high as 1 terabyte per square inch ( a trillion bits of information ) and temperature - stability in excess of one billion years .

“ This is a collection of thoughts and theories , ” West , 31 , said in an interview about his spiral - bound volume , which was written with J. Sakiya Sandifer .
West said he put his thoughts in a book because “ I get paraphrased and misquoted all the time . ”
He calls his wisdom “ Kanye-isms . ”
“ My favorite one is ‘ Get used to being used , ’ ” he said .
“ I feel like to misuse , overuse or abuse someone is negative .
To use is necessary and if you ca n’t be used , then you are useless . ”
So does he fancy himself a modern - day Confucius ?
“ I ’m trying to end the confusion , ” he said , laughing and adding , “ I ’m gonna put that on the next album . ”
West ’s derision of books comes despite the fact that his late mother , Donda West , was a university English professor before she retired to manage his music career .
She died in 2007 of complications following cosmetic surgery .
“ Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and so self - absorbed , ” West said .
“ I am not a fan of books .
I would never want a book ’s autograph .
“ I am a proud non-reader of books .
I like to get information from doing stuff like actually talking to people and living real life , ” he said .
West , a college dropout , said being a non-reader was helpful when he wrote his book because it gave him “ a childlike purity . ”
West dedicates the book to his late mother .
“ My mom taught me to believe in my flyness and conquer my shyness , ” he said , defining “ flyness ” as confidence .
“ She raised me to be the voice to allow people to think for themselves , to find their own way . ”

Fox News struck again today .
The network ’s on screen graphic while Republican Gov. Mark Sanford confessed his affair labeled him as a Democrat .
Later , FNC corrected their mistake , but this is n’t the first time that they have done this .
They also labeled disgraced former Republican Rep. Mark Foley as a Democrat .
Here is the FNC graphic courtesy of Media Matters :

Here is the Mark Foley graphic :
Loyal FNC viewers will call this a coincidental mistake , where us those of us of a more liberal persuasion will view this as Fox being Fox .
This was a breaking news story , but the network had given Sanford a ton of media coverage over his opposition to the Obama ’s economic stimulus bill .
It is n’t like Sanford was some political nobody who they had never covered before .
Was it an honest mistake ?
Maybe it was , maybe it was n’t .
If it was an honest mistake than FNC needs to get some better people working the graphics , but the network does have a history of distancing themselves from scandal riddled Republicans , so anything is possible , but FNC was really fair and balanced , this would not even be questionable .
[ Haskell - cafe ] Generic Graph Class
At the moment , there are at least three ways people use graph data - structures in Haskell : * Data .
Graph from containers * Data .
Graph .
Inductive from FGL * A custom job ( usually using something like IntMap ) .
If we look on Hackage , there are a number of graph - related packages there , each of which uses one of the above approaches .
However , for the more " generic " packages that operate _on_ graphs ( rather than using graphs as an internal data structure ) , there is ( as far as I can tell , anyway ) usually no reason why at least most of that package cannot work on _any_ of these types of graphs .
Examples include ( in no particular order ; found by looking for " graph " on the main hackage package list page ) : * hgal {uses Data .
Graph} * vacuum and related packages {custom , [ ( a , [ a ] ) ] }
* PkgGraph {custom , a -> [ b ]
AFAICT} * cabalgraph {custom , a -> b AFAICT} * graphviz {uses FGL} * SceneGraph { FGL} * data - reify {custom} * hsc3 and related packages {custom , not sure how} * dotgen {custom} * fenfire {custom} * GraphSCC { Data .
Graph} * Graphalyze { FGL} * SourceGraph {FGL via Graphalyze}
Just to give you an idea , out of these the following implement some form of graph -> . dot function ( for GraphViz ) : * vacuum * PkgGraph * cabalgraph * graphviz ( well , that 's the point of this package ... used by Graphalyze and SourceGraph ) * SceneGraph * hsc3 - dot * dotgen ( From its description : " This package provides a simple interface for building . dot graph files ... " )
Why do we duplicate so much work and effort ?
Not just in terms of generating
Dot representations for use in GraphViz , but also algorithm development ?
For example , I can't see any reason why hgal should n't also work for any generic graph type , possibly even GraphSCC ( note that sometimes specialisation is n't always avoidable : my Graphalyze library uses the inductive nature of FGL for its algorithms ) .
I thus propose that we work out a generic graph class that can be used by the various libraries we have and use , to avoid this duplication of effort ( I have already proposed that I intended to add such functionality to the graphviz library , but I 'm throwing open the design of such a class to the general community ) .
This means that even if you have to use some custom graph - like data structure in your program , you can take advantage of one of the libraries available ( e.g. graphviz ) without having to write your own graph functions for common tasks .
Here is my current thinking on how such a class could be defined .
Note that I 'm defining it for _directed_ graphs , as all graph definitions used seem to match this mould ( and we can emulate undirected graphs using directed graphs but not the other way around ) .
====================================================================== type Vertex =
Int class GenericGraph g where vertices :: g -> [ Vertex ] edges :: g -> [ ( Vertex , Vertex ) ] order :: g ->
Int order = length .
vertices size :: g ->
Int size = length .
edges --
All vertices v' such that there 's an edge ( v' , v ) adjacentIn :: g -> Vertex -> [ Vertex ] adjacentIn g v = map fst .
filter ( ( == ) v . snd ) $ edges g degIn :: g -> Vertex ->
Int degIn g = length .
adjacentIn g --
All vertices v' such that there 's an edge ( v , v' ) adjacentOut :: g -> Vertex -> [ Vertex ] adjacent
Out g v = map snd .
filter ( ( == ) v . fst ) $ edges g degOut :: g -> Vertex ->
Int degOut g = length .
adjacentIn g adjacent :: g -> Vertex -> [ Vertex ] adjacent g v = adjacent
In g v ++ adjacent
Out g v degree :: g -> Vertex -> [ Vertex ] degree g = length .
adjacent g --
For this function , maybe use as a default something based on the -- hidden isUndir function in graphviz 's Data .
GraphViz isDirected :: g ->
Bool ======================================================================
I 'm not saying that the above class is perfect ( though I can't think of any other generic graph - related functions we might want to include in there off the top of my head ) .
However , I do think it 's a good starting point .
Once we have defined such a class , how should we package it ?
In particular , how should we define instances for pre-packaged ( i.e. Data .
Graph and FGL ) graph data structures ?
Method 1 : Define the instances in the same package .
---------------------------------------------------
If we include the instances in the same package , then all libraries that use this class will require FGL , etc. to be installed ( e.g. if you want to use the graphviz library for your own custom class , then thanks to the static linking used by GHC you will still have an unwanted FGL dependency in your program ) .
Method 2 : Have seperate instance packages .
------------------------------------------
No unwanted dependencies , but this means we have what are basically useless packages containing nothing but an orphan instance .
Method 3 : Define the instance in Data .
Graph and FGL ---------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure if the maintainers of these packages ( let alone the GHC maintainers who require containers ) will appreciate us giving them another dependency for their packages .
Furthermore , this limits users of libraries that use this class to using versions of the data structures contained in libraries new enough to have this instance defined in them .
Method 4 : Give a default instance in the documentation .
-------------------------------------------------------
Users can copy / paste the instance definition from the documentation and put it in their code .
This will allow them to tweak the definitions if they so desire , but will lead to code duplication .
Please tell me any ideas / criticisms you have of this proposal .
My main reason for wanting this at the moment is to define it in graphviz , though I can think of some other uses I might have of it .
If we all agree to define this type of class in a custom package ( rather than me just defining it in graphviz and leaving it up to other users to define instances ) .
I 'd like to have this resolved sooner rather than later , as I want to work on graphviz soonish so I can start working on Graphalyze and SourceGraph again .

We just saw , in Some Like it Hoth , that Naomi offered Miles $ 1.6 million to join Widmore ’s expedition to kill Ben .
Then Miles told Bram he would n’t go to the Island if Bram paid him $ 3.2 million , which Bram declined to do .
We ’ve heard the number $ 3.2 million before .
Remember ?
Back in Season 4 ? Miles told Ben that for $ 3.2 million , he would lie to Widmore and tell him that Ben was already dead .
The scene contains this classic exchange :
— Ben , in a shocked tone : “ You ’ve arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me ?
— Miles : “ It ’s extortion , if you want to get technical . ”
Ben goes on to ask , “ 3.2 ?
Why not 3.3 or 3.4 ? ”
Which is exactly the question that I have .
What is the significance of 3.2 ?
We know that $ 3.2 million is double what Widmore was paying Miles , and we know that $ 1.6 million contains the number “ 16 , ” which is one of the numbers .
But there has to be more to it than that .
Miles never answers
Ben ’s question about why it ’s 3.2 .
Miles just looks at him .
His not answering gives the question even more significance .
So does the echo of the number , over a year later , in Some Like it Hoth .
3.2 means something — but what ?
The scene where Miles confronts Ben starts at 4:12 in the video below .
I ’ll think you ’ll enjoy seeing it again .
I found it interesting to go back to the time when the Losties still thought of Miles as their enemy .
And he does seem a bit menacing here , not yet the cuddly wise - cracker that we ’ve come to know and love ( even though he does get off a couple of very funny lines ) :
Editing to add 4/27/09 :
This mystery has now been solved !
Since some of Office Space was filmed in Las Colinas , and since writer - director Mike Judge once called Garland home , and since the movie still gets me to make the occasional " O " face , this good news courtesy the fine folks from Fantastic Fest down Austin way :
There 's gonna be an Office Space 10th anniversary - reunion shebang at the Paramount Theater on February 8 .
According to the note that dropped in the in - box , " This one - time only screening event will take place at 8:00 PM and will include special appearances by writer / director Mike Judge and members of the cast and crew to be announced at a later date . "
Some of the cast names have already been announced , among them the great Gary Cole ( Bill Lumbergh ) , David Herman ( Michael Bolten ) and Ajay Naidu ( Samir Nagheenanajar ) ; more will be announced in coming days .
General public tickets will be available here or at the Paramount box office beginning Saturday at noon ; there will also be a small amount of VIP passes available that will include " a pre-event cocktail reception , a limited edition event souvenir , flair , an actual red Swingline stapler , and an after - party at Chotchkie 's featuring pizza shooters , shrimp poppers and extreme fajitas ! "
Oh , oh , oh .
A bonus giggle after the jump .
The Skeleton Bar
I bet you feel like you ’re having a drink in a bar built by the Alien .
And in a way , you kind of are , because this odd - looking establishment was designed by Hans Rudi Giger ( HR Giger ) , who worked as a designer on the Alien movies , receiving multiple awards , including an OSCAR for best special effects .
I must say Giger did great work on this museum - bar , you must feel like you ’re somewhere in the Alien universe or inside the skeleton of a monster .
In any case it ’s very original and refreshing , I for one love it !
Taliban suspected as 86 Afghan girls are hospitalised following THIRD school poisoning
At least 84 Afghan schoolgirls were admitted to a hospital today after the third apparent poison attack on a girls school in as many weeks , officials said .
The students were lining up outside their school in north - eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday morning when a strange odor filled the school yard .
The school 's principal told how one schoolgirl collapsed .
' We took her inside and splashed water on her face , ' said Mossena , who like many Afghans goes by one name .
A schoolgirl is seen at a hospital after she was poisoned at Qazaaq primary school in Kapisa province
Five young girls slipped briefly into comas and nearly 100 were taken to hospital after a gas attack on their school
Then other girls started passing out in the yard and they sent all the students home .
It was unclear if the incident was a deliberate attack on the school , though the Taliban and other conservative extremist groups in Afghanistan have been known to target schoolgirls in a bid to stop their education .
Mossena said she did not know what happened next because she collapsed and woke up in the main hospital in Muhmud Raqi , the capital of Kapisa province .
At least 98 patients were admitted from Aftab Bachi school , including the principal , 11 teachers and two cleaners , said Khalid Enayat , the hospital 's deputy director .
He said about another 30 students were being monitored to see if they developed symptoms , although they were not admitted to the hospital .
The attack was the third in a series of such incidents north of Kabul , Afghan officials said
An official earlier said 89 schoolgirls had been hospitalised .
Tuesday 's apparent attack is the third alleged poisoning at a girls ' school in less than three weeks .
It comes a day after 61 schoolgirls and one teacher from a school in neighboring Parwan province were admitted to a hospital after complaining of sudden illness .
They were irritable , confused and weeping , and several of the girls passed out .
The patients in Kapisa complained of similar symptoms to those in the Parwan incidents - headaches , vomiting and shivering , said Aziz Agha , a doctor treating the girls .
' I got dizzy and my head hurt .
Some other students took me home , then I passed out and they brought me to the hospital , ' said a startled looking 11 - year - old , Tahira , from her hospital bed .
At least 98 patients were admitted from Aftab Bachi school , including the principal , 11 teachers and two cleaners
One of the affected girls is treated for the affects of the poisoning
One girl said she planned to go back to school when she felt better , but that now it would fill her with fear .
' I'm going to be scared when I go back to school .
What if we die ? ' she said .
Interior Ministry Spokesman Zemeri Bashary said officials suspect some sort of gas poisoning , and that police were still investigating .
Under the Taliban 's 1996 - 2001 regime , girls were not allowed to attend school .
Though it was unclear if the recent incidents were the result of attacks , militants in the south have previously assaulted schoolgirls by spraying acid in their faces and burning down schools to protest the government .
Scores of Afghan schools have been forced to close because of violence .
Still , the three recent apparent poisonings have taken place in northeast Afghanistan , which is not as opposed to education for girls as Afghanistan 's conservative southern regions .
The first apparent poison attack took place late last month in Parwan , when dozens of girls were hospitalised after being sickened by what Afghan officials said were strong fumes or a possible poison gas cloud .
In response to a post about how Fox News falsely claimed the Dow dropped 56 points during a speech by President Obama , an e-mailer offers up a snarky question ( subject line Fauxviating ) :
So what has the DOW done since Faux came into existence ?
Obviously , the question mocks
Fox 's favorite sport , highlighting ( or inventing ) drops in the Dow while a Democrat speaks .
Just for the record , Fox Business News had its first broadcast on October 15 , 2007 .
The previous close was 14,093.08 .
In other words , since Fox Business News came into existence , the Dow has dropped nearly 50 % .
So if you 're wondering which business network has caused the most damage to the nation 's economy , move over CNBC !
It 's Fox Business News !*

Grand Experiments : Eclipse is a Robot !
“ You are members of a shadowy government conspiracy to assassinate the President and derail the proceedings to have the US join the League of Allied Nations .
To do this you have tracked down and taken control of an experimental weapon created by a secret government project . ”
“ Due to a glitch this device believes it is a human being … ”
— excerpt from the conspirators ’ handout
During my New Century City superhero campaign ( the one that spawned all the M&M adventures ) , one of the subplots was that a main PC , the rookie hero Eclipse , did n’t know his origin .
He was raised by foster parents , but had vague hints that his real parents were scientists that had given him his powers ( with science ! ) before some disaster had taken their lives yadda yadda yadda .
I know — crazy superhero stuff .
So we ’re about 40 games into the campaign , and I decide to run a showcase episode “ Origin of the Eclipse ” to explore the secrets of his past .
At least that ’s what I say I ’m doing …
We start off with all the usual shticks .
Suspicious people turn up who seem to be either trying to warn Eclipse or find out what he knows , there are old photos of people who seem eerily familiar , incomplete files of ominous portent , allusions to secret projects better left buried — all the standard build - up as we warm up the mystery .
There a few are close scrapes and a bad encounter with knock - out gas , until finally Eclipse corners one of the guys who seems to know a lot but dreads saying anything useful ( “ you ’re better off not knowing !
leave the past alone ! ” ) .
And this guy looks very afraid of Eclipse , which is strange , because Eclipse is a lovable hero .
Just then Eclipse spots a sniper on a nearby roof and heroically leaps to shield the guy .
Bang !
Eclipse gets shot ( did I mention his powers did not include being bullet proof ? ) but when he looks down instead of blood he sees sparks and broken circuitry .
The guy he just saved is looking at him in horror , saying “ oh my god , it ’s true !
You ’re not human .
You ’re a robot ! ”
And then Eclipse blacks out .
End game session : to be continued .
Woo , surprise !
You ’re not what you think you are !
But that ’s not the experimental part .
As the game is breaking up I have a quick huddle with Eclipse ’s player and admit that no , of course Eclipse really is n’t a robot , just wait and see what happens .
Because it ’s his character , right ?
I ’m really not trying to jerk him around or leave him hanging .
But I tell him to keep it under his hat and I do n’t tell any of the other players , so on the email list there are all these “ holy crap , Eclipse is a robot ? !? ” messages flying around , because it is a pretty surprising twist .
Metagaming spelled backwards is Gnimagatem
So the next game session ( Origin of the Eclipse , part 2 ) we have this NormalVision / VillainVision scene where the other players ( who are running their own superheroes most of the game ) play the NPC spies / conspirators who ’ve now captured robot - Eclipse and are reprogramming him to follow their orders and carry out a scheme to assassinate the president .
[ Technically it ’s only sort of NormalVision , since the NV players are in the scene with a normal PC . ]
I send Eclipse ’s player out of the room to brief the other players on their roles as the conspirators .
I give them a background handout outlining their whole plan , how they need to handle the robot - Eclipse and get him to relinquish his delusions of humanity , the works .
They ’re even told how they ’ve opened an access panel on Eclipse and attached leads to monitor his functions , and how if he gets uppity they can override him with a particular command phrase .
But here ’s the thing : as I already said , Eclipse really is n’t a robot .
Early in the last game when Eclipse got knocked out by gas , the conspirators really captured him and hypnotized him .
They gave him a post - hypnotic suggestion , so he would think he was seeing cybernetic parts in his body and think he was a robot .
The sniper shot blanks , and the rest was a hallucination .
The conspirators are just brain - washing him to think he ’s a robot so he ’ll carry out their nefarious plan without his morals getting in the way .
They ’re just pretending to attach leads and monitor his “ electronic brain ” and all that stuff .
The conspirator NPCs of course know all that , but I intentionally do n’t tell the players running them in this scene .
So now everything in the scene is backwards :
– Eclipse ’s player is running a character who thinks he is a robot , but the player knows that ’s not true ( player knows the truth , character does n’t )
– The other players are playing characters who are pretending that Eclipse is a robot to trick him , but the players think it ’s for real ( characters know the truth , players do n’t )
It ’s crazy backwards metagaming , players having less knowledge than the characters .
Who ’s the Audience ?
They play it all out , with the conspirators pushing Eclipse to stop pretending to be a person , and Eclipse doing a reticent “ yes– masters– ” bit .
Then just a few scenes later the players ( now back playing their normal superheroes ) uncover the conspiracy , find out about the brainwashing attempt , and realize they have to find and stop Eclipse .
Mystery over .
The question is , who was that scene for anyway ?
Sure all that inversion of player / character knowledge is interesting and experimental , but what purpose did it serve ?
The more obvious reason is that a good story needs to come out one piece at a time .
You have to absorb and accept each moment before the next twist comes along and changes everything .
If you just summarized what happened or skipped to the end ( “ Eclipse was brainwashed to think he was a robot and assassinate the president , now we have to stop him ” ) it ’s all at arms length .
It ’s not interesting .
But if you live through all the twists and turns you get sucked in ( q.v. Revelations ) .
The other players were surprised to find out Eclipse was a robot , and later when they find out it was a trick they get to say holy crap all over again .
They really “ get ” the experience of Eclipse thinking he ’s a robot , because they ’re in the scene doing it , rather than just hearing about it later .
They ’re participating in the plot , not just watching it .
That ’s part of why it ’s _a game_ not a story .
Which leads us to the other more slippery reason , which is that this whole metagaming flip actually makes the conspirator players stand in as surrogate - victims .
By tricking those other players into believing the lies their own ( temporary ) characters are telling , those players are taking the place of Eclipse ’s player as the ones getting deceived .
We get the suspense and impact of a player character turning out to be some kind of monster , but the player who actually cares ( Eclipse ’s player ) is n’t left hanging by it because he already knows it ’s all fake .
See , I told you it was slippery .
Take Home Lessons : Respect gets Respect
Attentive readers will jump up and down and shout that in a previous article I said something along the lines of “ it is forbidden to interfere with the flow of information between the character and the player .
You can never say ‘ yes , your character knew that all along , but I did n’t tell you . ' ”
But I ’d remind the gentle reader that I also said , hell yes you can , just recognize that you are playing with dynamite and breaking all the rules .
This game was definitely a special case , since the players were controlling NPCs , not their normal characters .
I took pretty good care to make sure the people with real investment ( Eclipse ’s player in this case ) were not usurped — that was really the whole point .
And that ’s the take - home lesson .
If there ’s ownership and investment , respect it and think about what you ’re doing , but if there is n’t , well knock yourself out .
You can get away with crazy stuff in a one - shot game that you could n’t in a long campaign , but of course the flip side is that if you did it in a long campaign it is potentially much more meaningful .
But dangerous .
What happened to poor not - really - a- robot Eclipse ?
When the dust settled , he knew nothing more about his origin than he did at the start — the clues the conspirators left in his path were just fabrications to throw him off balance and make him vulnerable to their suggestions .
Luckily he also failed to assassinate the President — but not for lack of trying — and the heroes found out that in a world with superheroes and supervillains , the Secret Service is not to be trifled with , because you ca n’t outrun telepaths .
Here 's Joaquin Phoenix on David Letterman later tonight , either stoned out of his mind or just medically catatonic ( or both ) .
Letterman makes several heroic efforts to politely prompt Phoenix before ruthlessly mocking him .
Again , celebrities :
Dave does n't want to rip you to shreds on national television , but if you 're not going to help him fill the 10 minutes or whatever , he has no choice .
This particular trainwreck was predictable .
The movie star has been generating embarrassing tabloid headlines for weeks with his slurry rap performances , to the point where some of his associates started insisting the whole thing was a joke .
Phoenix then had to assure everyone he was serious .
Phoenix also announced that Two Lovers , the film he was sent on Letterman to promote , would be his last , since acting now bores him .
So even if he had n't been behaving erratically , Phoenix was not likely to have brought much enthusiasm to Late Show tonight .
Phoenix certainly knows how to turn on the late - night charm when he wants to ; here he is on Letterman on 2005 , sounding coherent and humorous ( and wearing the same suit ! ) while promoting Walk the Line :
This time around , Phoenix has either come unhinged again , or wants the world to think he has .
It 's possible he 's engaging in some performance art for the documentary his brother - in - law is making about him .
But on Letterman , at least , where Phoenix grew increasingly hostile toward the host and crowd , the celebrity does n't appear to be doing that sort of cool - headed calculation and planning .
At the end of the interview , Letterman says he owes an apology to Farrah Fawcett .
Fawcett was considered his all time most disastrous guest — until now at least .
Here 's her 1997 appearance :
Best moments from tonight 's show are above ; the full CBS highlights reel is below :
My favorite place in Japan was the subject for this months Japan Blog Matsuri and the entries are as varied as the country itself .
From north to south , from some the places we ’ve all heard about to those that will likely never be written about in a Japan Guidebook .
They are all beautiful , if only in the memories of those who visited them and I hoping that by sharing them you will be inspired to visit them for yourself .
This month we had some great participants from the JapanSoc Flickr Group that have been interspersed with links to articles on a number of great Japan blogs .
Enjoy !

With the basic structure for our Framework in place , it is time to start adding functionality to it .
In this tutorial we will create a template manager and database handler , bringing us a step closer to a powerful Framework fit for use for almost any project .
If you have n't already , be sure to review Part 1 of this series first !
MVC : Tweak the structure
In the first part of this tutorial , we created a folder called controllers to store the business logic for our applications .
As daok pointed out in a comment , this is n't the best place for all of the business logic , and that a model should be used to store this logic .
Previously , I have always used the database itself as the model in the majority of my applications , however , seperating this out a little more will make our framework even more powerful , and easier to extend .
So , what is MVC ?
MVC is a design pattern ( as was the Singleton and Registry patterns we looked at in part 1 ) , and it stands for Model View Controller , and the aim of this pattern is to seperate the business logic , user interface actions and the user interface from one another .
Although we are not going to do anything with our models and controllers just yet , let 's update our frameworks folder structure to include the " models " folder .
The model will contain the main business logic , and the controller will deal with user interaction ( e.g. submitting data , such as a comment ) .
NB : Our __autoload function does not need to be changed .
Database Handler
Most websites and web applications which make use of PHP also make use of a database engine , such as MySQL .
If we keep all of our database related functions in the same place , then we can ( in theory ) easily change the database engine we use .
We can also make certain operations easier , such as inserting records , updating records or deleting records from the database .
It can also make it easier when dealing with multiple database connections .
So ... what should our database handler do :
Manage connections to the database
Try to provide some level of abstraction from the database
Cache queries so we can use them later
Make common database operations easier
Let 's look at the code for our database handler , then we will discuss it afterwards .
Before discussing this in more detail , I should point out that this database handler is very basic .
We could provide complete abstraction by not executing queries directly , but instead constructing queries based on paramaters to a query function , and then executing it .
Our delete , insert and update record methods make it easier to perform some common tasks ( as I mentioned above we could extend this to do much much more ) , by only providing information such as the table name , an array of fields and coresponding values , limit values and conditions .
Queries can also be " cached " so that we can do things with them later .
I find this feature ( as well as the ability to " cache " arrays of data ) is very handy when combined with a template manager , as we can easily iterate through rows of data and populate it into our templates with little fuss , as you will see when we look at the template manager .
We can also work with multiple database connections relatively easily , so long as we switch between the appropriate connections when we need to ( although this wo n't work when caching queries and retrieving them via our template manager without further work ) , for example , the code snippet below would allow us to delete records from two databases .
How might we want to extend this class ?
Full abstraction
Make use of inheritance , create an interface and have database classes inherit from it , each for different database engines
Store the connection ID 's along with the query when caching queries
Improve data sanitizing , depending on the type of data we wish to sanitize
Template Manager
The template manager will handle all of the output , it needs to be able to work with various different template files , replace placeholders ( I call them tags ) with data and iterate through parts of the template with multiple rows of data from the database .
To make things easier , we will make use of a page class to contain the content related to the page , this also makes it easier for us to extend this and add features to it later .
The template manager will manage this object .
So , what exactly does this class do ?
Creates our page object , and bases it from template files , the page object contains the content and information which is needed to make - up the HTML of the page .
We then build FromTemplate ( 'templatefile.tpl.php ' , ' templatefile2.tpl.php ' ) to get the initial content for our page , this method takes any number of template files as its arguments , and stitches them together in order , useful for header , content and footer templates .
Manages the content associated with the page by helping the page object maintain a record of data to be replaced into the page , and also additional template bits which need to be incorporated into the page ( addTemplateBit ( ' userbar ' , 'usertoolsbar.tpl.php ' ) ) .
Adds data and content to the page by performing various replace operations on the page content , including retrieving results from a cached query and adding them to the page .
The template file needs to mark within itself where a cached query needs to be retrieved and the data from the query replaced .
When the template manager encounters a tag to replace which is a query , it gets the chunk of the page where it needs to iterate through by calling getBlock ( ' block ' ) on the page object .
This chunk of content is then copied for each record in the query , and has tags within it replaced with the results from the query .
We will take a look at how this looks in the template later in this tutorial .
Template Manager : Page
The page object is managed by the template manager , and it used to contain all of the details related to the page .
This leaves the template manager free to manage , while making it easier for us to extend the functionality of this at a later date .
How can this class be extended and improved ?
PostParseTags :
You may wish to have tags replaced after most of the page has been parsed , maybe content in the database contains tags which need to be parsed .
Passworded pages : Assign a password to a page , check to see if the user has the password in a cookie or a session to allow them to see the page .
Restricted pages ( although we need our authentication components first ! )
Altering the
Dynamically adding references to javascript and css files based on the page or application .
Load core objects
Now that we have some objects which our registry is going to store for us , we need to tell the registry which objects these are .
I 've created a method in the PCARegistry object called loadCoreObjects which ( as it says ) loads the core objects .
This means can can just call this from our index .
php file to load the registry with these objects .
This method can be altered later to encorporate the other core objects the registry should load , of course there may be objects which we want our registry to manage , but only depending on the application the framework is used for .
These objects would be loaded outside of this method .
Some Data
So that we can demonstrate the new features added to our framework , we need a database to make use of the database handler , and some of the template management functions ( where we replace a block of content with the rows in the database ) .
The demonstration site we will make with our framework by the end of this series of tutorials is a website with a members directory , so let 's make a very basic database table for members profiles , containing an ID , name , and email address .
Obviously , we need a few rows of data in this table !
A quick template
In order for anything to be displayed , we need a basic template , where we will list the data from our members table .
The START members and END members HTML comments denote the members block ( which is obtained via the getBlock ( ) method on the page ) , this is where the template manager will iterate through the records in the database and display them .
Framework in use
Now , we need to bring this all together , with our index . php file :
If we now view this page in our web browser , the results of the query are displayed on the page :
Coming in part 3 ...
In part three we will take a slight detour from the development side of our Framework , and look at how to design with our framework in mind , and how to slice up HTML templates so that they are suitable for our framework .
When we start to build our first application with our framework , we will look in more detail at some of the workings of these classes .
Finally , thank you for your comments last time !

A climate of fear , created by pervasive , excessive and arbitrary punishment , permeated most of the institutions and all those run for boys .
Children lived with the daily terror of not knowing where the next beating was coming from .
The report found that molestation and rape were " endemic " in boys ' facilities , chiefly run by the Christian Brothers order , and supervisors pursued policies that increased the danger .
It is tempting to use evidence of the " decades of rapes , humiliation and beatings at Catholic Church - run reform schools for Ireland 's castaway children " to slam the Catholic Church .
With a damning 2,600 page report including the discovery of " previously secret Vatican records that demonstrated church knowledge of pedophiles in their ranks all the way back to the 1930s , " I think this is precisely what should happen .
The problem of child abuse in the Catholic Church is not going away , and it is time for the outrage to translate to action .
It is time for the Catholic Church to fall .
What is the appropriate response to learning that " church officials shielded their orders ' pedophiles from arrest amid a culture of self - serving secrecy ? "
Outrage .
Anything less is simply insufficient .
According to Ireland 's Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse : No child deserves this .
Bringing those who directly perpetrated on children to justice is important .
However , when the Church itself turns out to be a conspirator , it is time to dismantle this sick enterprise once and for all .
Anything less is not justice or even a reasonable facsimile .
Endemic molestation and rape at the hands of Catholics , concealed for decades by the Church .
It is not good enough for various Irish orders to die out .
Not when other officials within the Church were aware of this and turned their backs .
It is not enough that the Church has paid out some money to survivors , not when these sorts of scandals continue to pop up all over the world .

A group of well - to - do German senior citizens , who lost their savings in the credit crunch , staged a revenge attack and held their terrified financial advisor to ransom , according to several published reports Wednesday .
The alleged kidnapping is the latest example of what is being dubbed “ silver crime ” — the violent backlash of pensioners who feel cheated by the world , the Daily Telegraph said .
“ As I was letting myself into my front door I was assaulted from behind and hit hard , ” the financial adviser James Amburn , a 56 - year - old German - American , told the Telegraph .
“ Then they bound me with masking tape until I looked like a mummy .
I thought I was a dead man . ”
He was freed by 40 armed policemen from the counter - terrorist unit last Saturday , after he pretended to send a fax to a Swiss bank asking for the transfer of funds demanded by the pensioners , writing " call.pol - ice " in German .
According to the Telegraph , two couples who entrusted Amburn 's investment company with $ 2.2 million bundled him into an Audi in the west German town of Speyer and drove him to one of their holiday homes near the Austrian border .
Amburn claimed he was held there in a cellar for four days while being fed soup twice a day and beaten .
“ I was beaten .
They threatened again and again to kill me , ” Mr Amburn told the newspaper .
The pensioners are under arrest on suspicion of deprivation of liberty , torture and inflicting grievous bodily harm .
These charges carry a maximum of 15 years in prison , said the Telegraph .
Figures for the amount of violent backlashes of pensioners who feel cheated during the financial crisis have increased , according to the newspaper .
( CNN ) --
New photographs released by NASA have captured images of a vast stellar formation resembling a human hand reaching across space .
NASA 's Chandra Observatory captured this hand - shaped image of an X - ray nebula .
The image , taken by NASA 's space - based Chandra Observatory telescope , shows an X - ray nebula 150 light years across .
It shows what appear to be ghostly blue fingers -- thumb and pinky clearly discernible from index , ring and middle digits -- reaching into a sparkling cloud of fiery red .
NASA says the display is caused by a young and powerful pulsar , known by the rather prosaic name of PSR B1509 - 58 .
" The pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is spewing energy out into the space around it to create complex and intriguing structures , including one that resembles a large cosmic hand , " NASA says .
The space agency says B1509 -- created by a collapsed star -- is one of the most powerful electromagnetic generators in the Galaxy .
The nebula is formed by a torrent of electrons and ions emitted by the 1,700 - year - old phenomenon .
The finger - like structures are apparently caused by " energizing knots of material in a neighboring gas cloud , " NASA says .
NASA scientist Patrick Slane told CNN that he and his fellow astronomers were more interested in the make up of nebula rather than its hand - like appearance .
Watch Slane explain the discovery »
" To tell you the truth , when I first saw the image , it was n't a hand structure that jumped out at me at all , it was other more complex structures , " he told CNN .
" We really concentrated on how this thing could be made rather than what it might be . "

MPs will face greater scrutiny of how they spend their expenses MPs have voted to keep their £ 24,000 second home allowances , but have decided not to award themselves above - inflation pay rises .
They rejected tougher auditing and an alternative expenses regime proposed by a Commons review .
The Tories and Lib Dems condemned the decision but MPs who backed keeping the allowances said they were fair .
But MPs voted for a 2.25 % pay rise , rejecting a proposed £ 650 - a- year " catch - up " payment .
' Own - goal ' A review by the Commons Members Estimate Committee had recommended the additional costs allowance ( ACA ) be replaced and an end to the so - called " John Lewis list " - the use of public money to pay for items like new kitchens and household goods such as TVs .
However , MPs voted by a majority of 28 to retain the ACA and the list , and to have their spending looked at only by internal , rather than external , auditors .
It gives the impression of an abuse of public expenditure
David Winnick , Labour MP
Ministers who voted to keep system Send us your comments
More than 30 government ministers opted to keep the ACA , including Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , Culture Secretary Andy Burnham and Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's parliamentary private secretaries Ian Austin and Angela Smith also voted in this way .
Liberal Democrat Nick Harvey , a member of the estimate committee , said : " It was a total own - goal on the part of the House of Commons .
An opportunity to put our house in order and be seen to put our house in order has been passed up .
" They took all the nice bits of the package but not the ones they did n't like .
They took the spoonful of sugar but refused the medicine . "
For the Conservatives , shadow work and pensions secretary Chris Grayling said : " When Parliament has been under fire in the way it has been over the last few months , it is essential our leaders set the right example .
" David Cameron and the shadow cabinet voted for the abolition of the John Lewis list whilst Gordon Brown and his most senior ministers went Awol .
They are showing blatant contempt for very real public concerns . "
After the expenses vote announcement was read out , Mr Cameron was heard to exclaim : " Where 's the government ? " ' Extraordinary situation '
But Don Touhig , a Labour MP and former minister who spearheaded the drive against reforms , insisted the ACA was necessary .
He said : " I think most fair - minded people would accept that the extraordinary situation of an MP needing to live both in his or her constituency and London requires an allowance to support that cost . "

Conservative former minister Ann Widdecombe , who backed keeping the ACA , said MPs had to " have the guts to stand up for ourselves , to defend the system and say why it is we have that system " .
Otherwise they would " continue to be vilified and " continue to be ridiculed " , she added .
MPs had been able to claim up to £ 250 per item for their second homes without producing receipts - but that threshold was reduced to £ 25 in April .
The existence of the " John Lewis " list , used by Commons officials to determine the maximum value of goods to be claimed for , became known during an information tribunal earlier this year .
Under the plans rejected by the House of Commons , the ACA would have been replaced by an overnight expenses allowance of £ 19,600 a year for accommodation .
Conway MPs would also have been given a £ 30 - a - day subsistence allowance without receipts , up to a maximum of £ 4,600 every year .
The expenses review was prompted by the furore over MP Derek Conway 's payments of more than £ 40,000 to his son for work as a parliamentary researcher , despite him being a full - time student in Newcastle .
He was suspended from Parliament for 10 days and was ordered to repay £ 13,161 .
Mr Conway also lost the Conservative whip .
Meanwhile , MPs voted in line with the government 's call to reject recommendations for above - inflation pay rises .
Earlier , Mr Brown said MPs should " recognise that the settlements in the public sector for these key workers have been around 2.3 , 2.4 and 2.5 ( % ) , when they vote on this year 's pay " .
An independent review by Sir John Baker had recommended that MPs ' pay be linked to the public sector average earnings index , and include a £ 650 - a- year " catch - up " payment - which would amount to around 4.4 % rise in total .
But the government opposed this .
It wanted MPs to receive the median average of " a wide basket of public sector workers " - amounting to around 2.25 % .
MPs rejected a backbench move to raise pay by 2.3 % this year and about 4.7 % next year .
They backed the 2.25 % rise without a vote , along with a recommendation that they should no longer vote on their own pay .

It 's the kind of story that makes you ask yourself , " How big does a model rocket have to be before it stops being a model and becomes real ? "
Also , if you 're anything like me , it makes you really want to rearrange your schedule so you can watch the 8,000 pounds of thrust take it into the air .
If all goes well , this coming Saturday , on the Eastern Shore of Maryland , the dream of a man named Steve Eves will be realized .
Eves has created , at great expense of both money and time , a 1 - 10 ratio scale model of the Saturn V rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon .
If successful , Eves will enter the record books for launching the largest - ever model rocket .
He will also simultaneously fulfill a longtime dream of his and create an awesomely huge spectacle for all those watching .
This is an absolutely enormous rocket , standing 36 feet tall and weighing at least 1,700 pounds .
It 's big enough that , according to this awesome article about Eves and his quest to build the rocket , a spectator asked him where the astronaut was going to sit .
The propulsion piece of the rocket is so heavy it will have four parachutes attached so it will , hopefully , land without sustaining damage .
If it were n't made to look like a Saturn V , there are few people outside of the world of high - powered model rocketry who would call it a " model . "
For my money , this is a realrocket .
Price , Maryland , is a rural spot only about two hours from my home , so I 'm awfully tempted to try to take my kids to watch the launch .
If I do , I will of course post pictures to GeekDad .

Since we launched Google Product Search for mobile a few weeks ago , I 've been using it to check prices , reviews and product details on my Android phone .
In addition to typing in my product searches , I 've also had some fun speaking them .
Sometimes , though , when I 'm looking up a specific item in a store rather than a category of products ( like " bluetooth headsets " ) , I 'd rather just scan a barcode to see results for the exact product I 'm searching for .
That 's why we 've integrated barcode scanning with Google Product Search for mobile .
Here 's how to get started .
First , visit the Google Product Search for mobile homepage by going to Google.com in your browser and selecting ' Shopping ' from the ' more ' tab .
Next , tap on the ' Scan Barcode ' button to install the latest version of the Barcode Scanner app -- if you do n't already have it -- from Android Market .
After you 've installed the application , go back to Product Search in your browser and tap on the ' Scan Barcode ' button again .
Select " Use by default for this action " and tap on the Barcode Scanner option .
After the app opens , center the red line over the barcode and hold the phone steady .
When the barcode is read successfully , you 'll see a Google Product Search results page back in the browser .
You can also access the scanner directly from the top of the Product Search results page by tapping on the barcode button .
Today , barcode scanning works best for products like electronics , books , movies or video games , but we 're working on adding more barcodes for other items .
Of course , if your scan does not return a result , you can always type in the product name just as before .
The integration of Barcode Scanner and Product Search for mobile is available in the US and UK , for Android - powered devices .

During the Seder , I read the Haggadah and think of my mother .
“ In each and every generation , a person is obligated to regard himself as though he actually left Egypt , ” it says in the Haggadah , which for me means “ In each and every generation , a person is obligated to regard himself as a refugee . ”
My mother was a refugee her entire life .
She was born in 1914 , right before World War I , to a wealthy and aristocratic Jewish family in central Poland .
During the stormy years of the war , the family left its spacious home , traveled across the Austro - Hungarian Empire , and returned when the battles subsided .
She returned to a razed home .
This was her first refugee experience .
Later on , my mother traveled to Krakow to study chemistry at the university there .
Jewish students were assigned separate benches at the edges of the lecture halls .
She met my father during one of her trips .
They got married in 1938 and postponed their honeymoon by a year .
As it turned out , they postponed it forever .
Upon the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , my mother urged my father to escape east with her , to the Soviet Union .
I do not want to see any German faces , she insisted .
They left their home with a handful of personal belongings and became refugees .
They slept on the road , at train cars and train stations , while making their way across the Soviet state .
They experienced frost at the Ural Mountains and scorching heat at the steppes of Uzbekistan , in a neglected clay home on the outskirts of a Muslim town where residents also hated the Jewish refugees .
My father fell ill , while his siblings died in the crematoria .
My parents returned to the communist Poland ; a Poland wounded by the war , devoid of charm , and overcome by hatred ; a Poland that received the survivors with outbursts of violent anti-Semitism .
Why did you return ?
Why did n’t Hitler finish you off ?
We lived in the industrial town of Lodz , in an apartment shared by several families , including a shared bathroom .
We had a room and a half .
A grim backyard .
Drunk neighbors .
A dark , foul - smelling staircase .
My father was a Zionist and worked for local Jewish organizations .
My mother knocked on doors and sought jobs outside the establishment , outside the system .
On occasion , we had night visits by the Polish security services ; the non-communist Jews in Poland were few , and all of them were suspected of espionage and treason .
My mother said : I did not return to a homeland ; I replaced my refugee life with a different kind of refugee life .
The refugee toolbox
We made aliyah from Poland after the collapse of Stalinism .
In Israel , my mother maintained the status of a refugee .
She could not overcome the challenge of Hebrew or the sense of foreignness .
For years we barely subsisted , bordering on poverty .
The Jewish Agency sent us to one transit camp and then to another .
Later we were sent to a tiny apartment in a neighborhood situated between Holon and Bat Yam .
Keep your spirits up , Agency officials told my father ( a prisoner of Zion ) and my mother .
Soon , a high - speed train will be passing through here , and these apartments will be worth a fortune .
These officials were a little premature – the trains will pass through the area by 2010 , 50 years later .
In order to maintain a minimal standard of living , my mother worked as a maid for wealthy families in northern and central Tel Aviv .
She carried baskets and washed floors , just like a foreign laborer .
On occasion I take part in public debates regarding discrimination in Israel .
“ What do you , Ashkenazim , know about poverty , ” a professor or doctor of Mizrahi descent tells me .
I do not reply : One ’s CV should not serve as an argument in a debate .
I recounted the synopsis of my mother ’s life in answer to the following question :
What did I get from her that helped me later in life ?
I got the refugee toolbox : Determination not to show despair , constant willingness to start everything anew , and the belief that no job is too humiliating and that it must be done well .
I also gained curiosity , tolerance , endurance , and the ability to keep anger bottled up inside .
I also gained the powerful hope that even in difficult situations we always have the freedom of choice ; nothing is pre-determined .
I also took from my mother a slight revulsion in the face of big money and the reminder that there are always weaker people , whose situation is worst than mine .
Do n’t judge them ; speak on their behalf , my mother taught me .
My mother did not understand economics , but she did understand what it takes to write for human beings .
Until she was on her deathbed , I would read out my articles to her , translated to Polish .
She was my most demanding critic .
Older people should not be writing about their parents , but rather , about their children .
This will make for optimistic writing .
My children are wonderful and happy ; my mother was an unhappy woman who did not feel that she belonged most of her life .
She made do with little , and even the little was scarce .
She was small and withered , she coughed , and she died suffering .
Her death did not leave an empty space in the world .
So when people ask me why I ’m a Zionist , I reply :
So that my children wo n’t be refugees like my mother was .
An Indonesian lowland forest habitat that is home to about 100 Sumatran orangutans recently reintroduced to the wild could be destroyed within months if a massive logging plan proceeds , a coalition of five conservation groups warns .
A joint venture of Asia Pacific Pulp & Paper ( APP ) and Sinar Mas Group had received a license to clear the largest portion of natural forest remaining outside the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in Jambi province of Sumatra .
“ It took scientists decades to discover how to successfully reintroduce critically endangered orangutans from captivity into the wild .
It could take APP just months to destroy an important part of their new habitat , ” said Peter Pratje of the Frankfurt Zoological Society , one of the groups .
The unprotected forest is also home to about 100 of the last 400 critically endangered Sumatran tigers still remaining in the wild .
The environmental coalition is urging Indonesian officials and APP ’s investors to halt the deforestation plan .
Sumatra lost nearly half of its natural forest in the 20 years ending in 2007 .
Only about a third of its original forested areas remain .
A road recently carved out by APP deep into the Bukit Tigapuluh forest has opened up access for rampant illegal logging practices and set the stage for wholesale destruction of tiger , elephant and ape habitats , the conservation groups warn .
" APP 's plan is devastating and it will almost certainly lead to more fatalities since tigers and people will be forced into closer contact with each other as the tigers ' forest disappears , " Dally Priatna of the Zoological Society of London said .

Who Betrayed ' Objective ' Journalism ?
The mainstream U.S. news media often laments the decline of objective journalism , pointing disapprovingly at the more subjective news that comes from the Internet or from ideological programming whether Fox News on the Right or some MSNBC hosts on the Left.
Email
Printer friendly
But one could argue that the U.S. mainstream press has inflicted the severest damage to the concept of objective journalism by routinely ignoring those principles , which demand that a reporter set aside personal prejudices ( as best one can ) and approach each story with a common standard of fairness .
The truth is that powerful mainstream news organizations have their own sacred cows and tend to hire journalists who intuitively take into account whose ox might get gored while doing a story .
In other words , mainstream ( or centrist ) journalism has its own biases though they may be less noticeable because they often reflect the prevailing view of the national Establishment .
How that translates into daily coverage is that an American news outlet often will demand a much lower threshold of evidence about serious accusations against a perceived U.S. enemy than an ally .
For instance , during the 1980s , when I was with the Associated Press and Newsweek , I witnessed extraordinary demands for airtight evidence regarding the real problem of cocaine trafficking by the U.S. - backed Nicaraguan contras , compared with easy acceptance of flimsy evidence about similar accusations against Nicaragua ’s Sandinista government .
After all , President Ronald Reagan had hailed the contras as “ the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers ” and had denounced Sandinista - ruled Nicaragua as " a totalitarian dungeon . ”
Truly objective U.S. journalism would have tossed out Reagan ’s characterizations and simply evaluated the cocaine - smuggling evidence , but that was not how it worked .
Even years later , in 1998 when the CIA ’s inspector general concluded that scores of contra figures and groups were implicated in cocaine smuggling , the mainstream U.S. news media ignored or downplayed those findings , while continuing to pummel journalist Gary Webb for flaws in his multi-part investigative series that had revived the contra-cocaine issue in 1996 .
The journalistic blacklisting of Webb – carried out by the leading lights of U.S. newspapers ( the New York Times , Washington Post and Los Angeles Times ) – contributed to Webb ’s suicide in 2004 .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ We All Failed Gary Webb . ” ]
While the Webb tragedy may have been an extreme case of the mainstream news media tailoring its coverage of a controversial issue to fit acceptable political parameters , the constraints that applied to the contra - cocaine issue were part of a long - running pattern .
Indeed , several years after ganging up on Gary Webb – and protecting Reagan ’s beloved contras – many of the same newspapers got in line behind President George W. Bush ’s case for war against Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
Claims about Hussein ’s supposed WMD stockpiles were trumpeted while contrary evidence was muted .
The Hariri Example Even after Bush invaded Iraq and discovered no WMD , the U.S. news media did n’t seem to learn much .
In another case that has recently returned to the news – alleged Syrian complicity in the Feb. 14 , 2005 , assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri – the double standards continued .
Because Syria was then on President Bush ’s hit list for “ regime change , ” speculative evidence of Syrian guilt was widely accepted by the U.S. news media , which demonstrated very little skepticism toward a preliminary United Nations report implicating Syrian leaders and their Lebanese allies .
“ There is probable cause to believe that the decision to assassinate former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri could not have been taken without the approval of top - ranked Syrian security officials and could not have been further organized without the collusion of their counterparts in the Lebanese security services , ” declared the U.N. ’s first interim report on Oct. 20 , 2005 .
Despite the curiously vague wording – “ probable cause to believe ” the killing “ could not have been taken without the approval ” and “ without the collusion ” – Bush immediately termed the findings “ very disturbing ” and called for the Security Council to take action against Syria .
The U.S. press joined the stampede in assuming Syrian guilt .
On Oct. 25 , 2005 , a New York Times editorial said the U.N. investigation had been “ tough and meticulous ” in establishing “ some deeply troubling facts ” about Hariri ’s murderers .
The Times demanded punishment of top Syrian officials and their Lebanese allies .
But the U.N. investigative report by German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis was anything but “ meticulous . ”
Indeed , it read more like a compilation of circumstantial evidence and conspiracy theories than a dispassionate pursuit of the truth .
As a wealthy businessman with close ties to the Saudi monarchy , Hariri had many enemies who might have wanted him dead for his business or political dealings .
The Syrians were not alone in having a motive to eliminate Hariri .
Indeed , after the assassination , a videotape was delivered to al - Jazeera television on which a Lebanese youth , Ahmad Abu Adass , claimed to have carried out the suicide bombing on behalf of Islamic militants angered by Hariri ’s work for “ the agent of the infidels ” in Saudi Arabia .
However , the initial U.N. report relied on two witnesses – Zuhair Ibn Muhammad Said Saddik and Hussam Taher Hussam – to dismiss the videotape as part of a disinformation campaign designed to deflect suspicion from Syria .
Investigator Mehlis then spun a narrative of a Syrian conspiracy to kill Hariri .
The findings meshed well with the Bush administration ’s goals and the desire of anti-Syrian Lebanese politicians to isolate Syrian sympathizers and force a full withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanese territory .
Four pro-Syrian Lebanese security officials were jailed on suspicion of involvement in Hariri 's murder .
Everything was falling neatly into place .
As a new U.S. press hysteria built over another case of pure evil traced to the doorstep of an American adversary , the holes in the U.N. report were mostly ignored .
At Consortiumnews.com , we produced one of the few critical examinations of what had the looks of another rush to judgment .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Dangerously Incomplete Hariri Report . ” ]
A Case Crumbles Much like the Iraqi WMD evidence , the Hariri case soon began to crumble .
One witness , Saddik , was identified by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel as a swindler who boasted about becoming “ a millionaire ” from his Hariri testimony .
The other one , Hussam , recanted his testimony about Syrian involvement , saying he lied to the Mehlis investigation after being kidnapped , tortured and offered $ 1.3 million by Lebanese officials .
Mehlis soon stepped down , as even the New York Times acknowledged that the conflicting accusations had given the investigation the feel of “ a fictional spy thriller . ”
[ NYT , Dec. 7 , 2005 ]
Mehlis ’s replacements backed away from his Syrian accusations .
The next chief investigator , Serge Brammertz of Belgium , began entertaining other investigative leads , examining a variety of possible motives and a number of potential perpetrators .
“ Given the many different positions occupied by Mr. Hariri , and his wide range of public and private - sector activities , the [ U.N. ] commission was investigating a number of different motives , including political motivations , personal vendettas , financial circumstances and extremist ideologies , or any combination of those motivations , ” Brammertz ’s interim report said , according to a U.N. statement on June 14 , 2006 .
In other words , Brammertz had dumped Mehlis ’s single - minded theory that had pinned the blame on senior Syrian security officials .
Though Syria ’s freewheeling intelligence services and their Lebanese cohorts remained on everyone ’s suspect list , Brammertz adopted a far less confrontational and accusatory tone toward Syria .
Syria had kind words for Brammertz ’s report , too .
Fayssal Mekdad , Syria ’s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs , praised “ its objectivity and professionalism ” and said the investigators “ had begun to uncover the truth ” after Mehlis departed .
Still , the U.S. news media , which had played the initial Mehlis accusations against Syria as front - page news , barely mentioned the shift in the U.N. probe .
Virtually nothing appeared in the U.S. news media that would alert the American people to the fact that the distinct impression they got in 2005 – that the Syrian government had engineered a terrorist bombing in Beirut – was now a whole lot fuzzier .
Instead , it remained common practice for the U.S. news media to continue citing the Mehlis report and referring to " Syrian officials implicated in Mr. Hariri's killing " – as the New York Times did – without providing more context .
Freeing the ‘ Suspects ’
Now , more than four years after the Hariri assassination , the U.N. tribunal handling his murder and other terrorist acts in Lebanon finally has acknowledged that it lacks evidence to indict the four security officials who have been held without formal charges since 2005 .
That shift was foreshadowed in a Dec. 2 , 2008 , interim report to the U.N. Security Council , which lamented the complexity of the case .
“ For every inch of progress there is a mile of effort , ” the report said .
“ Those responsible for the attacks were professional and took extensive measures to cover their tracks and hide their identity .
Much of the Commission ’s activity at this point in the investigation focuses on piercing this smokescreen to get at the truth . ”
On Wednesday , Judge Daniel Fransen of a special international tribunal ordered the four imprisoned security officials released .
In a similar situation – say , one that involved a U.S. ally – the release would have been viewed as proof of innocence or at least the absence of significant evidence of guilt .
In this case , however , the New York Times refused to acknowledge the obvious fact that the case against Syrian complicity remains weak .
Instead , the Times framed the development as underscoring “ the legal pitfalls of a divisive international trial . ” [ NYT , April 30 , 2009 ]
The stubbornly one - sided approach can be explained by the fact that U.S. journalists fear that balanced reporting about a case involving an unpopular regime like Syria can have negative career consequences .
That risk would rise dramatically if it were to turn out that the Syrian security officials were guilty after all , which remains a distinct possibility .
So slanting the story in an anti-Syrian direction makes all the career sense in the world , much as it did to buy into Bush ’s WMD claims about Iraq before the invasion .
What do you think would have happened to a U.S. reporter ’s career if he or she had raised a lot of questions about the WMD and it turned out that Saddam Hussein was hiding secret stockpiles ?
Career - minded reporters and editors judged that the smart strategy was to play up the anti-Iraq WMD claims – even though they came from dubious and self - interested sources – and to play down or ignore the counter - evidence .
Though the world has now seen the extraordinary cost in blood and treasure because of the failure of the U.S. news media to act professionally in the run-up to the Iraq War , there is little indication that the national press corps has learned lasting lessons from that catastrophe , as the Hariri case shows .
Another casualty of this behavior has been the discrediting of “ objective journalism , ” which after all rests on the courage of reporters and editors to insist on fairness even when the pressure is intense to go with the flow .
Objectivity means applying a single standard to friends – and to foes .
So , while the mainstream U.S. press can legitimately criticize news outlets that let ideology contaminate a commitment to the truth , is it really any better to let misguided patriotism – or fear of career retribution – distort the facts ?

As General Motors teeters towards bankruptcy , with a looming deadline of midnight tonight for bondholders to agree to a stock swap , Reuters reports that the talks do n't look promising .
The Wall Street Journal got the scoop regarding how the unions will shake out in all of this : very similarly to how they did with Chrysler .
This seemingly good news for unions might actually turn out to harm them .
According to the WSJ , unions will end up owning 17.5 % of the company 's common stock , along with $ 6.5 billion in preferred stock ( which includes a whopping 9 % annual dividend ) .
The agreement largely mirrors concessions the union granted to Chrysler LLC last month , including a suspension of cost - of - living allowances , bonuses and some holidays , people familiar with the agreement said .
It also includes a provision for job buyouts , as well as to forbid strikes until 2015 , these people said .
Wages are expected to remain unchanged .
And , of course , one should expect the GM bankruptcy proceedings to go exactly like the Chrysler proceedings : very well for the unions and very badly for bondholders .
Hedge fund manager George Schultze was on CNBC earlier arguing that bond investors are going to be very wary about funding unionized firms , given GM will likely shake out just like Chrysler did .
That led me to this gem from Bloomberg last week .
In it , Schultze is quoted about lessons learned by bondholders though the automaker bankruptcies :
The obvious one is :
Do n't lend to a company with big legacy liabilities or demand a much higher rate of interest because you may be leapfrogged in a bankruptcy .
This strikes me as an extremely important conclusion , which is difficult to deny .
Bond investors literally can't afford to lend to unionized companies because it 's clear that current power in Washington will take the unions ' side , despite past bankruptcy law precedents that favor senior creditors .
That means Washington 's actions in pushing for these bankruptcy verdicts to come out in favor of the unions will probably hurt unionized companies in the long run .
As a result , it might be wise for Washington to reconsider the precedents it 's setting for unionized companies undergoing bankruptcy .

A new era : Lykos admits mistakes in Rachell case COMMENTARY
Lykos ’ feat : using the active voice
There are places and institutions where what District Attorney Pat Lykos did last week would seem normal .
But this is Harris County , Texas .
And the institution is the District Attorney ’s Office .
So what Lykos did verged on the revolutionary .
She not only admitted mistakes , she used the active voice .
In a report detailing the sorry series of errors that led to the false child rape conviction of Ricardo Rachell and his more than five years in prison , she did n’t conclude by burrowing into the conventional refuge of bureaucrats , the passive voice .
As in : “ Mistakes were made . ”
Instead , she detailed the specifics and named names of prosecutors , defense attorneys and police officers who ignored evidence supporting Rachell ’s innocence .
And she apologized to Rachell and the public .
Granted , it ’s easier to apologize for mistakes made during your predecessor ’s tenure .
Another test will come when inevitably , given the size the caseload of the Harris County District Attorney ’s office , her own staff makes a mistake .
Still , the report ( which is linked to this column at www.chron.com), represents a strong step toward changing the culture of an office that not only sent innocent people to prison , but also went into flights of irrational fantasy to avoid admitting errors .
Take the case of George Rodriguez , who was convicted of the 1987 rape of a 14 - year - old girl who mistakenly identified him as one of two assailants .
A key piece of supporting evidence was a pubic hair found in the victim ’s panties .
This was before DNA , but a Houston police crime lab specialist testified wrongly that the hair eliminated another suspect , Ysidro Yanez , but not Rodriguez .
Rodriguez spent 17 years in prison before DNA tests indicated that the hair belonged to Yanez , who by that time was in prison for another crime .
The statute of limitations precluded charging Yanez with the rape .
But then - District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal did n’t apologize .
Instead , his prosecutors asked that Rodriguez be kept in jail under a $ 30,000 bail , which his family could not afford , while the District Attorney ’s Office considered trying him a second time .
The judge denied the request and freed Rodriguez .
Rosenthal ’s office cooked up a fanciful theory , as told to me at the time by a prosecutor : Yanez had previously had sex with someone in the room , and the victim ’s panties picked up one of his hairs when they were thrown on the floor .
Fortunately , even Rosenthal did n’t want to send his prosecutors to a jury with that argument , especially when evidence showed that the girl was kidnapped in Yanez ’s car and work records showed Rodriguez to be at his job at the time of the rape .
Still , Rosenthal refused to admit that Rodriguez was innocent .
Once his conviction was thrown out , the law said Rodriguez was innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .
But the District Attorney ’s Office said he was n’t innocent until it was proved he could n’t possibly have done it .
I have never fully understood why it is so hard for prosecutors to admit a mistake .
( Lykos has never been a prosecutor . )
Perhaps the cost of being wrong is too painful .
Perhaps the psychic energy required to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt requires the abandonment of all doubt , oneself .
Perhaps it ’s the erroneous notion that admitting a mistake shakes public confidence in the system .
But the reality is that we ca n’t have confidence in any large system that does n’t have its own system for discovering its inevitable mistakes , learning from them and taking actions to avoid making them again .
That ’s why the Lykos report boosts confidence in the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office .

Actually , we first learned about Chevron ’s South American shenanigans from our friends at Amazon Watch , who produced this brilliant parody about the oil company ’s Amazon antics , including petroleum profiteering and wide scale environmental abuses in Ecuador .
But mainstream media outlets are finally starting to take big oil to task , exposing its corporate social responsibility mantras as little more than hot air .
Chevron , according to a “ 60 Minutes ” report that aired last night , is the third largest company in the United States , with oil interests all over the world .
Drilling far from home , the company has responded to the U.S. ’s unquenchable thirst for oil .
While reaping a tidy profit–despite the economic downturn , Chevron managed to increase revenues by 25 % ( to $ 263 billion USD ) in 2008 — Chevron has consistently engaged in business and environmental practices that have had very real and devastating consequences for communities and ecosystems in South America , Africa , and on other continents .

Chevron ’s dirty work has been especially damaging in Ecuador , where the world ’s largest environmental lawsuit in history –with more than 30,000 litigants –is getting underway .
Chevron , which started oil prospecting in Ecuador in the 1960s , took the money and ran , leaving a trail of environmental hazards –including leaching waste wells–in its wake .

Another large format comic today , and I even have a couple more of these in the pipeline coming soonish .
Also , since this one probably took me twice as long to complete , my next post was originally planned to be an older strip from the 2007 archives .
However , quite timely I instead just got emailed a lovely guest strip from an awesome reader , so look for that on Friday .

The Obama administration is likely to deal with drugs as a matter of public health rather than criminal justice alone , with treatment 's role growing relative to incarceration , Mr. Kerlikowske said .
Already , the administration has called for an end to the disparity in how crimes involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine are dealt with .
Critics of the law say it unfairly targeted African - American communities , where crack is more prevalent .
The administration also said federal authorities would no longer raid medical - marijuana dispensaries in the 13 states where voters have made medical marijuana legal .
Agents had previously done so under federal law , which does n't provide for any exceptions to its marijuana prohibition .
Clearly marijuana prohibition is unique among American criminal laws .
No other law is both enforced so widely and harshly yet deemed unnecessary by such a substantial portion of the populace .
Police made roughly 800,000 arrests last year for possession of marijuana , typically tiny amounts .
That ’s almost the same number as are arrested each year for cocaine , heroin , methamphetamine , Ecstasy and all other drugs .
Meanwhile recent polls show that over 40 % of Americans think that marijuana should be taxed and regulated like alcohol ; and it ’s closer to 50 % among Democrats , independents , adults under age 30 , and voters in a growing number of western states ... [ W ] hen all is said and done , the principal , and most principled , argument in favor of ending marijuana prohibition is this : whether or not I or anyone else consume marijuana should be none of the government ’s business - so long as I ’m not behind the wheel of a car or otherwise putting others at risk .
It ’s time to get the government off my property and out of both my pockets and my body when it comes to marijuana .
Enough is enough .
Last week when Gil Kerlikowske 's name came before the Senate as head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy ( the drug czar ) , everyone but crazy old coot Tom Coburn voted for him -- and Coburn votes no on everyone and everything ; he 's like someone 's demented old one - eyed aunt in the attic muttering darkly to herself in her a squeaky rocking chair that 's driving her increasingly insane .
Well , Kerlikowske 's got something that 'll fix Coburn right up -- let the kook calm down with some pot .
Kerlikowske was with Seattle law enforcement for 36 years but in his first week on the new job he 's already proposed something pretty startling -- and long overdue : an old to the war on drugs .
It does n't mean nasty old cranks like Coburn can start puffing up a storm ... at least not yet .
What it means is that the government will shift away from expensive and dysfunctional incarceration to more effective ways of reducing drug use -- emphasizing treatment , reducing demand and tackling the problems of interdiction at the borders .
And while Coburn voted against Kerlikowske because he felt he would be too permissive on marijuana use , more rational legislators -- especially Barney Frank ( D - MA ) and Ron Paul ( R - TX ) are saying it 's time to decriminalize personal marijuana use .
And 3 days before Kerlikowske was confirmed , Arnold Schwarzenegger was calling for an open debate on the country 's-- or at least California 's -- antiquated drug laws .
He 's asking legislators to look at the experiences other countries have had when decriminalizing ( and taxing , probably his main motivation ) marijuana .
A week earlier we did just that -- via Glenn Greenwald and the results of decriminalization in Portugal , a huge success .
Schwarzenegger pointed admiringly to a bill in the state Assembly by San Francisco progressive Democrat Tom Ammiano that would bring the state $ 1 billion a year by taxing pot at $ 50 / ounce .
Support for this approach is growing across the political spectrum Tuesday CBS ran an OpEd by Ethan Nadelmann , the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance urging legalization which starts with the premise that marijuana should never have been criminalized in the first place .
On the other hand , if Schwarzenegger can't raise money by taxing pot , how about selling off the state 's monuments ?
He 's proposing selling San Quentin Prison and the Los Angeles Coliseum for starters .
" With its stunning views of the San Francisco Bay , San Quentin has long been eyed for a more lucrative use . "
I wonder what " lucrative use " means .
Something for rich people ?

This out from MSNBC …
MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann on tonight ’s “ Countdown ” pledged to donate $ 10,000 to charity after disc jockey Erich “ Mancow ” Muller was waterboarded today on live radio , in an attempt to prove the technique was “ not torture . ”
After six seconds
Muller said it was “ absolutely torture ” and that were he to be interrogated by the use of waterboarding he would “ confess to anything . ”
Olbermann promised to donate $ 10,000 to the charity Veterans of Valor , founded by Sgt. Klay South , who administered the waterboarding to Muller today , and withdrew his offer to Sean Hannity to make a donation to the charity of his choice if he followed through on his offer to undergo waterboarding .
If you have n’t seen the Mancow waterboarding , you can see the full video here .
It ’s powerful on a number of different levels .
The upshot is that the guy goes into it in cocky Hannity mode and then after maybe 5 or 6 seconds he struggles up and he ’s converted , claiming it ’s “ absolutely torture ” , that he never realized it was that bad , etc .
Now , here ’s the thing .
I ’m genuinely surprised that he was was surprised that it was that bad .
I ’m not saying that for effect .
Muller really seemed to think it was like getting dunked by your friend in a pool or something .
Just factually , everyone who knows anything about this says that it ’s horrific and you pretty much instantly feel like you ’re drowning and at the edge of death .
And it ’s a physiological response .
So even if you ’ve gone through it ten times and know rationally that you do n’t die , it does n’t matter .
You ’re instantly put back into the mental space of drowning and being at the edge of death .
I must confess that when I see Hannity or the rest of these guys saying it ’s no big deal and it ’s not torture , I kind of figured they ’re playing semantic games and essentially saying ‘ I do n’t care what we do to evil Muslim terrorist bad guys . ’
Hang them from them toes , waterboard them , whatever , who cares ?
I do n’t agree with that .
It ’s hideous .
But I understand it .
But here it turns out they ’re just completely ignorant , just have n’t been paying attention .
Just in the purest factual sense have no idea what they ’re talking about .
I know , I know … why am I surprised ?
( ed.note : When does Hannity get waterboarded ?
That may be waterboarding I can believe in . )

Finnish military sniper
Simo " Simuna " Häyhä ( Finnish pronunciation : [ ˈsimo ˈhæy̯hæ ] ; 17 December 1905 – 1 April 2002 ) was a Finnish military sniper .
He used a Finnish - produced M/28 - 30 rifle , a variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle , and a Suomi KP / - 31 submachine gun . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
He is believed to have killed over 500 men during the 1939 – 40 Winter War , the highest number of sniper kills in any major war .
His unit 's captain Antti Rantamaa credited him with 259 confirmed kills by sniper rifle and an equal number of kills by sub machine gun during the Winter War , but later in his book , Rantamaa credited Simo with 542 kills . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Häyhä never talked about it publicly but estimated in his private war - time diary that he shot around 500 . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Early life and youth [ edit ]
Simo Häyhä was born in the municipality of Rautjärvi in the Viipuri Province of southern Finland near the border with Russia .
He was the seventh of eight children in a Lutheran family of farmers .
[ 8 ]
He attended school in the village of Miettilä in Kivennapa parish and cultivated his home farm together with his eldest brother .
He was a farmer , hunter , and skier prior to his military service .
Militia and military service [ edit ]
Häyhä joined the Finnish voluntary militia White Guard ( Suojeluskunta ) at age 17 .
He was successful in shooting competitions in the Viipuri Province ; his home was reportedly full of trophies for marksmanship .
[ 9 ]
He was not keen to hog the spotlight , and correspondingly in the photos of his younger years he usually stood at the very back in group photos , until his later success started to force him to take centre place . [ 10 ]
In 1925 , aged 19 , Häyhä began his 15 months of compulsory military service in the Bicycle Battalion 2 in Raivola , Viipuri Province .
Häyhä attended the Non-Commissioned Officer School and served as a conscript officer in the Bicycle Battalion 1 in Terijoki .
However , he did n't get sniper training until a year before the war in 1938 at a training centre in Utti . [ 5 ]
According to Major Tapio Saarelainen , who wrote
Häyhä 's biography , Häyhä was able to estimate distances with an accuracy of 1 metre ( 3.3 ft ) up to 150 metres ( 500 ft ) . [ 11 ]
Saarelainen notes that during his Civil Guard training , Häyhä once hit a target 16 times from 150 metres away in just one minute .
" This was an unbelievable accomplishment with a bolt action rifle , considering that each cartridge had to be manually fed with a fixed magazine that held together five cartridges . " [ 12 ]
Winter War service [ edit ]
Häyhä served as a sniper for the Finnish Army during the 1939 – 40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union , under Lieutenant Aarne Juutilainen in the 6th Company of Infantry Regiment 34 ( Jalkaväkirykmentti 34 , or JR 34 ) during the Battle of Kollaa in temperatures between − 40 °C ( −40 °F ) and − 20 °C ( −4 °F ) .
Häyhä was dressed completely in white camouflage ; Soviet troops were not issued with camouflage uniforms for most of the war , making them easily visible to snipers in winter conditions .
Joseph Stalin had purged military experts in the late 1930s as part of the Great Purge , and the Red Army was consequently highly disorganized . [ 13 ]
Finnish sources describe that Häyhä was nicknamed " The White Death " by the Red Army ( Russian : Белая смерть , Belaja smert ; Finnish : valkoinen kuolema ; Swedish : den vita döden ) .
[ 5 ]
During the war , the " White Death " was one of the leading themes of Finnish propaganda . [ 14 ]
Finnish newspapers frequently featured the invisible Finnish soldier , thus creating a hero of mythical proportions . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
Achievements as a sniper [ edit ]
All of Häyhä 's kills were accomplished in fewer than 100 days , an average of five per day at a time of year with very few daylight hours . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Häyhä 's kill count as a sniper was based on Häyhä himself , with the confirmation of his comrades , and only those who were killed for certain were considered .
No count was taken when several snipers shot at the same target .
Men killed with a submachine gun as a group leader were not counted . [ 19 ]
[ 20 ]
Häyhä in Kollaa on 17 February 1940 , right after being awarded the honorary rifle .
Häyhä 's division commander Antero Svensson credited him with 219 confirmed sniper kills and an equal number of kills by submachine gun , when he awarded him an honorary rifle on 17 February 1940 . [ 20 ]
On 21 December 1939 , he achieved his highest daily count of 25 kills . [ 21 ]
In his diary , military chaplain Antti Rantama reported 259 confirmed sniper kills and an equal number of kills by submachine gun from the beginning of the war until 7 March 1940 , one day after Häyhä was seriously wounded . [ 5 ]
Some of Häyhä 's figures are from a Finnish Army document , counted from the beginning of the war , 30 November 1939 :
22 December 1939 : 138 sniper kills in 22 days [ 22 ]
26 January 1940 : 199 sniper kills ( 61 in 35 days ) [ 23 ]
17 February 1940 : 219 sniper kills ( 20 in 22 days ) [ 5 ]
7 March 1940 ( one day after Häyhä was seriously wounded ) : total of 259 sniper kills ( 40 in 18 days ) [ 5 ]
Häyhä never discussed it publicly but his own private diary , discovered in 2017 , shares a figure .
He begins by stating that " this is his sin list " , and estimates the total number shot by him to be around 500 . [ 7 ] [ 6 ]
Historian Risto Marjomaa questions the large number , as confirmation of casualties was difficult due to the absence of the body .
Complicating matters further is the use of Häyhä 's achievements as a tool of propaganda : the Finnish press built a hero 's myth around Häyhä at an early stage of war . [ 24 ]
Firearms and tactics [ edit ]
Häyhä used his issued Civil Guard rifle , an early series SAKO M/28 - 30 , serial number 35281 , Civil Guard number S60974 .
It was a Finnish Civil Guard variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle known as " Pystykorva " ( lit .
' The Spitz ' due to the front sight 's resemblance to the head of a spitz - type dog ) chambered in the Finnish - designed Mosin–Nagant cartridge 7.62×53 R .
When fighting as a group leader with the rest of his unit , Häyhä used a Suomi KP / - 31 submachine gun .
Häyhä preferred iron sights over telescopic sights , as they enable a sniper to present a smaller target for the enemy ( a sniper must raise his head a few centimetres higher when using a telescopic sight ) , can be relied on even in extreme cold , unlike telescopic sights which tend to cloud up in cold weather , and are easier to conceal ; sunlight can reflect off a telescopic sight 's lenses and reveal the sniper 's position .
Häyhä also did not have prior training with scoped rifles , and therefore preferred not to switch to the Soviet scoped rifle ( M/91-30 PE or PEM ) .
He would frequently pack dense mounds of snow in front of his position to conceal himself , provide padding for his rifle , and reduce the characteristic puff of snow stirred up by the muzzle blast .
He was known to keep snow in his mouth while sniping to prevent his breath in the cold air from giving away his position . [ 25 ]
Häyhä 's diary also shares a story by him where they caught a Soviet soldier , blindfolded him , spun him dizzy and took him to a party in the tent of Lieutenant Aarne " The Terror of Morocco " Juutilainen of his company .
The Soviet soldier was overjoyed by the carousing and was disgusted when he was sent back . [ 7 ] [ 6 ]
Häyhä after being promoted to second lieutenant , 1940 .
Häyhä was disfigured after being shot in the face by a Red Army soldier .
Wounding [ edit ]
On 6 March 1940 , Häyhä was seriously wounded after an explosive bullet fired by a Red Army soldier hit his lower left jaw . [ 26 ]
After the battle Häyhä was found unconscious and believed dead , and he was placed on a pile of dead bodies .
A fellow soldier , looking for Häyhä on orders from his commanding officer , noticed a leg twitching among the pile and found Häyhä alive . [ 12 ]
Häyhä was evacuated by fellow soldiers who said that " half his face was missing " .
The bullet had removed his upper jaw , most of his lower jaw , and most of his left cheek . [ 12 ]
Rumours of Häyhä 's death spread around in Finland and the Soviet Union .
He regained consciousness a week later on 13 March , the day that peace was declared .
He read about his own death in a newspaper , and sent a letter to the paper to correct the misunderstanding . [ 10 ]
Häyhä spent 14 months recovering from his wounds and endured 26 surgeries . [ 12 ]
After his wounding , Häyhä would have liked to have served in the Continuation War ( 1941 – 44 ) as well .
However , he was not allowed to because the injuries to his face were so severe . [ 27 ]
Honours [ edit ]
Häyhä was awarded the first and second class Medals of Liberty , as well as the third and fourth class Crosses of Liberty , of which the latter two were normally granted to only commissioned officers .
[ 1 ]
As an additional honour , on 17 February 1940 , Häyhä received a nameplated SAKO M / 28 - 30 “ Pystykorva ” honorary rifle ( serial number 100 781 ) , donated by Eugen Johansson , a Swedish businessman and great friend of Finland . [ 20 ]
According to an unofficial count , Häyhä had shot 219 Red Army soldiers at the time .
[ 5 ]
Häyhä later handed over the rifle to the tradition room of the Karelia Jaeger Battalion , from where it was transferred to the collections of the Military Museum of Finland after the dissolution of the North Karelia Brigade in 2013 . [ 28 ]
Shortly after the Winter War , on 28 August 1940 , Finnish Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim promoted Häyhä straight from alikersantti ( the lowest military rank of a non-commissioned officer ) to vänrikki ( the first military rank of an officer ) . [ 29 ]
In 1941 , Häyhä was also nominated as a Knight of the Mannerheim Cross , the most distinguished Finnish military honour .
However , the nomination remained " under consideration " . [ 30 ]
Häyhä also received the Kollaa fighters ' medal , the silver version of the Cross of Kollaa Battle , number 4 . [ 1 ]
Post - war and later life [ edit ]
Häyhä 's gravestone in Ruokolahti Church Graveyard , South Karelia , Finland , with the inscription : Home - Religion - Fatherland
It took several years for Häyhä to recuperate from his wound which required lengthy treatments and several surgeries . [ 10 ]
Nonetheless , he made a full recovery and after World War II lived as a farmer in Ruokolahti , a small municipality located in southeastern Finland near the Russian border .
He became a successful moose hunter and dog breeder ; he even hunted with the President of Finland Urho Kekkonen . [ 25 ]
However , he was also met with hate and even death threats ; some people did not accept his actions during the Winter War . [ 10 ] [ 27 ]
Häyhä was known as a modest man who never boasted of his wartime merits .
He spoke only sparsely about the war . [ 10 ]
He was asked in 1998 how he had become such a good sniper : " Practice " .
He was asked in 2001 , shortly before his 96th birthday , if he felt remorse for killing so many people .
He replied , " I did what I was told to do , as well as I could .
There would be no Finland unless everyone else had done the same " . [ 5 ]
Häyhä spent his last years in a war veterans ' nursing home in Hamina , where he died in 2002 at age 96 . [ 29 ] [ 31 ]
He was buried in his home town of Ruokolahti .
In popular culture [ edit ]
American author Arna Bontemps Hemenway has written a short story about Häyhä , called " Wolves of Karelia , " which was published in The Atlantic magazine . [ 32 ]
Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton released the song " White Death " in honor of Häyhä , which was released in 2010 album Coat of Arms . [ 33 ]
In 2011 , Philip Kaufman began filming HBO 's Hemingway & Gellhorn ( first airdate May 28 , 2012 ) , which features Martha Gellhorn ( played by Nicole Kidman ) reporting from Finland during the Winter War .
In this section , Steven Wiig portrays Simo Häyhä , leading a group of Finnish soldiers to shelter . [ 34 ]
Simo Häyhä has been made into a manga called The White Witch ( Japanese : 白い魔女 , Shiroi Majo ) by Nagakawa Naruki , where the main character 's gender has changed to a woman . [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
A film about Simo Häyhä called The White Death has been planned since 2017 . [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
The film is directed by David McElroy and written by James Poirier . [ 38 ] [ 39 ]

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Monsanto Co and Dole Fresh Vegetables
Inc are formalizing a partnership to breed vegetables that are more attractive to consumers .
The five - year collaboration will focus on creating variations of broccoli , cauliflower , lettuce and spinach , the companies said on Tuesday .
The results could include vegetables that are more colorful , tastier , less susceptible to bruising and have a longer shelf - life .
“ If I buy broccoli on Saturday or Sunday and try to cook it on Wednesday , it ’ll get wilty , ” said Monsanto spokeswoman Riddhi Trivedi - St. Clair .
She also stressed that these new variants will not be genetically modified like the company ’s much larger corn seed and soybean products .
Also known for its herbicide business , Monsanto has been aggressively growing its vegetable business with recent moves such as the 2005 acquisition of Seminis , which gave Monsanto control over more than 30 percent of the North American vegetable seed market .
In 2008 , Monsanto acquired Netherlands - based De Ruiter Seeds , whose focus is in greenhouse vegetable growers as opposed to the open - field expertise of Seminis .
Dole had been Monsanto ’s customer for decades before announcing the partnership on Tuesday , said Dole spokesman Marty Ordman .
Last year , Monsanto also entered into an agreement with Landec Corp ’s packaged food - maker Apio to develop broccoli and cauliflower products .
If new products are created under the collaboration , they could be sold by Dole in North America .
Monsanto shares closed Tuesday up 1.5 percent at $ 79.30 on the New York Stock Exchange .
( Updates throughout with Gupta comments )
WASHINGTON , Jan 6 ( Reuters ) - CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on Thursday that he withdrew from consideration for U.S. surgeon general to focus more on his family and medical career .
" It was a really tough decision , " said Gupta , a father of two young daughters and a third on the way .
" For me it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else . "
Gupta , a journalist and neurosurgeon , said he did not want to take on another responsibility that would require him to spend even more time away from his children or his work at a county hospital in Atlanta .
" I came to grips with , ironically , that being surgeon general I probably would not be able to continue to practice surgery , " Gupta said on CNN's " Larry King Live " program .
In addition to his work at CNN , Gupta is a practicing neurosurgeon and professor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , Emory University Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital .
U.S. President Barack Obama had not formally nominated Gupta for the post .
But the doctor said he had been told by White House officials he was their top choice for surgeon general .
Gupta served in the 1990s as a White House fellow , where he was a special adviser to Hillary Clinton , writing speeches and helping her formulate policies .
The surgeon general leads the 6,000 - member commissioned corps of the U.S. Public Health Service and is the top federal government spokesman on matters of public health .
Surgeons general in the past have used the office as a bully pulpit to urge Americans to give up smoking , battle AIDS and tackle other healthcare concerns .

We started tracking yesterday the emerging meme that Obama ’s restructuring of the defense budget amounts to being weak on defense .
It ’s an important early framing of the debate , driven by Republicans , and all too often adopted by media who should know better .
The meme is in full bloom this morning , with a chorus of Republicans equating the elimination of wasteful and obsolete weapons programs with being dovish — even as the money is reallocated to other defense priorities and the total defense budget increases .
But I do n’t think anyone has gone quite as far as Rep. Tom Cole ( R - OK ) :
While President Obama ’s short changing of America ’s Armed Forces is deeply disappointing , it is – unfortunately – not a surprise .
Throughout his campaign and during his short tenure as President , he has made it clear that he believes his charm and eloquence are adequate substitutes for a strong military .
That will not work .
Whether President Obama knows it or not , President Bush ’s foreign enemies were also America ’s enemies .
He cannot charm them out of their opposition to our country .
The cuts announced today , however , take that naivete to a dangerous new level .
I intend to do everything I can to make sure they do not actually occur .
Cole perfectly captures the strident , reactionary , and ultimately stale and unoriginal talking points coming from the GOP .
We ’ve been hearing this for so long , it ’s almost a caricature of the right wing , still reading Tom Clancy and fighting the Soviets .
In an unexpected move , Bethesda Software ’s parent company , ZeniMax , has acquired DOOM developer id Software .
The press release stated the following :
“ No changes will be made in the operations of id Software in the development of its games .
id Software will continue to operate as a studio under the direction of its founder , John Carmack …
All the principals at id Software have signed long - term employment contracts , assuring they will continue in their roles developing games in the future . ”
Both Robert Altman ( founder and CEO of ZeniMax Media ) and Todd Hollenshead discussed the acquisition :
“ Our role will be to provide publisher support through Bethesda Softworks and give id Software the resources it needs to grow and expand , ” Altman explained , “ Our intention is to make sure id Software will continue to do what they do best – make AAA games . ”
Hollenshead also agrees that the acquisition will be better for the future of the company , “ We will now have financial and business resources to support the future growth of id Software , a huge advantage which will result in more and even better games for our fans . ”

The last few weeks have been muy caliente in terms of Supreme Court dish .
To recap , Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced that he ’s retiring from the Court .
President Obama then laid out his criteria for selecting a new Justice , which included the quality of empathy ( which should be no surprise , considering that he called for judicial empathy way back in 2007 ) .
Obama ’s mention of the scary and perhaps tantalizingly foreign - sounding word “ empathy ” has driven the GOP into ever - heightening states of abject apoplexy at the ludicrous suggestion that a judge should possess an emotion that allows a human being to step into the shoes of another .
I know , I know ; I should n’t expect anything out of the GOP right now besides lies , misdirection and childish name - calling .
However , this furor over “ empathy ” has really stuck in my craw .
I ’ve been meaning to write a big post on it but Dahlia Lithwick appears to have done the job even better than I could :
One is surely entitled to say that President Obama ’s repeated claim that he seeks “ empathy ” in a replacement for Justice David Souter is something less than a crisp constitutional standard .
But the Republican war on empathy has started to border on the deranged , and you ca n’t help but wonder to what purpose .
Webster ’s defines empathy as “ the experiencing as one ’s own the feelings of another . ”
Obama , in The Audacity of Hope , described empathy as “ a call to stand in somebody else ’s shoes and see through their eyes . ”
To Obama , empathy chiefly means applying a principle his mother taught him : asking , “ How would that make you feel ? ” before acting .
Empathy in a judge does not mean stopping midtrial to tenderly clutch the defendant to your heart and weep .
It does n’t mean reflexively giving one class of people an advantage over another because their lives are sad or difficult .
When the president talks about empathy , he talks not of legal outcomes but of an intellectual and ethical process : the ability to think about the law from more than one perspective .
But Republicans have gathered up their flaming torches and raised their fists to loudly denounce empathy and all empathy - based behavior as evil .
Last Friday , RNC Chairman Michael Steele , sitting in for Bill Bennett on the Morning in America syndicated radio show , blurted out , “ Crazy nonsense empathetic !
I ’ll give you empathy .
Empathize right on your behind ! ” Nice …
When did the simple act of recognizing that you are not the only one in the room become confused with lawlessness , activism , and social engineering ?
For a group so vociferously devoted to textualism and plain meaning , conservative critics have an awfully elastic definition of the word empathy .
It expands to cover any sort of judicial malfeasance they can imagine .
Empathy — the quality of caring what others may feel — signals intellectual weakness , judicial immodesty , favoritism , bias , and grandiosity .
John
Yoo also seems to be of the view that the kind of emotional incontinence that begins with empathy for others quickly leads to being “ emotive ” on the bench .
Evidently it ’s a short hop from empathy to having the judicial vapors .
Read the whole article .
From a textualist perspective , I would also like to highlight for our Dear GOP Leaders some antonyms to the concept of empathy :
indifference : “ a lack of interest or concern ”
disregard : “ a lack of regard or attention ; neglect ”
callousness : “ feeling or showing no sympathy for others ”
unconcern : “ the absence of feeling or concern ”
Hmm , come to think of it , those words seem to capture pretty succinctly the GOP ’s preferred approach to politics and appellate jurisprudence .
Update :
Here ’s a more fulsome quote from the article Lithwick cites above , written by conservative law professor Douglas Kmiec :
A pornish cartoon .
That 's what the surprised astronauts from the Apollo 16 mission found while walking on the Moon .
It was in their checklist — mounted on the forearm — but it was n't the first time that happened :
During the Apollo XII mission , Commander Charles " Pete " Conrad , Jr and Lunar Module pilot Alan L. Bean found naked pinups in one of the pages of their checklist .
It reportedly made them laugh hysterically while command module pilot Richard F. Gordon , Jr. listened from his orbit around the Moon .

The reason for their surprise was in the fact that — while the main crew prepared them — these Extra - Vehicular Activity checklists were packed before the flight by the mission backup crew .
They placed the easter eggs without them knowing it at all .
The drawing here is part of Haise 's checklist , whch can be yours if you get $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 by July 16 .
That 's when it 's going up for auction at Bonhams , in London , UK .

The clip here showing Apollo XII 's Conrad and Bean is from the hilarious part 7 of From The Earth to the Moon .
If you have never watched the TV miniseries , do it .
I can't stress enough how incredibly good they are .

“ The banks run the place , ” Rep. Collin Peterson cried out this week .
The New York Times reports that he has a bill that would specifically ban derivatives from trading in a clearinghouse regulated by the New York Federal Reserve , which Peterson blasted as “ a tool of the big banks . ”
A “ tool ” because the nine biggest banks in the derivatives market– including JP Morgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and Bank of America– all met secretly to discuss how to use the lax regulation and institutional secrecy of the NY Fed to shield their credit - default swaps business from prying eyes and attempts at regulation , as the Times reports :
As the financial crisis entered one of its darkest phases in October , a handful of the nation ’s largest banks began holding daily telephone sessions .
Murmurs were already emanating from Washington about the need for a wide - ranging regulatory overhaul , and Wall Street executives girded for a fight .
Atop the agenda during their calls : how to counter an expected attempt to rein in credit - default swaps and other derivatives — the sophisticated and profitable financial instruments that were intended to limit risk but instead had helped take the economy to the brink of disaster .
What ’s more , the banks formed a lobby – the CDS Dealers Consortium– only weeks after accepting TARP funds in October 2008 to protect its interests .
Heading this effort is Edward Rosen , who previously helped fend off derivatives regulation .
Rosen wrote and circulated a “ confidential memo ” to the ‘ Treasury Department and leaders on Capital Hill ’ making their agenda clear , the Times reported .
Rosen and his backers propose that derivatives be “ traded in privately managed clearinghouses , with less disclosure , ” according to the Times .
The clearinghouse of choice for the big banks in Rosen ’s CDS Consortium is ICE U.S.
Trust , which is in turned regulated only by the Federal Reserve system .
Mr. Rosen ’s confidential memo , dated Feb. 10 and obtained by The New York Times , recommended that the biggest participants in the derivatives market should continue to be overseen by the Federal Reserve Board .
Critics say the Fed has been an overly friendly regulator , which is why big banks favor it .
Ironically , the Times notes , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , former president of the New York Federal Reserve , submitted a plan similar to Rosen ’s , although Treasury officials stated the proposal was “ independent . ”
Although Geithner vowed to make derivatives “ more accountable ” , critics say the emphasis on clearinghouses in the plan is a “ major loophole ” because ‘ little disclosure would be required ’ for any ‘ customized ’ swap .
It is clear that banks , who wanted their credit swaps to remain private , counted on the lack of transparency over Federal Reserve affairs to keep derivative affairs in the dark , thus enhancing their profit potential .
It is further clear that Treasury Secretary Geithner intended to help them in that aim .
Senator Tom Harkin said the loophole “ could be worth trillions and trillions of swaps , ” blasting it as “ a loophole big enough to drive a truck through . ”
Derivatives are the bulk of the “ toxic assets ” TARP was set up to fight– and total an astounding $ 1.5 quadrillion in estimate .
REGULATING THE FEDERAL RESERVE
Bloomberg reported Friday that the “ Fed ’s Role in AIG May Be First Target of GAO Audit . ”
President Obama signed into law on May 20 a “ Fed clause ” giving the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) the “ power to examine the Federal Reserve ’s emergency aid to specific companies , such as AIG , Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc . ”
The new law is designed to give the GAO access to records and people at the Fed ’s Board of Governors in Washington as well as the 12 district banks , such as the New York Fed , which has been the government ’s lead day - to - day supervisor of AIG .
Under what Bloomberg has called “ war powers ” , the Fed has issued “ an unprecedented expansion of credit to nonbank financial firms … invoking emergency powers and doubling its assets the past year . ”
The authority is notably only a half - measure .
Bloomberg notes that it “ does n’t remove limits from a 1978 law that prohibits the GAO from peering into Fed activities involving monetary policy or discount - window loans to banks . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke stated he would have no objections to audits , so long as there was no examination of monetary policy .
He stated clearly , “ I certainly would resist any attempt to dictate to the Federal Reserve how to make monetary policy . ”
Bloomberg makes a distinction from the “ more intrusive ” legislation introduced in the House by Ron Paul and in the Senate by Bernie Sanders .
Those bills now have well over a hundred sponsors .
Sanders was rebuffed by Ben Bernanke previously during TARP hearings after he demanded to know who the Fed lent money to and was told frankly , “ No . ”
Those bills , which have n’t made it past the initial stage of being introduced in Congress , would remove limits on GAO audits of the Fed and direct the agency to issue a report on the central bank by the end of next year .
Nevertheless , information about the meeting of the big banks shows that there is a desire to keep the Federal Reserve and its dealings quiet at a time when interest in the Fed ’s actions is at an all - time high .
Any move to bring accountability to that institution is positive , even if insufficient .

Comment on this article
Many discussions of whether or not developers should use or learn ASP .
NET MVC has been going on in blogs , Twitter and forums the last couple of weeks .
The opinions varies from not recommended to all ASP.
NET developers should learn it .
InfoQ have tried to summarize some of the recent activity around this topic .
Rob Conerey ( Microsoft employee at the ASP.
NET MVC team and creator of SubSonic ) explains why developers should learn ASP .
NET MVC after observing questions raised in the community .
In his introduction he starts off by describing WebForms as “ The Great Lie ” :
WebForms is a lie .
It ’s abstraction wrapped in deception covered in lie sauce presented on a plate full of diversion and sleight of hand .
Nothing you do with WebForms has anything to do with the web – you let it do the work for you .
This , friends , is a big deal ( at least to me ) :
You ’re working in a lie .
The web is * not* stateful and works with this stuff called HTML sent across wires using another thing called HTTP – you need to know this , love this , and feel it at the bone level .
Rob lists 7 reasons for using ASP .
NET MVC or in his own words “ 7 Reasons To Stop Calling Me A Jerk ” :
Testability Control over HTML Extensibility It Makes You Think … Differently : Javascript Does n’t Suck Learning New Concepts
It ’s Fun
And concludes with :
Bottom line : I ’m having fun web programming again and I think that ’s pretty motivating , at least for me and my cats .
Yet Another Comparison , sure , but hopefully a bit more direct .
You have absolutely no reason at all to not learn MVC – but I will concede there may be a reason or two for you to stick with WebForms .
Joe Brinkman ( full time developer on DotNetNuke ) quickly followed up with a response , criticizing Rob for not picking “ A GOOD Reason To Learn MVC ” , and lists his own :
It will expose you to a different architecture
You will be forced to become intimately familiar with HTML and HTTP MVC promotes unit testing MVC will make you see how much you take for granted with WebForms
Joe concludes by saying :
So in summary , you really should checkout MVC .
But not for the reasons Rob articulated .
You should explore MVC because in the end you might just learn something that will make you a better web programmer , no matter what platform you choose .
Both Rob and Joe is basically agreeing on the same , that ASP .
NET developers should learn themselves ASP.
NET MVC , but disagreeing on the why arguments .
Karl Seguin however has a different opinion and ask “ if ASP.
NET is a half - baked solution ” :
Being able to write complex systems more cleanly is a good start , but given where web development stands in general , and other platforms specifically , ASP .
NET MVC lags far behind ( Perl being the only one I can think of which is worse ) .
There 's little question that a big part of the problem is that this is really a VC stack - there is no thought , no support , and no tools for the Model .
When you compare the thousands of lines you 'll end up writing for your repository / dal / linq / nhiberate to other MVC stacks ( which commonly only require that your models to inherit from 1 class ) , you 're already at a serious productivity disadvantage .
But the true impact is actually much worse - you lose any cohesiveness of purpose through the controller and views .
There is no way to generate HTML labels from model properties , or client side validation .
…
There is some good news , and that 's that a lot of this " infrastructure " is reusable , which makes projects like S#arp Architecture possible .
However , I 'm still sceptical that these projects can truly succeed against better integrated frameworks .
Jeremy D. Miller ( one of the creators of FubuMVC ) lists some pros and cons :
CON :
… the MVC framework is not efficient unless you 're willing to roll up your sleeves and build your own project specific infrastructure to fill in the " M " , achieve some better testability , easier screen synchronization , and more productive Html helpers … …
PRO :
It 's pretty easy and straightforward to take the MVC framework by the horns and customize it for your benefit .
Jeremy concludes by saying :
I stand behind the assertion that the ASP .
Net MVC framework is a better way in the end to build web apps than an " abstraction wrapped in deception covered in lie sauce presented on a plate full of diversion and sleight of hand , " but at this point it 's probably a tool strictly for early adopter type folks .
Jeffrey Palermo ( currently writing the book “ ASP. NET MVC in action ” ) states that “ You should NOT use ASP.
NET MVC if … ” :
You are not very comfortable with polymorphism
comfortable with polymorphism
You are n’t willing to build on top of the framework
You rely on 3rd party vendor controls for lots of the UI
You are averse to using open - source libraries
But continues with :
The ASP.
NET MVC Framework is an enabling framework .
It is not a “ hold your hand ” framework .
It is not a “ ASP. NET 101 ” framework .
You have complete control over everything .
UI patterns in the web space are not so standardized that we can turn over control to frameworks that work in the “ standard ” way .
Data access has reached this point where we know we need Create , Read , Update , Delete , cascading persistence , lazy loading , etc .
There are many Object - Relational Mappers that support the common operations , and many developers are content giving up complete control over data access because of the similar way leading ORMs work ( Hibernate / NHibernate ) .
There are of course many others that have expressed their opinions , but InfoQ find that the above summarize most of the arguments for and against learning / using ASP .
NET MVC .
Interpol is still trying to find a couple of cashed - up Kiwis , believed to be living it up in Asia , after they were mistakenly given $ 8 million ( $ NZ10 million ) by Westpac .
Rotorua service station owners Leo Gao and his girlfriend Cara Young fled New Zealand with about $ NZ3 million after they discovered the money in their bank account .
But their chances of being caught have increased after they were joined overseas by Ms Young 's sister , Aroha Hurring , who posted details about their location on her Facebook page .
Police believe the trio are in China after Ms Hurring foolishly updated her status to say she was drinking the local Asian beer and enjoying the heat .
Her mother Sue Hurring , who runs a hairdressing salon in Blenheim , has been helping police with their inquiries .
" Well , you 've got to have a laugh , " she said .
" It is bizarre .
" She 's never pinched a thing in her life .
Probably as a little girl , yes , but so honest . "
Ms Hurring says she blames her daughter 's boyfriend .
" Well , if you really want to know I 'd like to wring his blinging neck for getting the whole ...
I do n't know what to say .
" Never mind Leo , he can stay there .
Just come home now please [ Cara ] .
It 's going to be OK . "
But getting the trio home could prove tricky , because New Zealand does not have an extradition treaty with China .
The affair began after the couple applied for a $ 10,000 loan to stop their business going under , but Westpac mistakenly transferred $ NZ10 million into their account .
Westpac 's New Zealand spokesman Craig Dowling says he had not banked on all the publicity the case has attracted , but is confident the accidental millionaires will be found .
" We 're concentrating on making sure our people are OK with the attention this is getting , and then also following the money trail .
" The details of that we 're still wanting to be a bit cagey about - we do n't want to say anything that will jeopardise our chances of recovering the outstanding money . "
Traumatised
He says a bank employee made a simple mistake .
" The entry in one area jumped from $ 100,000 to $ 10 million , so it was about a couple of errant noughts that caused a , quite a major issue . "
The employee is reportedly so traumatised that they are now receiving counselling .
" It 's probably pretty obvious to just about anyone that making a mistake that gets this amount of attention is not a pleasant thing to go through , and mistakes should not have led to this outcome , " Mr Dowling said .
" There 's a couple of other things that happened which make it a pretty unique event .
It 's absolutely a one - off for this , a keying error , to have gotten through to the stage that it did .
" We want to say we take responsibility for the checks that did n't work . "
Warning : the 20 - year - old Global Positioning System ( GPS ) that makes your car satnav work could soon fail .
GPS devices calculate your position using signals from four different orbiting satellites , and a minimum of 24 satellites is required to keep the network running .
There are currently 31 in operation , but several are well past their life expectancy and a US Air Force programme to replace them is way behind schedule .
This time next year , we might have to revert to old - fashioned maps to find our way - only some younger drivers will have no experience of this ancient method of navigation .
So how do maps work ?
Space does not permit full written instructions , but here are some Frequently Asked Questions to get you started :
How do I turn it on ?
An atlas operates much like a book , while a map unfolds , accordion - style , to form a large sheet .
This should be held in front of you so that any writing is right side up .
Now I can't see anything !
Stop driving .
Never attempt to operate a map and a motor vehicle at the same time .
I need to get to Redditch .
What do I press ?
Locate " Redditch " on your map and press it with one finger .
Find your current location and press it with your other finger .
Now find an unbroken line that connects the two fingers .
That is your " route " .
You are ready to begin your journey .
I 've been driving for 40 minutes and it still has n't said anything .
Should I just keep going straight ?
The map will not issue instructions .
It is up to you to compare the route on the map with information gleaned from your surroundings , and drive accordingly .
Sorry ?
For example - what does the sign you are passing now say ?
" Croeso i Gymru . "
Is that good ?
You 're on the Welsh border .
Try to find yourself on the map .
I 'm right near the edge of the paper !
Is it trying to tell me to drive off a cliff ?
Do n't be silly .
If your satnav told you to drive off a cliff , would you ?
I 've got quite a funny story about that , actually .
Oh , pull over and ask someone .
OK .
How do I turn this thing off ?
It 's a map .
Just fold it up the same way you unfolded it , only backwards .
Any other questions ?
Yes .
How do I make it sound like Joanna Lumley ?
Let 's save that one for next time .
Unemployment takes growing toll in New York City
By a reporting team
1 May 2009
New York City has been one of the US metropolitan areas hardest hit by skyrocketing unemployment .
The city had been somewhat insulated from the destruction of jobs elsewhere in the country , which began early last year .
As late as August of 2008 , employment was still rising thanks to New York ’s service sector , tourism and professional services .
Now , however , it is being hit by the full force of the crisis .
Line for jobs fair in midtown Manhattan
The unemployment rate in New York City is expected to reach the 10 percent level very soon .
The most recent monthly figure showed a jump from 6.9 to 8.1 percent , a record increase for a one - month period in the city .
New York ’s jobless numbers have nearly doubled in only a year , with 325,700 officially counted as unemployed in March .
The collapse of three of the city ’s big five investment banks in 2008 was accompanied by the mass layoffs of tens of thousands of employees at these institutions as well as elsewhere in the financial services sector .
The layoffs quickly spread to the city ’s huge law firms .
Unemployment is now spreading rapidly from these areas to other sectors of the economy .
Hotel and restaurant services are particularly hard hit , as the decline in tourism , entertainment and other discretionary and luxury spending exacts its toll on a mostly lower - paid work force .
According to the US labor department , the city lost 52,300 jobs in the transportation and utilities sector since March of last year ; 37,000 in manufacturing ; and 30,200 in financial activities .
A total of nearly 200,000 workers have suffered layoffs in the past year .
Health care and other public services , including several hundred thousand government workers , have not yet faced large numbers of job cuts , but New York Mayor Bloomberg has already announced that 7,000 layoffs are likely , on top of 8,000 jobs to be lost through attrition .
The city ’s mass transit system faces a combination of fare increases , service cuts and layoffs .
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has set in motion fare hikes averaging 23 percent , and announced a May 31 deadline for enacting the increases and service cuts , unless New York State comes up with legislation increasing state aid .
The MTA gave the Transport Workers Union the names of 600 transit workers who face imminent layoffs .
In addition , another 500 subway and bus workers may lose their jobs by the end of the year .
For those who are laid off , unemployment benefits amount to a maximum of $ 430 a week , an amount that is far short of what is needed to survive in the city .
It would not even cover the average rental for a studio apartment in Manhattan .
And many of the jobless are losing even that .
Benefits for 56,000 unemployed in New York state as a whole are set to run out this month , with 8,000 more a week losing benefits every week thereafter .
The unemployed also face continuing efforts to deny them access to welfare assistance .
The welfare rolls have been drastically slashed since the bipartisan welfare “ reform ” legislation enacted under the Clinton administration in 1996 .
Work rules , time limits and strict sanctions for missed appointments or other procedural infractions have all been used to cut the numbers of those receiving public assistance .
A report issued last week by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies described the current situation .
Even as the welfare rolls have continued to decline in the past decade , applications for assistance rose in the city from 221 in 1999 to 341,000 in 2007 .
The percentage of applications denied or withdrawn has sharply increased .
“ A lot of the unemployed New Yorkers who have lost their jobs in this recession are going to encounter barriers to social services that are meant for them , ” said a spokesman for the FPWA .
The growing ranks of the unemployed have turned out by the thousands at job fairs held in the city in recent months , even though they know they have little prospect of finding work under the present conditions .
WSWS reporters spoke to some workers who recently attended a job fair at the Radisson Martinique Hotel in midtown Manhattan .
Gerrick
Gerrick , 45 , has been out of work for one year .
He told the WSWS : “ I was working in accounts receivable for a brokerage firm that merged with another one .
As a result , most of us got laid off .
I have been surviving on unemployment benefits .
I think I have about ten weeks of benefits left .
“ I have been actively looking for a job for the entire past year , and have been to about 25 job fairs .
Every opportunity I get , I go to a job fair .
A lot of employers say I have no experience in the kind of work that they are looking for .
They are very polite about it , but I am still out of work .
The previous job fairs are a lot like this where you have to stay out in the chilly weather and wait until you can get into the hotel .
“ If I do not find a job soon and my unemployment insurance runs out , I really do not know what I will do .
Right now , my income is about less than half of what I was earning .
I am able to pay my bills because of what I had previously saved .
“ I am 45 years old , and I know that it is definitely harder for someone 45 years and older to get a job than it is for someone who is younger . ”
Chelsea , 24 , said she was working part - time in a restaurant , but had come to the job fair in search of full - time work .
“ I used to be working for a travel agency for about a year in California , ” she said .
“ Obviously , as the economy was going down , they needed less people and I was one of those who got laid off .
“ I then decided to come to New York , which has been a dream of mine since I was ten years old .
I have friends here .
I have been here for about two months working in a restaurant a couple of nights a week , which really does n’t pay the bills .
I went to one job fair in Orange County , but this is my first in New York .
This is a big line .
In California , they offered me a lot of sales jobs , but I am not a pushy kind of person .
I really am the exact opposite of that .
I do n’t think I would be good at it and I do n’t think I could handle that kind of work .
“ When I was laid off from my job in California , I had to become a waitress there .
I promised myself that I would never do that kind of work again , but here I am in New York doing the same job . ”
Ana
Ana , 52 , said she had been unemployed for one month .
“ I was doing retail , ” she said .
“ I was only working 20 hours a week , which is not enough to pay the rent .
I was working a year and a half for them .
Before that I was a receptionist for only six months .
“ I actually have had a lot of jobs .
I have been working under a lot of emotional and financial stress because I am a caregiver — I have an elderly mother at home .
Right now , I am getting unemployment insurance , food stamps , and housing benefits .
However , this does not pay my bills .
“ This is my third job fair .
They are not going to hire everybody .
I already know this .
There are simply not enough jobs to go around .
It is also a lot harder for many older people to find a job .
What are older people supposed to do ?
If one does n’t work and build up their Social Security , then there is not enough of a benefit for one to live on .
“ Obama ’s stimulus package is not doing any good .
When it comes to helping ordinary people the government is very slow , very bureaucratic , involving a lot of paper work .
The people in Congress and the Senate do n’t have a clue as to what working people are going through every day .
It is a lot different when it comes to bailing out the financial companies — they have a lot more pull than I do .
They are the ones who have the connections . ”
Nicole Moore
Nicole Moore , 40 , said that her unemployment benefits had run out in October . ”
I was an office manager for a small photography company that employed four people , ” she said .
“ With the economy going down , we did n’t get as many contracts as we used to .
I was working for them for two years .
Before that I was also an office manager for another company for about four years .
I got a masters degree in Germany in business administration that was transferred here .
“ It is very difficult to find a job because companies are very , very picky .
Even though I have education and work experience and am very qualified and learn quickly , it has been very difficult .
If my resume does n’t fit a hundred percent what the employer is looking for , there is no way to be considered .
While I have gotten first interviews and some second interviews , I am the mother of small children , and when this issue comes up I feel the interview is over .
It is discrimination against working mothers .
“ I send out about 20 job applications a week .
I have gone to so many job interviews that I can’t even remember the number .
I can say at least two a week .
Since I started looking for a job , things have only gotten worse .
“ I do n’t think that we have reached the bottom yet .
So many of my friends have lost their jobs from companies like Lehman Brothers , big banks like Chase and Citibank as well as smaller banks , and insurance companies .
Some of my friends are forced to do freelance work which is essentially like working part - time because that is all the companies are willing to pay .
This amounts to cutting full - time jobs , which reduces wages and benefits .
I am very angry about this because the companies are squeezing all that they can from people .
It is not the way work should be .
It is not right .
People are being squeezed financially and losing their homes .
“ My unemployment insurance has run out since October .
I am receiving public assistance right now , which just keeps me alive .
I have two small children — one is one and a half and the other is three and a half .
I left my husband and I am in a domestic violence shelter right now .
“ This is a direct result of the economic pressures , I think .
He is a carpenter , and because of the economy he has n’t worked in quite a while , and this caused domestic problems .
He used to work ten months out of the year , then six months out of the year , and he did not work at all last year .
The way the system works , I have to move from one shelter to another .
One saying that is very true today , even though it is kind of a cliché , many of us are just one paycheck away from being homeless . ”
area delegate goes after “ satanic ” lawmakers
Fundamentalism and politics becomes a noxious , incoherent mess in Utah County .
While the Utah County government tackles mundane issues like providing police and medical services to the people in the local area or balancing the budgets , delegate Don Larsen is waging the war of the End Times against Satanic forces in the U.S. which are using the Democratic Party as a front to approve anti-family laws .
The term anti-family here is one of those umbrella words often used by social conservatives to condemn any law , decision or action they do n’t like .
According to Larsen , there ’s an invisible government lead by a cabal of left - wing groups being told by Satan to destroy American families as recorded by the New Testament .
Since we all know that what the Beast is really afraid of , is resolutions from local governments , Larsen created one with the catchy title of “ Opposing the Hate America anti-Christian Open Borders cabal ” to start the first wave of legal resistance to the forces of evil .
Unfortunately for this crusader , it was rejected by his peers .
Since this already reads like an article from The Onion , one would think there should be more bizarre details to this story .
And there are .
Larsen submitted pretty much the same thing at a 2007 convention , showing that he’s at least consistently paranoid , regardless of the party in power .
In defense of his resolution , he offers that illegal immigrants and “ people from dysfunctional families ” are the ones casting most of their votes for Democrats and giving us a complete package of xenophobia and self - righteous evaluation of voters ’ family lives in one short , convenient soundbyte .
All that ’s missing is a quote from Revelations and a stern warning for all those heathens voting for Satan ’s party about spending eternity in a lake of fire .
In summation , what we have here is someone with a rather tenuous grasp of reality at best , using his position as a delegate to a local government in the middle of Utah as a launching ground for a crusade which will challenge the forces of evil as personified by immigrants and liberals .
Although his resolution was defeated by other Republican delegates , not one of them said that it was a crazy proposition based on religious fanaticism and a pious indictment of those with more liberal worldviews .
Not one of them questioned why rather than going about his business of providing the services that the taxpayers of his town need , Larsen is wasting time and money on indulging his personal whims .
And not one of them pointed out that such resolutions are further proof that basing one ’s government on Biblical verses is a really bad idea since it would allow amateur theologians eagerly anticipating Armageddon to challenge anything a democratically elected government does because they think they ’re right in their reading of thick allegories of ancient history .
Instead , they focused on the importance of the Latino vote in elections and how the party just could n’t afford to anger immigrants and expect to be a majority .
Well , maybe that ’s a start .
The GOP already recognizes the power of Latino voters and next , they might start to realize that they ca n’t afford to anger moderates by giving power to conspiracy theorists who see socialism or Satanism behind every new or different idea .
After that , they might recognize that scientists are actually smart people who know what they ’re talking about and that using the word “ family ” as an instrument for a hackneyed , verbal bludgeoning is n’t a good idea either .
Maybe they ’ll also reconsider using inflammatory pundits who ’s living consists of delivering far - right talking points and marketing outrage to millions .
But then again , if how the GOP has been handling their defeat at the polls last November is any indication of what they want to do with their party in the future , I would n’t wait with bated breath …

... one robber ( the literal apparatus of government ) keeps you covered with a pistol while the second ( representing State - allied corporations ) just holds the bag that you have to drop your wristwatch , wallet and car keys in .
To say that your interaction with the bagman was a “ voluntary transaction ” is an absurdity .
Such nonsense should be condemned by all libertarians .
Both gunman and bagman together are the true State .

Discussing faux private interests that are actually part of the State , Brad Spangler puts a new spin on Rothbard 's likening of the state to a holdup man .
In the case of state capitalism , he writes , the state is just an accomplice to " private " interests : Brilliant .
I 've seen too many " libertarian " defenses of big business that attempt to absolve it of any guilt for its role in this partnership .
Big business is just the passive victim , so they say , forced to accept corporate welfare and obtain special privileges in self - defense against the forces of the regulatory state .
According to this argument , the recipients of differential tax advantages are the good guys , managing to keep a bit more of their own money .
Complete and utter horseshit .
The rotation of personnel between senior corporate management and political appointees in government agencies is such that corporate and government leadership are , for all intents and purposes , a single power elite .
Large corporations are not passive victims of the state ; they actthe state .
It makes about as much sense to separate them from the state , as it would have made to separate the landholding class from the state in Medieval times .
The state , by definition , is the instrument of a ruling class .
Sometimes the state and the ruling class are one and the same , as under Soviet - style bureaucratic collectivism .
But sometimes the state is the instrument of a nominally " private " ruling class , or of a mixed ruling class of state and corporate interests ( e.g. Scandinavian " social democracy " ) .
Most of the recipes for " free market reform " I see coming from neoliberal politicians leave the gunman in place , but increase the ratio of nominally - private bagmen to gunmen .
The more of the work of robbery can be " privatized " to the bagmen , supposedly , the larger the portion of all activity is nominally private .
So is n't that a freer market ?
Is n't that " a step in the right direction " ?
To see some of the contemporary agitprop in favor of increased " global trade , " it must be .
To those who say differential tax advantages are n't " corporate welfare , " by the way : please remember that the practical effect of such exemptions is exactly the same as if we started with a corporate tax rate of zero , and then imposed a tax penalty on those not engaged in favored forms of enterprise .
The effect of rapid depreciation , say , is the same as a punitive tax on those not engaged in capital - intensive forms of production .
The fiscal and competitive effects are identical .
ASUS has just designed a new monster graphics card that breaks the mold for reference design GeForce GTX 295 , called the ASUS MARS 295 Limited Edition .
The card , although retains the name " GeForce GTX 295 " , same device ID , and is compatible with existing NVIDIA drivers , has two huge innovations put in by ASUS , which go far beyond being yet another overclocked GeForce GTX 295 : the company used two G200 - 350 - B3 graphics processors , the same ones that make the GeForce GTX 285 .
The GPUs have all the 240 shader processors enabled , and also have the complete 512 - bit GDDR3 memory interface enabled .
This dual - PCB monstrosity holds 32 memory chips , and 4 GB of total memory ( each GPU accesses 2 GB of it ) .
Apart from these , each GPU system uses the same exact clock speeds as the GeForce GTX 285 : 648/1476/2400 MHz ( core / shader / memory ) .
Each PCB holds 16 memory chips , a 6 - phase digital PWM power circuit , drawing auxiliary power from an 8 - pin PCI - E power connector , the GeForce GTX 285 - class GPU , and its companion NVIO2 processor .
The PCB holding the PCI - Express bus interface , also holds the bridge chip .
ASUS broke away with using the nForce 200 chip , and instead is using a yet to be disclosed third - party bridge chip .
Currently , PLX and IDT are two likely sources for such a chip .
The memory consists of high - density 0.77 ns memory chips made by Hynix .
The electrical - management on each PCB is care of a Volterra VRM controller , which supports the I2C interface , which means that the card supports software voltage control , perhaps a big plus for ASUS ' Voltage Tweak feature that is gaining in popularity .
Fused power circuit provides Over Current Protection while also facilitating extreme overclocking .
The cooler internally has the same basic construction as the reference cooler , it uses a single leaf - blower .
The card spans across two expansion slots and is slightly higher than the reference design card .
ASUS also used slightly longer internal bridges that make more room for third - party coolers , and the likes .
Our source from ASUS EMEA conducted a quick 3DMark Vantage test proving the card 's seamless compatibility with existing drivers , while also providing a significant boost in performance over existing GTX 295 cards .
Being Quad - SLI capable , this card finally makes GeForce GTX 285 ( effective ) quad- SLI possible , and makes for the most powerful desktop multi-GPU setup ever conceived .
ASUS designed this card despite pressure from NVIDIA enforcing its rigid policy of restricting its partners from custom - designing GeForce GTX 295 .
If everything goes smooth throughout the development process , the card might make it for a gala launch at Computex .
The RAC and the Western Australian Council of Social Services has welcomed today 's introduction of the Country Age Pension Fuel Card , which is aimed at improving the mobility of about 35,000 elderly Western Australians .
Under the scheme , age pensioners living in regional Western Australia will be eligible for $ 500 a year to help with their travel costs .
The WA Government 's Royalties for Regions program will provide $ 500 to each eligible applicant towards the cost of fuel and taxi fares for the next four years .
RAC Head of Member Advocacy Matt Brown welcomed the launch of the fuel card and said it was necessary to ensuring the mobility of all its members in the country .
" Seniors in the metropolitan area now have access to free public transport and so it 's important from an equity perspective that similar support is extended to the regions , " he said .
JERUSALEM  The Vatican sought on Tuesday to defend Pope Benedict XVI against criticism of his speech at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial the day before .
But as has become familiar in Benedict ’s four years as pope , the attempt at media relations stumbled , in a particularly awkward way for a trip to Israel : the German pope ’s spokesman first said that Benedict “ never , never , never ” had belonged to the Hitler Youth but later had to issue a retraction .
The spokesman , the Rev. Federico Lombardi , was working to counter both criticism of the speech  blasted in the press here as at best a bland missed moment for a German pope who experienced the Holocaust firsthand  and hostility from some in Israel to the pope himself .
Even before the pope spoke on Monday , the day he arrived in Israel , a cartoon in the daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot showed him at Yad Vashem looking at a photo of a group of Hitler Youth and saying , “ Hey , that ’s me . ”
Who is more valuable to society – a classroom assistant or a gravedigger ?
This is not an idle philosophical question , but one being considered by lawyers examining one of 62,000 equal pay claims making their way through the employment tribunals system .
Jackie Gilchrist thinks she has one of the most challenging jobs imaginable , supporting the teaching of children with autism in a mainstream school .
Her role requires familiarity with the latest developments in occupational , speech and behavioural therapy , a close knowledge of the national curriculum , extraordinary patience and unwavering kindness .
She is paid a salary of about £ 9,880 .
Gravediggers employed by the same council , Midlothian , just south of Edinburgh , earn £ 14,000 .
Road workers earn more than £ 19,000 .
Union representatives argue that it makes no sense for someone with such a responsible , skilled job helping children with special needs to be paid considerably less than someone who digs holes for a living .
About 95 % of classroom assistants are women , whereas gravedigging and road maintenance are male careers .
Historically , councils have paid male employees far more than their female staff – often grouped together as the three Cs , the cleaners , cooks and carers .
Over their career , women can find that they have been underpaid by up to £ 360,000 .
" People think ' That 's women 's work ' .
They say ' Oh , you are only communicating with children ' and assume that 's not particularly demanding .
But the communication skills needed to speak to disabled children are very great , and these are much more challenging jobs than just digging a hole in the ground – with the greatest respect to the gravedigger , " said Peter Hunter , a legal officer from Unison .
Two years ago , Gilchrist began an equal value pay action against Midlothian council .
Her claim rests on making the case that her role is of equal ( if not superior ) value , not just to gravediggers , but also other " comparators " , the road sweepers , the road diggers and the dustmen , some of whom earn almost double her wage .
Her legal adviser is confident she can win compensation of about £ 45,000 , but he warns the process of securing compensation is so complex and the claims system so choked up that it may be another eight to 10 years before she sees the money .
Nicola Brewer , chief executive of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission , will this week call on the government to reforms the tribunals system to clear the huge backlog of cases so that women like Gilchrist can get swifter justice .
Employment tribunals are " on their knees " she said , struggling with a 500 % rise in claims over the last four years .
Most cases so far involve women working for the public sector , the NHS and local government , where pay grades are monitored , but lawyers warn the still - hidden problem in the private sector is even graver .
Next year a further 150,000 claims will be lodged , the EHRC predicts , as unions and no - win - no - fee lawyers begin to encourage women to fight for what is owed to them .
But what should have been a triumphant quest for equality has become an impossibly messy scrabble , unleashing hostility between women and their male colleagues , many of whom fear their salaries will be reduced if the women get justice .
An undercurrent of gender warfare has emerged .
" We are not a militant group of workers , classroom assistants , and I did n't want to take my employer to tribunal , not at first , " says Gilchrist , tired after a difficult day at school .
" But the more I looked into it , the more unfair it seemed .
The job 's not valued .
It 's seen as a woman 's job and it 's not valued in any way . "
In the past , the gap has been " tied up with social stereotypes about men being breadwinners " , says Hunter .
Anything perceived to be a caring role , looking after children and old people , has always been rewarded less well than the predominantly male jobs , partly because the skills women bring to the work are regarded as innate , rather than qualities they need to be specifically rewarded for .
Bruce Reid , a gravedigger who roves between the council 's 20 - odd cemeteries , scraping out seven - foot holes with a mechanical digger , is concerned that his pay could be trimmed if Gilchrist 's salary is increased .
He will be arguing that the mental strain of his work , with the constant proximity to death and grieving families , makes it a job that deserves a bigger package .
" You ca n't go home and talk to your wife about what you 've been doing all day , " he says .
He has joined Gilchrist at the Buccleuch pub in the small town of Dalkeith to talk about the pay dispute and is at pains to be respectful of her work .
" Everybody has a level of danger in their job .
She has all the children that can flare up .
We have cave - ins in the grave , " he says , but he is certain his work deserves higher pay .
" Nobody wants to be a gravedigger .
If a wee bairn is murdered and you have got to bury that bairn , it all goes through your head .
It is quite a stressful job . "
Road worker Adrian Livingstone , who earns about £ 19,300 as a gulley operative cleaning roadside drains ( another comparator Gilchrist will use in her case ) , also defends his higher pay packet .
" We are out there in rains and blizzards .
We are not sitting in a warm building , " he says .
There are two key grounds for suing an employer for unequal pay : the relatively straightforward claim that a man who is doing the same job as a woman is being paid more than her , and the second , much more complex equal - pay - for - equal - value case , which involves resolving the nuanced questions under discussion between Gilchrist and Reid .
Part of the problem lies in the bonus systems many councils have which give men in manual jobs an extra 20 % - 50 % on top of their salary .
Women in caring roles have never been allocated extra bonus payments .
Midlothian council has promised to remove all bonus payments by the end of June .
Across the country , so many cases have been lodged that delays are dragging on into months and years .
In one notoriously protracted case , launched in 2002 , a significant proportion of the claimants are now dead , but a judgment has yet to be made .
Equality campaigners describe the system as a " 21st century Jarndyce and Jarndyce " .
Because the councils have to find the money to pay out enormous compensation packages they prefer to appeal at every stage rather than concede defeat .
Last year only 126 cases reached a conclusion in employment tribunals .
Every claim made by each retirement home carer trying to get her salary increased in line with the gardener outside and every school cook suing to be treated as well as the local dustbin man has to be heard individually .
Occasionally , councils have tried to make the women suing for compensation feel guilty for demanding their rights in a way that asbestosis victims , for example , never were .
In one now famous case , St Helens council told women that if they continued to pursue their case for equal pay , then school dinners would be at risk and children could go hungry .
Gilchrist has received similar threats .
" One council member told me we would bankrupt the council , " she says .
The delay in settling cases is partly a cost issue .
" You would n't say it would be cheaper for employers to discriminate against black staff , would you ? " says Bronwyn McKenna of Unison .

An Iowa man recently pled guilty to one count of “ possessing obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children ” and to one count of mailing obscene material .
He faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
This obscene material ?
Manga .
Christopher Hadley , 39 , ordered some manga from Japan two years ago .
When a postal inspector decided that the content of the books was obscene , he applied for a search warrant .
And when Hadley retrieved his package from the post office , having no idea it had been searched , he arrived home to find police officers who seized his manga , comic book , and DVD collection , as well as his computers .
The charges against Hadley were based on only a small number of materials in the collection of over 1,200 publications .
Child pornography is obviously a touchy subject , and it ’s a complicated one .
The laws were originally enacted to prevent child abuse or any other harm to children , but since then , reported links between the use of pornography and actual abuse have led to the additional banning of virtual child pornography ( i.e. illustrations or computer - generated images depicting children in a pornographic manner that did not involve the participation of any actual children ) .
Though the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the first law to this effect , there is a new law , the PROTECT Act , that specifically prohibits obscene virtual child pornography .
This is the law under which Hadley was prosecuted ; his guilty plea makes him the first person to be convicted for possessing cartoon art without any evidence that he viewed actual child pornography .
Manga is particularly problematic with respect to child pornography laws because of the illustration style ; not only do characters tend to simply appear younger than they may be intended to be , but males are often androgynous , and the Japanese have a taboo against pubic hair .
Of course , obscenity laws are supposed to protect works that have serious artistic value , which brings up the additional problem that many people do n’t consider manga ( or comic books generally ) to be “ real ” art .
Even the heavy hitters in the comic world were worried about what a conviction for Handley might mean .
Neil Gaiman told MTV
News in November : “ I wrote a story about a serial killer who kidnaps and rapes children , and then murders them [ referring to a storyline in ‘ The Doll ’s House ’ ] .
We did that as a comic , not for the purposes of titillation or anything like that , but if you bought that comic , you could be arrested for it ?
That ’s just deeply wrong .
Nobody was hurt .
The only thing that was hurt were ideas .
”
We have written before about the issue of obscenity laws possibly going too far , and the common refrain seems to be “ slippery slope . ”
Obviously the law should take all reasonable steps to prevent child abuse , and this includes child pornography laws ; but where should the line be drawn ?
If it ’s manga now , does this pave the way for Neil Gaiman next , or maybe Alan Moore ?
You might scoff at that , but you probably would have done so ten years ago as well if I ’d told you that someone might go to jail for fifteen years because of possessing ( not even drawing ! ) some cartoons .
As to why Handley pled guilty instead of fighting the charges ?
Supposedly it was partly because he could n’t afford his defense , but the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund was already serving as special consultant for the case and probably would have stepped up some fundraising efforts .
Apparently Handley ’s lawyer also thought he would n’t be able to convince a jury once they saw the images in question .
“ If they can imagine it , they drew it , ” he said .
Is n’t that kind of the whole point of art ?
No matter how disturbing we might find the finished product , should it be illegal to see it ?
It should be noted that ( due to a gag order , apparently ) we do n’t actually know what manga titles were problematic for Handley , though some have their ideas .
So should you be worried about your own manga collection ?
If there is anything that might possibly maybe somewhat be considered a depiction of an underage character in a sexual situation , maybe so .
As one blogger put it , “ hope you own a cross - cut paper shredder and an indoor fireplace . ”
Because unfortunately you never know when the justice system might decide to make an example of someone .

Hollywood has as many ways of saying “ no ” as it does Baldwin brothers .
Each layer of rejection is special and unique in it ’s own way , but all of them boil down to the exact same sentiment :
They think you suck .
The following layers of rejection apply to all areas of the entertainment industry , whether you are an actor , writer , director or musician .
The only area these rejection layers do n’t apply to is craft services .
No one rejects craft services .
Going top to bottom , saving the most heinous rejection for the last , Hollywood ’s Seven Layers of Rejection are as follows : Layer One : They Liked You And Would Consider You For Something Else In The Future .
This is the least harsh layer of rejection .
This means that they like you , want to work with you but not until you ’re much , much , much more successful .
Layer Two : They Liked You But They Did n’t Love You .
Remember in high school when the girl of your dreams told you , “ I like you , but I do n’t ‘ like ’ like you ” ?
It ’s the same thing here .
In both cases , you are not getting laid .
Layer Three : Now ’s A Really Bad Time For The Market .
Here ’s the thing :
There ’s NEVER a good time for the market .
It ’s always a bad time .
Using this excuse is the equivalent of saying , “ Now is a bad time to start smoking heroin . ”
Layer Four : They ’re Going In Another Direction .
That direction being as far away from you as possible .
Layer Five : They Were Hoping You ’d Bring More To The Table .
And by “ more ” they mean , “ more talent ” .
Layer Six : It ’s A Hard Pass .
This is Hollywood ’s “ nice ” way of saying that they really fucking hate you and what you are doing .
[ Side note : A “ soft ” pass is still a big no – it just means that one person in the room liked you , but that one person was an assistant ) .
LLayer Seven : No Response .
The last and worse layer , kind of like the spicy ground beef at the bottom of a seven - layer taco dip that gives you massive farts .
No response means that they do n’t give a fuck about you and your work .
In fact , they care so little that they do n’t have the time or energy to get on the phone and tell you .
If you are wondering if there are Seven Layers of Acceptance in Hollywood , the answer is no .
There is only one layer of acceptance in Hollywood :
The layer where they pay you .
A modern microscope is a joy to behold .
Resolutions between 0.5 - 1 micrometer are common , but that sort of focus comes at a cost .
When creating images at high resolution , it becomes difficult to track what is going on just a micron away .
This means that a biologist must really know where the action is going to occur before focusing in and taking a look .
This problem is particularly severe for certain forms of microscopy where the depth of field ( the portion of the sample that 's in focus ) is very small .
However , the development of a new type of lens has now been shown to improve the situation substantially .
A current - generation microscope obtains its pictures by raster scanning a laser rapidly over a sample , while simultaneously collecting light emitted by the sample .
In the case of two - photon microscopy , a single dye molecule must simultaneously absorb two photons in order to emit a single , higher - energy photon .
This requires quite high intensity , so light is only emitted from the tiny region where the laser is focused .
As a result , the images are both high resolution and high contrast .
Unfortunately , the laser is only focused to a single plane , meaning that a single raster scan only produces an image of a slice of the sample .
Often , it is useful to have an extended depth of focus — the tradeoff is that the resolution of the image is much poorer — in order to ensure that you really are looking where you want to look .
In the case of two - photon microscopy , an extended depth of field requires changing optics in the microscope , which is not really ideal .
To overcome this problem , researchers have developed an acoustic lens .
This lens consists of a piezoelectric ring , the center of which is filled with an oil .
When a voltage is applied to the piezoelectric ring , it expands or contracts , depending on the voltage 's polarity .
Like dropping a stone in a pond , this sends a ripple through the oil .
If the voltage varies with a high enough frequency , the outward and inward moving ripples interfere with each other , creating a set of permanent ripples in the oil .
These ripples refract the light , creating what is called a Bessel beam .
Bessel beams are very special in that , ideally , they never expand .
When this beam is sent through the microscope objective , it remains focused over a much greater distance .
Used in a two - photon microscope , it ensures that light is emitted from a relatively thick slice from a sample .
Furthermore , changing from an extended depth of field to a high resolution image is as simple as switching the sound wave on and off .
The researchers showed that they can do this by scanning every line twice , once with the lens switched on and once with the lens switched off .
You only get half the absolute frame rate , but two different sequences of images , one narrowly focused , the other with an extended depth .
The very cool thing is that this technology can be retrofitted to every two - photon microscope in the world with relatively little trouble .
Expect to see this as an add - on in the next couple of years .

When someone becomes dependent on drugs or alcohol , the brain 's pleasure center gets hijacked , disrupting the normal functioning of its reward circuitry .
Researchers investigating this addiction " switch " have now implicated a naturally occurring protein , a dose of which allowed them to get rats hooked with no drugs at all .
The research will be published Friday in the journal Science .
" If we can understand how the brain 's circuitry changes in association with drug abuse , it could potentially suggest ways to medically counteract the effects of dependency , " said Scott Steffensen , a neuroscientist at Brigham Young University who co-authored the study with two of his undergraduate students , one of his grad students , and a team of researchers at the University of Toronto .
Chronic drug users , as noted by previous research , can experience an increase of a naturally - occurring protein called BDNF ( brain - derived neurotrophic factor ) in the brain 's reward circuitry , a region scientists call the ventral tegmental area .
In this study , the researchers took the drugs out of the equation and directly infused extra BDNF onto this part of the brain in rats .
The Toronto team noted that a single injection of BDNF made rats behave as though they were dependent on opiates ( which they had never received ) .
Though rats instinctively prefer certain smells , lighting and texture , these rats left their comfort zone in search of a fix .
" This work may reveal a mechanism that underlies drug addiction , " said lead author Hector Vargas - Perez , a neurobiologist at the University of Toronto .
The BYU team confirmed that the protein is a critical regulator of drug dependency .
After the BDNF injection , specific chemicals that normally inhibit neurons in this part of the brain instead excited them , a " switch " known to occur when people become dependent on drugs .
Steffensen , who teaches in BYU 's psychology department , says this work suggests that BDNF is crucial for inducing a drug dependent state , one important aspect of drug addiction .
BYU undergrad and study co-author Micah Hansen researched in Steffensen 's neuroscience lab from his freshman year through his graduation one month ago .
Fellow BYU undergrad Christine Walton , also a coauthor , completed her degree a year earlier and now works as an addiction researcher at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md. David Allison , a psychology graduate student at BYU , is also a co-author .
Today 's Music News Radiohead in studio
The Oxford band have started work on the follow up to In Rainbows 18 May 2009 - Radiohead have started working on the follow up to their 2007 album In Rainbows .
Bassist Colin Greenwood told 6 Music the Oxford band have been busy in the studio over the last week with producer Nigel Godrich .
" It was very noisy and chaotic and really fun , " he said .
" It ’s at the stage where we ’ve got the big Lego box out and we ’ve tipped it out on the floor and we 're just looking at all the bits and thinking what ’s next ? "
" I 'm very impressed and grateful for Nigel our producer and his ability to make it all sound vaguely plausible , " he added .
Greenwood , who was speaking at the Great Escape music festival in Brighton , where he was helping to launch a new music journal called Loops , gave no indication as to when the Oxford five - piece will be releasing their next record or whether they will be briging it out in a similar format to their last LP .
" It 's at the stage where we 've got the big Lego box out and we 've tipped it on the floor . "
Colin Greenwood on Radiohead 's new album
Last time , Radiohead offered fans the chance to choose how much they were prepared to pay for In Rainbows .
" We were just saying to people how much do you think we 're worth ? " he added .
" It 's like a long term relationship and it was great because it kicked off lots of debate about it . "
The band have just finished touring with electro pioneers Kraftwerk in South America which Greenwood described as a " brilliant experience " .
" They are one of our musical heroes and it was a real privilege to share a stage with them , " he enthused .
" What I like about Kraftwerk is I obviously love the beats but I love their melodies too .
They seep into your brain and stay there . "
The five - piece are due to headline the Reading and Leeds Festivals this summer for a headline show where they have some unfinished business .
" It was a bit frustrating when we were playing some of our own shows last year because it was light for the first half hour , 40 minutes of the show , " Greenwood said .
" So we wanted to do it as it was meant to be seen – darker and louder . "

What are these ?
Blogger and Philadelphia Inquirer writer Will Bunch has a review ( Attytood , 5/11/09 ) of how , “ by late last year , the world already knew a great deal about John Yoo , the Philadelphia native and conservative legal scholar whose tenure in the Bush administration as a top Justice Department lawyer lies at the root of the period of greatest peril to the U.S. Constitution in modern memory ” :
It was widely known in 2008 , for example , that Yoo had argued for presidential powers far beyond anything either real or implied in the Constitution –that the commander - in - chief could trample the powers of Congress or a free press in an endless undeclared war , or that the 4th Amendment barring unreasonable search and seizure did n’t apply in fighting what Yoo called domestic terrorism .
Most famously ,
Yoo was known as the author of the infamous “ torture memos ” that in 2002 and 2003 gave the Bush and Cheney the legal cover to violate the human rights of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere , based on the now mostly ridiculed claim that international and U.S. laws against such torture practices did not apply .
Working closely with Dick Cheney , Cheney ’s staff and others ,
Yoo set into motion the brutal actions that left a deep , indelible stain on the American soul .
Bunch notifies us that , despite all this , his “ colleagues upstairs at the Philadelphia Inquirer –with none of the fanfare that might normally accompany such a move ” –decided “ to sign a contract with Yoo in late 2008 to give him a regular monthly column . ”
Bunch explains that the paper “ thus handed Yoo a loud megaphone on what was once a hallowed piece of real estate in American journalism –to write on the very subjects that have now led Justice Department investigators to reportedly recommend disbarment proceedings against Yoo . ”
In this simplified experimental layout , quantum dots defined by surface acoustic waves each carry a single electron through the top channel .
At the weakest point of the tunnel barrier , electrons can tunnel into the open 1D channel and escape into the bottom - right exit .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Detecting the coherent motion of a single electron is a challenge , for the simple reason of scale : the timescale of the coherent motion of a single - electron wave function is in the picosecond regime ( one trillionth of a second ) , which presents significant technical difficulties .
However , understanding single - electron dynamics is very important for a wide range of future quantum technologies .
Recently , a team of scientists from the University of Cambridge ’s Cavendish Laboratory and the Toshiba Research Europe Limited , both in Cambridge , as well as the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow , have designed an experiment that allows for the observation of single - electron tunneling at the picosecond timescale .
In their technique , moving quantum dots that contain single electrons travel through a circuit with regions of different confinement , which excites the electrons into a superposition of states and causes them to oscillate .
The physicists could detect oscillations in the resulting current , overcoming many of the challenges in single - electron detection .
Their study is published in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters .
" For the first time , we have detected the coherent motion of a single electron within a quantum dot , " lead author Masaya Kataoka told PhysOrg.com .
Kataoka was previously with the University of Cambridge , and is now with the National Physical Laboratory in London .
Previously , most approaches to electron detection have involved the application of short pulses to the electrodes of the experimental device .
By arranging their device a bit differently , the UK team could avoid the need for these pulses .
In their setup , they work with quantum dots , with each containing just one electron .
The quantum dots travel at a velocity of about 2,800 meters per second through a channel past a tunnel barrier , on the other side of which is a parallel channel .
“ Because of the bandwidth limitation , past observations of coherent motion of single electrons were done using a relatively slow process , such as oscillation between two quantum dots , ” Kataoka said .
“ The motion of an electron within a quantum dot , at a single - electron level , is normally much faster .
It is not easy to fabricate a single - electron quantum dot , or a quantum dot suitable for high - frequency measurement .
Our idea of moving quantum dots through a circuit , rather than using a static quantum dot , seems to work for this purpose . ”
The new method is based on the fact that the ground state of an electron in a quantum dot is very fragile , and a sudden change in the confinement potential can excite the electron from the ground state to a superposition of eigenstates .
A short tunnel barrier provides just such a change in confinement to produce a superposition .
If an electron encounters this tunnel barrier , it achieves a superposition of states , oscillating with a period of about 5 picoseconds and at a frequency that depends on the energy gap between the states .
In the setup , an electron wave function oscillates from side to side in the channel , periodically hitting the short tunnel barrier .
At the weakest point of the tunnel barrier , an electron can tunnel into a parallel channel and escape into a different exit than the exit at which the electrons that do n’t tunnel go to .
In other words , the electron oscillations lead to oscillations in the tunnel current , and the physicists could detect the tunnel current oscillations by making a weak , repeated measurement of the current at the second exit .
Unlike many previous experiments , this technique does n’t require the application of short pulses , enabling it to overcome bandwidth limitations .
“ Basically , the success of our experiments depended on giving each electron a chance to tunnel out for a very short time , on the order of 100 picoseconds or less , ” Kataoka said .
This new experimental technique could not only increase the understanding of electron dynamics on a fundamental level , but also assist in the development of future technologies that involve quantum mechanical dynamics , such as quantum electronics , quantum optics , and quantum information processing .
For instance , the basis of a qubit for many quantum computation schemes is the charge state or spin state of a single electron trapped in a quantum dot .
Compared with quantum dots that contain multiple electrons , quantum dots that contain single electrons provide stronger confinement potential , which leads to a faster dynamic process .
“ The capability of detecting coherent motion of electrons opens up various possibilities , ” Kataoka said .
“ Quantum computation requires fast manipulation and measurement of quantum states .
Our technique of creating a short tunnel barrier may be used for such operations .
Also , unlike many other solid - state quantum computation schemes , our quantum systems move through circuits .
This can provide an ‘ information bus ’ that carries quantum information between static quantum systems .
Another idea would be that we may be able to construct an experimental setup similar to quantum optics , replacing noninteracting bosons ( photons ) with interacting fermions ( electrons ) , by channeling electrons through a series of circuits and tracking their coherent motions . ”

Three of the four big broadcast networks now own stakes in Hulu , the popular video Web site .
ABC Enterprises , a unit of the Walt Disney Company , announced Thursday that it would join NBC Universal , which is owned by General Electric and Vivendi , and the News Corporation , owner of Fox , as a partner in the joint venture .
Hulu , which in the last 18 months has become the third most popular video site on the Web , behind YouTube and Fox Interactive Media , displays free , high - quality versions of television shows and movies , supported by advertising .
It said it would add ABC shows like “ Lost , ” “ Desperate Housewives ” and “ Jimmy Kimmel Live ” to its online library by late summer , pending regulatory approval .
Anne Sweeney , president of the Disney - ABC Television Group , said that while most of the network ’s shows will continue to be available on ABC.com , that site attracts mostly core fans .
By distributing them on Hulu , Disney hopes to reach Hulu ’s much - larger audience of 42 million visitors a month .
According to people briefed on the terms of the deal , ABC will give Hulu an exclusive license to distribute its shows on Hulu.com and across the Web on Hulu ’s partner sites , like MySpace and AOL .com .
ABC will also give Hulu around $ 25 million in marketing credit , which Hulu can use to advertise itself during ABC ’s broadcast shows .
White House Correspondent Association dinner veterans say the annual D.C. celebrity fest may be past its prime .

Has the party lasted too long ?
All over Washington , 20 - somethings are busy laying out outfits and organizing game plans in hopes of running into Ben Affleck or Ashton Kutcher .
They have reason to be excited :
In a town where fashion places second — or third or fourth — behind fiscal stimulus and hip takes a backseat to House resolutions , the weekend of parties and celebrity sightings surrounding the White House Correspondents ’
Association Dinner provides a rare bit of excitement and glamour .

But there are also plenty of graybeards doing what graybeards always do : declare that it ’s “ just not what it used to be . ”
“ This one may be reaching past its prime , ” said Qorvis ’ Chuck Conconi , who spent years covering the event for Washingtonian and The Washington Post .
“ It ’s one hell of an evening , but I think that it ’s overkill .
... I do n’t think it serves a purpose other than being a kind of cheerleading for journalists .
...
It ’s a lot of strutting and showmanship . ”
To be sure , the WHCA weekend in its current form really is n’t what it used to be .
What was once a more modest , clubby , local party dominated by print news outlets has evolved into a pricey , multiday , star - filled spectacle that garners the obsessive attention of countless TV networks , websites and newspapers — including this one , of course .
“ The dinner was always a big print evening , ” said ABC ’s Ann Compton , who recently served as the WHCA ’s president .
“ But some people now see the TV and cable networks as the dominant players , buying more tables , getting better seats , holding more receptions .
There was less Hollywood — except for the entertainer . ”
“ Back in the Pleistocene Age — before C - SPAN and Clinton — it was a determinedly nonglitzy affair , ” Newsweek ’s Howard Fineman said in an e-mail .
“ There was little coverage , and certainly no live TV coverage ; the Clinton - based mix of showbiz people and California Democratic money had n’t yet materialized .
Guests were supposed to be newsworthy or behind - the - news types .
My first bureau chief at Newsweek , the legendary Mel Elfin , used to advise against trying to bring big - name guests .
Better to bring a midlevel person who might really appreciate it . ”
But after the late Michael Kelly , then with The Baltimore Sun , invited Iran - Contra news hottie Fawn Hall as a bit of a goof , the glitz was turned on full throttle .
“ I still invited presidential wannabes , ” said Fineman , “ but I happily began veering off into Hollywood - on - the - Potomac : Alec Baldwin and his then - wife Kim Basinger , Michael Douglas , Bo Derek and Meg Ryan .
... I admit to enjoying it all . ”
This year , Fineman said , he ’s bringing “ Athenian goddess ” Arianna Huffington .
Some , of course , maintain that the weekend ’s ridiculousness has always been there .
“ It was pretty much Ringling Bros .
when I started doing it a dozen years ago , ” said Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank .
“ I think it lost its charm for me when the audience talked over Ray Charles like he was some bad lounge act .
I believe this contributed to his death . ”
And , yet , while the festivities have become more fabulous , they have also become less fun for some .
Yes , the “ prom ” circus has helped make both Washington and politics more sexy , but it has also engendered a bit of eye - rolling fatigue among those who are n’t up for 10 parties in four days or who feel like their precious baby has been taken away from them and turned into an insatiable monster .
Gossip columnists charged with covering the weekend once thought it an annual highlight ; now they groan for months ahead of it , knowing all too well what ’s in store .
“ Compared to 30 years ago , the dinner has become a goofy , mashed - up free - for - all that has little in common with its original purpose : a chance for White House print reporters to take a source out to an ‘ off the record ’ dinner , ” said WHCA Dinner veteran Carol Joynt , who currently chronicles Washington social life for the New York Social Diary website .
“ But everybody loves it when the circus comes to town , and this is the Washington media ’s circus . ”
The dinner has some strikes against it .
It faces stiff competition from the plethora of pre- and post - parties .
It ’s expensive — $ 200 a pop for long lines , average food and wine , security checks , packed seating , and waiters who always seem as if they ’re about to drop a tray of surf ’ n ’ turf in your lap .
And its main event — a comedy routine from a recognized comedian — dies as often as it kills .
All of this , of course , misses the dinner ’s most long - standing critique : that it exemplifies the cozy , compromised relationship between journalists and government types , to the detriment of both .
The New York Times got repulsed enough with the scene that it sat out last year ’s dinner and said it will do the same on Saturday night .
“ People who object on those grounds live in a cave , ” said Air America ’s Ana Marie Cox , adding , “ Do they think that if there was n’t a dinner , we ’d never find a way to talk to them ? ”
Fineman also thinks the criticisms are slightly misplaced .
“ I ’m not one of those hypocritical Washington journalists who claims to hate the dinner , ” he said .
“ It is what it is : a silly , fun group grope .
Is it dangerous for us to regard ourselves as public figures ?
Yes and no .
Depends on whether you can take pride in your reporting and writing and yakking .
Are we too close to the people we cover ?
Yes , but that is a far deeper problem than the dinner itself .
And for all of our faults — and we have many , the first five years of the Bush administration being chief among them —
I ’d still rather spend time with fellow journalists ( even the Washington variety ) than any other slice of humanity I can think of . ”
This year ’s dinner has one significant thing working in its favor : the Obama factor .
Will it make a difference , even for those who say the dinner has run its course ?
Consider : Unlike his predecessor , Barack Obama is popular with Americans and journalists alike — no small feat — which could remove the layer of uncomfortable resentment that seemed to float above President George W. Bush ’s last few WHCA dinners .
And Obama seems comfortable around reporters and is a more social creature generally , having hosted regular cocktail parties at the White House and ventured into Washington on several occasions .
There ’s even been the occasional drink , something Bush always avoided .
And then there ’s the Hollywood factor .
Perhaps no politician has ever enjoyed such popular support among celebrities , which would explain why this year ’s roster of A - list attendees is the strongest yet : Jon Bon Jovi , George Lucas , Glenn Close , Steven Spielberg , Sting , Brooke Shields , Mike Myers , Warren Buffett , Whoopi Goldberg , William H. Macy and Jennifer Garner just scratch the surface .
Ultimately , all of that WHCA fatigue — however real — could have a very simple explanation : malaise .
After eight years of the same president , the same power players and the same White House correspondents , the scene will inevitably grow weary , routine and tired .
“ On the first year of every new administration , there is a blitz of activity , ” said The Ashcroft Group ’s Juleanna Glover , who fondly recalls attending the Bush administration ’s first WHCA dinner .
“ And then it reverts back to the more predictable pattern .
...
This year will be much more interesting from a people - watching perspective .
There ’s a whole new raft of the next generation that ’s come to town and , for them , this will be a fantastically fun evening . ”
By the end of this weekend , partygoers will likely adopt the same attitude they do every year :
Sure , it was a chaotic , crazy mess , but it was our mess .
Longtime Washington Post and Orlando Sentinel scribe Annie Groer asks , “ Has the boldface thing gotten out of hand ?
Of course .
But it seems harmless enough , given the celebrification of the universe . ”
“ It is ridiculous , ” said Cox .
“ But that does n’t mean that you ca n’t like it . ”
Four decades ago , " disappear " was always an intransitive verb .
Keys disappeared .
Jobs disappeared .
But , grammatically speaking , you did not disappear something .
Beginning in the 1970s , that changed .
In Chile , Argentina , Guatemala , El Salvador and elsewhere in Latin America , military dictatorships and death squads associated with them disappeared people in large numbers .
The generals in Buenos Aires and Santiago dropped some of them in the ocean .
In Guatemala , the destination for many was a mass grave .
In Spanish , the cognate is desaparecer , and the people who vanished soon came to be called los desaparecidos .
In El Salvador and elsewhere , groups like " Las madres de los desaparecidos " ( mothers of the disappeared ) formed to demand that the governments tell them what happened to their sons and daughters .
Long - standing systematic CIA links to death squads in Central America made the U.S. , at the very least , an accomplice in these acts of terror .
The CIA has disappeared people far more recently .
Dafna Linzer pointed out at ProPublica Wednesday that , according to Human Rights Watch , 35 suspects known to have been held in secret prisons as far back as 2001 are still unaccounted for .
The Cheney - Bush administration admitted in 2006 that it had secretly held prisoners incommunicado for years at " black sites . "
In the words of then - CIA Director Michael Hayden , the prisoners totaled somewhat fewer than 100 .
In September that year , 14 high - level captives from this group were transferred to military custody at the U.S. detention center at Guantánamo Bay .
Others were sent to Egypt , Jordan and Pakistan .
At the time , however , six human rights groups said 39 other captives were still believed to be held by the CIA .
More than two - and - a - half years later , 35 of these captives remain " disappeared , " ghost detainees .
Thus , a third of those the CIA once held , if Hayden 's 100 figure can be believed , have vanished as surely as the Argentinians who were pushed out of helicopters into the Atlantic in the 1980s .
Last week , as Linzer reported when the Office of Legal Counsel memos were released , al Qaeda suspect Hassan Ghul 's name was apparently accidentally included .
The last time that name had been publicly spoken by a government official was in 2004 when George Bush mentioned Ghul 's arrest to the media .
Linzer wrote :
According to the [ OLC ] memo , Ghul was one of 28 CIA detainees at the time who had been subjected to the agency ’s " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
Specifically , the memo says he was subjected to " facial hold , " " facial slap , " " stress positions , " " sleep deprivation , " a technique called " walling , " in which a detainee ’s shoulders are repeatedly smashed against a wall , and the " attention grasp [ 8 ] , " in which the detainee is placed in a choke - hold and slapped .
After Dana Priest in the Washington Post exposed the secret prisons in 2005 , most of the prisoners were gradually transferred to third countries .
But the 35 on the Human Rights Watch list have vanished .
" CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told ProPublica : " The agency has not , as a rule , commented on these kinds of lists , which are typically flawed . "
ProPublica reported :
" Making the Justice Department memos on the CIA 's secret prison program public was an important first step , but the Obama administration needs to reveal the fate and whereabouts of every person who was held in CIA custody , " said Joanne Mariner , director of the Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program at Human Rights Watch .
" If these men are now rotting in some Egyptian dungeon , the administration can't pretend that it's closed the door on the CIA program . "
The Red Cross has had access to and documented ... the experiences of only the 14 people who were publicly moved out of the CIA program and into the prison at Guantanamo Bay .
As Steve Hynd says :
[ The administration ] cannot say it has closed the door on the Bush administration 's criminal conduct in concealing these prisoners ' ident [ it ]ies and whereabouts in contravention of international laws .
Yet another charge to be added to illegal detention , torture and illegal kidnapping for the purposes of detention and torture .
If the Human Rights Watch list is " flawed , " there is a simple way for the CIA to clear this matter up .
Perhaps the agency needs a little nudging from the guy they greeted so warmly on Monday .

WASHINGTON --
The Obama 's administration 's leading plan to fix General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC would use bankruptcy filings to purge the ailing companies of their biggest problems , including bondholder debt and retiree health - care costs , according to people familiar with the matter .
The move would in essence split both companies into their " good " and " bad " components .
The government would like to see the " good " GM to be a standalone company , according to an administration official .
The " good " Chrysler would be sold to ...
Everyone knows that smoking is bad for your health .
Turns out it ’s not so good for the health of the planet , either .
Cigarettes might go up in smoke but the butts remain and account for 1.7 billion pounds of non-biodegradable trash .
According to ButtsOut , cigarette butt litter is the world ’s greatest environmental litter problem with approx 4.3 trillion cigarette butts tossed onto roads , pavements , beaches , parks , forests and in waterways every year .
Further breakdown indicates that smokers in the U.S. account for over 250 billion cigarette butts , those in the UK account for 200 tons of butts , and Australian smokers litter over 7 billion cigarette butts annually .
In fact , in most Western countries cigarette butt litter accounts for around 50 % of all litter .
And it ’s gotten worse since governments around the world started implementing indoor smoking bans .
In America , while cigarette smoking has decreased 28 % , smokers are increasingly dropping cigarette butts on the ground , in planters , and throwing them into the waterway .
Why ?
Probably due to a combined lack of awareness and lack of proper cigarette receptacles .
This year , the World Health Organization ’s No Tobacco Day on May 31st is focusing on health warnings on tobacco product packaging as a way of encouraging smokers to quit .
But perhaps instead they should be focusing on educating smokers about the damage that butt litter causes to the environment .
Maybe if they realized that it takes over 25 years for cigarette butts to decompose and that they poison our waterways and kill marine life , they would stop simply throwing butts away .

The difficulty of studying Order 10 squares is staggering .
Such a square has 111 columns and 111 rows , in each of which 11 of the numbers used in the square must be selected and arranged so that the array fits together according to the rules .
Dr. Graham said that the number of ways of choosing just one of the 111 rows is more than 470 trillion .
No ordinary computer can deal with such monster problems , but the Montreal group enlisted the help of an American supercomputer - a Cray 1S normally used for Defense Department projects by the Institute for Defense Analysis at Princeton , N.J .
The institute provided Dr. Lam 's group with time on the computer during periods when it was not at work on military problems .
Even with the help of the Cray , computation took several thousand hours spread over three years , '' possibly a world record ' ' for lengthy computation time , Dr. Lam said in a telephone interview .
He explained that he and his Concordia University collaborators , Dr. John McKay , Dr. Larry Thiel and Dr. Stanley Swiercz , had attacked the problem in somewhat the way a computer chess program tries to defeat an opponent .
'' The computer chess player must examine all its possible moves and all the countermoves its opponent could make in response to each one , '' he said .
'' The farther ahead the computer tries to look , the more immense its task becomes .
Our search of the possibilities for an Order 10 finite projective plane faced the same kind of obstacle - gigantic complexity . ''
The computation that would be needed to solve higher orders of the problem than Order 10 would take too long using present - day equipment , he said .
For example , mathematicians would like to determine whether a finite projective plane of Order 12 could exist , but Dr. Lam said that only a computer 10 billion times faster than today 's supercomputers could answer the question in a human lifetime .
Dr. Lam said that even using a supercomputer , his study depended heavily on time - saving strategies derived from the theoretical work of Dr. Jessie MacWilliams and Dr. Neil J. A. Sloane , both of A.T.&T . Bell Laboratories , and Dr. John Thompson of Cambridge and Rutgers universities .
Dr. Thompson was the winner of a 1970 Fields Medal , an international award for mathematicians comparable in prestige among mathematicians to the Nobel Prize .

Peru 's military have been authorised to give support to the police for 30 days in an escalating dispute over Amazon resources with indigenous groups .
The armed forces will intervene to ensure the operation of roads , airports and other essential services , Peru 's ministry of defence said .
A day before the protesters said they would begin an insurgency to defend their rights , a threat later withdrawn .
Some 30,000 people have held a month - long protest in Peru 's Amazon region .
There have been clashes with the police as the indigenous protesters call for the repeal of decrees passed over the past two years relaxing restrictions over oil exploration and development .
President Alan Garcia has said all Peruvians should benefit from the country 's natural resources not just the " small group of people who live there " .
" We have to understand when there are resources like oil , gas and timber , they do n't belong only to the people who had the fortune to be born there , " President Garcia said .
Under Peru 's constitution the state is the owner of the country 's mineral and hydrocarbon wealth .
Ancestral territories
On Friday , Alberto Pizango , head of the indigenous Amazonian organisation , AIDESEP , said talks with the government had broken down .
Indigenous leader Alberto Pizango : ' Not against development '
He said their ancestral territories were being handed over to multinational companies without consultation .
But he denied he or the movement of 65 indigenous groups he leads are against development .
" What we want is development from our perspective , " Mr Pizango said .
On 8 May the government declared a state of emergency for 60 days in parts of Peru's Amazon region where the protestors have disrupted transportation links including airports and bridges .
Huge stakes are involved , says the BBC's Dan Collyns in Lima .
Last month , a French oil company , Perenco , pledged to invest $ 2bn ( £ 1.32 bn ) in one rainforest oil field .
Indigenous communities complain that some 70 % of Peruvian Amazon territory is now leased for oil and gas exploration , putting at risk their own lives and the biodiversity of the Amazon .
The Peruvian rainforest is the biggest stretch of Amazon outside Brazil .
A new European communications satellite was successfully launched into orbit on Friday , at 12:24 pm EDT ( 1624 GMT ) from the Russian - operated Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan , Space reports .
The mission lasted more than nine hours , and the device was positioned on a high - altitude geosynchronous transfer orbit .
A 191 - foot - tall Proton deliver system was used as the carrier , and the rocket did not disappoint , offering the view of a perfect launch to all those present .
The cargo , the Eutelsat - operated W2A satellite , began its 15 - year mission at 01:34 GMT Saturday ( 9:34 pm EDT Friday ) , with a successful conclusion of its launch phase .
According to the International Launch Services ( ILS ) – a joint Russian - American venture to market and provide launch services on Proton and Atlas launch vehicles – the craft will deposit itself on a 20.7 - degree inclination , with a high point of 22,118 miles ( roughly 35,600 kilometers ) and a low point of 3,113 miles ( some 5010 km ) .
The launch itself was made possible by the joint efforts of six first stage RD - 276 engines aboard the Proton delivery system .
Immediately after lift - off , the craft oriented itself towards northeast , and moved further up .
Once deployed , it will provide a number of communication - related services to Europe , Africa , the Middle East , as well as to parts of South America and India .
Some 2 minutes after the launch sequence was initiated , the first stage engines were shut down and dropped , revealing the second stage thrusters .
These engines burned for about three and a half minutes .
After that time , the third stage thrusters kicked in , shutting down their “ predecessors ” and jettisoning the second stage of the Proton rocket .
After this stage exhausted its fuel supply , it also separated , along with the nose cover that protected the W2A satellite during the atmosphere exit process .
All that remained was the Breeze M stage , which fired its engines for the first time 11 and a half minutes into the flight .
Having reached a temporary , lower orbit , the craft then fired the boosters four more times , until the targeted orbit and inclination were achieved .
A Kremlin policy paper says international relations will be shaped by battles over energy resources , which may trigger military conflicts on Russia 's borders .
The National Security Strategy also said that Russia will seek an equal " partnership " with the United States , but named U.S. missile defense plans in Europe among top threats to the national security .
The document , which has been signed by President Dmitry Medvedev , listed top challenges to national security and outlined government priorities through 2020 .
" The international policy in the long run will be focused on getting hold of energy sources , including in the Middle East , the Barents Sea shelf and other Arctic regions , the Caspian and Central Asia , " said the strategy paper that was posted on the presidential Security Council 's website .
" Amid competitive struggle for resources , attempts to use military force to solve emerging problems can't be excluded , " it added .
" The existing balance of forces near the borders of the Russian Federation and its allies can be violated . "
The paper did n't elaborate or name any specific nations .
Medvedev 's predecessor Vladimir Putin , who is now Russia 's powerful prime minister , often accused the West in the past of trying to expand its clout in the ex-Soviet nations and push Russia out of its traditional sphere of influence .
The Kremlin has fiercely opposed NATO 's plans to incorporate its ex-Soviet neighbors , Ukraine and Georgia .
Russia currently controls most natural gas export routes out of the former Soviet region , but that grip is coming under growing pressure from China and the West .
The European Union , which depends on Russia for about one - quarter of its gas needs , has sought alternate supply routes , including the prospective Nabucco pipeline that would carry the Caspian and Central Asian gas to Europe but skirt Russia .
Intensifying rivalry for influence in the ex-Soviet region fomented tensions and helped stage the ground for last August 's war between Russia and Georgia , which sits astride a key export pipeline carrying Caspian oil to Western markets .
The war in Georgia has badly strained Russia 's ties with the West .
President Barack Obama 's administration has sought to rebuild ties with Moscow , which plummeted to a post - Cold War low under his predecessor and focus on negotiating a new nuclear arms control deal .
Medvedev and other Russian officials have hailed what they called the new administration 's constructive approach and voiced hope that Washington will drop plans to deploy missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic - a top irritant in U.S. - Russian relations .
Reflecting the Kremlin's hope for better ties with Washington , the strategy paper said Russia will seek " equal and full - fledged strategic partnership with the United States on the basis of coinciding interests . "
But it warned that missile defense plans and prospects to develop space - based weapons remain a top threat to Russia 's security , and said Russia will seek to maintain a nuclear parity with the United States .
However , it added that Russia 's policy will be pragmatic and will exclude a new arms race .
Here 's more evidence that Madoff 's inner sanctum , including his family members , were aware of the ongoing fraud and decided to get out of the oncoming train .
Daily Beast : The Daily Beast has learned that in the 90 days leading to the collapse of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities , $ 735 million was withdrawn from accounts controlled by Madoff ’s relatives , employees , and their relatives , and by people who fed billions of dollars of investors ’ money to Madoff .
The dollar amount has been previously known .
What has not been reported until now is the unusually short period in which the withdrawals were made , and how close it was to the collapse of the Madoff firm and to his confession on December 10 , 2008 .
The timing of those withdrawals prompted Irving Picard , the bankruptcy trustee , to send “ clawback letters ” in mid-April to 223 people among the more than 8,000 investors who had accounts with Madoff .
What this shows is that the bankruptcy trustee is not randomly trying to recover money from every Madoff investor — he ’s looking for people who may be culpable .
“ If you were a close relative of Bernie or Ruth , you got a letter , ” said David Sheehan , who is a leader of Picard ’s legal team at Baker , Hostetler . '
Not only is this interesting in terms of timing , but it also indicates that Picard is n't just indiscriminately mailing out clawback letters to the Madoff winners .
Not everyone is being asked to give the money back -- only , it seems , those folks with some kind of connection to the company and a reason to believe that the funds were actually gained fraudulently .
Still , if you were a family member and you know the fund was a fraud , why would you have any money with the firm at all ?
The Deproliferator
President Obama ’s Prague speech has inspired a flurry of opposition from nuclear weapon proponents .
Among their arguments , that old chestnut deterrence still holds pride of place .
But another seeks to shoulder it aside .
In The Trouble With Zero , the lead article of the May 10 New York Times Week in Review , Philip Taubman writes :
If arsenals are drastically reduced , the next steps toward abolition could be even trickier .
Since scientific and engineering knowledge cannot be expunged from mankind ’s memory , the potential to build weapons will always exist .
Does this rationale , aka You Ca n’t Put the Nuclear Genie Back in the Bottle , succeed in its intended purpose of making a mockery of disarmament ?
Whirled View‘s Cheryl Rofer , a former chemist at Los Alamos National Laboratory , wrote to us in an email :
Most of us know how to waterboard now , and we do n’t have an epidemic of neighborly waterboarding , or even by local law - enforcement authorities . …
We ca n’t eliminate the knowledge of how to waterboard , either , but we can outlaw it .
And , since building a nuclear weapon takes a bit more than a piece of cloth and a pitcher of water , there are effective choke points to limit building nuclear weapons . …
It ’s not the knowledge , it ’s what we do with it .
And so far the opponents of setting zero as a goal have n’t done much with their knowledge .
If future proliferators follow their lead , we have nothing to worry about .
Along with the choke points to which Ms. Rofer refers , improved tools for monitoring and verifying compliance with treaties stand ready and waiting to be used to prevent proliferation , as are ever - more intrusive inspections .
Still , short of burning the papers of nuclear scientists , confiscating their hard drives , and injecting them with memory - erasing drugs , their research wo n’t disappear into the recesses of time anytime soon .
Normally , it ’s to mankind ’s credit when knowledge is archived and endures .
But , while nuclear knowledge in its resting state is a form of potential energy , it yearns to be made kinetic .
Is there a way for us to keep it down on the archive after its seen the testing grounds ?
Convincing Nuclear Aspirants to Step Away from the Nukes
Blissfully unhaunted by the Cold War , states that long for nuclear weapons view them as essential to security .
Little do they know that , once armed , the honeymoon period is all too brief before a state — India and Pakistan come to mind — discovers that it ’s in no less peril than before it developed them .
To prevent non-nuclear states from realizing its aspiration , nuclear states need to think outside the monitoring and compliance box , or at least supplement it with more tools .
Nuclear - aspiring states might respond to the same encouraging , proactive steps that Lewis Dunn proposes in the recent Arms Control Today for dealing with nuclear states like Russia and China .
These include :
Information , data exchanges , and transparency measures ;
Joint studies , experiments , and planning ;
Personnel exchanges , liaison arrangements , and joint military staff bodies ;
Joint activities , programs , systems , and centers ; and
Unilateral initiatives and coordinated national undertakings .
As for the individuals who become nuclear scientists and are hired by the nuclear - aspiring state , is there any hope of inducing qualms in them about working on nuclear weapons ?
Unfortunately , they ’re often indisposed to not only politics but ethics .
In addition , they ’re likely to be susceptible to the nationalistic exhilaration that accompanies their state ’s own version of the Manhattan Project .
The work - around , though , is obvious .
Offer nuclear - aspiring states assistance with projects that will quicken scientists ’ pulses even more than developing nuclear weapons — after all , enriching uranium with its endless rows of centrifuges quickly becomes tedious .
Alternative energy , for example .
Still , that will likely be insufficient to divert a state from developing nuclear weapons .
In regard to inducing states in possession of nuclear weapons to intensify their disarmament measures , Taubman writes :
One solution suggested by abolition advocates would be a form of latent or virtual deterrence , based not on weapons all but ready to launch , but on the ability to reassemble or rebuild them .
Needless to say , latent deterrence does n’t apply to non-nuclear states , because they have no weapons to disassemble .
But that positions them to enact another , more sophisticated form of deterrence than latent .
Let ’s call it pregnant deterrence .
We ’ll define it as possessing the knowledge and ability to develop nuclear weapons , without bringing their development to fruition .
But everyone knows how long it takes to develop the fuel cycle .
What state inimical to the one in question , especially if it ’s both equipped with nuclear weapons and a non-signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , will be shaking in its boots about the other ’s ability to develop nukes five years down the line ?
Pregnant deterrence can only work if a state ’s neighbors think the state is able to accelerate completion of the fuel cycle .
That can only come to pass if a nuclear state not only provides the nuclear aspirant with all the knowledge needed to develop nuclear weapons , but , nuclear umbrellas aside , promises to help facilitate said development in the event of a imminent nuclear threat to the aspirant .
Wait — what NPT nuclear state ( or states ) in its right mind would consider making such a commitment ?
Nuclear weapons proponents claim that disarmament does nothing to stop other states from arming .
But , it ’s disingenuous and an abdication of the position of leadership implicit in a state ’s position as an NPT nuclear state to contend that disarmament should start with anyone but the haves .
Thus , the only way to make pregnant deterrence work is for nuclear weapon states to couple the promise of assistance with a sure - fire way of preventing the need for that from ever arising .
Maybe pregnant deterrence is best filed under the category of : “ We can dream , ca n ’t we ? ”
But setting a deadline for significant disarmament and sticking to it just might buy the time needed to keep a nuclear state from threatening a state that ’s in a state of pregnant deterrence .
There will then be no need for the latter to induce labor and give birth to a bouncing , baby nuclear weapons program .
To Hell in a Bond Basket
Drag Me to Hell !
That ’s the title of the first horror movie with a credit crunch theme .
No kidding .
We just read about it in the Financial Times .
The idea of the movie is simple enough .
A young woman is a mortgage loan officer at an LA bank .
She wants a promotion … but to get it she has to prove that she ’s tough enough to say ‘ no . ’
So when a creepy customer comes in and asks for an extension of her mortgage , the woman rejects the proposal … perhaps a little too coldly .
Then begins the horror .
But just look around .
There are plenty of frightening and unnatural scenes going on .
Broadly speaking , it ’s a merciless war between inflation and deflation .
But there are many different attacks , ambushes , counterattacks , feints , and massacres going on .
The Dow retreated 173 points yesterday .
Typically , following a major fall in the stock market , there is a ‘ reflex rally ’ that lasts several months .
Our rough guess was that it would carry on until summer .
Most analysts thought it would exhaust itself sooner .
Who knew ?
But yesterday , it looked as though the rally may be nearing an end .
The rally itself is a part of a larger battle between two contradictory body parts – the heart and the mind .
The heart wants to believe that the worst is over .
It reacts sentimentally , remembering the glory days of the great bubble era and wishing they were back .
Higher consumer confidence readings sent the stock market higher on Tuesday – the heart ruled .
But on Wednesday , it was the head ’s turn .
The head looks at the facts : housing and employment are still going down .
People will spend less money .
Businesses will make less money .
Ergo , no reason to expect stocks to go up .
Instead , they ’re more likely to go down .
The Dow scurried back to the lines it occupied at the beginning of the week .
The head noticed , too , that the Treasury market is getting slammed by higher yields .
The long bond yielded 4.56 % yesterday – up from well below 3 % at the end of last year .
“ Treasury yields give cause for concern , ” says this morning ’s Financial Times .
“ Rising Treasury yields threaten to stifle economic recovery , ” continues another article in the same paper .
But has the top of the bond market really passed ?
Is the credit cycle now in full retreat ?
Will homeowners and businessmen be tortured with higher interest rates ?
Those are the questions the head was asking yesterday .
And it did n’t like the answers .
If there were any green shoots , it reasoned , higher interest rates could crush them .
And then at least a few heads began thinking about what this meant to the big strategic issues … and how this flick will turn out .
At the end of last year , America ’s great buddy , China , changed its policy .
Instead of buying long - dated US debt , China began buying the short stuff .
China ’s top man openly wondered whether the US would be able to protect the value of the dollar and keep its promises to foreign lenders .
“ We have a huge amount of money in the United States , ” we quoted China ’s premier just yesterday .
He reminded the US that China had entrusted a lot of its wealth to US paper and went on to request that America respect its obligations to bond buyers .
Obviously , the Chinese must wonder if the US is capable of protecting its currency while still funding its war against deflation .
Tim Geithner promptly responded .
“ Yes we can ! ” But the Chinese cogitated on the matter …
“ No they can ’t , ” they began to think .
Then , they switched to buying short - term US debt , leaving the longer - term bonds to other buyers .
Since the Chinese were the biggest buyers at US Treasury debt auctions , this switch in policy had a quick and noticeable effect .
Bills rose .
Bonds fell .
The yield on bills fell to below zero , while the yield on the 30 - year bond has gone steadily up .
If America ’s supply lines to cheap credit have been cut , she is at a great strategic disadvantage .
Or rather , her pre-existing strategic disadvantage is becoming more apparent : she depends on foreigners just to be able to continue living in the style to which she has become accustomed .
As the president of the United States of America acknowledged this week :
“ We ’re out of money now . ”
But how does this affect the war between inflation and deflation ?
The US is on the side of inflation , of course .
It put its whole economy on a war footing and has earmarked more resources ( in real terms no less ) , to the fight than it spent on WWII .
In a larger sense , the US is at war with capitalism …and with nature herself .
Markets have natural rhythms .
They go from boom to bust … from inflation to deflation … from expansion to contraction naturally .
Trying to stop the bust is futile .
It is a fight against Fate …a losing proposition .
And it is diabolically unnatural .
You have to take the bad with the good in life .
There ’s no going to Heaven without dying .
And you ca n’t rebuild a house without tearing down the old one .
Mistakes must be corrected .
Old , worn - out businesses have to go out of business so that new ones can take their places .
Bad investments need to be deflated … liquidated .
Failed managers and failed business models must be eliminated .
Bubble delenda est .
The feds ca n’t beat nature .
The bubble ca n’t be reflated .
They ca n’t make the situation better than it would be if they left it alone .
But they can make it a lot worse .
They still have the nuclear option .
Then we ’ll all be blown to Hell …
What ’s the nuclear option ?
It ’s the Zimbabwe Solution … pioneered by Gideon Gono , head of Zimbabwe ’s central bank … and recently proposed for the US by Harvard professors Rogoff and Mankiw .
And they ’re not the only ones .
Of course , there is no need to exaggerate .
The facts are outrageous enough .
So , let ’s calmly look at what has happened so far …and where it is likely to lead .
As you know , the battle between inflation and deflation is going badly for the feds .
Deflation is winning .
And yesterday , the Eastern Front collapsed .
Germany announced that consumer prices are now 0.1 % lower than they were a year ago .
Germany is in outright deflation .
The rest of Europe is probably not far behind .
In America , the trend is probably in the same direction .
The money supply – M1 – grew at an 18 % rate over the last 6 months .
But taking just the last 3 months , the rate of growth has fallen to only 1.8 % .
Meanwhile , the US Treasury is borrowing hudreds of billions ’ of dollars in order to close the gap between what the US spends and what it receives in taxes .
Even if the Chinese are willing to fund that borrowing in the very short term , it just pushes forward the inevitable day when the list of willing lenders is shorter than the list of US Treasury bonds to be sold .
When that happens , the Chinese can bend over and kiss their reserves goodbye .
Because there is no way the US government is going to forego spending money just to protect foreign bondholders .
Instead , to raise money , it is going to turn to its very own bond buyer of last resort – the Fed .
The Fed will “ monetize the debt ” – by buying Treasury debt and converting it to dollars in circulation .
At least , that ’s the plan .
The risk is that it will cause consumer price inflation .
Everyone is aware of the risk .
Few doubt that it would happen .
But that ’s where Gono , Rogoff , Mankiw and many others , come in .
Caroline Baum reports :
“ Harvard University ’s Ken Rogoff and Greg Mankiw think more is better when it comes to inflation .
“ Rogoff said he advocates 6 percent inflation ‘ for at least a couple of years . ’
That would alleviate the strain deflation imposes on debtors , including the U.S. government , who have to pay back their loans in appreciated dollars .
“ In the Middle Ages , they threw people who failed to repay their debts into debtors ’ prisons .
Today debtors are rewarded with all kinds of government perks .
Look how far we ’ve come !
“ Borrowers took out mortgages they could n’t qualify for to buy homes they could n’t afford .
When the housing market collapsed , they were rewarded with government - subsidized mortgage modifications and , in some cases , partial forgiveness on their loan balances .
And now , under Rogoff ’s 6 percent solution , debtors would see more of their burden lifted .
“ And we , the savers , get screwed again .
“ ‘ Zimbabwe Solution ’ …
“ And who says the Fed can orchestrate 6 percent inflation and not let it get out of hand ?
You know what would happen to those well - anchored inflation expectations :
Ahoy , matey , it ’s out to sea with you .
“ ‘ Trying to manage a slight increase in the rate of inflation in a discretionary way is not practical , ’ says Marvin Goodfriend , professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon ’s Tepper School of Business in Pittsburgh .
“ Mankiw did n’t specify his preferred inflation rate in the Bloomberg story .
He was too busy to give me an interview , directing me instead to his New York Times column from last month where he proposed the idea of negative interest rates : not negative real rates , adjusted for inflation ; negative nominal rates .
“ The idea is ‘ to make holding money less attractive ’ so people will spend it . ”
Needless to say , we ca n’t wait to see what happens .
The Chinese already seem to think that holding dollars is less attractive than it used to be .
But Geithner and Bernanke assured Wen Jiabao that his money was safe .
We wonder what he ’ll do when he realizes they played him for a fool .
Until tomorrow ,

It is hard to find such a limited in functionality , yet such a wide - spread and popular device as a toaster .
The only thing it does is burning a slice of bread – but have you ever seen a kitchen without it ?
However like any other ordinary thing , a toaster has a long history and can be innovated in multiple things .
So let ’s just let ’s see what we have never expected from an ordinary toaster : let ’s explore state - of - the - art toasters :

Note : LifeStraw has been significantly improved since this article was written .
LifeStraw filters down to 0.2 microns using mechanical means – no chemicals are used to filter and it is BPA - free .
To find out more , go to the most recent article about LifeStraw or to our wiki .
A $ 5 donation through a Rotary Club will purchase a LifeStraw for a person in a developing nation who has limited or no access to clean water .
U.S. and Canadian customers can purchase a LifeStraw for $ 19.95 through EarthEasy or Green Beetle Gear .
The Lifestraw is a simple looking device , merely a plastic tube at first glance , but inside is a powerful water filter , capable of killing disease - causing bacteria and viruses , and filtering particles down to the size of 15 microns .
Distributing the Lifestraw to people without access to clean water can make the difference between life and death to them , and the cost to us is only about $ 5 .
Lifestraw is the invention of Vestergaard - Frandsen , a Swiss firm that produces textiles for insect and disease control , and has been distributed through donations to people in the developing world .
The device filters out 99.99 % of bacteria , and contains an iodine element to kill viruses and parasites .
Medgadget has this description of the filtration process :
What first meets the water when sucked up is a pre-filter of PE filter textile with a mesh opening of 100 micron , shortly followed by a second textile filter in polyester with a mesh opening of 15 micron .
In this way all big articles are filtered out , even clusters of bacteria are removed .
Then the water is led into a chamber of iodine impregnated beads , where bacteria , viruses and parasites are killed .
The second chamber is a void space , where the iodine being washed off the beads can maintain their killing effect .
The last chamber consists of granulated active carbon , which role is to take the main part of the bad smell of iodine , and to take the parasites that have not been taken by the pre-filter or killed by the iodine .
The biggest parasites will be taken by the pre-filter , the weakest will be killed by the iodine , and the medium range parasites will be picked up by the active carbon .
The Lifestraw Family version can handle a much larger volume of water , and as you can see in this video , it can turn water contaminated with some of the nastiest stuff you can imagine into potable water .
The personal Lifestraw comes with a string to keep the device handy around the user ’s neck , and can filter about 700 liters ( 185 gallons ) of water , which works out to about a year ’s worth of drinking water .
It ’s important that water can be filtered at the point of use , so a personal filter is a key element in safeguarding people , and if they always have one with them , the risk of drinking contaminated water is greatly reduced .
For those of us in the western world , with filtered and treated tap water freely available , the fact that a significant percentage of the population does not have access to potable water is not readily apparent .
We have a hard time imagining what that would be like .
However , for those who live in areas where everyday is a struggle to get clean water , and diarrhea and other waterborne illnesses are a common occurrence , this simple little device , the Lifestraw , really could be a lifesaver .
If you are so moved , please make a donation to Lifestraw and help out a fellow human today .
Happy Fatherhood Friday everyone .
This is the second in a series of entries chronicling the adventures of George and the Man in the Yellow Hat as they journey back to the jungle where they first met .
Along the way they may run into a few familiar faces .
If you missed the first part , you can read it here .
And if you have a little more time check out some of the other great posts at Dad Blogs including my latest column entry .
“ Wait , explain this again .
what are you and what are you doing here ? ” asked the Man in the Yellow Hat , absently playing with the tray table latch .
“ I ’m a rabbit , and my Dad and I go all around the country visiting people of different cultures and such , ” replied Buster , pausing to take a sip from his plastic cup .
“ Dad ’s a pilot and we normally are flying this random band with an unpronounceable name on their world tour , but Dad said because of some ‘ incident ’ with Mexican Federal Police we had to fly normal planes for awhile . ”
The Man in the Yellow Hat scratched his chin .
“ Ok , so you ’re a rabbit – that seems fairly obvious .
Let ’s put aside for a second that rather than living out your life in a wooden hutch munching hay in someone ’s backyard you can talk , walk upright and wear pants .
But your Dad is just a normal guy wearing rabbit ears , right ?
I mean , you guys really do n’t look at all alike .
And what about your friend … what did you say his name was ? ” he asked .
“ This is Arthur .
He ’s a muskrat , ” Buster said .
“ I am not , I ’m an aardvark !
How long have we been friends ? ” interjected Arthur , his face twisted in disbelief .
The two started squabbling .
The Man in the Yellow Hat sighed , pulled out his clashing iPod Nano ( despite repeated requests , Apple would not create a canary colored one , only goldenrod ) , dialed up the soundtrack to the Jungle Book and tried to drift off to sleep .
With luck this would be a short and uneventful plane ride .
Down below in the cargo hold , George sat with his arms and legs folded in frustration .
FAA regulations do n’t allow for monkeys in the main cabin area , and so at the last minute George ended up here , locked in an oversized dog carrier .
He had amused himself the first part of the trip with a “ magical pocket sun ” the Man in the Yellow Hat had given him until he realized it was just a flashlight .
Now he was hungry – he had seen the Man in the Yellow Hat stuffing MonkeySnacks into his suitcase before they had left .
They had to be around here somewhere , he thought .
The dog carrier was designed to keep dogs in , not monkeys with opposable thumbs .
It took him a few tries , but George was able to get the door unlatched and it swung open .
He stepped out into the cargo hold and looked around .
He was surrounded by suitcases and bags of all shapes and colors – they all looked a lot like the suitcase the Man in the Yellow Hat had packed his snacks in .
George would have to go through each of them to find it .
He scampered over to the nearest suitcase and tore it open using his secret monkey claws .
George looked inside and pulled out fuzzy pink bracelets connected by a chain and a stick that he remembered the farmer using to make the horses go faster .
The farmer must be on the plane , he thought – this was n’t the right bag .
He jumped to the next box which was already partially open .
Inside this box was hundreds of rubber snakes .
Snakes on a plane , George mused .
How predictable .
This was going to take forever – there were just too many .
There must be someway to move all of these suitcases quickly so he could spot the one he was looking for .
He looked around , uttering quizzical monkey noises to no one in particular .
He spotted a big red button on the wall .
George remembered the button in the cider mill that he had pressed secretly trying to kill a squirrel hellbent on eating his apple and instead inadvertently bottled several hundred gallons of monkey - tainted cider that later poisoned several thousand unsuspecting consumers .
Maybe this button will be equally as fun , thought George .
He gingerly pushed the button and a green button next to it started to blink .
Hmm , George thought .
He reached and pushed the blinking button .
Suddenly , the back of the room disappeared , and all the suitcases started moving backward and disappearing too !
George quickly resorted to his first inclination in these situations – jumping up and down and shouting “ Haiiiiiii ! ” over and over .
This is usually when the Man in the Yellow Hat arrived and saved the day with a reassuring pat on the head . , George thought .
Where was he ?
Almost all the suitcases were gone , and he had to hold onto the wall to keep from disappearing himself .
Then a side door opened , and a Man With A Pissed Off Expression appeared .
“ Yikes ! ” he said , slapping the red button George had hit before .
The back of the room slowly reappeared .
George was relieved , and ran over to the Man With a Pissed Off Expression and held tightly to his leg .
“ Uh - oh ” thought George .
In all the excitement he had inadvertently soaked the man ’s leg .
He looked up with an embarrassed grin .
The Man with Pissed Off Expression looked down and scowled .
“ Why does n’t this monkey have a damn diaper on ? ” he asked .
Up in the passenger cabin , the turbulence caused by George ’s misadventure had caused pandemonium .
The Man in the Yellow Hat had been jolted out of his slumber by the shaking plane amidst the other passengers screaming , praying , and Buster ’s Dad yelling about a drunken rendezvous with a rabbit in college while holding a fake pair of bunny ears in his hands .
Despite what at the time seemed like imminent death , the Man in the Yellow Hat still found himself smirking a little .
After the flight settled and the panic had abated , the captain ’s voice came over the loudspeaker .
“ Sorry for the bumpy ride ladies and gentleman .
We ’re going to have to make an unscheduled landing here in just a minute .
Apparently a monkey just jettisoned all of your luggage over the Isle of Sodor … ”
“ GEORGE ! ” the Man in the Yellow Hat , now oblivious to Buster ’s hysterical crying .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The contentious debate over so - called enhanced interrogation techniques took center stage Wednesday on Capitol Hill as a former FBI agent involved in the questioning of terror suspects testified that such tactics -- including waterboarding -- are ineffective .
From left : Sens. Lindsey Graham , Sheldon Whitehouse , Patrick Leahy and Dianne Feinstein listen Wednesday .
Ali Soufan , an FBI special agent from 1997 to 2005 , told members of a key Senate Judiciary subcommittee that such " techniques , from an operational perspective , are ineffective , slow and unreliable and harmful to our efforts to defeat al Qaeda . "
Soufan 's remarks followed heated exchanges between committee members with sharply differing views on both the value of the techniques and the purpose of the hearing .
Soufan , who was involved in the interrogation of CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah , took issue with former Vice President Dick Cheney , who has said that enhanced interrogation techniques helped the government acquire intelligence necessary to prevent further attacks after September 11 , 2001 .
The techniques , which the Bush administration approved , are considered torture by many critics .
Watch analysts discuss harsh interrogations and torture »
" From my experience -- and I speak as someone who has personally interrogated many terrorists and elicited important actionable intelligence -- I strongly believe that it is a mistake to use what has become known as the ' enhanced interrogation techniques , ' " Soufan noted in his written statement .
Such a position is " shared by many professional operatives , including the CIA officers who were present at the initial phases of the Abu Zubaydah interrogation . "
Soufan told the committee that within the first hour of his interrogation of Zubaydah , the suspected terrorist provided actionable intelligence .
But once the CIA contractors took over and used harsh methods , Zubaydah stopped talking , Soufan said .
When Soufan was asked to resume questioning , Zubaydah cooperated .
After another round of more coercive techniques used by the contractors , however , Soufan said it was difficult for him to re-engage Zubaydah .
One of four recently released Bush administration memos showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on Zubaydah and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the suspected planner of the September 11 attacks .
" People were given misinformation , half - truths and false claims of successes ; and reluctant intelligence officers were given instructions and assurances from higher authorities , " Soufan testified .
" I wish to do my part to ensure that we never again use these ... techniques instead of the tried , tested and successful ones -- the ones that are also in sync with our values and moral character .
Only by doing this will we defeat the terrorists as effectively and quickly as possible . "
Watch as Soufan makes his case before the panel »
Soufan was hidden behind a protective screen during his testimony before the Judiciary Committee 's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts .
Staffers for the committee cited " documented threats " against him , noting his previous interaction with al Qaeda terrorists as well as his undercover work against Islamic extremists .
Philip Zelikow , who was a top aide to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , repeated an accusation during the hearing that Bush officials ordered his memo arguing against waterboarding to be destroyed .
The order , " passed along informally , did not seem proper , and I ignored it , " Zelikow said .
He said that his memo has been in State Department files and is being reviewed for possible declassification .
Zelikow slammed the " collective failure " behind the government 's adoption of " an unprecedented program of coolly calculated dehumanizing abuse and physical torment to extract information .
This was a mistake , perhaps a disastrous one . "
He added that some " may believe that recent history , even since 2005 , shows that America needs an elaborate program of indefinite secret detention and physical coercion in order to protect the nation .
...
If they are right , our laws must change and our country must change .
I think they are wrong . "
Watch Zelikow tell CNN's Kiran Chetry how U.S. leaders came to the wrong conclusions on interrogation policy »
Committee Republicans warned that the hearing ultimately could contribute to diminished national security .
" As we harshly judge those who had to make decisions we do n't have to make , please remember this : that what we do in looking back may determine how we move forward , " said Sen.
Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina .
" And let 's not unnecessarily impede the ability of this country to defend itself against an enemy who , as I speak , is thinking and plotting their way back into America . "
A top intelligence source familiar with the Bush administration 's interrogation program was dismissive of Soufan 's credibility as a witness .
" It 's puzzling that someone who questioned a single high - value detainee for just a few months claims to be able to talk about the value of a program that lasted nearly seven years after he was part of it , " the source said .
" Suffice it to say , there are varying accounts of the facts and circumstances surrounding the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah . "
Soufan wrote an op -ed in The New York Times in April arguing that there " was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that was n't , or could n't have been , gained from regular tactics . "
He said that " using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions .
...
The short - sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods , the nature of the threat , the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists , and due process . "
While at the FBI , Soufan was involved with investigations of sensitive international terrorism cases , including the East Africa bombings , the 2000 attack on the USS Cole and the September 11 attacks .
Sen . Sheldon
Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island , opened the hearing by accusing Bush administration officials of lying about the use of techniques that had damaged the country 's standing in the world .
Watch Whitehouse and Graham at the hearing »
" The truth of our country 's descent into torture is not precious .
It is noxious .
It is sordid , " Whitehouse said .
" It has also been attended by a bodyguard of lies .
... President Bush told us America does not torture while authorizing conduct that America has prosecuted .
...
Vice President Cheney agreed in an interview that waterboarding was like a dunk in the water , when it was used as a torture technique by tyrannical regimes from the Spanish Inquisition to Cambodia 's killing fields . "
CNN 's Pam Benson contributed to this report .

Here is our latest film .
It tackles the most important climate issue of all - coal .
Some readers may be surprised that I rank coal at the very top of the climate agenda .
I do so for a very simple reason .
Unless most of the world 's vast reserves of coal are kept underground then rapid climate change is , according to the scientific consensus , inevitable .
Oil and natural gas are in relatively limited supply , and will almost certainly be burnt , but there are still vast reserves of coal - nearly 1,000bn tonnes of the stuff .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) estimates that the CO2 stored in the world 's known coal reserves would be enough to push atmospheric CO2 concentrations up to around 600 parts per million .
There is a lot of debate about what constitutes a safe level of atmospheric CO2 .
Pre-industrial CO2 levels were around 280 ppm , now the figure is 389 p pm .
But virtually all scientists agree that levels above 550 ppm would guarantee catastrophic climate change .
That is why US climate campaigners have made coal a key focus - just take a look at our film .
It is different here in Britain .
Climate campaigners here have made the battle to block the third runway the most high profile climate issue .
John Sauven , the director of Greenpeace UK , predicted the site would become " the battlefield of our generation " .
In tonight 's film we have an interview with the eminent Nasa climate scientist Dr James Hansen .
He helped defend six campaigners charged with criminal damage after occupying the Kingsnorth coal - fired power station in Kent .
He told the court the protest was justified because the 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emitted daily by the plant could lead to the extinction of 400 species .
The accused were acquitted .
But when campaigners asked him to support the third runway campaign he refused .
It was a major blow to the campaign .
Dr Hansen said he believed the protests would not help the battle against global warming and do not deserve support .
Is Dr Hansen right ?
Does making aviation the focus of the climate campaign risk putting off potential supporters who do n't want to change their lifestyles ?
Moreover , if the world 's oil reserves will be burnt is n't trying to stop aviation fighting a lost cause ?
That 's Dr Hansen 's view : " Coal is 80 % of the problem , " he tells us .
" You have to keep your eye on the ball and not waste your efforts , " he said when the Observer newspaper asked him why he would not support the Heathrow campaign .
" The number one enemy is coal and we should never forget that . "
Should the British environmental movement put more emphasis on coal ?
Is this another case of the green movement being part of the problem ?
Everyone 's had that moment where they inadvertently come across a movie , show or music video so heinously awful that the only possible response is " How the fuck did that get made ? ! ? "
You joke to your friends that it probably has something to do with the offspring of a rich or famous person .
The reality is that your assumption is almost always correct .
When you live in LA you are always coming across rich kids ' pet projects .
These guys have never heard the word " No " and , unlike the rest of Hollywood 's dreamers , have never had to endure an all Ramen diet .
So blowing more money than most American families make in a year on some half - baked idea they came up with while they were high does n't seem that ridiculous to them .
The key factor in all of these projects is that they would n't even exist if they had to go through normal channels ( i.e. studios , labels , investors actually interested in getting their money back ) .
I mean , how else do you explain a sixty million dollar historical drama starring some guy nobody has ever heard of before ?
Oh yeah , his dad is the third richest man in America .
Most of these projects are merely poorly made , quickly forgettable wastes of money while a few actually turn out to be surprisingly good .
But the ones that all of us plebes love the most are the shockingly bad , incredibly embarrassing disasters .
Watching rich people with zero grasp on reality crash and burn is one of mankind 's greatest joys .
And that brings me to our latest example : Chris Dane Owens and the music video he produced , starred in and donned a cape for in support of his new ( only ? ) single , " Shine On Me " .
When you watch it for the first time , the uncompromising cheesiness of it all makes you pretty sure its a joke .
" Wow , the Funny or Die guys are getting pretty good budgets nowadays , " you think .
But you wait for the hook , the punchline , or any indication at all that this shit is n't for real ... and it never comes .
He 's got Ann Coulter 's hair along with industrial strength fans blowing it dramatically .
He 's playing a sparkly green guitar , with a crazy slap bass backup that has n't been heard since the 80's .
All this and I have n't even mentioned the medieval knight storyline yet .
There 's floating castles , flying dragons and a damsel in distress , often turning longingly to the camera as if to say , " I left Wisconsin for this ? "
One thing you can't knock , though , is the production value , which is through the roof .
You could buy a house by the beach with the cash they spent on this thing .
And with that realization , begs the question , Where did the money for this piece of crap come from ?
It turns out , Chris Dane Owens , who looks like some sort of mythical being descended from Mt. Olympus , is actually the spawn of Gary Owens , one of Hollywood 's most prolific announcer / narrators .
He is credited on thousands of movies , commercials and tv shows including Laugh - In and The Tonight Show .
Oh yeah , he 's also the voice of Powdered Toast Man. Respect .
As if " Shine On Me " has n't sullied the proud Owens name enough already , Chris is actually producing more installments , with Michael Jackson 's early longform music videos as a model .
In a time when our economy is in tatters , millions are getting laid off , the government has spent a trillion on bailouts , and the entertainment industry is almost at a standstill due to an impending strike , this jackass still gets to run around blowing crazy amounts of cash on chainmail , Panavision cameras and special effects , all in the pursuit of pleasing one person , himself .
The world is a funny place .
The Federal Trade Commission is seeking to shut down a telemarketing campaign that has been making hundreds of millions of allegedly deceptive " robocalls " to sell vehicle warranty extensions .
In two related complaints filed in federal court on Thursday , the FTC said it was taking action against the promoter of the phony extended auto warranties , as well as the telemarketing company that it hired to carry out its allegedly illegal campaign .

A 13 - year - old Minnesota boy with cancer must resume medical treatment to save his life , despite religious and other objections by his family -- unless it already is too late , a Brown County judge ruled Friday .
Judge John Rodenberg said Daniel Hauser must have a chest X - ray by next Tuesday , and ordered lawyers and the family back into his courtroom that day to give him an update on the boy 's condition .
" Daniel Hauser is a child in need of protection , " Rodenberg wrote , noting that five doctors agreed on the recommended course of treatment .
The county , he said , had proved " a compelling state interest in the life and welfare of Daniel sufficient to override the fundamental constitutional rights of both the parents and Daniel to the free exercise of religion and the due process right of the parents to direct the upbringing of their child . "
An attorney for the Hausers said Friday that the family will comply for now and has scheduled X - rays for Monday , but is considering an appeal .
" The Hausers believe that the injection of chemotherapy into Danny Hauser amounts to an assault upon his body , and torture when it occurs over a long period of time , " said their attorney , Calvin Johnson of Mankato .
" They believe that it is against the spiritual law to invade the consciousness of another person without their permission . "
County Attorney James Olson , who petitioned for the court 's intervention , said the judge 's decision " gets things started . "
But even with the X -ray , he said , doctors may not have a prognosis for Daniel by Tuesday 's hearing , and the judge may require more information before issuing a final order on chemotherapy .
Daniel was diagnosed in January with Hodgkin 's lymphoma , but the Hausers stopped his chemotherapy and radiation after one treatment and began substituting alternative care , including herbs and vitamins .
His doctors notified child protection officials , prompting Olson to file a child neglect petition .
VANCOUVER -
The city of Vancouver has taken over full financial control of the athletes village for the 2010 Winter Olympics .
City officials say they 've bought out the building loan for the project in order to better control costs .
The buyout cost the city $ 319.5 million , on top of the $ 400 - million worth of construction remaining on the village .
The original lender , Fortress Investment Inc. , had stopped payment on the loan in September and since then the city had been covering construction expenses to keep the village on schedule .
The city will now act as the banker on the $ 1 - billion project , which will house 1,100 athletes and officials during the Games and be converted to private housing afterwards .
" We have gone from an agreement that was clearly not in the interests of taxpayers , to an agreement that puts Vancouver 's taxpayers first , " Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson said Wednesday .
City manager Penny Ballem said Fortess ' completion guarantee was driving the city and developer to finish and sell the units -- even in a declining real estate market .
Their exit from the deal " does now open up a number of different options , " she said .
But the village 's problems are n't over -- the city is now grappling with massive cost overruns for the social housing component of the village , which has finances separate from the rest of the project .
A report prepared by city staff says the costs of the social housing component of the village is over budget by as much as $ 77 million .
Council policy requires that 20 per cent of units in new neighbourhoods be developed as affordable housing .
In the initial agreement with the Vancouver Olympic organizing committee , or VANOC , the city received $ 30 million from organizers and planned to have 252 units in the village dedicated to affordable housing after the Games .
Council in 2006 projected spending $ 65 million for the affordable housing .
A year later , council approved an interim increase to $ 95 million .
That cost has now climbed as high as $ 172 million , said the report sent to the mayor and council last week .
The deal to take over financial responsibility for the project means that the city now has the entire village as an asset , not just the land it sits on .
Ken Bayne , general manager of the city , said the project is still not risk - free .
" But certainly we need to acknowledge that the assignment of this loan , actually owning this loan and removing Fortress significantly enhanced our security because if things do n't go well , then that asset includes all those buildings , " he said Wednesday .
The costs of the $ 1 billion project breaks down into $ 193 million for land , $ 750 million for construction and $ 125 million for cost overruns .
The co-founders of website The Pirate Bay have been found guilty of facilitating illegal file sharing and sentenced to a year 's imprisonment and a £ 2.4 million fine .
The chairman of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , John Kennedy , said that the organisation was pleased by the verdict but the four defendants are planning to launch an appeal against the decision .
Is the verdict and its accompanying sentence justified ?
Pro-Israel Mouthpiece Says Freedom of Speech Dangerous ‘ JINSA ’ article says outlets who oppose future wars should be silenced — killed if necessary — by military strike
By Michael Collins Piper ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL voices of the pro-Israel lobby has published a shocking essay suggesting that , in the future , there should be “ military attacks ” on journalists and media outlets that oppose American military ventures on behalf of Israel .
In the spring 2008 issue of its Journal of International Security Affairs , the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ( JINSA ) , a particularly vocal force of the Jewish lobby , published a series of articles devoted to the subject : “ The U.S. Military Faces the Future . ”
One article , entitled “ Wishful Thinking and Indecisive Wars , ” written by Ralph Peters ( described as “ a retired U.S. Army officer ” ) states flatly that “ Although it seems unthinkable now , future wars may require censorship , news blackouts and , ultimately , military attacks on the partisan media . ”
The JINSA essay says “ Freedom of the press stops when its abuse kills our soldiers and strengthens our enemies .
Such a view arouses disdain today , but a media establishment that has forgotten any sense of sober patriotism may find that it has become tomorrow ’s conventional wisdom . ”
JINSA ’s suggestion that the media in America opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq — a key demand by Israel and JINSA — flies in contrast to the truth .
In fact , the major media banged the drum for war .
AMERICAN FREE PRESS and a few independent newspapers strongly opposed this needless war .
So what JINSA is saying is that those independent media voices — such as AMERICAN FREE PRESS — that opposed the drive for war should ultimately face military violence if they oppose the Jewish lobby ’s future military aims .
One analyst , University of Pennsylvania Prof. Edward Herman , has described JINSA as “ organized and [ run ] by individuals closely tied to the Israeli lobby and can be regarded as a virtual agency of the Israeli government . ”
JINSA was founded in the mid-1980s by Stephen Bryen .
He , along with several of his close associates — including future George W. Bush administration officials Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith — was investigated by the FBI on charges of spying for Israel at various times .
JINSA has worked to forge alliances between the Jewish lobby and former American military officials , treating them to international junkets and a variety of business and other financial bonanzas provided by Israeli sympathizers in America and around the globe in return for support for their blatantly pro-Israel policies .
Peters — whose pro-Israel articles are published regularly in The New York Post , owned by pro-Zionist billionaire Rupert Murdoch — is just one of those whose views on the military appeared in JINSA ’s journal .
A recurring theme in the essays emphasized the need for the United States to coordinate its international ventures with its “ allies , ” that is , Israel .
The essays underscore the idea that it is vital for the United States to engage in covert action to bring down regimes that stand in the way of Israel ’s agenda .
Written in “ code , ” so to speak , the essays carry the theme that Israel ’s interests are those of America and vice - versa and that those who oppose Israel are “ anti-American , ” and that includes American military officers .
An essay by one Patrick Poole alleges that the distinguished Strategic Studies Institute at the U.S. Army War
JINSA ’s propagandist claims the War College “ is only representative of a larger rot in the U.S. military ’s halls of higher learning . . . [ that ] apparently runs through all levels of our military senior service schools .
. . . ”
The author of these attacks on American military leaders who refuse to pander to the Jewish lobby , Patrick Poole , is a ubiquitous Internet presence , writing pro-Israel screeds for Frontpagemag.com , the website of ex-communist - turned - neoconservative pro-Israel publicist David Horowitz .
The record shows that increasing numbers of American military figures , and a host of ex-diplomats , intelligence officers and others are publicly challenging the Jewish lobby .
They include Adm . “ Fox ” Fallon , former ambassadors Charles Freeman and Richard Peck , ex-CIA officers Michael Scheuer and Ray McGovern as well as top academics such as Dr. John Mearsheimer and Dr. Stephen Walt .
And former President Jimmy Carter as well .
It is thus no surprise that influential Jewish voices , such as Forward , published in Manhattan , complain there is opposition to Israel within higher circles , a point that surprises many Americans who believe Israel has a firm stranglehold on the American intelligence , diplomatic and law enforcement apparatus .
On May 11 , 2005 , Forward reported that Barry Jacobs of the Washington office of the American Jewish Committee said there were high - ranking officials in the U.S. intelligence community who were hostile to Israel and unreceptive to pro-Israel lobbyists .
Citing the then - ongoing FBI investigation of espionage by officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , Forward noted that this top Jewish leader believed , in Forward ’s summary , that “ the notion that American Jews and Pentagon neo - conservatives conspired to push the United States into war against Iraq , and possibly also against Iran , is pervasive in Washington ’s intelligence community . ”
Although the Justice Department recently dropped its case against the AIPAC duo , the FBI investigators remained confident that their criminal case against the intriguers would have resulted in a conviction .
It has been a long - standing concern of JINSA that many in the military are tired of fighting wars for Israel .
In the fall of 2006 , JINSA ’s journal suggested that a full - fledged witch - hunt was in order , designed to root out critics of Israel at high levels , implying that Israel ’s critics were allied to “ jihadist ” fundamentalist Muslims .
JINSA asked :
How deeply have jihadist elements infiltrated the U.S. government and federal agencies , including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Department of Homeland Security , the Department of Defense , and various military commands , either through sympathizers or via actual operatives ?
Since there are few Muslims in the FBI , Homeland Security , the Department of Defense etc , the suggestion that “ jihadist ” elements have “ infiltrated ” our government might seem silly to the average American .
But JINSA — determined to enforce Israel ’s demands on American foreign policy and military might — is concerned that there are growing numbers in the military , the FBI and the CIA who are opposed to wars for Israel — and this , in JINSA ’s view , constitutes collaboration with the dreaded “ jihadists . ”

Sprites are rare and fleeting events , lasting between just 10 and 100 milliseconds ( Image : Steven A Cummer , Duke University )
Mysterious flashes of light called “ sprites ” , that occur above thunderclouds during powerful storms , have been captured on film in unprecedented detail by researchers using an ultra - high - speed camera .
The best images yet of the flashes – which resemble a giant undulating jellyfish with its tentacles falling from a halo of light – have allowed the team to pick apart their structure and mechanics .
Sprites are fleeting events , which normally last between 10 and 100 milliseconds .
The researchers hope their results will help inform models of the chemical and physical nature of the flashes .

In summer 2005 , researchers from Duke University , US , and collaborators from FMA Research in Fort Collins , Colorado , US , kept a watchful eye on the skies above the Great Plains from the Yucca Ridge Field Station in Fort Collins , hoping to capture sprites in action using their 7000 - frames - per- second camera .
And capture it they did .
Previously , the best published sprite images were recorded at 1000 frames per second .
Lightning streamers
“ The whole structure develops a lot in one millisecond .
So by going with the faster video we really see all the pieces and how they develop in time , ” says Steven Cummer , assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke ’s Pratt School of Engineering .
And with so much energy being pumped into a small region , Cummer says sprites may drive atmospheric chemistry that does not normally occur .
“ The significance at this point lies in what chemical effects these [ sprites ] may have on the upper atmosphere , ” Cummer told New Scientist .
The researchers say sprites typically begin at an altitude of about 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) in the sky in single spots where the electric field creates a spark .
Those produce falling “ streamers ” that branch out as they fall .
Much brighter , thicker channels follow , expanding upward from the original spots .
Natural beauty
Based on the new images , the team says “ isolated dots ” that glow intensely and often outlast the rest of the sprite are the result of a collision of streamers .
Cummer says such collisions may account for as many as half of the observed dots .
In July and August 2005 , the group imaged 66 sprite events above Kansas and Nebraska .
They captured their clearest images on 13 August , their final day of observations .
Their findings from that event are to be posted in the online version of Geophysical Research Letters on 22 February .
“ When a sprite is captured on film , it ’s extremely exciting , ” says Nicolas Jaugey , a member of Cummer ’s team .
“ You just see a flash on the TV screen , but when you retrieve the recording from the high - speed camera and see its development , it ’s very beautiful . ”
