Votorola was an experimental technology for the public guidance of electoral systems , exec­u­tive of­fices , legis­latures , and other decision sys­tems .
Unique­ly it combined the de­vices of re­combin­ant text , trans­i­tive voting , and vote pipes to build a max­imum of person­al freedom into its facil­i­ties .
The main facil­i­ties were tree - form , de­cision guide­ways .
Voto­rol­a deployed the leaf­ward edges of these in sup­port of the pub­lic sphere where they pro­vided a pur­pose and out­let for ration­al dis­course .
The op­posite trunks it aimed at de­cision sys­tems that are sensi­tive to form­al con­sensus .
It tar­geted each of the ma­jor types of de­cision sys­tem in so­ciety ( white ) with a special guideway design ( green ) , enabling the hidden complexity of political decision making to be exposed to the scrutiny of rational discourse :

For each decision that is scrutin­ized , how­ever , the first demand of reason will always be the question , Why ?

Denver , Colorado ( CNN ) --
Driving down Broadway , it 's easy to forget you are in the United States .
Amid the antique stores , bars and fast - food joints occupying nearly every block are some of Denver 's newest businesses : medical marijuana dispensaries .
The locals call this thoroughfare " Broadsterdam . "
As in Amsterdam , Netherlands , these businesses openly advertise their wares , often with signs depicting large green marijuana leaves .
" The American capitalist system is working , " said attorney and medical marijuana advocate Rob Corry .
It 's a matter of supply and demand .
" The demand has always been there , " he said , " and the demand is growing daily because more doctors are willing to do this , and now businesses , entrepreneurs , mom-and - pop shops are cropping up to create a supply . "
Colorado voters legalized medical marijuana in 2000 .
For years , patients could get small amounts from " caregivers , " the term for growers and dispensers who could each supply only five patients .
In 2007 , a court lifted that limit and business boomed .
Between 2000 and 2008 , the state issued about 2,000 medical marijuana cards to patients .
That number has grown to more than 60,000 in the last year .
State Sen. Chris Romer , a Democrat whose south Denver district includes Broadsterdam , said the state receives more than 900 applications a day .
" It 's growing so fast , it 's like the old Wild West , " Romer said .
" This reminds me of 1899 in Cripple Creek , Colorado , when somebody struck gold .
Every 49er in the country is making it for Denver to open a medical marijuana dispensary . "
They 're calling it the Green Rush .
Corry , who has represented defendants in medical marijuana cases for years , is taking a different role :
He has formed the Colorado Wellness Association , a trade group representing medical marijuana growers and providers .
" We want to be the Better Business Bureau of marijuana , " he said .
On the 28th floor of a downtown building with a great view of the Rocky Mountains , Corry 's office is adorned with vintage posters .
One reads " Marihuana : Assassin of Youth ! "
In the corner sits a plastic 6 - foot marijuana plant .
It 's a prop from the TV show " Weeds , " about a suburbanite mother who begins selling marijuana to make extra cash , Corry said .
The lagging economy has created an opening for medical marijuana , Corry said .
As governments struggle for new sources of revenue , the prospect of taxing medical marijuana can be enticing .
The dispensaries are " paying taxes , hiring employees , renting out space , purchasing supplies and moving this economy along , " he said .
" Local governments need to get on the bandwagon and start realizing this is a major source of revenue and it can help us cure our bankrupt governments . "
The association aims to get a larger supply of marijuana into the dispensaries and make sure it is safe , Corry said .

" What we 're looking at is quality control , " he said .
" We have the technology to make sure there 's no harmful toxins , pesticides . "
Bob Winnicki is a 35 - year - old analyst and co-owner of Full Spectrum Laboratories , which the wellness association uses for testing .
" We 're trying to get away from smelling , texture , color " as a measure of quality cannabis , he said , adding that he prefers " hard analytical data . "
Wearing a dress shirt and tie under a white lab coat , Winnicki opens envelopes with samples of marijuana dropped off by growers and dispensers .
He puts the marijuana into test tubes and mixes it with a solution to create a greenish liquid .
The test tube goes into a machine that performs a chemical analysis .
The active ingredient in marijuana is tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC .
But Winnicki said it 's other , less understood components that may provide much of the claimed medicinal benefits .
Winnicki is not a marijuana user , he said .
In July , he took a break from medical school to start the lab because he loves " the science " behind medical marijuana and thinks the market is wide open , he said .
" There 's a lot of money to be had in it , and there 's a lot of jobs and growth that can come out of it , " he said .
Across the city , entrepreneurs are trying to get in on the Green Rush .
In a northwest Denver neighborhood , Aaron Randle is tending to his new shop , Sunnyside Alternative Medicine .
He opened in September and said he has about 100 customers so far .
Read about a mother and son who grow marijuana
" I 've been an electrician for eight years and before that I had a cable contracting company .
It 's always been a dream to work for myself , " he said .
" I 'm very passionate about marijuana . "
Customers drop by his modest storefront operation and take a seat in a small waiting room .
It 's no different than a dentist 's office except the magazine rack is stuffed with High Times , a publication for marijuana buffs , instead of Sports Illustrated and parenting magazines .
One at a time , customers survey a display case full of marijuana strains as well as marijuana - infused brownies , taffy and lollipops .
Maui Waui and Purple Kush are popular strains .
It costs $ 50 for an eighth of an ounce , $ 54 with tax .
Purchases go into a plastic prescription bottle and then into a white bag that reads , " Prescriptions .
Thank You ! "
Randle proudly displays his business license on the wall .
" There 's a lot of jobs created because of medical marijuana , " he said .
" You have employees that work at the dispensaries , then you have vendors that are getting paid .
...
Real estate is booming right now .
Warehouses are getting rented out for grow operations . "
What Randle calls " vendors " are marijuana growers , a mix of people who operate " grow houses , " where the plants are cultivated using elaborate lighting systems , or small - scale farmers who operate in rural areas .
Zack Moore is a grower with a small greenhouse operation in southern Colorado .
He also is a medical marijuana patient .
A snowboarding accident knocked out his two front teeth , and he smokes marijuana for relief from various aches and pains , he said .
He rolls a joint and lights up before having a seat in a rocking chair in the afternoon sun .
With a basket of marijuana in front of him , he uses toenail scissors to trim the dried plants .
When he 's done , he will have made about $ 6,000 for six months work , he said .
Though he hopes to do better next season , he 's happy to be working .
" I build houses for a living .
There 's not many houses to be built right now . "
Not everyone is happy with the changes the legalization of medical marijuana has brought to the state .
Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said the amendment to the state constitution that allowed the new businesses is flawed .
" Colorado has seen a rapid proliferation of medical marijuana dispensaries and patients since the Justice Department earlier this year announced it would not actively prosecute medical marijuana businesses -- despite the fact that marijuana remains an illegal drug under federal law , " he said in an October statement .
" Amendment 20 , written by marijuana - legalization proponents , is very vague .
Our state lawmakers must give clarification to Amendment 20 and create a regulatory scheme for the growing medical marijuana industry . "
State Sen. Romer concurs .
" Right now it 's easier to get a medical marijuana license than it is to get a liquor license , " he said .
Currently , patients need to see a doctor only one time to get a recommendation that enables them to buy medical marijuana .
Patients can choose to pay $ 90 to file with the state and receive a card identifying them as medical marijuana patients .
The cards do not expire .
To become a provider or grower of medical marijuana , entrepreneurs need to have a patient name them as a caregiver when they file for a medical marijuana card .
Romer said he does n't want to limit legitimately sick people 's access to medical marijuana , but he does n't want to see the state law turned into de facto legalization of marijuana .
" Amendment 20 never dealt with where you got the medical marijuana , " he said .
" We 're going to license the growers and we 're going to license the caregivers . "
Romer wants to keep marijuana out of the hands of teenagers and hopes to channel some of the revenues into programs to treat substance abuse .
One of the most difficult aspects for lawmakers is how to define true medical need .
Romer is keeping an open mind .
" I think you 're having a lot of baby boomers who , all of us , are feeling a lot of aches and pains [ and ] are going to decide to try medical marijuana , " he said .
" I personally have n't tried it yet , but I 'm not saying someday before I 'm done I wo n't . "
In its endorsement of Democrat Bill Owens today , the Watertown Daily Times said that over the course of yesterday Dede Scozzafava , the regular GOP nominee who bowed out yesterday , “ began to quietly and thoughtfully encourage her supporters to vote for Democrat William L. Owens . ”
The Times itself did n’t leave much room for doubt about its views .
The strongest line : “ It is frightening that Mr. Hoffman is so beholden to right - wing ideologues who dismiss Northern New Yorkers as parochial when people here simply want to know how Mr. Hoffman will protect their interests in Washington . ”
This is a reference to an incident we noted a few weeks ago when Hoffman showed up to a meeting with the paper ’s editorial board with former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and then got defensive and abrupt when he was n’t able to answer questions about the district or the issues that faced it .
Armey stepped in and chastised the editors for focusing on “ parochial ” issues .
Late Update :
As you can see in our feature story , this afternoon Scozzafava removed all doubt and formally endorsed Owens .
Low - T Syndrome : Another Word for Male Menopause Low - T syndrome is real , say some , but others argue its only a marketing scam .
Aug. 10 , 2009  --
By the time Dan hit 57 , he did n't recognize himself .
He was always tired , fell asleep after dinner and was angry all the time .
" My libido was less and I was beginning to have a loss of erection while having sex , but I thought that was part of the normal aging process , " said Dan , who did not want his real name to be used .
" I had just changed doctors and he asked me , ' Are you more grumpy and less interested in things like sex ? ' "
Dan , now a 60 - year - old California counselor , said .
" Yeah , I am more grumpy , get less enjoyment out of life and certainly am having less sexual activity with my wife of 40 years , " Dan answered .
" I had excellent health all my life and he said there was a name for it -- male menopause . "
The doctor ordered a series of blood tests and found Dan had low levels of testosterone .
" My levels were in the basement , " he said .
Dan , according to his doctor , has andropause , what is now euphemistically being called low - T syndrome .
Television ads for low - T syndrome have cropped up on prime - time nightly news programs , joining direct - to - consumer drug ads for erectile dysfunction , or " ED , " as well as other aging ailments such as high cholesterol , enlarged prostates and dry eyes .
Andropause is a " term of convenience " in describing the complex symptoms in aging men with low testosterone levels , according to one study at the University of Toronto Department of Medicine .
Some studies show only 25 percent of all men with low testosterone levels ever experience symptoms such as Dan's , as well as bone loss and fracture , sleep disturbances and lethargy .
The very existence of andropause is contentious and large - scale studies on hormone treatment are only a decade old .
Many say the underlying cause of some men's complaints are part of the normal aging process .
Two Canadian studies cited by the National Institutes of Health illustrate the debate on low testosterone and its treatment .
Dr. Richard Casey , director of the Male Health Centers in Oakville , Ont. , argues that andropause is primarily market - driven , " largely promoted by industry , accepted by a handful of physicians and embraced by some patients who are looking for an antidote to aging . "
" We need to resist the marketing efforts and consider the science , " writes Casey .
" The range of normal testosterone levels is quite broad ; levels depend on time of day and no consensus exists on what measurement of testosterone correlates best with symptoms or treatment success . "
But Dr. Alvaro Morales of Queens University in Ontario supports the concept of " testosterone deficiency syndrome " ( TDS ) and advocates well - monitored therapy .
" The absurd view that TDS is an invention of industry blatantly and conveniently ignores medical observations and reports going back 500 years and accelerating since the mid 20th century , " writes Morales in his study .
" It does not merit further discussion . "
' Male Menopause Is Real '
" Male menopause is real , " said Jed Diamond , a psychologist and author of a series of books on the topic , including , " Irritable Male Syndrome . "
" I describe it as adolescence , the second time around , " he said .
" Everybody goes through it , just as no one can say I did n't go through puberty .
Some have a fairly easy time and , for some , it 's more difficult . "
Part of the normal part of aging , male menopause is accompanied by a gradual decline in their sexuality , mood and overall energy .
For most men , it arrives between the ages of 40 to 55 , but for some it happens as early as 35 and as late as 65 .
Not All Men Have Symptoms of Low Testosterone
" Men are more in denial about this than women , " said Diamond , who has a Ph.D. in international health and a master 's degree in social work .
" It 's taken guys a little longer for the medical evidence to come out and for doctors to find ways to treat this .
But more men are getting help . "
More men are also taking testosterone treatment in creams , gels or injections , Diamond said .
Dan began a holistic course of treatment that included testosterone shots and more exercise , better eating habits , herbal supplements , as well as a multivitamin and zinc .
" Those made a big difference , " he said .
" But exercise has been the most profound thing .
Without it , the other would n't work .
I do weights and yoga twice a week . "
After Treatment , Noticing Fewer Aches and Pains
" After a year , the injections worked , " Dan said .
" It 's not like I am doing physical feats that I was not doing before , but I was noticing a change when I would take groceries out of the car and move wood into the pile .
Before , I used to groan as I did it and had more aches and pains . "
Diamond , who runs the Men Alive Clinic in Willits , Calif. , said all men treat menopause differently .
Some are in denial and others treat it medically .
But male menopause is more complex than just increasing testosterone levels -- involving hormonal fluctuation , changes in brain chemistry , interpersonal and societal changes .
" The changes have to do not only with hormones , but also sex changes that have to do with relationships and self - esteem changes .
We evaluate all of these different areas , " he said , " We do n't just look at the test . "
Unlike women 's hormone replacement therapy , which uses estrogen from horses , doctors treat men with bio-identical testosterone , Diamond said .
" Biologically , it 's the same and it is n't as expensive and they can manufacture it in large quantities , " he said .
That 's why doctors say the pharmaceutical companies are pushing treatment for low - T syndrome on television .
Interestingly , direct - to - consumer advertising is only allowed in two countries in the world -- New Zealand and the United States .
" The drug companies want to figure out new ways of making money , " said Dr. Robert Butler , president of the International Longevity Center in New York City and author of the landmark book , " Human Aging . "
All men do not experience low testosterone levels , he said .
" Not everyone goes through a decline , though there is a small category of men in their 50s and 60s , but it 's a new market , " he said .
Men should be monitored while taking testosterone because it can cause problems for those with heart conditions or prostate cancer that is underway , Butler said .
" I do n't fault [ the drug companies ] for being good marketers , " he said .
" But I think the public should beware in terms of endangering themselves . "
But Dan said he has confidence in his doctor and , oddly , the regimen has had the least impact on his sex life .
" I do n't have to be fearful and anxious and I feel like I am equipped to meet whatever comes my way , " he said .
" When you are 18 to 20 , you think you are immortal .
At 30 and 40 , you think you have the world by the tail . "
" I began to lose that sense for no good reason , " Dan said .
" Now , I feel a psychological sense of completeness and robustness and maleness . "
What Should Egalitarians Want ?
I agree with Will Wilkinson that , considered in isolation , the pattern of income distribution in a society does n’t tell us much about whether that society is just or unjust .
Nevertheless , as an egalitarian , I think inequality in wealth and income , when considered in its causal context matters a lot .
Economic inequality is objectionable when it makes people , especially the less well - off , less well - off than they otherwise would be .
It is also objectionable when it reflects government favoritism toward the better - off .
In the United States , economic inequality is objectionable for both of these reasons .
There are several ways in which economic inequality undermines people ’s well - being .
( I do n’t claim that mere awareness that others are better off makes people worse off : I do n’t credit envy with a genuine grievance . )
For lack of space I ’ll set aside the intriguing evidence that economic inequality makes people ill , reduces life expectancy , increases stress and violence , and undermines social trust .
Here I ’ll argue that economic inequality ( 1 ) makes the less well - off vulnerable to domination , ( 2 ) makes them vulnerable to stigmatization , and ( 3 ) causes governments to favor the better - off at the expense of the worse - off .
Consider the problem of domination .
People ’s bargaining power is tied to their relative exit costs .
This often enables people with superior wealth to dominate others .
Women are more likely to submit to domestic abuse and control if the cost of leaving their partners is a drastic fall in material well - being .
Low - wage workers are often unable to bargain for predictable work hours because they ca n’t afford to quit .
This empowers employers to wreak havoc with workers ’ lives , as arbitrary changes to their work schedules leave them scrambling for ( often unavailable or very costly ) child care , or forced to withdraw from community college courses , turning their hard - earned tuition payments into a deadweight loss and crushing their dreams for a better life .
Such despotic control over workers ’ time can be humiliating .
At one Nabisco plant , female workers were forbidden to take time off the production line to use the restroom , and were told to wear diapers .
Economic inequality can also lead to stigmatization .
Adam Smith famously observed that , as the general level of consumption increases , so does the level of consumption needed by each individual to be able to appear in public without shame :
A linen shirt , for example , is , strictly speaking , not a necessary of life .
The Greeks and Romans lived , I suppose , very comfortably , though they had no linen .
But in the present times , through the greater part of Europe , a creditable day - labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt , the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty , which , it is presumed , no body can well fall into without extreme bad conduct .
The consumption of the better - off thereby raises the cost of living for the worse off .
The demands of respectable appearance can be crushing in regions where spiteful competition inflames a culture of conspicuous consumption .
In the 2008 documentary Kids +
Money , Lauren Greenfield depicts the competitive consumption among teenagers of all classes in Los Angeles , sometimes to the financial ruin of parents who are less well - off .
One single mother , desperate to see her daughter wear socially accepted clothes , could n’t pay her utility bills because she spent her income on a pricey t- shirt for her daughter .
Finally , economic inequality causes governments to make favorites of the better - off and neglect the interests of the worse - off .
A recent study by Larry Bartels finds that the preferences of low - income constituents have no influence at all on senators ’ votes , while the preferences of middle - income constituents have middling influence , and the views of high - income constituents had great influence .
( His findings apply to Democratic as well as Republican senators . )
How does catering to the preferences of the well - off harm the worse - off ?
In some cases , the state grants or extends monopoly privileges to the better off .
Consider the extension of copyright terms , dramatic consolidation of broadcasting ownership , and huge giveaways of public spectrum to existing broadcasters due to IP and communications laws passed in the 1990s .
In other cases , the state effectively exempts the well - off from laws that are supposed to protect the worse - off .
After discovering that Wal - Mart had violated child labor laws dozens of times , the Labor Department under President Bush agreed to give Wal - Mart 15 days notice before inspecting its stores for further violations , giving it time to hide its lawbreaking from authorities .
This is hardly an exception .
Many employers steal from their low - wage workers with impunity .
One recent study found that a quarter of low - wage workers were paid less than the minimum wage , most were denied meal breaks to which they were legally entitled , many were forced to work off the clock , not paid for overtime , suffered the theft of their tips , and illegally fined , among numerous other labor - law violations .
In still other cases , the state grants the better - off legal loopholes or vast subsidies at the expense of the worse - off .
Payday loans are largely exempt from usury laws .
For years , the federal government paid a 9.5 % interest rate to student loan companies , even though prevailing interest rates were much lower than this , and the government guaranteed the loans , obviating any rationale for a risk premium .
Even after Congress had enacted a law to end this absurd subsidy , the Bush administration failed to act on it .
That ’s billions of dollars to the wealthy at taxpayer expense .
Yet to focus on government subsidies and favors to wealthy rent - seekers offers a narrow view of the ways the better off use their superior wealth to skew government policy toward their interests , at the expense of the less well - off .
As economic inequality increases , the better off perceive fewer and fewer shared interests with the less well - off .
Because they buy many critical goods — health insurance , education , security services , transportation , recreation facilities — individually from the private sector , or pool the provision of these goods within private gated communities or municipalities governed by zoning regulations designed to exclude the less well - off , they tend to oppose public provision of these goods to the wider population .
At the same time , the ways they provide these goods for themselves raises the costs to the less well - off of obtaining them .
When the better - off vote down public transportation because they own their own cars , the less well - off must buy cars too .
When the better - off spend more on schooling , so too must the less well - off , to give their children a fighting chance to compete for better opportunities .
Since municipal zoning regulations create class - segregated cities , the less well - off must tax themselves more heavily to provide inferior public services to what their better off counterparts in other towns pay .
Wilkinson ’s evidence on consumption inequality fails to account for these facts , because he looks only at individuals ’ consumption of private goods , not their access to publicly provided goods .
Yet for the less well - off , consumption of the sorts of consumer goods that the market has — to its credit — so successfully delivered to all classes pales in importance to public and publicly provided goods .
To live in a low - crime , orderly , unpolluted neighborhood , free of run-down and abandoned property , graffiti - marred buildings , open drug dealing , prostitution , and gangs ; to have access to public parks where one ’s children can safely play , to well - maintained sidewalks and roads , to schools that offer an education good enough to qualify one for more than menial , dead - end jobs : how many cell phones and athletic shoes is that worth ?
Enjoying warranted confidence that the police will , if one is innocent of any crime , treat one with the respect one is due , rather than as a criminal suspect , and extend one the protections of the law rather than police harassment , accusation , and prosecutorial abuse : here there can be no question of comparison to consumer goods .
But access to these public goods depends on one ’s relative wealth .
As wealth inequality increases , such goods are less and less within reach of the less well - off .
Wilkinson says , “ There is overwhelming reason to believe that in the United States the deck really is stacked against some people .
As a consequence , many millions are doing much less well than they might be .
” I agree entirely with this judgment .
I also agree with Wilkinson that to deal with this , we must get the causal story right , and attack the root causes of injustice , rather than just the epiphenomena .
I suspect that we also agree that right causal story would identify state action ( or inaction ) as critical to stacking the deck .
But I suggest that economic inequality is also among the root causes of the stacked deck , because it motivates the affluent to skew state policy in their interests , at the expense of the less well - off .
As wealth inequality increases , the rich lose interest in state action to promote security , prosperity , and opportunity to all , and instead use their vast wealth advantage to buy access to government officials via campaign contributions , and to out - lobby more diffuse and less well - funded public interests .
They thereby acquire agenda - setting and veto powers over public policies , which they use to limit provision of public goods to the less advantaged , and to obtain special privileges for themselves — monopolies , subsidies to favored industries , and effective exemption from laws that are supposed to protect the less well - off from exploitation and domination by the better - off .
Economic inequality thereby harms the worse off , and reduces them to second - class citizens .
The pressures on Greece continue to increase and this is reflected in the credit default swaps and the interest rate spread over Germany .
Indeed , that is a key development in the euro zone over the past month , Greece yields have risen above Ireland , which had been the highest yield in EMU this year .
Ten year Greek yields are just below 5 % , while Ireland is near 4.75 % .
Greece fundamentals are poor .
It was lagged going into recession and may lag on the exit .
That lag may mean that the ECB may unwind some liquidity facilities before Greece is ready .
As we have noted previously , the new Greek government revealed a much larger deficit that the outgoing government ' fessed up to .
The budget deficit this year is near 12 % of GDP .
The current account deficit was around 14.5 % of last year and is fallen this year .
The monthly deficit is around 2 bln euros this year which is about a third smaller than the same period in 2008 .
The EU estimates that Greece 's public debt to GDP stood at almost 100 % last year and will rise to 135 % by the end of 2011 without dramatic action .
Some of the efforts the new government , which had campaigned on a platform to increase spending , to rein in spending , like freezing state worker pay at 2000 euros a month is meeting stiff resistance .
Greece has moved to shorter maturities to reduce its debt servicing costs , but this will " kick the can " down the street but only until Q2 next year , when Greece will have 18 bln euros coming due .
The new talk today suggests that senior Greek officials are meeting with several large Chinese lenders and a possibly a couple of large US banks to either buy Greek bonds in the secondary market or in a future placement .
Why should investors with no Greek exposure be interested in this story ?
First , as tensions on the periphery remain high , with Greece just the most acute example , it could influence the timing and magnitude of the ECB 's withdrawal of liquidity .
When the ECB first offered 1 year funding at a fixed rate of 1 % , we suggested that in that act of monetary policy lay a fiscal support program on ideas that some of the receivers of the funds would buy high yielding European bonds and interest rate differentials over Germany did narrow , lending credence to our argument .
One of the implications of the pressure in the region is that it may favor the ECB replacing 12 - month refi operations with a six month operation ( s ) .
Second , the pressure on Greece may spill over to other periphery members .
This is not suggest that Greece or another country will drop out of the euro zone , like " bets " www.intrade.com suggested the odd of a country dropping out of the euro zone by the end of 2010 was nearly 1 in 3 .
Those odds have fallen considerably .
The point is that the euro zone remains a great experiment of monetary union without political union .
This coupled with the fact that member countries do not control the euro printing press , like the US controls the dollar press and UK the sterling press , makes it harder to conceive of the euro eclipsing the dollar .
Thirdly , the pressures on Greece may illustrate that the opportunity for strains that were felt sharply during the crisis will not necessarily diminish during the recovery .
Inside the euro zone , few countries can compete with German and its ability to resist upward pressure on unit labor costs .
Outside of the euro zone , many key trading partners , like the UK , have experienced currency depreciations that adversely impact some euro zone members .
As someone who makes his living entirely by the pen , I approached the character of R Tranter in Sebastian Faulks 's new novel , A Week in
December , with great interest and not a little envy - the envy of the writer fetched up alongside someone working in the same field who is clearly doing a great deal better than he is .
Tranter , a score - settling fortysomething who lives alone in a seedy flat with a cat called Septimus Harding , is , for example , allowed to write simultaneously for two Sunday newspapers ( a privilege that no self - respecting literary editor would ever dream of conceding ) .
He is , in addition , supposed to make £ 30,000 a year simply by reviewing books .
And then , during the novel 's finale , in an act of munificence that would have had the Cheerybles in Nicholas Nickleby shaking their heads , his chief editorial sponsor hands him a contract worth £ 25,000 a year with the proviso that " you can only write about the 19th century " .
It is that final caveat which establishes Tranter 's unreality for all time .
No book reviewer in England gets that kind of money , in those conditions , not even Professor John Carey , the Sunday Times books section 's principal ornament these past 30 years and more .
There is no one like him in modern Grub Street , and probably never was .
Interestingly , the people who come closest to him , in habit , inclination and routine , are literary models such as Jasper Milvain , the thrusting young careerist of Gissing 's New Grub Street ( 1891 ) , or the anonymous drudge of Orwell 's " Confessions of a Book Reviewer " ( 1946 ) , settling down to appraise five fat and miscellaneous tomes , one of which is called Tribal Customs in Portuguese East Africa , in 800 words , while a pneumatic drill rumbles in the street and the staircase echoes to the boots of his creditors .
And yet , in putting Tranter , with his hulking resentments and his shady backstage intrigues ( and also , it should be pointed out , his thoroughgoing knowledge of contemporary writing ) , busily at work amid the pages of a sup­posedly realist novel , Faulks is also gesturing , with a certain amount of grudging respect , at one of English literature 's most pervasive archetypes - the Man of Letters .
By chance , 2009 marks the 40th anniversary of possibly the most brilliant piece of literary - cum - social criticism I have ever read : John Gross 's The Rise and Fall of the Man of Letters .
Gross 's chief area of concern is the literary culture of about 1800 to 1950 - from the rise of the Quarterly reviewers , say , to F R Leavis and Scrutiny - but the epilogue takes the story up to the era of the Angry Young Men , Marshall McLuhan and the global village .
As for the thing itself , Gross never offers an exact definition .
His Man of Letters can range from a simple " bookman " , snug in his study with 3,000 novels for company , to the kind of highbrow critic whose followers invest his cult with well - nigh religious significance , or the moonlighting MP who sees literature as a kind of default setting for his political schemes .
What unites them is a passion for books , a fixation with the culture in which books get produced and evaluated , and an assumption that , as Gross puts it in his final sentence , " the idea of the man of letters has a place in any healthy literary tradition " .
This and the fact that , with one or two trend - defying exceptions , men of letters are as extinct as the passenger pigeon .
What had done for the Man of Letters in the 120 years since Carlyle - no less - included him in the ceremonial pantheon of On Heroes , Hero - Worship and the Heroic in History ?
Gross , with his keen eye for the cultural cross-currents of the immediately postwar era , has several explanations , ranging from literature 's general retreat before a tide of newfangled mass entertainment to the whole McLuhan - esque take on popular culture and its " more aggressive counterattack on traditional literary standards in the name of the media " .
There is also - and as an ex-don come to rest in Grub Street , Gross is notably shrewd about this - the rise of " English studies " as a university discipline , the professionalising of " criticism " , and the assumption that book reviewing in newspapers is an amateur sideshow compared to the more rigorous instruction going on in college lecture halls .
All this is true , and most of the phenomena Gross identifies have simply calcified in the intervening 40 years .
And yet one of the real reasons for the near - extinction of Gissing 's and Orwell 's ( and before them Carlyle 's and Thackeray 's ) " literary men " is much more straightforwardly economic .
It is not just that , here in the early 21st century , the once - homogeneous entity known as " literary culture " has become horribly dispersed , blown out into cyberspace and colonised by bloggers and self - appointed savants who think their opinion of a book is just as good as the Sunday Times's .
It is merely that , with one or two very singular exceptions , it is impossible to make a living out of reviewing any more .
In strict fiscal terms , the money available for the kind of low - level literary jobs relished by R Tranter has not kept pace with inflation .
In the early 1900s , Hugh Walpole was paid three guineas for his weekly novel round - up for the Daily Telegraph - not far off the average clerical wage , and substantially more than the rent on his Celsea bedsit .
Thirty years later , Evelyn Waugh reckoned to make £ 5 out of a morning 's work writing a Spectator book review , which may not sound a great deal , but my father , then starting his career at the Norwich Union Insurance Company , was earning £ 45 a year .
( These days the Spec pays £ 200 - not bad , but you can't live off it . )
Not only was the pay better , but the volume of publications available to print one 's work was greater .
There were half a dozen London evening newspapers in the 1930s : as Alec Waugh , Evelyn Waugh 's elder brother , recalled , a short story had to be very bad , or very good ( that is , hopelessly highbrow ) , not to find a home .
Seventy years later , the only reliable market for short fiction in the UK is the Sunday Times Magazine or BBC Radio 4 .
The only time in recent years when it was possible to make a decent income from the old - style literary life was that brief Indian summer of the late 1980s and early 1990s .
In the wake of Murdoch 's trouncing of the print unions , newspapers suddenly grew bigger , sprouted arts supplements , pined for new talent and paid over the odds for it .
A real top - notcher who cultivated his contacts , took on any work offered him , and reviewed for one daily newspaper , one Sunday and any weekly magazine that would have him might have earned £ 20,000 a year 20 years ago , but he ( or she ) could n't do it now .
Rates have been slashed ; contracts are frowned on by vigilant managing editors ; books pages struggle to retain their identity amid the annual encroachments of film and music .
Meanwhile , the prestige commissions that writers habitually take on to keep their names before the public grow ever less viable .
Now , a 2,000 - word piece for the Times Literary Supplement , the country 's leading literary journal , pays £ 200 - even though it takes a couple of days to write and finesse .
Agreeable pin money if one is a media don , but not if you are trying , as I am , to feed , clothe and educate three growing boys while trying to write a novel that , as Orwell once put it , will knock Proust into a cocked hat .
No doubt the professional literary man , who roams through the pages of Thackeray 's Pendennis ( 1848 -50 ) , who hangs around the margins of Anthony Powell 's Books Do Furnish a Room ( 1971 ) and whose handful of modern epigoni can still be seen clinging to a rock face that each year slips a little further into the sea , had his drawbacks .
Like Tranter , a failed novelist and lower - middle - class ingrate , he could be consumed by spite in the presence of better - placed contemporaries .
Like many of Gross 's Victorian critics , he could sometimes forget that books , like anything else , are there to illuminate life , not to block it from view .
On the other hand , he did have two inestimable advantages .
One was that he was not an academic ( Gross has some choice remarks about the " basic antagonism " that exists " between the very nature of a university and the very spirit of literature " ) .
The other was that , however crude or ready - made his judgements , he tended to operate by a series of standards arrived at through long years at the coalface and an instinct for establishing whether a book was any good or not .
Even today , wanting an opinion on a newly published novel , and forced to choose between a newspaper critique , an internet book blog or Professor X of the University of Neasden loftily descending from Olympus to pronounce a few oblique compliments in the London Review of Books , I would always go for the man ( or woman ) in the newspaper , on the grounds that he ( or she ) is likely to have a better idea of what the book is about and tell me whether I want to read it .
Like the polar bear on his Arctic floe , uneasily conscious of the cracking ice and the rising tides that seethe about him , the Man of Letters ' frail descendant needs all the help he can get .
It was he who helped to create " literary culture " in the first place ; in his absence , literary culture will never be the same again .

Tom Judson 's Abstract Algebra : Theory and Applications is an open source textbook designed to teach the principles and theory of abstract algebra to college juniors and seniors in a rigorous manner .
Its strengths include a wide range of exercises , both computational and theoretical , plus many nontrivial applications .
Rob Beezer has contributed complementary material using the open source system , Sage .
The first half of the book presents group theory , through the Sylow theorems , with enough material for a semester - long course .
The second - half is suitable for a second semester and presents rings , integral domains , Boolean algebras , vector spaces , and fields , concluding with Galois Theory .
This textbook has more freedom than most ( but see some exceptions ) .
First , there is no cost to acquire this text , and you are under no obligation whatsoever to compensate or donate to the author or publisher .
So in this most basic sense , it is a free textbook .
Therefore you can also make as many copies as you like , ensuring that the book will never go out - of - print .
You may modify copies of the book for your own use - for example , you may wish to change to a prefered notation for certain objects or add a few new sections .
There is a copyright on the book , and subsequently it is licensed with a GNU Free Documentation License ( GFDL ) .
It is this combination that allows the author to give you greater freedoms in how you use the text , thus liberating it from some of the antiquated notions of copyright that apply to books in physical form .
The main caveat is that if you make modifications and then distribute a modified version , you are required to again apply the GFDL license to the result so that others may benefit from your modifications .
( CNN ) -- Lavinia Masters was 13 .
She winced as the doctor swabbed her vagina for possible evidence .
She watched as he put her underwear and purple nightgown into plastic bags , careful not to disturb any fibers or hairs .
Lavinia Masters was raped by a stranger in her Texas home when she was 13 .
It was a hot July night in 1985 , and the Texas sixth - grader had been sexually assaulted by an unknown suspect .
This process -- collecting evidence for a rape kit -- lasted several hours and was " devastating . "
But just as difficult , says Masters , was the 20 - year wait for that evidence to yield results .
Her rape kit sat idle until 2005 , when the Dallas Police Department re-opened her case , as part of a new initiative to solve old crimes .
DNA testing had not been available when Masters was assaulted .
But in 2005 , police said they discovered the DNA in her kit matched DNA samples from a man who was already serving time in prison for unrelated crimes , including sexual assault .
But the suspect could not be prosecuted in Masters ' case because the statute of limitations had run out .
CNN usually does not identify victims of sexual assaults .
But Masters , now 38 , decided to let her name be known to shed light on the issue of backlogged rape kits .
Government officials say many police departments and crime labs across the country are inadequately funded and overwhelmed , leaving many rape kits untested .
Rape victims ' advocates say leaving the kits untested suggests law enforcement agencies are n't prioritizing rape cases .
In Los Angeles , California , 7,495 untested rape kits were in the police department 's system in October 2008 , the department said .
The rape kits may have the critical DNA that could lead to the arrest of offenders , exonerate those wrongly convicted and end the agonizing uncertainty for rape victims .
What 's in a rape kit ? »
Today , Masters and other rape survivors are pushing for police to process rape kits more rapidly and to test unopened rape kits that have accumulated over decades .
They know what it feels like to have justice delayed .
" Having to wait is like pouring salt on the wound , " Masters said .
" To have DNA technology at our disposal is awesome , but we have to take advantage of it . "
This week , DNA testing led local police and the FBI to a suspect in a 19 - year - old rape case .
Dennis Earl Bradford , a 40 - year - old welder , was arrested in connection with the rape and attempted murder of Jennifer Schuett , 27 , of Dickinson , Texas .
Exactly how many rape kits remain untested nationwide is unknown .
No agency tracks those numbers , nor are there uniform national standards for testing or tracking the kits .
Some jurisdictions , such as New York City , require every kit to be tested .
Others do not .
From 2002 to 2005 , the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported the number of backlogged crime cases jumped 24 percent to 359,000 cases .
That figure includes rape cases , but the report does not break down the crimes by type .
The Los Angeles Police Department drew criticism last year over its backlog .
By September , the LAPD reported the backlog had dropped to 2,937 due to an influx of federal grant money and the efforts of its DNA Task Force .
The tested rape kits resulted in 405 suspect hits , according to law enforcement officials .
" There is n't anything about Los Angeles that is anomalous from any other major police jurisdiction , " said Sarah Tofte , a researcher at Human Rights Watch .
In May , an analysis by the Chicago Tribune found more than 1,000 backlogged DNA cases in Illinois .
The paper said nearly half of those were untested samples from rape kits .
And last month in Houston , Texas , about 1,000 rape kits remained untested in labs , said Kese Smith , a spokesman for Houston Police Department .
" We 're in much better shape than we have been in past years , but obviously , we do n't think 1,000 is acceptable , " Smith said .
Some agencies consider kits untested for more than 30 days to be backlogged .
In some cases , rape kits have been tested too late , when the statute of limitations has already expired .
In recent years , the passage of state and federal laws requiring that DNA samples be taken from anyone who is arrested , not just convicted felons , have added to the backlog , critics say .
At least 21 states have enacted such laws , according to DNA Saves , a nonprofit that pushes for broader DNA collection policies .
Top priority for testing involves cases in which a likely suspect has been identified or those that involve murder or children .
Incidences involving a victim who is attacked by a stranger are usually given the next priority .
Often kits from cases involving an acquaintance or spouse -- where the " he - said - she - said " dilemma arises -- are n't tested all .
Law enforcement agencies point out some women are n't willing to testify or do n't want their rape kits processed .
Officers in some communities say they are trying to be efficient when they process the rape kits , focusing first on those that can lead to a suspect or charges .
But advocates for rape victims urge women to be pro-active .
" The squeaky wheel gets the oil , " says Kellie Greene , head of the advocacy group Speaking Out Against Rape Inc .
" If you call a lot , and ask for updates on your case , those are the cases that move forward . "
In New York City , where police started to process all rape kits after 2003 , arrests rates jumped from 30 to 70 percent , according to Human Rights Watch .
There is some hope that the backlogs will diminish .
The Los Angeles Police Department announced last month that $ 3 million would be dedicated to testing old rape kits .
The Houston Police Department received $ 1.3 million in federal grants this month to help expedite the rape testing process .
And in 2004 , Congress passed the Debbie Smith Act , providing more than a billion dollars to improve DNA testing procedures and reduce the backlog .
Debbie Smith waited more than six years for her 1989 rape case to be solved because of a DNA database backlog in Virginia .
These improvements come too late for Lavinia Masters .
She can not get back the 20 years she spent wondering about the man who raped her when she was 13 .
In 2007 , when her suspected attacker appeared for a parole hearing in an unrelated case in Texas , Masters gave phone testimony against his release .
He remains incarcerated but may appear before the parole board again in spring of 2010 .
Masters intends to be there .

Unconstitutional ' Bill of Attainder ' to be legally challenged , but was it also an example of class warfare ?
Ernest A. Canning Byon
11/16/2009 , 9:35 am PT
Guest blogged by Ernest A. Canning
On Nov. 12 , the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court alleging that separate House and Senate Resolutions to bar all funds to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) were unconstitutional Bills of Attainder , which violated ACORN's Fifth Amendment right to due process of law and First Amendment right to freedom of association .
( See Rachel Maddow 's excellent coverage and explanation of a " Bill of Attainder " here . )
The CCR suit " seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent the government from reallocating funds designated for the organization and its affiliates and a preliminary injunction to stop Congress from singling out a single organization for punishment without proper investigation or due process . "
During his Nov. 13 appearance on Democracy Now , CCR Attorney Bill Quigley ( video below ) warned that if constitutionality of the legislation is not legally challenged , ACORN could be but the first of numerous groups seen as supportive of Democrats whose funding will be challenged , as that rightwing blogs are already looking to target the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) as well .
While the suit presents a significant legal challenge , and while there is little doubt that ACORN has been the victim of a GOP witch hunt which , as Brad Friedman and others have reported , included the " phony ' voter fraud ' charges " that were at the " heart of the U.S. Attorney purge scandal , " the willingness of so many Congressional Democrats to jump at the chance to punish ACORN via this Bill of Attainder may also entail something more subtly insidious ...
Appearing on Democracy Now in the wake of an 83 - to - 7 Senate vote to bar the group from receiving any federal funds from the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development , ACORN 's CEO , Bertha Lewis , revealed that the video , which depicted a handful of ACORN 's 700 employees giving advice to two rightwing activists dressed as a pimp and a prostitute , was but the latest in a series of Republican efforts to smear the organization , and that past efforts , such as other alleging voter fraud , failed " because all of those people ... were turned in by us . "
Lewis noted that the rightwing " sting " videos were presented out of context ; that the rightwing group engaged in the sting had not only been asked to leave several ACORN offices but that , in several instances , the police had to be called to force them to leave .
None of this was considered before Congress acted to bar funds to an entire organization for the inappropriate , if not particularly illegal , remarks of a few employees .
That 's because , despite an awareness of the Republican 's near continuous partisan assault on ACORN , Democrats in Congress did not bother to hold hearings before rushing to judgment .
By contrast , as Brad Friedman previously reported , citing Jeremy Scahill 's piece in The Nation , the top 100 government contractors , who made " nearly $ 300 billion from federal contracts in 2007 alone " paid some " $ 26 billion in fines to settle cases stemming from fraud , waste or abuse ; " KBR was not merely been charged with such abuse but with poisoning as many as 100,000 people , including U.S. troops , yet these same Democratic members of Congress who defunded ACORN have ignored a bill [ PDF ] offered by Rep. Betty McCollum ( D - MN ) which would prohibit " the Federal Government from awarding contracts , grants , or other agreements to , providing any other Federal funds to , or engaging in activities that promote certain corporations or companies guilty of certain felony convictions . "
( Note : Unlike the measures used to defund ACORN , McCullum 's bill would not amount to a " Bill of Attainder " because it does not single - out one group for punishment , but instead applies across - the - board to all corporations which are " convicted " of the specified felonies . )
So why the rush to judgment by Congressional Democrats ?
Was it a case of Democrats simply rolling over in the face of another rightwing onslaught ?
During the above - cited appearance on Democracy Now , Ms. Lewis explained what ACORN does besides voter registration :
We are the largest membership - based community organization of low - and moderate - income people of color , black and brown folks , in this country .
We have been around for forty years .
We ’ve saved thousands of homes .
We ’ve helped raise the wages of tens of thousands and now hundreds of thousands of people .
CCR 's fact sheet [ PDF ] notes that ACORN :
• Raised the minimum wage to a living wage in dozens of communities across the country ; • Fought predatory lending and to stop foreclosures .
Thus , while ACORN may help register millions of voters who predominantly vote for Democrats , ACORN also shields those same voters from the excesses carried out by the true constituency of the corporate sector of the Democratic Party --- banks , Wall Street , corporate America .
ACORN 's constituency has little in common with many of the members of Congress their registration drives have helped to elect .
As Jim Hightower observed in Thieves in High Places less than one percent of U.S. citizens are millionaires .
Nearly half the members of Congress elected in 2002 were millionaires .
As Hightower notes :
Congress 's real constituency is no longer you and me , but the people who ' matter . '
These are your ' top - floor corporate executives ... who have full - time lobbyists and who make $ 1,000 - and - higher campaign donations ... that grease the wheels of the incumbency .
They are the privileged few who know members by their first names , who get every one of their phone calls returned -- and who get their agendas adopted . "
A more recent study by the Center for Responsive Politics revealed that , at present , 237 members of Congress are millionaires .
In " Nader was Right : Liberals are Going Nowhere with Obama , " Chris Hedges observed at TruthDig :
It is the same old merry - go - round , only with Obama branding .
And if we have not learned by now that the system is broken , that as citizens we do not matter to our political elite , that we live in a corporate state where our welfare and our interests are irrelevant , we are in serious trouble .
We have experienced repeated examples --- the Wall Street bailout , an inadequate stimulus , health care legislation designed to extend more money and more power to the insurance cartel and pharmaceutical industries accompanied by the elimination of the " Kucinich Amendment " which would have permitted states and their citizens to adopt single - payer legislation if they so choose ; endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the benefit of the military - industrial complex , which now includes well - paid , allegedly murderous mercenaries like Blackwater / Xe .
While the desire to deflect criticism from the rightwing echo chamber helps to explain the occasions in which the Democratic leadership willingly abandons long - time allies , as occurred when candidate Obama threw Reverend Wright under the bus or when the President stood by silently in the face of the McCarthy - like assault on Van Jones , class as well as cowardice may help to explain the willingness of so many corporate Congressional Democrats to slam ACORN with an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder .
Their actions are consistent with what Noam Chomsky describes as an " elite consensus ; " as an extension of the class war that the wealthy in this nation have waged against working class Americans over the past forty years .

November 14 , 2009 -- Socialist Resistance --
The people on this platform share a lot of ideas .
We want a working - class party to the left of the Labour Party , with a socialist program that confronts the dual crises of the ecology and the economy , which the ruling class is struggling to contain
to the left of the Labour Party , with a socialist program that confronts the dual crises of the ecology and the economy , which the ruling class is struggling to contain
We want a party in which anti-capitalists are hegemonic , but not monolithic .
We have to be open to everyone who ’s for the class struggle , not just those with Marxist ideas
.
We have to be open to everyone who ’s for the class struggle , not just those with Marxist ideas
We want a party of struggle , based on the ground , that ’s developing a movement of resistance as well as an electoral campaign .
That ’s a lot of agreement .
It ’s meaningful .
It ’s new .
We like it .
But what ’s the next step ?
Where do we go from here ?
And in particular , some of us are in different places -- so that means different routes to the same destination .
Socialist Resistance has four ideas we want to share with you about our idea of the route to a new party .
1 . We need a party based on the struggle , not just a party for the election
In this crisis , the capitalists are starting a new offensive against social and democratic rights to increase the exploitation of labour and protect profits .
Western governments are making working people pay for the crisis : “ just as before , or almost and perhaps worse ” .
There ’s an employers ’ offensive in the workplace to protect profits , and that will impact the trade unions , but there ’s also a state offensive which hits women and the black communities hard .
So the bosses ’ talk of a recovery is starting to sound very contradictory when benefits and public services are cut , taxes are increased and the government starts fingering scapegoats : migrant workers and the black communities .
So we need a party that builds itself up from the grassroots , and on rebuilding a cultural of solidarity there .
The postal workers ’ strike was a great example of that .
Many postal workers were inspired , touched -- some even amazed by the solidarity they won .
But the active solidarity was a tiny part of what could have been -- the huge public support they have in their struggle against privatisation .
That illustrates something .
There ’s a space to the left of the Labour government .
And , as Labour moves right , that space looks huge .
The Scottish Socialist Party , Respect , the Socialist Labour Party , Plaid Cymru , the Greens , the new coalition of the Communist Party of Britain and the Socialist Party -- they are picking up those votes .
But many of those people to the left of social democracy are passive rather than active .
You see that internationally : former voters for social democrats are staying at home rather than holding their noses .
That passivity is dangerous , and the [ fascist ] British Nationalist Party also benefit from it .
There ’s something to be learnt about the way Respect came out of the mass movement against the war .
Respect recruited almost 6000 members , and without a mass movement it would have faced a much more challenging task .
Its achievements , both electorally and its roots in migrant communities , reflected the way that Respect seems to be the only party that spoke for working people against the war .
But what we will see after the next election is that the landscape will look a little different .
If there ’s a new party – or even a new coalition – it wo n’t start with a broader base unless it reaches out .
As this offensive builds up , people and organisations will have to decide whether and how far they go into struggle .
We need a party that not only give a voice to those people ’s concerns , but help make it easier for people to link up in struggle .
2. Start at the start , not at the end .
That space to the left of the Labour Party is filled with anger and struggle , but not with Marxist ideas .
We ’d love to see a united revolutionary Marxist organisation in Britain , but such an organisation would still be tiny compared to the much bigger opportunity , which is for a party that ’s to the left of Labour and which consistently stands with the struggle .
That party wo n’t start off calling itself communist .
You can even see from the New Anti-Capitalist Party ( NPA ) in France , which stands for the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism , that such a party may not end up calling itself communist .
But the proof of the pudding is in the eating .
Communism is the fight to abolish the capitalist system .
A real communist party is a real active movement against capitalism , not just a society for proselytising idealist utopias .
But the real movement is n’t a pile of tin cans , all neat and impermeable .
It ’s chaotic , contradictory and dynamic and the tasks of socialists are to learn and lead , not to preach .
So it ’s fruitless , for example , to demand or expect that a new party develops a political program that ’s more developed than the people it ’s based on .
The NPA is based on people with deep revolutionary and communist roots , so it ’s a revolutionary party .
And the left in France is clearly , actually , through daily practice , bisected between those on the soft left who want to participant in capitalism and the NPA which wants to abolish it .
In Britain , we have a much bigger opportunity because that division is n’t so clear to most people .
If you look at the program of Respect , or the People 's Charter , or the so - called left wing program of the CPB , they all raise exactly the sort of demands around which we can develop mass united action and build a new party .
We should aim to win the whole space to the left of social democracy , as the Left Bloc has done in Portugal , not just to organise the Marxists .
That ’s what we have the opportunity to build : a grassroots party which serves , organises and defends the working class both in the struggle and at the ballot box .
3 . The crucial struggle for a democratic party will require patience and tenacity
If you only want to get on the ballot paper , then you do n’t need a grassroots party .
You can see that with the SLP .
But there ’s a lot for the left to learn negatively from the SLP .
The SLP started with a huge set of advantages : Arthur Scargill , despite everything , was widely loved and revered for his role in the 1980s miners ' strike .
And you knew where you were with him , even if you did n’t revere him .
The Clause 4 struggle in the Labour Party also meant that a big part of the labour left was there for the picking .
But despite a lot of people joining , the SLP could not develop as a real party because everyone quickly learnt that only Scargill was allowed to influence things .
In particular , people coming out of the Labour Party and the trade unions knew what workers ’ democracy looked like , and can smell a stitch up a mile away .
What we learnt from the SLP , and got right in the Socialist Alliance , was that a transparent and democratic way of functioning was essential to integrating members and developing momentum
So , that said , why is that we ended up 10 years later with No2EU , which also lacked any real democratic structure ?
Honestly , we have to partly blame the Socialist Workers Party which used its numerical superiority to dominate organisations .
That almost killed Respect .
It made the Socialist Party and some others very anxious about the sort of grassroots , participatory democracy we need .
In No2EU , only the founders have a voice -- and each of them also had a veto on the others .
When every vote needs to be unanimous , it ’s not surprise that democracy starts to look unworkable .
But , in fact , it ’s the lack of democracy that ’s unworkable .
And that gives us a special challenge .
A new party is probably not going to start off with perfect democracy .
It would be mistaken to refuse to join a real party because of that ; it would not help us in any way .
But it would be a crucial error to not argue for deeper and more real democracy in such a party .
That ’s essential to building a real party .
If the members make mistakes , then can learn .
But if the members cannot make decisions , then no - one can learn and the life of the party is suffocated .
4 . The needs of women , migrant workers and the black communities have to be central
The organised labour movement has little to say about what happens outside unionised workplaces .
Worldwide , the burden of the crisis falls mainly on women and migrants .
In Britain , we also see this amazing level of youth unemployment .
A new party has to stand up for the interests of those people .
Women are the first victims of the world recession .
According to the International Labour Organisation , 22 million women worldwide will lose their jobs in 2009 .
They are hit first by massive redundancies in the services , health and clothing industries .
There more pressures : dropping out from school , less work , poverty .
In the same way , the recession also produces authoritarian solutions .
Anti-immigrant policies gain strength .
There are massive movements of people , particularly from poor countries to rich ones because of globalisation and the growth of trade , the impoverishment of the global South by the powers of the global North , and ecological and food - related disasters .
The crisis worsens all the phenomena of exploitation and oppression of immigrants .
Racist movements make them scapegoats .
We have to advance a policy of defence of the rights of immigrants : not just self - defence , but also to defend their civil rights and cultural freedom .
Key to all of that is linking up all the attacks — by the state , the employers and the fascists – to the capitalist system they defend .

Advertisement A team of British scientists and engineers is developing plans for a spacecraft that could stop large asteroids from hitting the Earth .
The 10 - tonne " gravity tractor " would deflect any orbiting rocks years before any potential collision could happen .
The device , which would rely on the force of gravity , is being developed by Stevenage space company EADS Astrium .
However , the idea is still in its early stages and the company says a prototype is some way off from being built .
The tractor would steer asteroids away from the Earth The US space agency 's ( Nasa ) Near Earth Object programme reports on its website that it has recorded 1068 known " Potentially Hazardous Asteroids " , however there are thousands more estimated to be present in space .
Dr Ralph Cordey , who is EADS Astrium 's head of exploration and business , told BBC News that the concept of a gravity tug was actually first mooted by two Nasa astronauts , Edward Lu and Stanley Love , a few years ago .
He said : " Frankly , I thought it was crackers .
I thought it would never work . "
But he said after reconsidering the idea and focusing on specific engineering issues , including the size of the spacecraft , and long - term propulsion methods , it was considered by the team to be potentially feasible .
The tractor would intercept the asteroid from just 48 m away and exert a small gravitational force on it , pulling the rock towards it .
The pair would then embark on a slightly different orbit , away from the Earth .
It could possibly be powered using solar panels .

However , the device would have to be launched at least 15 years before any predicted collision and would need a team to monitor it from the ground during this time .
Dr Cordey said the company had worked with a number of space authorities on other methods of protecting the Earth from asteroids but this one would be able to target a wider range .
He said : " We have done quite a lot of design work on this with the European Space Agency and we believe this would work just as well on a big solid iron asteroid as well as other types . "
But the high cost implications mean that before the device could be made , it would have to be commissioned by a government or a group of governments working together .

Thus was the first shot fired in the Great McCain / Palin War of ’09 , my friends .
From Sarahcuda ’s book , a copy of which is now in the hands of the Associated Press :
She writes about the “ jaded aura ” of professional campaign aides and how McCain ’s entourage limited her access to the media , leading to allegations – unfounded , she says – that she was avoiding reporters .
And she says that most of her legal bills were generated defending what she called frivolous ethics complaints , but she reveals that about $ 500,000 was a bill she received to pay for the McCain campaign vetting her for the VP nod .
She said when she asked the McCain campaign if it would help her financially , she was told McCain ’s camp would have paid all the bills if he ’d won ; since he lost , the vetting legal bills were her responsibility .
I ’m always suspicious when the media attempts to state her position without quoting her , but assuming that ’s accurate , an unnamed McCain staffer will have you know that ( a ) the bills were n’t for vetting and ( b ) they could n’t have paid them if they wanted to .
“ That is one hundred percent untrue , ” said the McCain official , who would only speak on the condition of anonymity in deference to McCain .
“ All those bills are from her personal attorney Thomas Van Flein , mostly relating to the Troopergate investigation and other ethics investigations .
It is not legal to pay for those investigations out of general election funds , even if the campaign was so inclined . ”
Palin spokeswoman Meg Stapleton would not confirm the accuracy of the AP report .
“ The book remains embargoed , ” Stapleton said in an e-mail to CNN .
“ The Governor will appear on Oprah first to discuss the book ’s contents . ”
Election law is so labyrinthine that I ’m not even going to try to research this .
There ’ll be plenty of expert opinion about it on the wires tomorrow , no doubt , although election lawyers are welcome to send in tips if they have a take .
In the meantime , a question :
Why would n’t Team Maverick pick up the tab , assuming it was legal to do so ?
The RNC was willing to shell out six figures on wardrobe ; a few hundred thousand more to bail her out of a campaign - induced legal quagmire does n’t seem much to ask .
If anything , given the tensions between her and some of the campaign ’s staffers , you would think they ’d be eager to do whatever they could to make her happy after the election to minimize the risk of an ugly McCain vs. Palin / GOP in disarray storyline .
Follow the first link up top for more details from the book .
Turns out that , according to Nicolle Wallace , Katie Couric suffers from low self - esteem .
Heart - ache .
Update : Another shot fired .
This senior McCain campaign official says they considered the $ 500,000 bill from Palin ’s lawyer to be exorbitant — plus , even if they wanted to , they could n’t use their general - election funds to pay for it ( remember that McCain accepted some $ 84 million in federal funds for the general election ) .
“ Everyone thought it was ridiculous , ” the senior McCain official tells First Read .
Anyone not think the “ senior McCain official ” is Steve Schmidt ?
Update :
Here ’s why it ’s a bad idea to trust the AP .
The line in the blockquote above about how “ she reveals that about $ 500,000 was a bill ” has now been revised in subsequent versions of the story to read “ she reveals that about one - tenth of the $ 500,000 was a bill ” .
In other words , the vetting allegedly cost 50 grand , not 500 grand .
Which makes it even odder that the campaign did n’t pick up the tab — assuming it was legally entitled to do so .
Update : Sounds like we have a disagreement over what constitutes “ vetting . ”
It ’s not legal for general election matching funds to pay for pre-emptive legal defense ; the McCain campaign did not believe it was legal for GELAC funds — a separate account that paid for fundraising complaince — to pay for the investigations either .
But vetting is a poor word to choose .
The McCain campaign footed the bill for Art Culvahouse ’s investigation of Palin before she was elected .
Palin was urged by campaign lawyers to set up a legal defense fund to pay for the investigations and ethics complaints that had nothing to do with her presidential bid .
“ I can confirm that she was not billed for any vetting costs by the campaign , ” said Trevor Potter , the campaign ’s general counsel .
“ I do not know if she was billed by her own lawyer for his assistance to her in the vetting process , but from the excerpt that has been read to me by the AP , it sounds as if that is what she is describing . ”
Without a quote from the book itself , it ’s impossible to tell how much of a dispute there really is here .
Palin's God vs. Obama's God
November 27 , 2009
By Grant Swank Sarah Palin 's deity is the God of the Bible .
Her personal Savior is Jesus Christ .
Her holy writ is the infallible , inerrant Bible .
Her hope for eternity is heaven as described in the Word of God .
Her hope for the present is God 's will activated in her dedication .
Barack Hussein Obama 's deity is the god of the Koran  Allah .
His personal savior is Allah , though he professes to be a Protestant via his membership in the theologically liberal United Church of Christ ( Congregational / UCC ) .
That would make him out to be a witness to Jesus Christ ; of course , that is bogus , including his testimony that at an altar at Chicago 's Trinity UCC he discovered Christ .
If it was Christ , it is not the Christ of the New Testament .
Obama 's so - called holy writ is the abominable Koran .
His hope for eternity is unknown ; but if he becomes a suicide bomber for Allah , he will be guaranteed pronto a score of virgins for everlasting .
His hope for the present seems to be his reliance upon Islam 's Koran furthered by his clandestine support of Islam World Rule via czars and a shadow government given to overthrowing our Republic .
In January 2009 , Marxist Muslim 's Obama seemed to be riding high on mob hysteriacs seating him proudly in the Oval Office .
Recall he told the world , " I won . "
Countless devotees showed up at his inauguration .
He was applauded throughout Congressional halls as the new messiah promising " hope " and " change .
"
Not yet a year later , he has not produced productive " change " for America ; therefore , there is no grassroots " hope " in the Pied Piper who led millions into his lying machine .
Today he is below par in polls .
He has not accomplished anything worthwhile , per Saturday Night Live spoofs , for example .
Today he is on the verge of submerging America into the trenches due to his pro-Islamic policies installed by crooks and Muslim cronies surrounding him 24 / 7 .
He stalls on Fort Hood investigations .
He enforces the warmist religion by bowing down to Al Gore clones at global global warming sessions .
He cheers on 9/11 civil investigations , providing Allah disciples privileges not deserving self - confessed Muslim murderers .
Obama is being unsealed moment by moment so that even the young mob hysteriacs are starting to get the cruel message instigated by the chief betrayer set loose in America .
In short order he has plotted to ruin our health care system , dump us into the devil 's debt and bankrupt our Christian heritage by uplifting Muslims and atheists on the same honorary level as biblical believers .
This cancer sore Obama is the most dangerous occurrence ever in all the Republic 's history for it promises us our doom .
Then comes along Sarah Palin .
What does she hold out for the populace ?
She speaks of common sense politics , a Christian heritage history continuance , reliance upon the God of Scripture , actual hope in prayer and the Holy Spirit 's guidance in one 's personal faith life .
She comes from a biblical base regarding worship gatherings .
It is not theological liberalism as touted in the United Church of Christ , Episcopal Church , Anglican Church , United Church of Canada , Unitarianism , Evangelical ( a misnomer ) Lutheran Church of America and other anti-Christ labels .
She worships with Christians who seek to live out the Bible , confess to following Christ as personal Redeemer , pray daily , conduct family devotions , believe in miracles , repent of their sins and then yearn to go forth in holiness .
Palin is the antithesis to Obama .
Palin represents a biblical way of life .
Obama represents a satanic cult .
America is now faced with the choice of Palin or Obama .
Of course , in weeks and months to come , someone else may log in to sideline Palin .
But at the moment , it is Palin versus Obama .
To say that America is at a crucial fork in the road is to speak in understatement .

A United Nations committee has approved a Canadian - led resolution urging Iran to stop harassing political opponents in the wake of its disputed presidential elections .
The vote Friday in the General Assembly 's 192 - member human rights committee passed with 74 in favour , 48 against and 59 abstentions .
The resolution censured Iran for its human rights record , including the arbitrary arrests , detentions and the disappearance of Iranians who protested after the elections this year .
Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon welcomed the result and said it draws international attention to the political situation in Iran .
" The adoption of this resolution is another clear signal of the international community ’s concern for the human rights of people in Iran , " Cannon said in a statement .
" It sends a message of hope to the victims of violations and to the human rights defenders who seek to effect positive change in Iran . "
Iran dismisses resolution
Mohammad Khazaee , Iran 's UN ambassador , called the resolution " politically motivated " and dismissed the election claims as " entirely misleading and incorrect . "
Khazaee noted that the majority of the voters in the committee either voted against the resolution or abstained .
The resolution must now be approved at a plenary session of the 192 - member world body .
Canadian governments have tabled the draft resolution censuring Iran every year since the 2003 torture and murder of Iranian - Canadian journalist Zahra Kazemi .
The resolutions are largely symbolic and are not legally binding .
This year 's resolution was approved by a margin of 26 votes , an improvement over last year 's resolution , which passed by 16 votes .
The vote comes the same day representatives from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — the United States , Russia , China , France and the United Kingdom — and Germany are meeting in Brussels to discuss possible measures against Tehran for its refusal to halt nuclear enrichment activities .
Earlier this week , Iran rejected a UN - backed proposal for the country to send its uranium to be processed abroad .
Under this plan , Iran would export its uranium for enrichment in Russia and France , where it would be converted into fuel rods and returned about a year later .
The rods can power reactors but cannot readily be turned into weapons - grade material .
Iran 's refusal prompted U.S. President Barack Obama to discuss the possibility of imposing new sanctions against Iran .
An EU official said there was no mention during the Friday meeting of imposing sanctions against Iran for its refusal to halt nuclear enrichment activities .
The official said this was not the right time to raise the issue .
Representatives at the Brussels meeting said they would hold a follow - up session around Christmas .
The outgoing head of the UN 's nuclear watchdog appealed to Iran to accept the agreement , while advising Western countries during a news conference in Berlin on Friday not to pursue more sanctions .
" I would hate to see that we are moving back to sanctions , " said Mohamed El - Baradei , director - general of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
" Because sanctions , at the end of the day … really do n't resolve issues . "
El - Baradei , who steps down from the agency on Nov. 30 , said he had yet to receive a final answer from Iran about the deal but was hopeful an agreement could still be reached by the end of the year .
Even with all the ill will towards hedge funders and bankers following the financial crisis , defendants can still get a fair trial .
The two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers , Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin , were found not guilty on all counts related to their failed hedge funds today .
" I am grateful for the jury ’s hard work in weighing all the evidence and thank them for their commitment to finding the truth , " said Tannin in a press statement .
The prosecution was widely regarded to have performed terribly .
WSJ : The trial did n’t go altogether smoothly for the government .
More than one government witness strayed from the script , and ended up providing testimony that was n’t exactly damaging to the defendants ’ cases .
The judge on the case , Frederick Block , ruled the jury could n’t consider one of the prosecution ’s emails , as well .
Prosecutors said the pair hid warning signs their funds -- loaded with sub - prime mortgage bets -- were on the verge of collapsing , costing 300 investors some $ 1.6 billion , as the AP notes .
But the defense said the men were just expressing concerns about they funds that changed constantly and were taken out of context .
" Of course , we are disappointed by the outcome in this case , but the jurors have spoken , and we accept their verdict , " said U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell .
" Honesty and integrity are the principals [ sic ] upon which our financial markets function .
Enforcing and protecting those principals [ sic ] will continue to be one of the principal efforts of this Office . "
The only major criminal prosecution stemming from the financial crisis , this was supposed to be the trial of the year for Wall Street .
But there was little fan - fare at the start on October 13 and the jury took less than two days to decide the not guilty verdict .
Rupert Murdoch wants to remake the web as a toll both , with him in the collector 's seat , but the net wo n't shift to his will
Just what , exactly , is Rupert Murdoch thinking ?
First , he announces that all of News Corp 's websites will erect paywalls like the one employed by the Wall Street Journal ( however , Rupert managed to get the details of the WSJ's wall wrong – no matter , he 's a " big picture " guy ) .
Then , he announced that Google and other search engines were " plagiarists " who " rip off " Newscorp 's content , and that once the paywalls are up ( a date that keeps slipping farther into the future , almost as though the best IT people work for someone who 's not Rupert " I Hate the Net " Murdoch ! ) he 'll be blocking Google and the other " parasites " from his sites , making all of News Corp 's properties invisible to search engines .
Then , as a kind of loonie cherry atop a banana split with extra crazy sauce , Rupert announces that " fair use is illegal " and he 'll be abolishing it shortly .
What is he thinking ?
We 'll never know , of course , but I have a theory .
First , the business of blocking search engines .
Rupert has got dealmaker 's flu , a bug he acquired when he bought MySpace and sold the exclusive right to index it to Google .
This had the temporary effect of making Rupert look like a technology genius , as Google 's putative payout for this right made the MySpace deal instantly profitable , at least on paper ; meanwhile , MySpace 's star was in decline , thanks to competition from Facebook , Twitter and a million me - too social networking tools .
It also put ideas into Rupert 's head .
You can practically see the maths on the blackboard behind his eyelids : exclusive deals + paywalls = money .
I think that Rupert is betting that one of Google 's badly trailing competitors can be coaxed into paying for the right to index all of News Corp 's online stuff , if that right is exclusive .
Rupert is thinking that a company such as Microsoft will be willing to pay to shore up its also - ran search tool , Bing , by buying the right to index the fraction of a fraction of a sliver of a crumb of the internet that News Corp owns .
They 'll be able to advertise : " We have Rupert 's pages and Google does n't , so search with us ! "
( Actually , they 'll have to advertise : " We have Rupert 's pages and Google does n't , except MySpace , which Google has . " )
Or maybe not – MySpace is not delivering the traffic Rupert guaranteed Google in his little deal , and Google may bail if there 's a likely sucker on the line .
Maybe the target is n't Microsoft .
Maybe it 's some gullible startup that 's even now walking up and down Sand Hill Road , the heart of Venture Capital Country in Silicon Valley , showing off a PowerPoint deck whose entire message can be summarised as : " You give us a heptillion dollars , we 'll do exclusive search deals with Rupert and the other media behemoths , and we 'll freeze Google out . "
I 'd be surprised if such a pitch sold , though .
What 's the liquidity event that would return some profit to the VC ?
It 's not going to be an IPO ( Initial Public Offering ) , not in today 's regulatory climate .
It 'd have to be an acquisition , and the two most likely targets would be Google and News Corp .
Now , what about fair use being illegal ?
At a guess , I 'd say that some Cardinal Richelieu figure in Newscorp 's legal department may have been passing some whispers to Rupert about international copyright law .
Specifically , about the Berne Convention – a centuries - old copyright accord that 's been integrated into many other trade agreements , including the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , and its " three - step test " for whether a copyright exemption is legal .
Copyright exemptions are all the rights that copyright gives to the public , not to creators or publishers , and " three - steps " describes the principles that Berne signatory countries must look to when crafting their own copyright exemptions .
Those three steps limits copyright exemptions to :
1. certain special cases …
2. which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work ; and …
3. do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights holder .
Now , arguably , many countries ' fair dealing or fair use rules do n't meet these criteria ( the US rules on VCRs , book lending , cable TV , jukeboxes , radio plays , and a hundred other cases are favourite villains in these discussions ; but many European rules are also difficult to cram into the three - steps frame ) .
And I 've certainly heard many corporate law mover - shakers announce that , with the right lawsuit , you could get trade courts to force this country or that country to get rid of its fair dealing or fair use provisions .
However , this view of international copyright lacks an appreciation of the subtleties of international trade , namely : big , powerful countries can ignore trade courts and treaty rules when it's in their interest to do so , because no one can afford to stop trading with them .
The US gets $ 1 trillion added to its GDP every year thanks to liberal fair use rules .
If the WTO says that it has to ban video recorders or eliminate compulsory licenses on music compositions ( or shut down search engines ! ) , it will just ignore the WTO .
The US is an old hand at ignoring the United Nations .
The US owes billions to the UN in back - dues and shows no signs of repaying it .
The fact that the WTO looks upon the US with disapproval will cause precisely nothing to happen in the American legislative branch .
And , if the WTO tries to get other countries to embargo the US , it will quickly learn that China and other factory states can't afford to stop shipping plastic gewgaws , pocket - sized electronics , and cheap textiles to the United States .
And furthermore , other countries can't afford to boycott China – because those countries can't afford to allow a plastic gewgaw and cheap textile gap to emerge with America .
Of course , the elimination of fair use would present many problems to News Corp – because , as with all media companies , News Corp relies heavily on copyright exemptions to produce its own programming .
I 'm sure that , if there 's a lawyer wh put this idea into Rupert 's head , she knows this .
But I likewise believe that she would be perfectly willing to expand the legal department to the thousands of lawyers it would take to negotiate permission for all those uses if fair use goes away .
That 's my theory : Rupert is n't a technophobic loon who will send his media empire to the bottom of the ocean while waging war on search engines .
Instead , he 's an out - of - touch moustache - twirler who 's set his sights on remaking the web as a toll booth ( with him in the collector 's seat ) , and his plan hinges on a touchingly naive approach to geopolitics .
Either way , old Rupert shows signs of degenerating into a colourful Howard Hughes figure in a housecoat , demanding that reality shift to his will .
SOUTH BEND , Ind . --
The College Football Hall of Fame , which never managed to attract the number of visitors its organizers hoped for after moving it to South Bend in 1995 , is being moved to Atlanta to bring it more exposure , organizers told the city .
The National Football Foundation notified the city of South Bend in a letter Tuesday that it is terminating its agreement with the city when its current lease ends on Dec. 31 , 2010 .
" We take this action not because of any failure on your part , but because we have an opportunity to take the exposure of the Hall of Fame to an entirely new level , " wrote Archie Manning , chairman of the National Football Foundation and the College Football Hall of Fame .
South Bend Mayor Stephen Luecke said Wednesday that he met with football foundation officials on Tuesday and they told him that the move would be announced at a news conference Thursday in Atlanta .
College Football Hall of Fame officials did not return telephone messages from The Associated Press , but issued a statement thanking the city of South Bend for its support .
" The painstaking decision to move the College Football Hall of Fame to Atlanta is made with regret but also in the knowledge that the new venue will provide the Hall an unprecedented opportunity to grow , " the hall said in a statement .
A spokesman for the National Football Foundation , Phil Marwill , declined to comment immediately but said he would comment later Wednesday .
He did not respond to further messages seeking comment .
Luecke said he was told a group in Atlanta had put together an impressive package , " including some sponsorships that we were never able to develop here in South Bend . "
The hall moved to South Bend from Kings Mills , Ohio , in 1995 to take advantage of its proximity to Notre Dame .
Supporters predicted it would attract more than 150,000 visitors a year , but it drew about 115,000 people the first year and about 60,000 annually after that .
" I think they feel being in a larger city perhaps will give them better exposure , " Luecke said .
" It was a business decision on the part of the National Football Foundation . "
Luecke said he was " deeply disappointed " by the foundation 's decision , but not surprised considering the number of communities that have courted the hall in the past .
" The hall has been a great asset for our community .
It has provided national exposure for us and it's contributed to the revitalization of South Bend , " he said .
Luecke said foundation officials had expressed frustration to him when some community members and city officials had complained that the hall was a financial drain .
The city owns the building that houses the hall .
" So for them , perhaps it was an easier decision that it would have been otherwise , " Luecke said .
" I do n't think we kicked them out , but some of those negative comments may have added to their willingness to make a decision to relocate . "
The city pays $ 1.6 million per year through 2017 on the bonds for the building , which also includes some expenses for the nearby convention center , and contributes $ 550,000 per year to the hall through a hotel - motel tax , Luecke said .
The city also has been putting money from its professional sports development fund into an endowment fund to pay for repairs at the facility .
The city will work with the football foundation to work out a transition plan .
Luecke said there is a chance the city could close the facility before the end of 2010 .
He said he was told the facility in Atlanta probably wo n't be ready until 2012 .
The hall is scheduled to hold its enshrinement ceremony in South Bend in July .
Luecke said he 's not sure it will take place .
" It 's possible that we could have had our last enshrinement festival , " he said .

The following points are almost universally agreed upon by New Testament historians regardless of belief in miracles or their position on the resurrection itself :
The gospels ( Matthew , Mark , Luke and John ) are dated between 60 - 90 AD ; Mark is sometimes considered the earliest , dated between 60 and 70 .
John is generally considered the latest at 90 AD .
Paul ’s letters are dated 40 - 55 AD , Acts is dated 65 - 80 AD
Belief in the divinity of Christ is found in the earliest known Christian creeds
Classical historical references to Jesus outside the New Testament : Thallos , Pliny the Younger , Suetonius , Tacitus , Mara Bar Serapion , Lucian of Samosata , Celcus ; general report is that Jesus was a “ troublemaker ”
Jewish references to Jesus outside the New Testament : Josephus , rabbinic tradition , Toledot Yeshu ; general report is that Jesus was a “ cult leader ” and a “ magician . ”
All of these sources treat Jesus as a real historical person ; none assert that he was fictitious
The four gospels differ too much in their details of the resurrection to have been deliberately harmonized ; they represent four sources which are at least partially independent and two which are almost completely independent ( synoptics vs. John )
All four gospels tell the same essential story
All four gospels explicitly speak of an empty tomb
Nobody ever produced Jesus ’ body
Virtually all historical scholars who write about the resurrection agree on the following six points :
First century Jews expected a Messiah but did not expect a dying / rising Messiah .
Jesus died and was buried .
After this happened , the disciples were discouraged and dejected .
Soon after Jesus ’ burial , the tomb was claimed to be empty and some disciples had experiences they took to be encounters with a risen Jesus .
These experiences caused them to believe Jesus rose from the dead .
They started a massive worldwide movement based on the idea that Jesus rose from the dead .
No one who rejects the resurrection offers a convincing alternative explanation of what happened .
Theories abound , but no single “ 2nd theory ” has achieved any real consensus ; alternative theories all have significant problems and leave major questions unanswered .
Even a prominent skeptic admits : If God exists , belief in the resurrection is philosophically rational and historically reasonable .
“ Atheists are quick to ridicule the resurrection because of its miraculous nature ; Christian apologists are quick to point out that an a priori rejection of the miraculous is unwarranted .
“ Both sides are correct within their worldview .
But they have failed to argue outside of their worldview .
Atheists should not be so quick to ridicule the miraculous and use a Humean attack on miracles to refute the resurrection .
Unless atheists can demonstrate that theism is irrational or that the historical evidence for a material resurrection is lacking , they are unlikely to convince many theists to reject the resurrection .
Similarly , Christian apologists need to recognize that , until atheists are shown that theism is plausible , atheists will continue to regard the resurrection as a highly implausible event .
“ I think it is rational to both accept and reject the resurrection .
I think there are strong historical arguments for the resurrection ( a lá William Lane Craig ) , but I also think there are good reasons to reject such arguments .
I realize this may sound like a cop-out to some , but I think it is quite reasonable , especially when the issue of prior probability is taken into consideration . ”
- Jeffrey Jay Lowder , The Historicity of Jesus ’ Resurrection , 1995 ( Infidels.org )
The question is :
What interpretation of these historical facts best explains the sudden origin of early Christianity , belief in a risen Christ , and the explosive growth of the church , even in the face of severe persecution ?

In the remarkable Fox News report posted below , Dr. Archelle Georgiou , described as a well - recognized physician leader who “ helps consumers make better health care decisions , ” argues the case for adding lithium to the water supply .
Georgiou is affiliated with the Center for Health Transformation , an organization founded by the notorious neocon Newt Gingrich .
Georgiou is also a “ medical expert ” for Fox News 9 in Minneapolis where she commented on a proposal to drug people during a segment on “ Health Care Innovations 2009 . ”
“ Lithium in the Water Supply : America has been adding fluoride to its public water supplies for decades to help prevent reduce tooth decay .
Now researchers from Japan suggests expanding the list to lithium , ” is how how Fox News 9 describes the segment .
Georgiou does not explicitly call for adding the mood - stabilizing drug to the water system , as suggested by Japanese researchers , but she does not denounce the proposed practice .
Instead , she says the draconian proposal is a “ very interesting concept . ”
Japanese researchers , according to Georgiou , are “ investigating whether trace amounts of lithium can just change the mood in a community enough — in a really positive way without having the bad effects of lithium — to really affect the mood and decrease the suicide rate . ”
Remarkably , Georgiou does not address the moral issue of forcibly drugging a population into submission .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
On May 1 , the BBC reported on the Japanese research .
“ Researchers examined levels of lithium in drinking water and suicide rates in the prefecture of Oita , which has a population of more than one million .
The suicide rate was significantly lower in those areas with the highest levels of the element , they wrote in the British Journal of Psychiatry . ”
Scientists are not certain how lithium works in the brain .
“ Lithium increases the amount of neurotransmitters such as serotonin , which can help stabilize both the manic and depressive sides of the disorder , but the exact method behind this is still under investigation , ” notes Discovery News .
Apparently the unresolved scientific aspects of lithium were not a concern in the Japanese research .
Research conducted in Texas from 1978 - 1987 revealed lower incidences of crime , suicide , and arrest when lithium is present in water , according to PubMed .
“ These results suggest that lithium has moderating effects on suicidal and violent criminal behavior at levels that may be encountered in municipal water supplies . ”
Peter D. Kramer , in an article on lithium in drinking water , states there are serious ethical considerations to any plan to drug the populace .
“ The neurotrophic factors seem to protect against psychiatric and neurological disease .
But they may also affect personality traits – and that possibility poses ethical dilemmas for any broad - based effort to improve resilience in the brain , ” he writes for DoubleX .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Lithium has well - documented harmful effects .
It is known to be responsible for significant amounts of weight gain and reduces the activity of thyroid hormone .
It is also believed to affect renal function .
Our water supply already contains dangerous levels of pharmaceutical drugs .
Preliminary results from two important federal studies compared the waste water flowing from sewage plants that handle waste from drug companies and compared them with others that do not , redOrbit reported in April .
According to a U.S. Geological Survey ’s report , some of the samples contained a range of pharmaceuticals , from over - the - counter medications to opiates , barbiturates and tranquilizers ; some of them at significantly higher concentrations than what were found at other plants .
“ All of this comes down to the mass medication of the public with trace amounts of prescription drugs .
In another words , if you ’re drinking tap water that ’s tainted with these drugs , you ’re getting a little bit of Prozac whether you like it or not , ” remarks Mike Adams , the Health Ranger .
Drinking water in the United States has been polluted with fluoride for decades .
The often cited reason given for this forcible drugging of the American public is that fluoride prevents tooth decay .
Numerous studies prove otherwise .
( A study conducted in Tucson , Arizona in 1992 on 26,000 elementary school students produced empirical evidence of just the opposite — the more fluoride a child consumes , the more cavities appear . )
According to chemist Charles Perkins , fluoride is added to the water supply because in time reduces an individual ’s power to resist domination by incrementally poisoning and narcotizing a certain area of the brain , thus making an individual submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him .
This is precisely why the Nazis forced concentration camp internees to ingest fluoride .
Americans liberating of POW camps at the end of the Second World War discovered stockpiles of fluoride stored near water supplies .
When they asked what the fluoride was used for , they were told that the Germans used the substance as an additive to the prisoners water to make them docile .
Researchers in Japan and Dr. Archelle Georgiou may believe adding lithium to the drinking water is beneficial to society – never mind the unresolved scientific issues of the drug ’s use and the immorality of the forcible drugging on a population – but there is a larger context here .
Adding fluoride and lithium to drinking water is an effective way to subdue and narcotize the population , especially during times of social and political upheaval .
Our eugenicist rulers are not perturbed by crime and suicide in society .
Like the Nazis , they are primarily interested in rendering the masses docile and making certain they are unable to resist the draconian plans – from an engineered crash of the global economy to the establishment of a totalitarian world government – now unfolding with increased speed and determination .

The mobile homes at Belmont Trailer Park on Denver ’s west side are n’t fancy .
Their makeshift plywood porches are gathering places where cherished memories are made , like the celebration that drew about 50 people from Lourdes Rascon ’s church to mark the installation of a Virgin of Guadalupe statue in her living room .
And the trailer park is home , say Belmont residents , some of whom have lived there for more than 20 years .
But city officials have another term for the 40 - home neighborhood at 4406 Morrison Road : a non-conforming use .
Last month , Denver ’s zoning administrator , Michael O’Flaherty , notified the owners of the Belmont — one of only a few trailer parks left in Denver — that they have until July to shut down the park because of inspection and zoning violations .
Denver banned mobile - home parks in 1956 , declaring them a non-conforming use , but allowed existing parks to remain as long as they continued to meet safety standards and did not expand .
Belmont , where a mobile home runs $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 to buy and a lot rental is $ 350 a month , has lived on as a well - known place to find cheap housing .
That is until recently , when Belmont began attracting complaints .
The city ’s neighborhood - services inspectors visited in July and found code violations at all but six of the trailers .
They found makeshift sheds and porches made of tin and plywood — structures that had been built without permits .
They also found safety hazards , including faulty electrical wiring , a leaking gas line and the use of propane to heat a handful of the mobile homes in the park — which , according to city records , has been around since at least 1946 .
Enclosures , sheds added
The inspectors also could not find required log sheets that would document smoke detectors and portable fire extinguishers .
The trailer park ’s landowners , Vince and Marley Vranesic , say they have told the city that they will clear up the electrical problems and any other safety issues .
Still , O’Flaherty said the fact that the owners of the mobile homes have added on wood enclosures , porches and sheds without city authorization has put Belmont out of compliance with the city ’s zoning laws .
“ They ca n’t expand the use ; they ca n’t increase the square footage of use , ” O’Flaherty said in a recent interview .
“ By building the wood - frame additions to trailers without getting prior approval to expand the square footage of the use , it terminated the legal status . ”
O’Flaherty and Sue Cobb , a spokeswoman for Community Planning and Development , said the city is trying to reduce the stress of residents having to move in the middle of winter , or in the middle of the school year , and will give them until next summer to relocate .
“ We deliberated about the mechanics of the termination and made what we thought was a reasonable decision , given the human factor , ” O’Flaherty said .
The Vranesics have appealed to the Denver Board of Adjustment , a five - member board of mayoral appointees .
A hearing is scheduled in January .
Owners making fixes
The landowners say O’Flaherty ’s stance is cruel , considering it will oust their tenants from their homes .
Further , the Vranesics say they invested $ 1.6 million to buy the land five years ago and may go bankrupt if their tenants are given the boot .
“ We are complying with the safety issue , but apparently , that does n’t mean anything to the city , and I do n’t understand that , ” said Marley Vranesic , who said she and her husband have spent at least $ 18,000 fixing electrical problems since they received notification in October .
Ramon Luis , owner of La California , a Mexican restaurant at the edge of the Belmont , has his own worries .
When he saw the city inspectors taking photos at the Belmont , he worried whether it was safe to renew his restaurant ’s lease .
The Vranesics told him it was .
“ I built this from zero , ” Luis recently said , gesturing to the prep line and electric grill he installed four years ago along with the tile flooring .
Worse , he said , relocating would force him to rebuild his customer base for his huge tortas and chile rellenos that he says are the best in town .
The city decided the restaurant wo n’t have to close , but Luis still wonders what will happen if the Vranesics sell their land .
News of the eviction is worrisome for trailer - park resident Rascon , her husband and four children .
“ My family , where will we go ? ” wondered the 40 - year - old , whose husband ’s landscaping business has dried up , leaving the $ 150 she is paid weekly to clean homes as the family ’s livelihood .
“ I bought this home for my children . ”
She paid $ 5,000 in cash two years ago to buy the mobile home from her brother , Luis .
This week , she stood on her porch and watched her brother give a battered Cutlass a tune - up to survive the drive to Oklahoma so three of her children could see their aunt and uncle for Thanksgiving .
Her home is too old to relocate , and she does n’t have the money to move it anyway .
She said she will miss the home if the family is forced to leave .
“ I feel like we have no recourse , ” Rascon said .
Advocate appointed
Councilman Paul Lopez , who represents the area of the city where the Belmont is located , said he is working to ensure that the residents get aid from the city .
“ The current conditions of the property are very dangerous and not acceptable living standards for anyone , period , ” Lopez said .
“ The residents deserve affordable , decent and safe housing . ”
Denver Department of Human Services spokeswoman Revekka Balancier said her agency is appointing an advocate to work with residents at the Belmont to help them apply for assistance .
Questions , though , still persist .
The eyes of 16 - year - old Brenda Cruz grew big with surprise when she recently heard that the city wanted to close the Belmont down .
“ What will they do with our trailer ? ” she asked .

ACORN hired a former Attorney General , Scott Harshbarger of Massachusetts , to conduct an independent review of how ACORN operated after those sleazy videos were released by FOX .
The resulting report concludes that ACORN did not engage in any criminal behavior , even though some of it looked pretty out there .
ACORN , the community organizing group which found itself embroiled in the latest of several controversies after some of its workers were recorded providing advice to a couple posing as a pimp and prostitute , was cleared of illegality in the matter by the former Massachusetts attorney general .
But Scott Harshbarger , the lawyer ACORN hired to conduct a review , criticized the organization for bad management which it said contributed to the ACORN 's problems .
A major problem , he said , was that the organization grew too quickly , neglecting training of its workers and other essentials .
Harshbarger says this about their conduct :
While some of the advice and counsel given by ACORN employees and volunteers was clearly inappropriate and unprofessional , we did not find a pattern of intentional , illegal conduct by ACORN staff ; in fact , there is no evidence that action , illegal or otherwise , was taken by any ACORN employee on behalf of the videographers .
Instead , the videos represent the byproduct of ACORN 's longstanding management weaknesses , including a lack of training , a lack of procedures , and a lack of on - site supervision .
ACORN has always claimed that these were isolated instances and not a systemic problem , though this report suggests that they were at least a product of systemic disorganization , something ACORN obviously needs to repair .
What the report does say , moreover , is that the rogue videographers edited the videos and likely manipulated the final product :
TPM sez :
Harshbarger also notes that the videos were sometimes less than perfect representations of the events they depict .
He writes : > The videos that have been released appear to have been edited , in some cases substantially , including the insertion of a substitute voiceover for significant portions of Mr. O'Keefe 's and Ms. Giles 's comments , which makes it difficult to determine the questions to which ACORN employees are responding .
A comparison of the publicly available transcripts to the released videos confirms that large portions of the original video have been omitted from the released versions .
In the wake of the scandal , Congress voted to cut off all federal funds from ACORN .
In response , the group is suing the US government , arguing that the measure is a bill of attainder , and therefore unconstitutional .
A real news network would have spent the time necessary to prove the accuracy of the tapes .
FOX
News never tried to act like a news organization when they received the tapes .
It 's their responsibility as journalists to verify the information the tapes contain , but instead FOX repeatedly aired them in hopes of destroying ACORN , a group that has a history of great work with lower - income families .
The damage has been done as Congress joined in the vilification process .
Proof , once again , that this is not a news network .
It 's a propaganda mill posing as one .
VANCOUVER–In less than a minute , with three simple sentences , three B.C. Court of Appeal judges dismissed the dreams of 14 female ski jumpers who have been fighting for years for inclusion in the Olympics .
The tears started almost immediately after the ruling late Friday afternoon for some of the ski jumpers , including Lindsey Van of the U.S. , a world champion ski jumper who had hoped to compete in the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games .
The women had argued that by allowing men to compete in ski jumping but not women , the Vancouver Olympic organizing committee is violating the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
They asked the court for a declaration that unless women could compete , the men 's competition should be cancelled .
Justice Ann Rowles , one of the three appeal court judges who heard the case over the last two days , said she was aware a decision was needed quickly .
Reasons for the decision will be released next week .
The women could seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada , but lawyer Ross Clark , who is representing the ski jumpers , said such an appeal would need to overcome a lot of hurdles .
The appeal to B.C. 's highest court was an attempt to overturn a B.C. Supreme Court decision that found that while excluding the women from competing is discriminatory , the International Olympic Committee is not subject to the Charter and cannot be forced to hold a women 's ski jumping event .
In his argument before the court , Clark said by allowing the IOC to dictate what events can or cannot be held at the Games , Canada appears to tolerate discrimination .
The Vancouver Olympic organizing committee , known as VANOC , argued that it has no power to determine what events can be held and that decision is solely made by the IOC .
The IOC 's position has been that there are not enough competitions to merit making the event an Olympic sport yet .

Carrie Prejean , the dethroned Miss California 2009 who stirred up controversy by expressing her views against gay marriage , has dropped her lawsuit against the Miss California contest because of an “ extremely graphic ” sex tape , says a report at the celebrity gossip site TMZ .
“ Carrie Prejean demanded more than a million dollars during her settlement negotiations with Miss California USA Pageant officials — that is , until the lawyer for the Pageant showed Carrie an XXX home video of her handiwork , ” the Web site reported .

The Web site reports that it obtained a copy of the sex video “ months ago but decided not to post it because it was so racy . ”
While TMZ would not state what was depicted on the tape , it hinted at the content by saying that “ Carrie has a promising solo career . ”
Prejean won the 2009 Miss California title earlier this year , but stirred controversy over her answer during the pageant to a question about gay marriage .
“ You know what , in my country , in my family , I think I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman , no offense to anybody out there .
But that ’s how I was raised and I believe that it should be between a man and a woman , ” Prejean said , causing a stir of complaints from progressives and rights activists .
Prejean raised more eyebrows this spring when TMZ released topless photos of the pageant winner .
The pageant stripped her of her title in June , officially because she had failed to appear at scheduled functions .
Prejean then sued the pageant on grounds of religious discrimination and slander .

Is Israel Addicted to the Occupation ?
The Likud government of Israel and its powerful supporters in the United States are making it clear that they will resist – and undercut – any serious effort by the Obama administration to broker a peace deal with the Palestinians if it requires major concessions from Israel .
Email
In the view of Gideon Levy , a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz , Israel has become “ addicted ” to its role as the occupier of the Palestinian Territories and wo n’t face up to its addiction unless a “ real friend ” from the outside forces it to change its ways .
( The story summary continues below . )
More at The Real News
But Levy is not optimistic .
He believes the powerful Jewish Lobby in the United States , backed by a Christian Right Lobby , will frustrate any attempts by the Obama administration to intervene and , in Levy ’s analogy , force Israel into a rehab program .
By supposedly protecting Israel from such pressure , AIPAC and other lobbying forces may feel they are acting as Israel ’s friend , but Levy says the friendship is akin to helping an addict get more drugs .

Following US
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's visit here this weekend , Palestinians are reacting with frustration over what appeared to be a shift in the Obama administration 's policy toward Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank .
Although Secretary Clinton had previously insisted that the US wanted a total freeze on West Bank settlement expansion , she said during her meetings here this weekend that Palestinians should return to negotiations without preconditions – and lauded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's steps toward limiting settlement growth as " unprecedented . "
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , in an interview with the Monitor , said that this most recent development illustrated an " asymmetry " in negotiations dating back to the 1993 Oslo Accords – and one that must be rectified in order for future talks to be more fruitful .
" What are we going to do when it comes time to actually resolving these issues , and we 're told , ' Sorry .
That 's all that can be on offer because that 's all that Israel is prepared to offer , ' " said Dr. Fayyad , adding that Palestinians are being asked to settle for less than what was considered as conducive to peacemaking under the Bush administration .
" The key idea underlying the Oslo process leaves the matter of ending the occupation up to the occupying power – that is , Israel .
Where we are today shows the shortcomings of this approach . "
Netanyahu takes credit for ' economic boom '
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argues that Israel is doing more than ever to help Palestinians in the West Bank : easing travel restrictions and removing checkpoints , fostering Palestinian economic growth , and offering to curtail some settlement construction .
" We are making a focused effort to resume the peace process , " Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday , during which he said his policies had led to an " economic boom " for Palestinians .
" We are ready to start negotiations without delay . "
Never before , Netanyahu says , have there been Palestinian " preconditions " to negotiations .
As such , he has portrayed the Palestinians – particularly President Mahmoud Abbas , who refuses to have official talks in the absence of a settlement freeze – as the main stumbling block to progress .
Fayyad pointed out , however , that that is not a new demand – nor a purely Palestinian one ; the 2003 road map introduced by the Bush administration insisted on a full freeze in settlement activity , including natural growth .
Under former prime minister Ariel Sharon , Israel agreed to implementing that road map , as did the Palestinians , whose obligations under the blueprint included cracking down on extremism .
Both accused each other of not living up to their promises .
" It 's as if we Palestinians are the only ones that have obligations that need to be observed , even though the road map included a total Israeli settlement freeze , " said Fayyad .
Arabs express ' deep disappointment ' after Clinton remarks
In addition to presenting an impasse on Israeli - Palestinian talks , US backpedaling on the settlement issue could also stymie the Obama administration 's efforts to reach out to Arab leaders and win their support for normalizing ties with Israel .
" I am telling you that all of us , including Saudi Arabia , including Egypt , are deeply disappointed ... with the results , with the fact that Israel can get away with anything without any firm stand ... , " Arab League Secretary - General Amr Moussa told reporters at a gathering of Arab foreign ministers in Marrakesh , Morocco .
Clinton was in Morocco on Monday in a stop in part aimed at shoring up support for the Obama administration 's work on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
She was scheduled to address the foreign ministers at the Forum of the Future in Marrakesh on Tuesday , and was also expected to meet with Moroccan Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri , the country 's King Mohammed V , foreign ministers of several Persian Gulf states , and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal .
Saudi Arabia authored the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative , which suggests that if Israel gets to a peace deal with the Palestinians , it will throw open the doors to peace with the rest of the Arab world .
The Obama administration has tried to convince some of the Arab states to make moves toward normalizing relations with Israel as an incentive in the interim , but has met with little success .
Asked in Morocco about the negative Arab reaction to her comments on the settlement freeze issue , Clinton said her words were meant as " positive reinforcement " – something she believes in giving either side when they take steps toward peace .
But she insisted that the US position remained firm .
" The Obama administration 's position on settlements is clear and unequivocal .
It has not changed , " she said .
" The US does not accept the legitimacy of continuing Israeli settlements . "

New Zealand 's champion rabbit thrower is a 19 - year - old female German tourist .
Lisa Lutz could not believe her luck when she out - threw a Waitomo local by the name of " Butch " at the world rabbit throwing championship in Waitomo yesterday .
More than 70 people took part in the event , according to organiser Barry Woods , who said it was great to see people of all ages rolling up their sleeves and taking part .
" Basically this was a stand against the PC brigade who think there is something wrong with what goes on in the real world , " Mr Woods said .
Competitors selected a dead rabbit from a pile and threw it into a trailer attached to a motorbike which , Mr Woods said , was exactly how it 's done on the farm .
" Why should n't kids be able to see how it 's done , handle a dead animal and learn about pests which destroy the environment ? " he said .
Miss Lutz won a trip for two on the Waitomo Riverjet and a $ 100 meal voucher for her throwing ability but admits to being embarrassed about the win .
" I could n't believe it , I just laughed .
It was very funny . "
Miss Lutz is in New Zealand on a 12 - month working holiday .

California voters passed a law in 1996 that allowed a seriously ill person with a doctor 's clearance to use marijuana .
Another law in 2004 permitted patients and their primary caregivers to open collectives to procure and distribute marijuana to their members .
Though the council is now trying to craft guidelines -- including possible rules on the number and location of dispensaries -- Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley contends that many of the outlets are simply illegal , drug - selling operations that are reaping huge profits , much of it in cash .
He says that if the stores do n't close voluntarily , he will move to have them closed and file criminal charges against their operators .
" The sale of marijuana is illegal under state law , " said Mr. Cooley .
Dispensary defenders argue that such sales are allowable , noting that one state agency has even put out a directive saying that legal marijuana transactions are subject to sales tax .
According to 2008 guidelines from the California attorney general , qualified users and their primary caregivers can form cooperatives or collectives to grow and supply pot to members .
Those entities have to operate on a not - for - profit basis but can recoup expenses ; dispensary defenders say that is where the over - the - counter sales come in .
The Los Angeles city attorney 's office , another critic of over - the - counter sales , says the costs have to be recouped through a mechanism such as monthly membership dues .
Law - enforcement officials also say dispensary operators often do n't qualify as primary caregivers .
. Law - enforcement officials also argue that a doctor 's recommendation is easy to get .
They note that some physicians openly advertise for marijuana - seeking patients , with one such ad promising that " if you do not qualify for a recommendation " the $ 150 examination fee would be waived .
There is " a corruption of a portion of the medical community , " said Mr. Cooley , who said he will also seek to punish offending doctors .
While there are bad actors among dispensaries , " I believe that the vast majority are trying to operate legally , " said Don Duncan of Americans for Safe Access , a marijuana advocacy organization .
The lack of clear rules in Los Angeles does n't help , he added .
Possession and sale of marijuana remain illegal under federal law .
During the Bush administration , federal prosecutors here won criminal convictions against some dispensary operators .
Early this year , President Barack Obama 's attorney general , Eric Holder , said federal prosecutors would n't go after people complying with state marijuana laws .
Since then , several hundred new dispensaries filed notifications with Los Angeles city officials .
Mr. Holder " was widely heard , " said David Berger of the Los Angeles city attorney 's office .
A Justice Department spokeswoman said nothing in Mr. Holder 's remarks should have given " any encouragement to people to open illegal marijuana operations . "
Those found to violate federal and state marijuana laws will be prosecuted , she added .
Local law - enforcement officials say the case of Luis Godman illustrates the kind of operation they are worried about .
A former real - estate agent who became a marijuana dispenser , Mr. Godman was arrested last year in an underground parking garage while purchasing more than three pounds of marijuana .
Mr. Godman told officers he bought marijuana for $ 3,000 a pound and received the equivalent of $ 9,000 a pound at a roughly $ 20 - per-gram " donation " from collective members , according to court filings .
Mr. Godman pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to sell and tax evasion related to under - reporting of what authorities calculated was hundreds of thousands of dollars of income .
The district attorney recommended a year in jail .
The judge gave Mr. Godman 180 days of home confinement .
Mr. Godman 's attorney , Bruce Margolin , said his client " was acting in good faith " in operating the dispensary .
The home - confinement sentence , he added , shows " the court did n't think he was acting in a criminal fashion . "
Arrested with Mr. Godman was Nathan Holtz , who has been charged with illegal cultivation of marijuana , theft of utility services and other crimes .
In court filings , the district attorney 's office linked Mr. Holtz to two houses that had been converted into indoor marijuana - growing facilities that contained more than 1,300 plants .
To power pumps and grow lights , main utility lines were tapped and more than $ 60,000 of electricity stolen , the filings said .
Mr. Holtz has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial .
He is a member of a number of " lawful " collectives and supplies marijuana to each , said his attorney , Bradley Brunon .

This post is my submission for the Green Moms Carnival which will be hosted this month by Mary Hunt at In Women We Trust .
The topic is " standards " with a specific look at Walmart 's sustainability index .
Yesterday , I gave a little background information in preparation for my post today .
With this background in mind , Mary asked us to ponder the following statement :
" Wal Mart and other big box stores are developing a sustainability index .
I do n't have the $ 250,000 it costs to get a seat at the table , but if I had a seat there , this is what I 'd want to make sure is in that index criteria ... "
Thinking about this subject reminded me of a novel I read last year called Someone Knows My Name by Lawrence Hill .
It was a sad but beautiful account of a brave woman in the mid-1700s , describing her abduction from her home in Africa , her trials as a young slave on an indigo farm in South Carolina , her escape to freedom in Canada , and finally her aid to the abolitionists in England .
It might seem strange that Wal - Mart would remind me of a novel about slavery , but there was one particular scene in the book that I 've often thought of as I 've learned more about environmentalism and social justice .
The heroine , Aminata , is talking to an Englishman who is connected to the slave trade .
Aminata tells him about her life , and seeing his sympathy , she asks him how the British can continue to participate in slavery .
The man replies , " Ninety - nine Englishman out of a hundred take their tea with sugar .
We live for our tea , cakes , pies , and candies .
We live for the stuff , and we will not be deprived . "
The price of sweet tea ...
I recognize that the scene from this novel was completely fictional , but I have heard this same attitude in real life from modern corporations .
And that includes Wal - Mart .
" Our customers demand cheap products , " they say .
" Manufacturing our products in countries with fewer environmental regulations and lower human rights standards is the only way to meet the demand for cheap products . "
I have also heard that attitude from the mouths of consumers .
" We are just pawns in the system , " one friend said .
" It 's not our fault , and there 's nothing we can do about it ... But that does n't mean we should n't take advantage of it ! "
It seems like everyone wants to blame everyone else for the problems with the system .
The corporations blame the consumer for demanding cheap products .
The consumer blames the corporation for making poor manufacturing decisions .
It 's everyone 's fault and no one 's fault .
And nobody really cares ... As long as we all get what we want .
Even those of us who do n't regularly shop at Wal - Mart have to recognize the importance of the development of this sustainability index .
While laws and regulations stutter to a standstill in Congress , Wal - Mart 's index will force their 100,000 suppliers to action , leading to improvements and accountability throughout the manufacturing world and hopefully providing customers with an easier way to make informed decisions in the marketplace .
But the demand for ever cheaper products by Wal - Mart and other big box retailers is at the base of our environmental degradation and global human exploitation .
The case could be made that Wal - Mart is the root of many of our problems .
Can the world 's biggest bully make an about face to become the biggest influence in our transition to sustainability ?
So this is what I would say to Wal - Mart :
Are you committed to sustainability ?
Are your intentions true ?
Will you make the standards strong enough to make a difference ?
Will your lifecycle assessments push for a cradle - to - cradle standard ?
Will you put an end to ridiculously wasteful packaging ?
Will you take a stand for safety and quality ?
Will you establish accountability for social injustices ?
How will you measure compliance to the standards ?
( Right now , it looks like they just have to be able to answer " yes " to a bunch of questions .
Honestly , that 's a fairly meaningless way of measuring sustainability . )
Most importantly , I want to know , if compliance to sustainability standards means higher prices and your customers balk , will you drop out of the game ?
And since Wal - Mart only deserves a portion of the finger - pointing , I would ask everyone to ask themselves :
Was cheap sweet tea worth the price of slavery ?
Are cheap products today worth the cost to sustainability ?

Some people claim that dynamic languages are too difficult to manage without using powerful IDEs .
One theory is that a lack of static typing means that static analysis is insufficient to write and to manage great gobs of code .
I look at the problem differently .
I do n't want to manage great gobs of code .
I want to use small , sharp , flexible , well - designed tools that I can fit together in a coherent form .
I wrote about recursion and tail call elimination in the Modern Perl book yesterday .
As I was doing so , I realized that I should at least look at Yuval Kogman 's new Sub : : Call : : Tail and Sub : : Call : : Recur .
Granted , I do have root privileges on my local machine ( though with local : : lib that does n't matter anymore ) and I have the suitable development tools installed ( gcc , make , the Perl headers , system headers ) , and I have my CPAN client installed -- but installing these distributions to test was almost trivial :
$ cpan Sub :: Call :: Tail
In less than the time it took to read the documentation on search .
cpan.org , the CPAN client prompted me for a sudo password .
I changed three lines in my example code and ran the tests and everything passed .
You read that right .
It took fewer than five minutes from deciding to install a language extension to using that extension productively .
Yes , my example was small , but my confidence in the code and the ecosystem is high because CPAN has been a fundamental part of the professional , modern Perl experience for over a decade .
I do n't have to care about installation paths or mirror selection .
I do n't have to care about having the right dependencies .
I do n't have to care about losing out on the latest version or wondering if the code works right on my machine .
The tools are great .
( Caveat : sometimes I do have to worry about those things , but those are the exceptions which demonstrate how amazing it is that a system begun 14 years ago with tens of thousands of modules written by thousands of authors works together so well . )
Part of this is a testament to the Unix philosophy .
Sub :: Call :: Tail does one thing and does it well .
There 's almost no interface .
There 's little to learn .
It 's a very simple language extension that , if it behaves properly , should only make your code clearer and somewhat more efficient ( if you even need to measure it ) .
Part of this is that Yuval is a good , careful coder with good design sense .
See also the first point .
Part of this is also that I have more than a decade of practical experience with Perl 5 , so I know that I can trust Yuval and I know how to wrangle CPAN to do what I want .
Then again , the CPAN ecosystem has improved so much even in the past three years that that ease does n't come only from practical experience .
Could an IDE replicate the CPAN experience ?
I suppose there could be a graphical IDE to browse and install CPAN distributions in the same way that some people find Synaptic easier to use than aptitude .
I 'd like to see such a thing , personally -- but make no mistake , that 's just an interface over what makes CPAN work : the CPAN distribution system , CPAN metadata , CPAN Testers , CPANTS , community standards , and the realization among effective Perl programmers that programming modern Perl effectively means making the most of what 's available on the CPAN .
My productivity does n't depend on an IDE writing code for me or performing automatic refactorings .
( I have no problem with the latter . )
My productivity depends on reusing great code , most of it code I did n't have to write .
If you overlook the CPAN tools because they do n't come with a splash screen or a point and drag installer , you 're overlooking one of the most powerful benefits of modern Perl .
The real rolling stones : Mystery of Death Valley 's gliding rocks
These extraordinary pictures reveal a bizarre event that is puzzling the science world - rocks that glide across the desert .
Amid the eerie silence and the 50C heat of California 's Death Valley these giant boulders appear to move smoothly - and unaided - across the desert .
The rocks , some as heavy as 17 stone , edge along in bizarre , straight - line patterns across the ultra - flat surface of the valley .
They can travel more than 350 yards a year .
Er ... how did that get there ?
One of the extraordinary moving rocks leaves a track through Death Valley
Scientists believe the phenomenon is caused by a coming together of specific weather conditions .
Studies suggest a combination of 90 mph winds , ice formations at night and thin layers of wet clay on the surface of the desert all help to push them along .
Photographer Mike Byrne , 40 , has spent years documenting the stones ' mysterious movements .
As his amazing pictures show these real - life rolling stones leave trails across the sand in places almost untouched by man .
He said : ' Some of these rocks are as heavy as a person , it is really is strange to imagine them gliding across the desert like this .
' They must be the original real - life rolling stones , they just keep moving through the sand and I do n't believe anyone has really 100 per cent worked it out yet .
Rock on : More of the boulders and the eerie paths they leave across the Valley
' Most of the stones are found on an old lake bed , known as the Racetrack Playa , where the ground is particularly flat .
' It has been documented over the years and it is something very special to witness , although I know climatologists believe the phenomenon could disappear in a few years as the temps continue to rise .
' One of the strongest theories about what the rocks move is that water rising from beneath the surface of the sand is pushed by the wind creating a surface the rocks can move along . '
Death Valley is the lowest point in the U.S. , at 282ft below sea level .
It is almost completely flat and holds the record for the second highest temperature ever recorded on earth , a blistering 58C .
In the 1990s a study by a team of scientists lead by Professor John Reid , from Hampshire College , Massachusetts , attempted to explain the rocks ' movement .
His study concluded that the rocks may be moved when they become embedded in sheets of ice forming at night on the surface of the sand .
Forthcoming book examines the role of humans in the eradication of species , and its findings are not likely to be pleasant
At first sight it seems an unlikely topic for a landmark publishing deal : a fee of about half a million dollars for a book about dead animals – or , to be more precise , extinct animals .
Nevertheless the subject of eradicated species has become publishing hot property after a bidding battle in the US saw Henry Holt , a publisher , beat its rivals to buy The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert last week .
According to the New York Times , a " mid- six - figure advance " has now been agreed between writer and publisher .
" The idea of mass extinctions as the next step after talking about the perils of global warming is the most crucial subject , " said Gillian Blake of Holt , after completing the deal with Kolbert , a writer for the New Yorker on environmental issues .
Her last book , Field Notes from a Catastrophe , outlined evidence collated from sites across the planet showing how global warming is changing the world .
The book was well reviewed on both sides of the Atlantic , with the Observer praising it as " a superbly crafted , diligently compressed vision of a world spiralling towards destruction " .
Now , Kolbert is to focus on humanity 's impact on the animal world , and in particular will look at the species that are today being rendered extinct by men and women .
Scientists say the number of species being lost is approaching levels reached during five pivotal extinction events that have swept the planet over the past 600 million years .
Among these catastrophes was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .
Kolbert 's task will to be show whether or not humanity – with its spiralling population , widespread habitat destruction , over - fishing and global warming – is rivalling these .
The theme is intriguing but not new .
Nor is the title .
In 1996 the distinguished palaeontologist Richard Leakey , with journalist Roger Lewin , produced his version of The Sixth Extinction , in which he argued that the five previous mass extinction events were now being matched by a sixth .
" Homo sapiens is poised to become the greatest catastrophic agent since a giant asteroid collided with the Earth 65 million years ago , wiping out half the world 's species in a geological instant , " he says .
Other distinguished scientists , including EO Wilson and Norman Myers , have also produced works on this theme .
None received advances like the one agreed between Holt and Kolbert , however .
So what has changed ?
Why have extinctions become the subject of such attention and finance ?
Answers have much to do with timing .
Over the past decade , there has been a revolution in concerns about the environment – on both sides of the Atlantic .
A succession of reports from United Nations wildlife experts and climate scientists have shown that our planet is in peril and that thousands of species are now hovering on the brink of extinction .
For a decade , the public has been deluged with stories about the vulnerability of the tiger , coral reefs , amphibians and a host of other creatures .
Hence the interest in Kolbert 's new book .
In publishing terms , the move is also a significant one because it represents a shift from big - money outlays on works of fiction which have dominated the market in recent years .
Huge sums , for example , have been paid to novelists such as Audrey Niffenegger for works – such as her latest , Her Fearful Symmetry – that have had disappointing sales .
A dose of eco - horror might prove rewarding , it is thought .
Certainly , extinctions make a riveting and disconcerting subject .
As Professor Norman MacLeod , keeper of palaeontology at the Natural History Museum in London , told the Observer : " We now know that 99.9 % of all lifeforms that have ever existed on Earth have gone extinct .
That means , to a first order approximation , that all life is extinct . "
Obviously this latter , rather disturbing , scenario has not quite arrived .
Nevertheless it does indicate that the constant eradication of lifeforms has been the norm throughout the history of life on Earth .
It is the fate of all species to become extinct , a notion that should concentrate the minds of Kolbert 's readers .
The question is : what forces are responsible for the loss of vast numbers of species in such a short period ?
Answers depend on individual cases , it transpires .
For example , a huge asteroid crashing on Earth 65 million years ago is generally thought to have done for the dinosaurs .
The vast plume thrown up by the impact coated the planet in dust and triggered a devastating climate change .
As a result , 47 % of marine genera ( groups of related species ) and 18 % of land vertebrate families , including the dinosaurs , were wiped out .
And as evidence geologists point to the Chicxulub crater near the Yucatán peninsula , beneath the Gulf of Mexico , as the impact point of the asteroid .
Similarly the Triassic extinction , which occurred between 199 million and 214 million years ago , was most likely caused by massive floods of lava erupting from the Atlantic Ocean .
These created a wave of global warming .
In this case , around 22 % of marine families and 52 % of marine genera were eradicated .
Then there was the Permian - Triassic extinction , about 250 million years ago , which has been linked to both asteroid impacts and volcanism .
This was Earth 's worst mass extinction , killing 95 % of all species , including an estimated 70 % of land species such as plants , insects and vertebrate animals .
Before that , the Late Devonian extinction , about 360 million years ago , killed 57 % of marine genera .
Its cause remains unknown .
And finally , there was the Ordovician - Silurian extinction , about 440 million years ago , which has been linked with changes in sea levels and which led to the eradication of 60 % of marine genera .
Life on Earth has , on some occasions , become remarkably unpleasant in a short space of time , to say the least – though this has not always been the prevailing view among scientists .
In fact , Darwin thought extinction was a slow , painful business .
" The complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process than their production , " he once remarked , a view that held sway for more than a century .
Indeed it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that scientists uncovered evidence – the Chicxulub crater – that an asteroid crash must have been involved in the demise of dinosaurs .
Extinctions could be sudden , they realised .
However , MacLeod urged caution in interpreting such discoveries .
" Most palaeontologists dislike the idea that any single cause was responsible for one of the main extinctions , " he said .
" Life is very robust and it takes a sequence of events to produce large - scale extinctions . "
Thus the dinosaurs were wiped out at a time of considerable volcanic activity on Earth .
Plumes of material were already sweeping the planet , plunging it into a period of global cooling .
The crashing asteroid then administered a planetary coup de grace .
On top of volcanoes and errant astronomical objects , other factors involved in these mass extinctions include extreme ice ages which coated the planet in ice from pole to equator , and eruptions of deep - sea methane deposits that set off massive global warming .
The resulting death toll is measured in millions of species .
What remains unclear is the degree to which humans are now repeating this bloodletting , to the extent that we are about to set off a sixth extinction wave .
If so , we will be the first single , biological cause of this kind of catastrophe .
" If you add up the numbers of species that have been wiped out over the past few hundred years , then you find the figures fall well short of a mass extinction , " said MacLeod .
" It is only when you look at the numbers of creatures that are poised at the brink of eradication does the picture become alarming . "
Tigers , coral reefs and all the marine life they support , amphibians such as the golden frog of Panama , orang - utans , sharks , mountain gorillas , the marine iguanas of the Galápagos , albatrosses , chimpanzees and thousands of other creatures now face obliteration : hunted , rendered homeless , and poisoned by humans .
More to the point , this predation has been going on , not for hundreds of years , but for tens of thousands of years .
Whenever Homo sapiens has moved into new territory , this has been followed quickly by the disappearance of most large land mammals , palaeontologists have found .
For example , the Clovis people , ancient hunters armed with fearsome stone - tipped spears , arrived in North America 12,000 years ago .
A total of 75 species , including woolly mammoths , mastodons , four - horned antelopes and lumbering sloths the size of giraffes were killed off almost immediately .
A thousand years later , the slaughter continued in South America when humans arrived there .
The glyptodon ( a giant armadillo - like animal ) , several species of rodent and various llama - like animals were wiped out .
And a similar bloodbath occurred in Australia with the arrival of the first members of Homo sapiens .
In short , humanity has a great deal of blood on its hands , spears and guns .
Whether we maintain this kind of eradication of our fellow Earthlings remains to be seen .
Most experts predict grim times , an outcome that will provide Kolbert with the core of her ambitious look at the fate of our planet – and at the fate of the animals who are trying , unsuccessfully , to share it with human beings .

It ’s the environmentalists vs .
The NIMBYS – and Umatilla county property owners are caught in the crossfire
By Oregonians In Action ,
Oregonians
In Action is working closely with Umatilla County property owners to defeat an ordinance proposed by a Umatilla County resident that would create new regulations similar to the Columbia River Gorge Act on over 200,000 acres of Umatilla County .
The purpose of the proposed ordinance is to protect the scenic views in the eastern portion of the county .
The ordinance is being proposed as a Goal 5 amendment to Umatilla County ’s Comprehensive Plan .
Goal 5 is the state ’s natural resources goal , covering scenic views , open spaces , wetlands , riparian areas , historic properties , etc .
The reason for the proposal is unique – a small group of Umatilla County property owners have joined forces with the City of Milton Freewater to fight two companies interested in leasing rural property for “ wind farms . ”
The wind farms are essentially a series of large wind turbines used to generate electricity .
Wind power has long been a favorite of the environmental community , as an alternative to other forms of power generation , such as hydroelectric ( dams ) or coal .
Wind power generation is currently heavily subsidized by government , and its potential to provide sufficient power to serve as a true alternative is questionable .
But companies across the United States have formed to determine whether the technology can work .
Recently , two companies have begun leasing property from Umatilla County farmers and ranchers to install wind turbines .
The company places turbines on the property , and the farmer gets a check , while continuing the agricultural activities on the farm .
It ’s a win-win for the property owner and the company .
But the Milton Freewater City Council and a couple of rural residents have decided that wind turbines are ugly , and offend their visual sensibilities .
As a result , a single property owner has crafted a lengthy ordinance that would impose a “ scenic view overlay ” on the eastern portion of Umatilla County .
And the ordinance affects far more than wind turbines .
Under the terms of the ordinance , nearly all structures would be “ regulated ” on any private property that can be viewed from a highway or county road .
Structures include barns , corrals , pens , and dwellings , along with wind turbines .
Unfortunately , the proposed regulations are so onerous and subjective that they would be impossible to meet .
“ It ’s the environmentalists versus the NIMBYs ” said Dave Hunnicutt , OIA President .
“ Normally , we ’d stay out of that fight .
But in this case , Umatilla County property owners are going to be tremendously impacted , so we ’re involved . ”
The proponents of the ordinance claim that the ordinance is important because having structures that can be viewed by drivers traveling through Umatilla County disrupts the beautiful view of the Blue Mountains , as well as local residents , including the townfolk in Milton Freewater .
One can only imagine the sheer horror that a motorist would encounter upon seeing a well - kept dwelling or barn at the top of a hill .
You can hear them now – “ cover the kids eyes dear , there ’s a house over there !
Of all the nerve ! ”
“ This ordinance is like the Gorge Act on steroids , ” said Hunnicutt .
“ Telling a property owner that they can’t build a house on their property , and telling a farmer that they ca n’t build a barn because it ’s ugly is at the top of government overregulation . ”
At present , the ordinance is before the Umatilla County Planning Commission .
Fortunately , the sponsors of the ordinance have had a difficult time crafting the ordinance in a coherent manner , leaving a muddled mess that changes every time the Planning Commission meets .
Whether the ordinance is ever taken seriously by the Umatilla County Commission is up in the air .
But OIA is ready for a legal fight .
“ If the ordinance is ever adopted , we will appeal , ” said Hunnicutt .
Almost 38.000 patients suffer from rectal cancer per year in the UK A patient with rectal cancer has become the first to have part of their tumour destroyed by ultrasound , say UK doctors .
A team of radiologists , surgeons and oncologists at Hammersmith Hospital in London used high intensity ultrasound to heat up and kill the cancer .
They say the technique will allow faster and more accurate targeting of tumours than conventional treatments .
Hammersmith Hospital will offer the treatment to advanced stage patients .
But one expert cautioned that ultrasound treatment could not deal with all the effects of the cancer on its own .
High intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU ) is carried out under general anaesthetic .
The device can treat tumours up to about 40 cc volume and can heat the tissue up to 90 degrees centigrade First patient
The first patient to have the procedure has requested anonymity .
RECTAL CANCER
Almost 38,000 patients suffer from rectal cancer per year in the UK Approximately a third of these cancers are within the rectum Patients often suffer from tenesmus - a painful condition where they find it difficult to empty their bowels and need frequent trips to the toilet
The patient was given a low dose of heat at 70 degrees .
Doctors say they are planning to treat 50 more patients and they will closely monitor them to discover the most effective temperature at which to perform the procedure .
Unlike radiotherapy , HIFU , can be given to a patient a number of times with minimal risk of toxicity .
The study leader , Professor Paul Abel , from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust , said : " There is no incision made during the procedure , it 's completely non-invasive , so recovery time will be quicker too .
" As this is the first time this procedure has ever been performed for rectal cancer , we need to study a wider group of patients to assess how effective the treatment is and whether it has the potential to be curative or to lengthen a patient 's life . "
A spokesman for the charity Beating Bowel Cancer said it welcomes " advances to improve the quality of patients ' lives and relieve symptoms " .
" As this is a world first , we look forward to further studies and results with more patients over a longer period . "
Dr Robert Glynne - Jones , medical director of Bowel Cancer UK , said the difficulty was that ultrasound could not deal with cases where the cancer had spread into the lymph glands of the body .
He said : " We already have a number of ways of dealing with rectal cancer but this may be useful for when the screening programme gets going and we can see very early tumours in the future . "

After we passed our final inspection , I started designing the costume in Solidworks .
I was thrilled to find that someone had created a 3dStudio max mesh model of the Tauntaun online and was able to download the file and import it directly into my Solidworks drawing !
I also imported the model for a human body into the drawing for scale .
Once the frame and custom stilts were drawn I began construction .

For their part , White House officials took pains to publicly refrain from criticizing the Secret Service .
“ The men and women of the Secret Service put their lives on the line every day to protect us ; they are heroes , and they have the full confidence of the president of United States , ” said Nick Shapiro , a White House spokesman .
“ The White House asked the United States Secret Service to do a full review , and they are doing that .
The United States Secret Service said they made a mistake , and they are taking action to identify exactly what happened , and they will take the appropriate measures pending the results of their investigation . ”
Domestic security experts said that the episode raised serious questions about protection for the president .
Ronald Kessler , author of “ In the President ’s Secret Service : Behind the Scenes With Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect , ” said threats against the president had increased 400 percent since Mr. Obama took office .
On Friday , agents went to a Virginia winery founded by Mr. Salahi ’s father in search of the couple , one administration official said .
A phone call to the establishment , Oasis Winery in Hume , Va. , was not returned .
The winery ’s ownership has been the subject of extensive litigation involving disputes within the family .
The Salahis and the winery were saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of unpaid bills , according to bankruptcy and legal findings in Virginia .
Mr. and Mrs. Salahi , who are known in the area to have a taste for polo and fine wine , are aspiring reality - show celebrities .
For months , the couple have been trailed by camera crews with the cable channel Bravo , as it prepared for a new show , “ The Real Housewives of D.C. ”
Seemingly distancing itself from the Salahis ’ actions , Bravo said Friday that it would not comment about “ ongoing investigations . ”
Earlier , the channel said that while its cameras were filming the Salahis before the dinner , producers were told by the couple that they had been invited to it .
The Salahis have not officially been selected for the “ Housewives ” show .
“ The decision as to who will be included in the series will not be made for several months , ” Bravo said Friday .
SPY gunning was part of the Fed 's spring / summer collection .
Fall / Winter is all about the ES .
With all the SPY IOIAs broadcast for the world to see , and JPM 's clients not too happy that pop media like Zero Hedge makes it all too obvious when Jamie Dimon 's boys are executing market manipulation orders for their prime quant clients , the latest way to drive the market higher , especially on days like , well , everyday when there is no volume to speak of , is by AUG - Steyring the futures market .
Our friend , the Pragmatic Capitalist does a pretty , pretty , pretty convicing job of demonstrating just how that happens .
I do n’t know if any characteristic of this massive 6 month rally has been more apparent than the huge futures run-ups we ’ve seen at random points during the trading day .
Without news , the S&P 500 futures get gunned on huge volume and surge higher .
I ’ve seen it at least every other day for 6 months .
It tends to occur on low volume days such as the one we ’re currently experiencing .
As you can see in the chart below , the futures are getting gunned on massive volume without any coinciding volume in SPY .
This means an institution is jamming the futures higher knowing that they can drive the market higher on no volume .
Effectively , they can take out every asking price with a large enough order and immediately create a 0.25 % bump in the market in no time .
If you ’ve been wondering why we ’ve seen huge surges on low volume days and conviction high volume selling on down days this explains much of it .
I do n’t know if there is malfeasance behind this or if the buyer is simply too stupid to input trades at the bid ( like most rational investors do as they try to achieve the best low price ) , but this is certainly an odd phenomenon that I cannot recall occurring so routinely over the course of my career .
Who is the mystery institutional buyer that just needs to place their huge block orders with such urgency ?
And in the " more tin-foil hat " category we present this report by the black helicopter fearing men of Grant Thornton which summarizes many of our , Themis Trading , as well as Senator Kaufman and Schumer 's concerns about what is happening to the no-longer free markets , and in fact , the overall economy , courtesy of the casino style strategies that have become the norm with the advent of high frequency trading .
It may have cost 22 million jobs , but at least HFT provides liquidity and tightens spreads in AIG , C and FNM .
Fair tradeoff .
Some highlights :

There are thought to be hundreds of tunnels along the border Egypt has begun constructing a huge metal wall along its border with the Gaza Strip as it attempts to cut smuggling tunnels , the BBC has learned .
When it is finished the wall will be 10 - 11 km ( 6 - 7 miles ) long and will extend 18 metres below the surface .
The Egyptians are being helped by American army engineers , who the BBC understands have designed the wall .
The plan has been shrouded in secrecy , with no comment or confirmation from the Egyptian government .
The wall will take 18 months to complete .
For weeks local farmers have noticed more activity at the border where trees were being cut down , but very few of them were aware that a barrier was being built .
' Impenetrable '
That is because the barrier , made of super - strength steel , has been hidden deep underground .
The BBC has been told that it was manufactured in the US , that it fits together in similar fashion to a jigsaw , and that it has been tested to ensure it is bomb proof .
US officials have though denied to the BBC that they are involved in building or supplying the wall .
When we get a political solution , there will be no need for tunnels .
I do n't think this new wall will affect the smuggling , we are talking about thousands of tunnels

Egypt's Gaza barrier : Your views
The reports say the wall cannot be cut or melted - in short it is impenetrable .
Intelligence sources in Egypt say the barrier is being sunk close to the perimeter wall that already exists .
They claim 4 km of the wall has already been completed north of the Rafah crossing , with work now beginning to the south .
The land beneath Egypt and Gaza resembles a Swiss cheese , full of holes and tunnels through which the Palestinians smuggle the everyday items they are denied by the blockade .
But the Israelis say the tunnels are also used to smuggle people , weapons , and the components of the rockets that are fired at southern Israeli towns .
The wall is not expected to stop all the smuggling , but it will force the Palestinians to go deeper and it will likely cut the hundreds of superficial tunnels closer to the surface that are used to move the bulk of the goods .

On the Modern Perl Books blog , chromatic wrote a post titled " From Novice to Adept : On Answers to Smart Questions " where he mentions my comment to a previous feature of his there .
I am flattered that chromatic decided to expand upon my comment .
Quoting my comment : I agree with you about it .
However , idioms are nice and dandy , but naturally , when going on IRC , one can often open the Pandora box of the colour of the bike shed argument .
For example should it be : Person -> new ( first => " Sophie " , ' last ' => " Cohen " , birth_year => 1977 , ) ; Or : Person -> new ( { first => " Sophie " , ' last ' => " Cohen " , birth_year => 1977 , } ) ; ( with a hash ref ) I tend to think the second option is better because it 's probably a bit faster ( not that it matters a lot ) , and because it will warn about an " odd number of hash elements " earlier , but there 's a lot of code on CPAN out there that uses the first option , because it involves somewhat less syntax .
In one of my modules , I supported only the second option , and a programmer who was after my T - shirt offer , implemented convulted code to have it either with a single hash - ref or flattened into @_ , which I had to reject .
Naturally , this is just the tip of the iceberg .
Brace indentation , placement of HTML opening and closing tags , whether HTML should be nicely indented ( even if generated by a server - side language ) , or instead occupy as little space as possible , whether you should sub-class sub new {... } or sub _init {....} etc. etc. are all a matter of much debate , and they are pretty much a bike shed colour 's argument ( while they often do have some points for and against ) .
I think it 's important for a beginner ( in Perl or in any other language ) to distinguish between such minor matters and non-idiomatic code , and that it is even more important for an expert to see past his own preferences for the bike shed 's colour when helping newcomers .
chromatic discusses it in the page above , and gives some advice for newbies who want to avoid getting confused from such discussions on personal style and conventions .
Often , matters such as those of indentation and whitespace or placement of braces have some good and valid arguments either way , but they are still a bike shed colour argument , and as such should be either enforced globally by the project or workplace , or alternatively a programmer can do what they prefer on their personal project .
The latest wrinkle in the public option debate ( via Politico initially ) is a proposal that comes from Senator Tom Carper , the Delaware Democrat that sits on the Finance committee .
According to the proposal 's latest draft , which Carper 's staff is circulating but -- I 'm told -- Carper himself is not really hawking yet , the idea is to let states set up their own alternative coverage options .
Those options include starting a non -profit co-operative , opening up the benefits plan for state employees , or , yes , starting a real public plan .
There 's no trigger , at least in the document I 've seen .
All it would take would be action by a state legislature , signed by that state 's governor .
And states would be free to join with other states and create joint plans .
But there would be various restrictions :
A state could n't create a public plan that tied reimbursements to federal Medicare rates ( even with a higher percentage added on ) and they could n't compel providers to participate .
In these respects , states would be free to create relatively weak public plans -- like the compromise measure Senator Charles Schumer has proposed -- but not relatively strong ones -- like the version Senator Jay Rockefeller has put forward .
One interesting question is whether the proposal is already redundant , thanks to an amendment that another member of the Finance committee , Ron Wyden , introduced that Chairman Max Baucus accepted before the hearings even began .
There is water on the moon , NASA confirmed today , and lots of it .
In the first look at results from the LCROSS mission , which sent a probe crashing into the Cabeus crater near the moon 's south pole , NASA 's main investigator said their instruments clearly detected water , despite the underwhelming plume .
Within the field of view of their instruments , the team measured approximately 220 pounds or about 26 gallons of water .
Next , the team will try to understand how the compounds they saw in the plume relate to what 's actually embedded in the lunar regolith at the bottom of the permanently shadowed crater .
" We need to take all the information — the amount of ejecta , the size of the crater — and reconstruct the entire event and understand how it all fits back into the ground , " Colaprete said at a NASA Ames press conference .
For about a decade , lunar scientists have known the moon contained a lot of hydrogen , thanks to the Lunar Prospector mission , but it was n't entirely clear what form that hydrogen was stored in .
Now , the LCROSS observations provide a handy explanation for the hydrogen :
It 's bound with oxygen to form water .
Other analyses have also provided evidence that water exists on the moon , including most recently , the Indian satellite Chandrayaan .
But the latest LCROSS observations are different .
" [ Chandrayaan ] could not see into the shadowed craters .
Their observation is entirely unique and complimentary .
We looked inside the shadowed craters .
The amounts and flavors could be distinctly different , " Colaprete said .
" They saw water bound and adsorbed in grains .
We saw , potentially , real crystalline water ice . "
Combined with the various confirmations of water ice on Mars , it 's becoming clear that water — at least in ice form — is present throughout our solar system .
Astronomers are gaining a new appreciation for celestial bodies that once seemed rather staid .
" [ LCROSS ] is painting a really surprising new picture of the moon .
This is not your father 's moon , " said Greg Delory of the University of California , Berkeley .
" Rather than a dead and unchanging world , it could be a dynamic and interesting one . "
Delory , who is not on the LCROSS team , also called the discovery " exciting and extraordinary , " saying lunar science could now move on to other fascinating questions .
" What 's equally important is what we do next , " Delory said .
" Where did the water come from ?
How long has it been there ?
What kind of processes are involved in putting it there and removing it and destroying it ? "
There are all kinds of sources for the water , Delory said .
It could come from comets , the solar wind , the moon itself or even the Earth .
" Now that we know that water is there we can begin in earnest to go to the next set of questions , " he said .
And answering them could tell us a lot about the solar system and its planetary bodies ' relationship to water , which is necessary to all forms of life we know .
Colaprete may have another surprise in waiting , hinting that they glimpsed other interesting compounds in the plume that arose from Cabeus crater .
" This goes beyond the water , there 's a lot of stuff that came out of there , " Colaprete said , before saying he did n't want to say " too much beyond " that .
Delory was equally excited but circumspect saying , " I 'm sure the LCROSS team is going to reveal new and exciting discoveries as they continue to analyze their data . "
So , while the first LCROSS surprise — the wimpy plume — was disappointing , perhaps the next one the mission delivers will be happy .

( CNN ) -- Rock star Courtney Love has lost custody over her daughter Frances Bean Cobain .
Two legal guardians have been appointed to care for Frances Bean , Love 's 17 - year - old daughter with the deceased Nirvana front man , Kurt Cobain , CNN has confirmed .
According to legal documents originally obtained by TMZ.com , the court has appointed Kurt Cobain 's mother , Wendy O'Connor , and his sister , Kimberly Dawn Cobain , to watch over the minor .
Geraldine Wyle , an attorney for O'Connor and Cobain , confirmed to CNN that an order of temporary guardianship has been granted to her clients and said the issue was a " private family matter . "
A court hearing has been scheduled on the issue for February 10 .
This is not the first time that Love has been in court to discuss issues within her family .
In 2003 , Frances Bean was temporarily placed under the care of O'Connor after Love was arrested and accused in an attempted break - in at an ex-boyfriend 's home , overdosed on painkillers and made a suicide threat .
Love admitted a misdemeanor charge of being under the influence of a controlled substance .
She regained custody in 2005 .
" Life is about choices , " Love said in 2005 .
" And I 've chosen to move forward with my life in a healthy and positive way . "
Frances Bean , who turns 18 in August , told Harper 's Bazaar magazine last year that she does n't want to live in the shadow of her famous parents forever .
" I get it , I really do , " she said .
" But at the same time it 's creepy .
These people are fascinated by me , but I have n't done anything .
If you 're a big Nirvana fan , a big Hole fan , then I understand why you would want to get to know me , but I 'm not my parents . "
BERKELEY —
A marathon standoff ended peacefully with the release of scores of protesters who occupied Wheeler Hall on the UC Berkeley campus for more than 12 hours Friday .
The protesters , who barricaded themselves in a second - story classroom , were cited for misdemeanor trespassing and released in small groups beginning about 7:30 p.m.
Afterward , police stood guard outside the building into the night .
The sound of demonstrators chanting “ This is what democracy looks like ” filled the air as police led the protesters out .
They then joined the massive crowds that had gathered around Wheeler Hall throughout the day .
One of the released protesters , a woman who did not give her name , said she was surprised at the size of the crowd .
“ I knew there were people outside , but I did n’t realize there were so many , ” she said .
The protest against increased student fees began about 7:30 a.m. , with those inside using a bullhorn to yell at demonstrators gathered outside , accusing police of “ coming in swinging ” and using pepper spray .
The demonstrators had hung a sign out a window that read “ 32 Percent Hike , 900 layoffs , ” with the word “ Class ” crossed out in red .
Outside the building , dozens of supporters gathered throughout the day as word of the protest spread — including online via Twitter posts supposedly from protesters inside the building .
Supporters brought food and water to be tossed up to the demonstrators throughout the afternoon .
The students originally bolted themselves inside Wheeler Hall but were forced to flee upstairs when authorities forced their way in and occupied the building except for the second - floor classroom where the protesters had gathered .
Three students were separated from the larger group and arrested , said UC police Capt .
Margo Bennett .
Aakash Desai , one of the arrested students , later said he and the other two arrested were charged with felony burglary .
All three were released about 5:30 p.m. , he said .
Bennett refuted claims that officers had used unnecessary force on the protesters .
But police presence was heavy .
The Alameda County Sheriff ’s
Office sent in deputies to back up the UC and Berkeley police , whose officers were dressed in riot gear and carried batons and rubber bullet rifles .
An officer was taken to the hospital early Friday , but it was not known what the extent or causes of the injuries were .
As the day wore on , tempers flared between demonstrators and officers .
A Berkeley police officer hit a young woman in the face between her eyebrows with his baton during a scuffle on the northeast side of Wheeler Hall .
Organizers struggled to keep the situation calm by telling the angry protesters to sit down and not to provoke the officers .
About 3,800 students were affected as classes were canceled at Wheeler , which houses the English Department .
Several other campus buildings were shut down as a routine precaution , university officials said .
Activities in other campus buildings were disrupted by falsely activating fire alarms , officials added .
Crowds cheered wildly as activists reiterated Friday night the demands that led to the occupation of the building .
Among other demands , they called for a repeal of the 32 percent fee hike , the reinstatement of fired custodians and for the firing of the UC President Mark Yudof , who students blamed for the circumstances leading to the protest .
Elsewhere , protesters who on Thursday took over Kerr Hall , the home of UC Santa Cruz administration , continued to demonstrate Friday .
The campus closed Kerr Hall because of safety concerns , and students were also occupying Kresge Town Hall .
Students reportedly stayed overnight in both locations .
No arrests have been reported , though administrators are considering other punishment .
Several hundred students and faculty rallied for an hour outside Kerr Hall beginning at noon Friday .
“ We need to keep mobilizing and keep coming out here , ” graduate student Mark Paschal yelled into a bullhorn .
“ It ’s the only way — if we join together . ”
Thirty to 50 protesters staged a takeover of Campbell Hall at UCLA on Thursday , as regents met across campus to approve the fee hike .
More than 50 students were arrested Thursday during protests at UC Davis .
Staff writers Doug Oakley and Kristin Bender , the Santa Cruz Sentinel and The Associated Press contributed to this story .

Most of the crew - not to mention your fellow jarheads - will be leaving the ship in lifeboats .
They 'll ride to the surface in air conditioned comfort , sipping wine , and nibbling on appetizers .
Not you , however .
Oh no , you 're going to leave the Pillar of Autumn in a different method .
Tell me boys and girls … how will you leave ?
We go feet first , sir !
— Shock Trooper 's response .
The Orbital Drop Shock Troopers ( ODST ) are a special operations capable organization of the UNSC Marine Corps that specialize in orbital - dropped shock infantry and special warfare tactics .
The ODSTs are one of the primary Special Operations units of the United Nations Space Command , and is under the supervision of Naval Special Warfare Command .
[ 2 ]
ODST primary HQ is located at Kenosha , Mars . [ 3 ]
Contents show ]
History Edit
Origins Edit
While the concept of dropping human soldiers from orbit had been around since the mid 21st century , the first iterations of the ODST were n't established until 2129 .
[3 ]
One of the names for these iterations were the " Drop Jet Platoons . " [ 4 ]
Officially , the Orbital Drop Shock Trooper came into being in 2163 . [ 3 ]
At the conclusion of the Rainforest Wars and the Jovian Moons campaign , the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers were a fully established force and participated in every high risk operation during those conflicts .
However , the conclusion of these conflicts in 2170 , along with the signing of the Callisto Treaty and the subsequent years that followed , the ODSTs saw little action as more political , and more important issues such as overpopulation and famine and a massive military with no purpose gripped the postwar nations of Earth . [ 5 ]
The first major combat re-emergence of the ODSTs occurred in 2490 during the beginnings of the civil conflict between the UEG and the Insurrection .
Using the ORIONs as exemplary models , the reputation of the ODSTs , as well as their training , was restored and enhanced as time passed .
In the years leading up to 2525 , the ODSTs would once again conduct high risk operations against the Insurrectionists , to either stop the enemy before they could carry out attacks against supporters and officials of the Earth Government or to cut off major suppliers to the Insurrectionists .
Human - Covenant war Edit
Early War Edit
On November 1 , 2525 , the UNSC moved into a full alert status after the devastating and horrifying first contact with the Covenant at Harvest ; this marked a change in objectives for the ODSTs , who up until that point had been fighting the Insurrectionists .
As humanity 's military turned to meet the threat of the Covenant , divisions of ODSTs prepared to participate in the most critical engagements in the war and also to conduct the riskiest missions in the history of mankind .
The Battle of Hat Yai marked one of the first deployments of ODSTs against Covenant ground forces .
Although the planet was lost in the ensuing conflict , fortunately , the ODSTs were successfully extracted before the UNSC retreated .
In 2526 , ODST 's were dropped onto Circinius IV to assist in the defense of the planet , but all were lost over the course of the battle .
Not long after the Harvest Campaign , the ODSTs participated in the Battle of Arcadia where they assisted Marine forces and SPARTAN - II Red Team in defending the capital city from Covenant ground forces , thus allowing the evacuation of the civilian population .
Having successfully kept Covenant forces from occupying the city , the Corps began launching multiple assaults on the Covenant 's bases of operations to reclaim the planet .
Several ODST battalions joined UNSC Spirit of Fire 's rescue operation after retaking the planet and soon participated in the Battle of Shield 0459 .
Following the enactment of the Cole Protocol in 2535 , ODST combat teams were tasked with boarding commercial and private vessels and purging their navigation databases .
During one of these routine operations , a group of ODSTs aboard UNSC Midsummer Night were captured and taken to The Rubble .
They , in conjunction with SPARTAN - II Gray Team , would later defeat a Kig - Yar plan to trick the inhabitants of the Rubble out of their navigation data , which could compromise the location of Earth .
Late War Edit
As the Covenant - Human war progressed , the ODSTs would go on to participate in many engagements ; among these were the Battle of Jericho VII , an assassination mission on Heian , the Battle of Skopje , the Battle of Sigma Octanus IV , the Battle of New Jerusalem , the Battle of Tribute , and the Battle of Ariel .
The numerous campaigns and operations in which the ODSTs participated throughout the long war all pale in comparison to the Fall of Reach in 2552 , during which countless ODSTs lost their lives defending strategic locations on the planet .
Reach Edit
During the initial invasion of Reach , a large contingent of 3,200 ODSTs participated in the Battle of Viery , assisting the UNSC Army in repelling the Covenant forces from the planet .
Throughout the course of the battle , the UNSC formed joint forces to combat against the overwhelming Covenant forces .
Some time during the event , several battalions were stationed on UNSC Pillar of Autumn .
As the planet fell to the Covenant onslaught , the vessel made a blind Slipspace jump away from the Epsilon Eridani system , discovering the long - abandoned Installation 04 .
During the Battle of Installation 04 , shock troopers led by Major Antonio Silva and First Lieutenant Melissa McKay , operated as a guerrilla force by conducting hit - and - run operations against the forces of the Covenant 's Fleet of Particular Justice . [ 6 ]
Earth Edit
Fresh from the disastrous loss of Reach , the ODSTs participated in the most significant battle of the entire war : the Battle of Earth .
The battle began on October 20 , 2552 , when the Fleet of Sacred Consecration led by the Prophet of Regret jumped into the Sol System .
ODST combat teams , along with the Marines , began engaging Covenant forces on the Orbital Defense Platforms Cairo , Athens , and Malta .
Despite the ODSTs ' valiant efforts , Malta and Athens were destroyed .
As the Covenant ship carrying the Prophet of Regret landed over the African city New Mombasa , teams of ODSTs were deployed over the city from orbit in an attempt to board the carrier .
Before the teams could reach the target , however , the carrier jumped into slipspace .
Only Alpha - Nine managed to safely land in the city to carryout the retrieval of the Superintendent 's data .
After Regret 's unexpected retreat from New Mombasa , members of the 7th Shock Troops Battalion would later drop from UNSC In Amber Clad onto Installation 05 during the Battle of Installation 05 in an effort to kill the Prophet of Regret . [ 7 ]
Most of these troopers would perish during the initial firefights against the Covenant , and only a few would escape back to Earth with Lieutenant Commander Miranda Keyes to lead a resistance against the Covenant occupation forces . [ 8 ]
Overall , the defense of Earth was one of the largest campaigns the ODSTs fought in during the entire war .
The fighting spread across the globe and in space as the Fleet of Furious Redemption and the Prophet of Truth 's own fleet attacked the remnants of the Orbital Defense Grid .
The fleets soon deployed troops throughout the continents of North America , South America , Europe and Asia .
The Battle of Cleveland is one example of the ODSTs ' participation during the war on Earth .
Two ODSTs from the 2nd Shock Troops Battalion fought alongside a detachment of Marines in the Battle of Sector Six . [ 9 ]
Troopers T. Rymann and S. Hartley were tasked with calculating the crash site of John - 117 on Earth , while a Marine battalion was tasked with defending a narrow corridor between Covenant and UNSC forces in Pakistan .
Bravo - 21 and numerous Marines were killed in the clash , while Bravo - 22 was injured along with some of the other surviving Marines .
Their actions successfully allowed HIGHCOM to track and locate the Spartan .
Installation 00 Edit
After the opening of the Artifact in November of 2552 , the 11th Marine Force Reconnaissance / ODST , stationed aboard UNSC Forward Unto Dawn , fought alongside John - 117 , during Operation : BLIND FAITH . [ 10 ]
Men and women from this battalion were also some of the first humans to travel outside the Milky Way galaxy , during the Battle of Installation 00 . [ 11 ]
One such assault happened during a mission to destroy numerous Covenant Type - 27 Anti-Aircraft Cannons overlooking a desert .
These AA guns were destroyed by the ODSTs , allowing UNSC Forward Unto Dawn to successfully land near the Cartographer building . [ 11 ]
During the last battle of the Ark campaign - the last battle of the war - ODSTs were again airlifted into combat .
This time , they punched holes in Covenant armor and artillery positions to allow John - 117 and Thel ' Vadam to eliminate the Prophet of Truth . [ 12 ]
This section requires expansion .
Duties Edit
The ODSTs perform highly specialized , small scale , high - risk operations including : [ 2 ]
Deep Ground Surveillance or Long Range Reconnaissance : Patrols in small groups , in uniform , usually far behind the enemy lines .
While DGS units may direct air or artillery strikes against enemy positions , they strive to be unobserved , and have only self - defense , not DA , capability .
Groups engaging in surveillance deep behind enemy lines , are commonly known as " Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols " or LRRP's .

Direct Action : Short - duration strikes and other small - scale offensive actions conducted as a special operation in hostile , denied , or politically sensitive environments and which employ specialized military capabilities to seize , destroy , capture , exploit , recover , or damage designated targets .
Direct action differs from conventional offensive actions in the level of physical and political risk , operational techniques , and the degree of discriminate and precise use of force to achieve specific objectives .

Uniform Edit
Battle Dress Uniform Edit
Main article : ODST battle armor
The ODST Battle Dress Uniform is the signature piece of equipment used by the ODSTs - the armor is vacuum - rated , capable of extravehicular activity for fifteen minutes .
The ODST BDU has been in use for well over 50 years by the 105th , and remains untouched by its ability to protect its wearer during the toughest operations .[ citation needed ]
The ODST helmet is standard for Helljumpers .
In 2535 the MJOLNIR / AA entered service as a less venerable helmet from the regular ODST Helmet .
Armament Edit
Infantry Edit
Due to their Special Operations status , Orbital Drop Shock Troopers are equipped with most of the weaponry used throughout the UNSC , regardless of branch of service .
While not given the same level of resources as the SPARTANs , they are able to complete missions considered too dangerous for normal infantry , using whatever weapons that are available .
Specialized weaponry used by the ODST are suppressed weapons , primarily the M7S Caseless Submachine Gun and the M6C / SOCOM .
Vehicles Edit
Human Entry Vehicles Edit
Main article : Single Occupant Exoatmospheric Insertion Vehicle
The Single Occupant Exoatmospheric Insertion Vehicle ( abbreviated SOEIV ) is a tear - drop shaped pod made of Titanium - A , Lead Foil and coated with ceramic skin .
The SOEIV is the signature piece of equipment used by the ODSTs and is known for its risks and intense heat which has garner the ODST nickname Helljumpers .
Armed Assault Boats Edit
Main article : Armed Assault Boat
Armed Assault Boats were aircraft used by the UNSC Navy and Marine Corps , to deploy troopers for air assaults .
However , the armed assault boats proved to be ineffective , taking heavy fire once within ground firing range and were also very slow .
At some point they were replaced by the SOEIV . [ 6 ]
Subordinates Edit
Personnel Edit
The Orbital Drop Shock Troopers are one of many Special Operations Forces in the UNSC Defense Force .
The ODSTs are under the exclusive operational authority of the Naval Special Warfare Command / Naval Special Weapons .
Their methods of operation allow them to conduct missions against targets that more conventional forces cannot approach undetected .
ODSTs are recruited from all three services ( UNSC Marine Corps , Army , and Navy ) [ 13 ] and from the Special Operations Groups of every nation of the Unified Earth Government and are a strictly all volunteer fighting force .
Potential ODSTs are selected because of their performance in their chosen MOS ; every ODST candidate is a veteran from another Special Operations outfit and therefore has already gone through at least two layers of screening and months of intense training — not counting the years of training received before volunteering for the ODSTs .
There are no age or gender restrictions — as long as the candidate meets the physical and mental requirements they are guaranteed the opportunity to try out for the ODSTs .
Once in the ODSTs , a candidate 's training continues - its entrance requirements serve as a third layer of screening upon two more , where applicants would have theoretically failed to pass .
Candidates would , therefore , already have extensive experience in conducting the types of high - risk missions that the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers typically perform .
List Edit
The status of each trooper is in accordance with their last known appearance .
Units Edit
Main article : List of UNSC Military Units
ODST units are not embedded within conventional UNSC forces ; they do however participate in joint operations , and tend to be force multipliers - increasing the effectiveness and morale of those they fight alongside .
ODST combat teams usually consist of six to eight ODST Troopers - with each combat team specializing in a particular mission set , but they are expected to be flexible enough to adapt to any given situation .
These combat teams however can vary from company to company .
Each combat team also consists of ten to fourteen operators , each of whom has a specific function on the team . [ 15 ]
ODSTs are known for their unusual methods of insertion , dropping from orbit onto terrestrial environments .
Similar to their ground - based counterparts , the ODSTs maintain units of varying strength aboard many UNSC vessels and Installations .
List Edit
Gameplay Edit
The Orbital Drop Shock Troopers are a playable unit in Halo Wars .
They are available in a few missions of the Campaign but are only available as the final upgrade for the Marine unit in Skirmish Mode if the player chose Captain Cutter as their hero unit .
In the Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary Firefight level , Installation 04 , some ODSTs are found on top of the Forerunner signal tower .
If an ODST is transformed into a Flood Combat Form , their armor will become that of a Marine Battle Dress Uniform .
This is because the game engine does not have any code to transform the ODST into an ODST Combat Form .
Trivia Edit
On the right side of an ODST 's body armor is a Chinese character which , when translated , means roughly " complete badass , " a reference to the ODSTs ' hardcore attitude .
Putting these symbols together spells the Chinese word " 混蛋 , " which translates to " asshole . "
In Halo : Uprising , when the ODSTs drop off the Hornets , they use a sort of cable they keep inside their belt , much like modern day armed forces off of a helicopter .

Aboard the carrier UNSC Atlas , John - 117 had a confrontational moment with four ODSTs in the ship 's gym .
John had removed a pin from the weights at the bench press , and forgot to put it back .
The ODSTs walked into the gym and went straight to the bench press .
The weights fell and almost crushed one of the soldiers ' feet .
A fight ensued and John killed three of the ODSTs and severely injured the other .
Ever since then , relations between the Spartans and the ODSTs have been tensed and uneasy . [ 6 ] [ 17 ]
However , this does not seem to stop them from working to their utmost efficiency during the Fall of Reach , [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Battle of Installation 05 [ 20 ] and Battle of Installation 00 . [ 11 ]

Strangely enough , the ODSTs in Halo : Reach are seen using standard - issue UNSC Army weapons , instead of ones normally used by Marines , the branch that the ODSTs belong to .
The reason for this is unknown , though it is most likely for gameplay purposes .
An in -continuity explanation could be that the ODSTs borrowed weapons from the army due to lack of supplies or maybe losing their own weapons in battle .

The story of the seduction of a lesbian by an ageing stage actor , which includes an eye - watering scene with a green dildo , has won Philip Roth the dubious honour of a place on the shortlist for the Literary Review 's bad sex in fiction award .
Roth can comfort himself with the fact that a roll call of literary fiction 's great and good , from Booker winner John Banville to acclaimed Israeli novelist Amos Oz , Goncourt winner Jonathan Littell and Whitbread winner Paul Theroux , have made it into the line - up for this year 's bad sex prize , set up by Auberon Waugh to " draw attention to the crude , tasteless , often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel , and to discourage it " .
On a shortlist of 10 , singer Nick Cave was picked for his second novel The Death of Bunny Munro , about a sex - obsessed door - to - door salesman .
" Frankly we would have been offended if he was n't shortlisted , " said Anna Frame at his publisher Canongate .
The Pulitzer prize - winning Roth makes the line - up for The Humbling , in which the ageing actor Simon converts Pegeen , a lesbian , to heterosexuality .
The Literary Review singled out a scene in which Simon and Pegeen pick up a girl from a bar and convince her to take part in a threesome .
Simon looks on as Pegeen uses her green dildo to great effect .
" This was not soft porn .
This was no longer two unclothed women caressing and kissing on a bed .
There was something primitive about it now , this woman - on - woman violence , as though in the room filled with shadows , Pegeen were a magical composite of shaman , acrobat , and animal .
It was as if she were wearing a mask on her genitals , a weird totem mask , that made her into what she was not and was not supposed to be , " writes Roth .
" There was something dangerous about it .
His heart thumped with excitement – the god Pan looking on from a distance with his spying , lascivious gaze . "
' Roth is very anxious about his description of sex , " said Jonathan Beckman at the Literary Review of the extract .
" Why write of a scene that repeatedly features a green dildo , ' this was not soft porn ' , unless you 're worried that it might be taken as such - in this case , with sentences like ' then she crouched above Tracy , brushing Tracy 's lips and nipples with her mouth and fondling her breasts ...' , the worry seems justified .
But it 's the overcompensation that qualifies this passage for the award – the totems and shamans are an attempt to convince us that Roth 's leering is actually giving some vital anthropological insight . "
Sanjida O'Connell is the only woman to make the Bad Sex shortlist , selected for The Naked Name of Love , about a young Jesuit priest who is taught how to love by a gifted shaman woman on the eastern steppes of Mongolia .
Beckman said the line - up for the 17th annual Bad Sex prize was " very strong , with a good mix of well - known writers and others who are less well - known " .
Also shortlisted are the first novel from Independent film critic Anthony Quinn , set at the outbreak of the first world war , Simon Van Booy 's love - themed short story collection Love Begins in Winter , and 23 - year - old Richard Milward 's novel Ten Storey Love Song .
Comprising just one paragraph and replete with graphic sex scenes , Milward 's second novel follows the story of Bobby the Artist as he becomes a star and then sinks into drug - induced psychosis .
Milward , who accepted the prize in 2007 on behalf of the late Norman Mailer , said he " would have been upset " if he had n't been shortlisted this year .
" I 've been there before and I 'll be there again ..
There 's so much bad sex in my book that this is a nice accolade , " he said .
" Some authors spend five pages describing a walk in the park but when it comes to sex they 'll just do two sentences - ' she rolled off him ' .
Sex is exciting stuff - it can be vey dirty and smelly , but you 've just got to get stuck in , and I 'm not afraid of doing that . "
The winner of the award , a plaster foot , will be announced on 30 November at London 's
In & Out club .
Last year 's prize was won by Rachel Johnson for her novel Shire Hell , in which at one point the heroine makes a " grab , to put him , now angrily slapping against both our bellies , inside " .
Previous winners include Sebastian Faulks , AA Gill and Giles Coren , while last year 's ceremony also saw John Updike given a lifetime achievement prize after four consecutive nominations .
The shortlist
Paul Theroux for A Dead Hand
Nick Cave for The Death of Bunny Munro
Philip Roth for The Humbling
Jonathan Littell for The Kindly Ones
Amos Oz for Rhyming Life and Death
John Banville for The Infinities
Anthony Quinn for The Rescue Man
Simon Van Booy for Love Begins in Winter
Sanjida O'Connell for The Naked Name of Love
Richard Milward for Ten Storey Love Song
It ’s that point in the NFL season where NBC can start to flex their muscle and change the NFL schedule .
The first game that can be flexed out this year is in Week Eleven .
NBC has to make their decision by tomorrow , November 10th .
So will they or wo n’t they boot the Philadelphia Eagles at the Chicago Bears from primetime ?
On the surface the Eagles at Bears looks like it could be a good matchup .
Both teams are fighting for playoff berths in the NFC , the Eagles are at 5 - 3 while the Bears stand at 4 - 4 .
NBC can also play off the Donovan McNabb heading home to the Windy City as well , something that ’s always played when he visits his hometown .
But is all of that enough ?
I do n’t think it will be , I ’m thinking this game is toast .
It ’s moving to the afternoon whether either side likes it or not .
Especially after the dud the Eagles put up last night against the Dallas Cowboys on primetime .
So what games could fill the soon to be open primetime slot ?
In my opinion there are four games that NBC should consider .
First and foremost is the Indianapolis Colts at the Baltimore Ravens .
The Ravens are only 4 - 4 but they ’ll be playing the potentially undefeated Colts at home .
If the Colts get past the New England Patriots this Sunday then this would be one of the only contests left that could derail a perfect season .
Would NBC select this game in hopes that the Colts continue their streak ?
I think it ’s a strong possibility especially with how much they love the Peyton Manning led Colts .
Another is the Atlanta Falcons at the New York Giants .
Much like the Eagles / Bears this is a contest of two teams fighting for playoff berths in the NFC .
Falcons are 5 - 3 , Giants 5 - 4 . The G - Men are on a 4 - game losing streak but will be well rested coming off a bye week .
The potential explosiveness of both of these offenses could lead NBC to take this over the currently selected game .
NBC also loves the other Manning brother , Eli , so this game definitely has a chance .
The San Diego Chargers ( 5 - 3 ) and Denver Broncos ( 6 - 1 ) also a strong chance to replace the Bears on Sunday night .
The Broncos have been stellar all season and beat the Bolts 34 - 23 in Week Six .
Since then thou the Chargers have gone on a 3 - game winning streak and are fresh off a last minute win in the Meadowlands .
Could that last minute win over the Giants compel NBC to select this game ?
One last possibility is the always interesting New York Jets and the New England Patriots , in Foxboro .
The Jets are two games back of the Pats .
They ’ll be looking to get back in the race and look to avenge a 16 - 9 loss in Week Two .
That game was an ugly defensive struggle , with a strong possibility that should happen again especially with Mark Sanchez ’s struggles this year .
Is that something that NBC would want to put on in primetime , even with the storylines ?
Like I said earlier that Eagles / Bears game is gone , I do n’t think there is much a chance at all that NBC keeps that game .
The question is what game do they take .
I think they ’ll go for the Colts / Ravens .
If any defense could shut Peyton Manning down it would be the Ravens D . The real question is would CBS waste one of their limited pull backs ?
It ’s still only the middle of the season and there could be much more compelling games later in the year that CBS would want to protect .
If the Colts could win this week and next week , there ’s a very good chance that the Colts would be undefeated when they play the Broncos in Week 14 .
That ’s a contest they ’d definitely want to protect .
With the viewing public not knowing the number of games each station can protect its hard to predict if just one pull back is a waste or not .
But if it was me I ’d let NBC take the Colts / Ravens game if they want it .
Once again , I ’ll make my prediction it ’s going to be the Indianapolis Colts at Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football in Week Eleven , not the Eagles and Bears .

When oil prices shot over $ 100 a barrel a year ago , I was inundated with press releases from inventors claiming they had an engine that would solve the energy crisis .
In most cases , I simply deleted each release and went on with my work .
You see , I 've seen this all before .
The same thing happened after the oil shocks of the 1970s .
All kinds of inventors came up with all kinds of engine designs , promising to solve the country 's energy problem .
But not one of those engines ever made it into production .
In most cases these new designs only existed on paper .
In other cases , the efforts were led by people who had no clue what it takes to break into the automotive industry .
Think about it .
In the last 100 years only three engines have made it into mass production : the gasoline engine , the diesel engine , and the rotary .
And only Mazda has stuck with the rotary .
But recently I got to see a new type of engine that makes me think it might have a chance .
Part of that has to do with the design of the engine .
The other part has to do with who is behind the project .
____________________________________________________________________________________John

Every week he brings his unique insights as an auto industry insider to Autoblog readers .
____________________________________________________________________________________Eco
Motors is the name of a new company that has come up with a radically new type of engine .
It has two opposing pistons in two contiguous cylinders , connected to a common crankshaft in the middle of the engine .
An electric supercharger provides boost on demand .
It 's a two - stroke engine with no valves , yet still achieves 90 % scavenging efficiency with less oil consumption than a four - stroke engine .
In other words , it 's a two - stroke engine that can meet the strictest emissions standards .
It can be made as a spark - ignited or compression - ignition engine , and the diesel version can meet emission standards without using urea .
Believe me , my description does not do this engine justice .
Click on the accompanying videos to get a better understanding of how this works .
%Video -897 % Eco
Motors calls this the OPOC engine , which stands for opposed piston , opposed cylinder .
The most intriguing part is that it's a design which is half the size and uses half the parts of a conventional piston engine .
Eco claims it can be built for 20 % lower cost and 30 % lower investment than traditional internal combustion engines ( ICE's ) .
And it claims it can provide a 15 % improvement in fuel economy But Eco also says that by pairing two of these engines together you can get a 50 % improvement in fuel economy .
In this arrangement , one engine shuts off in light throttle applications , then instantly fires up for full throttle acceleration .
This would boost fuel economy 50 % over a conventional ICE , since there are no pumping loses when the second engine shuts down .
%Video -898 %So , for example , instead of building one 150 - hp OPOC engine for a compact car , you 'd build two 75 - hp OPOC engines and connect them together .
Even though this dual - engine arrangement would erase the advantage of having fewer parts , it would still result in an engine that 's half the height of a current ICE .
Eco Motors showed me engineering schematics where a dual - engine layout would easily fit in the engine compartment of any of today 's compact front - wheel - drive cars .
What makes Eco Motors worth paying attention to is that this engine is more than just a design study , or a CAD simulation .
Eco invited me over to Roush Industries to watch one of their working prototypes running on a dynamometer , where it 's already racked up over 500 hours of test time .
Just as importantly , the OPOC engine was designed by Peter Hofbauer , who spent 20 years at Volkswagen designing diesel engines and the VR6 , that narrow 15 - degree engine .
The CEO is Don Runkle who was the chief technology officer at Delphi and played key roles in the original Corvette ZR - 1 , Buick Racing and the Chevrolet Indy effort .
The COO is John Coletti who used to run the SVT engineering operations at Ford .
In other words , these are people with a proven track record who know how to get things done in the auto industry .
Sure , it may turn out that this is just another one of those engines that ends up on the ash heap of automotive industry .
But of all the alternatives I 've seen so far , this one intrigues me the most .

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin did n't rule out a 2012 presidential run with Glenn Beck as a running mate .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Palin : ' We 'll see ' about run with Beck
Former Alaska GOP Gov. Sarah Palin on Wednesday did not rule out running for president alongside Fox News host Glenn Beck in 2012 .
Palin was asked during an interview with Fox News ’s “ Fox & Friends ” about the chances that she “ would run on a ticket with Fox ’s own Glenn Beck , ” as the conservative outlet Newsmax reported might be a possibility in 2012 .

“ I saw that , I saw that ; he probably got a kick out of that , ” Palin said .
“ It was just a hoot , too , to hear such a thing . ”
“ I do n’t know , ” she said .
“ We ’ll see , we ’ll see . ”
Palin did not specifically tell Newsmax that she was considering a run with Beck but did tout the controversial television and radio host as “ bold ” during her interview with the conservative magazine .
“ Glenn Beck , I have great respect for , ” she said .
“ He gets his message across in such a clever way . ”
“ He calls it like he sees it , and he 's very , very , very effective , ” Palin added .
Asked by Newsmax if she had thought about potential running mates if she were to run for president , Palin said she ” can envision a couple of different combinations , if ever I were to be in a position to really even seriously consider running for anything in the future , and I ’m not there yet . ”

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Stuck for Christmas gift ideas ?
Is your marriage or a friend ’s going through a rocky patch ?
How about a divorce voucher ?
In an unusual take on the season of giving , a London law firm is offering Christmas gift vouchers for divorce advice .
The firm , Lloyd Platt & Company , which normally charges 325 pounds ( $ 530 ) an hour , said it had been swamped with enquiries since it launched the vouchers early last week .
So far , more than 60 have been sold -- a snip at 125 pounds for a half hour session with a divorce lawyer .
The firm ’s founder , Vanessa Lloyd Platt , said she had been amazed at the response to the vouchers .
“ They seem to appeal to an enormously widespread spectrum of people looking for that ‘ must have ’ gift for Christmas , ” she said .
A spokesman for the Church of England called the vouchers sad .
“ Divorce is a very personal matter and not really suitable for the idea of gift vouchers which are presents from other people , ” he said .
Demand for the vouchers could soar over the next few weeks .
Christmas tends to be a particularly stressful time for families , with a huge rise in people seeking advice each January , Lloyd Platt said .

VOICE TWO :
And this is Steve Ember with Science in the News , a VOA Special English program about recent developments in science .
Stress is a condition of mental or emotional tension .
Today , we tell about the effects of stress on people¡¯s health .
(( THEME ) )
VOICE ONE :
Many people suffered mental and emotional problems after the September Eleventh terrorist attacks in the United States last year .
Terrorism creates fear and fear often leads to severe stress .
Studies suggest that stress can reduce the body¡¯s ability to fight disease and can lead to serious health problems .
Stress affects everybody every day .
It is your body¡¯s reaction to physical , chemical , emotional or environmental influences .
Some stress is unavoidable and may even be good for us .
Stress can keep our bodies and minds strong .
It gives us the push we need to react to an urgent situation .
Some people say it makes them more productive at work and gives them more energy .
VOICE TWO :
Too much stress , however , can be harmful .
It may make an existing health problem worse .
Or it can lead to illness if a person is at risk for the condition .
For example , your body reacts to stressful situations by raising your blood pressure and making your heart work harder .
This is especially dangerous is you already have heart or artery disease or high blood pressure .
Stress is more likely to be harmful if you feel helpless to deal with the problem or situation that causes the stress .
VOICE ONE :
Anything you see as a problem can cause stress .
It can be caused by everyday situations or by major problems .
Stress results when something causes your body to act as if it were under attack .
Sources of stress can be physical , such as injury or illness .
Or they can be mental , such as problems with your family , job , health or finances .
Many visits to doctors are for conditions related to stress .
The tension of stress can interfere with sleep or cause uncontrollable anger or sadness .
A person may become more forgetful or find it harder to concentrate .
Losing one¡¯s sense of humor is another sign of an unhealthy amount of stress .
Stress can lead to many other health problems if people try to ease it by smoking , drinking alcohol , taking drugs , or by eating more or less than normal .
(( MUSIC BRIDGE ) )
VOICE TWO :
Chronic stress lasts a long time or happens often .
Chronic stress causes the body to produce too much of the hormones cortisol and adrenalin .
Cortisol is called the ¡°worry¡± hormone .
It is produced when we are afraid .
Adrenalin is known as the ¡°fight or flight¡± hormone .
It prepares the body to react physically to a threat .
People under chronic stress produce too much of these hormones for too long .
Too much cortisol and adrenalin can result in physical problems and even changes that lead to stress - related illnesses .
Cortisol provides high levels of energy during important periods .
However , scientists have become concerned about the hormone¡¯s long - term effects on our health .
Evidence shows that extended periods of cortisol in the body weakens bones , damages nerve cells in the brain and weakens the body¡¯s defense system against disease .
This makes it easier to get viral and bacterial infections .
VOICE ONE :
Chronic stress has been linked to high blood pressure and heart disease .
Research suggests that people who are easily stressed develop blockages in their arteries faster than other people who are more calm .
A recent study of women was carried out in Japan .
It found that women who reported high levels of stress were more than two times as likely to die from stroke and heart disease as other women .
High stress levels have been found to cause asthma attacks that make it difficult to breathe .
Stress is also linked to mental conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders .
Research also shows that chronic stress reduces the levels of the hormone estrogen in women .
This might put some women at greater risk for heart disease or the bone - thinning disease , osteoporosis .
Experts say long - term stress also can weaken your resistance to infections such as colds and influenza , as well as your ability to recover from these diseases .
Extended periods of stress are also linked to headaches , difficulty sleeping , stomach problems and skin problems .
(( MUSIC BRIDGE ) )
VOICE TWO :
Mental and health experts believe personality is an important part in how we experience stress .
Personality is the way a person acts , feels and thinks .
Many things influence the development of a person¡¯s personality , including genetics and experience .
Some people , for example , are aggressive and always in a hurry .
They often become angry when things do not happen the way they planned .
They are called ¡°Type A¡± personalities .
Studies suggest that these people often get stress - related illnesses .
The ¡°Type B¡± personality is a much more calm person .
These people are able to deal with all kinds of situations more easily .
As a result , they are less affected by stress .
VOICE ONE :
Studies show that men and women deal with stress differently .
Women usually have stronger social support systems to help them in times of trouble .
These social supports may help explain why many women seem to be better able to deal with stress than men are .
However , experts say women are three times more likely to develop depression in reaction to the stress in their lives .
VOICE TWO :
Chronic stress is most common among people in the workplace , especially among women .
Scientists studying stress in the workplace say many working women are under severe stress because of the pressures of work , marriage and children .
Some experts say that pressure can cause a chemical imbalance in the brain that can lead to depression .
More than thirty - million American women suffer from depression .
These problems are linked to their stress - filled lives and constant hurrying .
VOICE ONE :
People who care for family members who are old or sick also suffer from high levels of stress .
Most caregivers in the United States are women .
Several studies have been done on people who care for family members with Alzheimer¡¯s disease .
The studies showed that the caregivers had high cortisol levels in their bodies .
This greatly weakened their immune systems against disease .
For example , one study in the United States found that women who cared for family members with Alzheimer¡¯s took an average of nine days longer to heal a small wound .
The researchers found that the blood cells from the caregivers produced lower amounts of substances that are important for healing and for fighting disease .
(( MUSIC BRIDGE ) )
VOICE TWO :
Experts say there are several ways to deal with stress .
They include deep breathing and a method of guided thought called meditation .
They also include exercise , eating healthy foods , getting enough rest and balancing the time spent working and playing .
Doctors say people should limit the amounts of alcohol and caffeine in their diets .
People who have many drinks with caffeine , like coffee , experience more stress and produce more stress hormones .
Experts say exercise is one of the most effective stress - reduction measures .
Running , walking or playing sports causes physical changes that make you feel better .
Exercise also improves the body¡¯s defense system against disease .
And a recent study has found that it helps protect against a decrease in mental ability .
Doctors say deep , slow breathing is also helpful .
And many medical studies have shown that clearing the mind through quiet meditation helps you become calm .
This causes lower blood pressure , reduced muscle tension and decreased heart rate .
VOICE ONE :
Experts also say keeping stress to yourself can make problems worse .
Researchers have linked the inability to identify and express emotions to many health conditions .
These include eating disorders , fear disorders and high blood pressure .
They say expressing emotions to friends or family members or writing down your feelings can help reduce stress .
Experts say people should try to accept or change stressful situations whenever possible .
Reducing stress may help you feel better and live longer .

Seaweed holds promise as more than an ingredient in a purifying face mask or a maki roll .
So say researchers at E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. , which alongside Seattle - based Bio Architecture Lab ( BAL ) has secured $ 9 million from the Department of Energy to explore seaweed 's potential as a feedstock for biobutanol , an advanced biofuel .
Their venture appears to have largely cornered the current market .
Though more than 200 companies have looked into algae - based biofuels , DuPont and BAL say most others have shied away from using macroalgae , like kelp .
" We 're in the vanguard here on this technology .
There are other people who have talked about changing microalgae -- green algae that floats in the water -- into advanced biofuel , but [ using ] seaweed is unique , " said DuPont 's Nathan Danielson , a program manager who oversaw the companies ' DOE grant application .
That 's why the companies were able to win one of DOE 's Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy ( ARPA -E ) awards , announced late last month , which are designed specifically for ambitious " high - risk , high - payoff " energy research projects .
Part of the reason seaweed has n't taken off as a biofuel source is that it's not part of American culture , said Nikesh Parekh , CEO of Bio Architecture Lab .
" Our founders are from Japan , and they are much more familiar with seaweed farming and seaweed as a culture crop . "
Planting a large - scale seaweed farm would likely come up against stiff opposition from those who are not used to seaweed farms in their backyards , agreed Mike Graham , an ecologist specializing in seaweed at the California State University - associated Moss Landing Marine Laboratories .
Difficulty controlling seaweed probably also kept interested companies focused on the more manageable microalgae , since it 's so small , Graham said .
A startup could more easily select a preferred strain of algae , grow it in a man -made pond on land , and oversee the process , he said .
Of course , the downside to that , says BAL , is that it can be a costly endeavor .
Aquafarming
Most U.S. seaweed operations , like Maine Seaweed Co. , harvest a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of tons of seaweed naturally available along the U.S. coast , but BAL hopes to farm its own .
Parekh says his company , which is in charge of growing seaweed for its biobutanol project , is interested in farming the seaweed because it is more environmentally sustainable .
" One of the challenges of harvesting a natural seaweed bed is you can only do a certain percent of the bed if you do n't want to have a negative environmental impact , " he said .
" The economics of production suggest that we 'll be better off if we grow our own seaweed and locate it close to our plant . "
But to farm enough seaweed to support mass production of a biofuel would be a large departure from current U.S. practices .
Graham has one of the few seaweed farms in the United States -- perhaps the largest -- and he only grows about a ton of seaweed a year to augment abalone snails ' diet .
If successful , though , the payoff could be well worth it .
Biobutanol advocates , including DuPont , say the fuel could work better in automobiles than the better - known ethanol and will be easier to transport .
The key to unleashing seaweed 's biobutanol potential is in a BAL - designed microbe that lives entirely off of seaweed as a carbon source , the company says .
" We were really the first to think of that , " Parekh said .
The microbe takes sugar from the seaweed and thus far can produce ethanol as a byproduct .
The company plans to work with genetic engineers at DuPont to further perfect the microbe -- programming it to produce biobutanol .
' It can look easy on paper '
The other piece of the puzzle is that biobutanol is really an experimental biofuel itself .
DuPont says it has already succeeded at extracting sugar from corn and converting it into biobutanol in the lab , but it has yet to scale up the operation .
The company will not disclose how much butanol it expects to produce from seaweed , citing competitive reasons .
Parekh says that the companies believe they will one day be " competitive " with petroleum , and as a bonus , they will be able to avoid the steep up - front costs microalgae farmers face to create pools for their algae .
BAL could theoretically just lease some offshore areas from the government and farm the seaweed there .
The company , which also has a site in Chile , is still considering locations in both the United States and abroad as potential farm destinations .
The site selection will also determine its seaweed of choice , since it hopes to grow seaweed that is native to its surroundings .
DuPont estimates that if just 2.5 percent of America 's coastline were used for seaweed growth -- all along the continental shelf in those areas -- 6.8 billion gallons of fuel could be produced per year .
The companies maintain that they do not see seaweed as better than other types of algae , just as another biofuel option .
" We can't get ourselves over the capital hurdle around microalgae yet , but we 're really watching both areas , " DuPont 's Danielson said .
The companies plan to start work with the seaweed in early 2010 and work on the early stages of the project over the next two years while funded by the ARPA - E grant .
Though they do n't expect the product will be close to market - ready at that time , they hope to better gauge whether it will be feasible to continue research on this track .
" With R&D , it can look easy on paper , " Parekh said , " but you can run into all sorts of challenges . "

The post -WWE hypocrisy of Ric Flair continues .
I have learned from sources that Flair is currently negotiating a deal with TNA Wrestling .
The deal could land the man that said he ’d never wrestle again , never wrestle in TNA , never work with Eric Bischoff again , never work with Vince Russo again , and well you get the point .
If all goes well , it is possible that TNA will counter WWE ’s Bret Hart punch with the Nature Boy .
Sources tell me that Flair is negotiating a one - of - a- kind deal with TNA Wrestling .
While I ca n’t get into specifics , there is one specific request by the Nature Boy that is currently holding up the deal .
From what I am told , it is a serious sticking point on both sides .
So much so , that neither side has budged and it could very well be a deal - breaker for both sides .
However , the WWE ’s acquisition of Bret Hart changes the stakes and I have a feeling that somehow or another TNA Wrestling will get the deal done and sign Ric Flair .
It has really been some ride for Ric Flair following his WrestleMania 24 match against Shawn Michaels .
Flair retired and was given the send - off of a lifetime by the WWE .
Shortly thereafter Flair quit a cushy job as a WWE ambassador to hit the convention circuit .
Flair immediately started making noise about wanting to wrestle again .
A subsequent divorce and reported financial problems turned his desires into a necessity .
Flair put the tights back on for the first time last month for a series against Hulk Hogan and likely cut the cord in regards of any hopes of a WWE comeback .
The negotiations with TNA Wrestling are shocking , yet nothing surprises me anymore when it comes to Ric Flair .
Flair has been extremely critical of Eric Bischoff , Hulk Hogan , and Vince Russo since WCW closed down .
The idea that Flair go to work in a company that will be run by two if not all three of these guys is laughable .
For a guy that talks for hours about honor and integrity in pro wrestling , Flair has shown little of either since the day he walked out of the WWE following his retirement ceremony .
After seeing the pictures of Ric Flair in Australia as much as I was a fan of him growing him , I do n’t think he is somebody that needs to be featured by anyone right now .
While I do think that Flair still can cut one of the best promos in pro wrestling , he is almost embarrassing at times in the ring .
I think Flair would make a great on - air personality as a manager or G.M. , but I ca n’t imagine him being any kind of a draw in his sixties in the ring .
I also think that any value gained by making a big splash with Flair would be overshadowed by Hulk Hogan .
Hogan did n’t put Flair over on a small international house show , so I have no reason to believe that he will let Ric Flair shine over him in TNA if he is running the show as he claims he will be .
As for TNA , this new direction featuring Hulk Hogan has disaster written all over it .
To succeed , TNA needs to differentiate their product from WWE with younger , more athletic wrestling rather than come off like a WWE senior tour .
There is no long term value of sacrificing your young stars to keep putting over guys that are short - term answers that wo n’t be there in 1 - 2 years .
If TNA really wants to compete with the WWE , put on an X Division tournament , give the fans the most exciting wrestling they have ever seen , and keep these older ex-WWE stars at a minimum .
But hey what do I know ?
I ca n’t see any relationship between Flair and TNA Wrestling ending well .
I can see it now .
Flair signs , says TNA Wrestling is the place to be , the talent is great , and he is looking forward to fighting it out with the WWE .
Once he leaves , it was a nightmare , the talent was n’t up to snuff with the WWE , the writing was atrocious , he hates Hulk Hogan , and Vince McMahon is the greatest person ever to write a wrestling show .
It ’s okay .
At Flair ’s age you kind of start to expect dementia .

The star power of Barack Obama has seen the United States eclipse Australia as the place most people want to visit and do business with .
The annual Country Brand Index , which ranks nations like retail brands , found the US had unseated Australia , which held the top spot for the past three years .
Australia has slipped to third , with Canada rising to second place .
New Zealand and France complete the top five country brands in this year 's index that included 102 countries .
" The revitalisation of Brand USA , and other factors , have resulted in the effect on Australia 's ranking , " said Tim Riches , chief executive of FutureBrand Singapore , which conducted the survey .
" It highlights the importance of keeping a country brand fresh , relevant and engaging in a highly competitive international marketplace . "
The index is based on a survey of about 3,000 business and leisure travellers from nine countries .
In addition to branding countries , it also identifies global trends in travel and tourism , which FutureBrand says is the world 's fastest growing economic sector .
The US was seen as the ideal place for business , one of the top places for families , shopping and quality products , as well as one of the countries people wanted to visit whether for the first time or again .
The survey echoes a similar poll that showed the US was the most admired country globally , largely thanks to Mr Obama 's global popularity .
It also identified the United Arab Emirates , China and Vietnam as the top three nations likely to become major tourist destinations in the next five years .
Croatia , South Africa and India also made the list .
With the global economic crisis tightening purse strings across the world , the survey showed that bargain - driven travel would remain a major trend .
It says consumers will " think like financial analysts in choosing destinations and properties that are undervalued and booking trips that allow them to maintain the style they were accustomed to in boom times " .

If anyone knows Linux kernel driver development , it ’s Greg Kroah - Hartman , who ’s been working deep in Linux for over a decade .
In this interview , Greg talks about how the Linux project has accommodated the accelerating rate of change for the kernel , and offers some insight on where Linux is headed .
Scott Swigart : Can you please introduce yourself and your association with Linux ?
Greg Kroah - Hartman : Sure .
I ’m a Novell fellow , and I ’m working on the Linux kernel with the SUSE Labs division at Novell .
I ’ve been doing Linux kernel work for more than 10 years now .
I ’m a maintainer of several different subsystems , including USB , the driver core , and some other minor things .
I ’m also responsible for releasing the stable Linux kernels .
I used to be a maintainer of a lot of other driver subsystems and such over the years , but I ’ve thankfully handed them off to other people .
Scott :
Let me start with a really big - picture question , since you ’ve been involved in Linux for a long time .
Obviously , there ’s still lots of stuff happening on the mailing list , but fundamentally , the way code makes it into the kernel has n’t really changed , and yet the scale of development is much larger than it was , say , five years ago .
How have you seen Linux kernel development change to handle the scale of the effort that ’s going on today ?
Greg : I ’ve been tracking this for over five years now , and we ’ve gotten a lot better .
There are a lot more people doing the work .
To give an example , for the 2.5 to 2.6 kernel development series , which took about two years , the top 30 people did 80 percent of the work .
Now , the top 30 people do 30 percent of the work .
The sheer number of developers has also increased .
We were running a couple hundred developers , and now we ’re running a couple thousand .
Scott :
How does that get managed ?
Are there more layers in the hierarchy ?
Greg :
We ’ve invented some tools to help us out a lot .
It used to be that Linus was the only one who could commit anything , or who would accept anything .
It was all done through email .
And then BitKeeper was developed , and a number of us started using that .
It was very nice , because we had a much faster feedback loop with Linus .
I could have him pull 50 patches , see that he pulled them , and then I could hit him with another 50 patches , if I wanted to , within a day .
Before , we had a lag of a couple of weeks .
Then , when we could n’t use BitKeeper anymore , Linus wrote Git , and then that just increased it even more , because everybody can use Git .
Our development model increased its capacity , and part of that was that we started trusting more people .
Now we have subsystem maintainers and such .
As I said , I maintain the subsystems such as USB , and I have people who I trust enough that if they send me a patch , I ’ll take it , no questions asked .
Because the most important thing is I know that they will still be around in case there ’s a problem with it .
[ laughs ]
And then I send stuff off to Linus .
So , Linus trusts 10 to 15 people , and I trust 10 to 15 people .
And I ’m one of the subsystem maintainers .
So , it ’s a big , giant web of trust helping this go on .
We ’ve developed some procedures that help guide how and when we do merges and releases .
And we ’ve a very regular release schedule : every three months , we do a release .
We have a two - week merge window , and all those patches in that merge window have to have been tested .
We ’ve gotten the development process down really well over the past four years .
We ’re also increasing the rate of change in our development .
The same amount of work one of the top 10 developers did last year would n’t have even made it into the top 20 this year .
Our individual developers have got the work flow down , so we can actually contribute more , to an extent that ’s amazing .
Scott : I understand that one of the things you ’re involved with is the Linux Driver Project .
It seems like there was a certain tension between Linux and certain hardware vendors , in the sense that , for a long time , hardware vendors had been really used to not shipping driver code .
They were used to shipping for Windows , and they did n’t have to be involved with drivers .
They just provided an installer .
And then , as Linux started to become a lot more popular in the server space and make some inroads in the desktop space , they wanted access to that market .
There was kind of a culture shift in a lot of companies to realize how to provide things like drivers in a way that matched with what the Linux community expected .
Take the example of some hypothetical Acme hardware vendor that wants to submit a driver but has never done it before .
What does the process look like ?
Greg : First , people need to realize that our driver model is different than other operating systems , because all our drivers ship with the kernel .
The license requires our drivers to be open , so everything is in the main kernel tree .
Because of our huge rate of change , they pretty much have to be in the kernel tree .
Otherwise , keeping a driver outside the kernel is technically a very difficult thing to do , because our internal kernel APIs change very , very rapidly .
In other operating systems , APIs change more slowly , since their development process is comparatively very slow .
So , it makes sense , from a technical standpoint and just to save money , to get your code into the kernel .
It is maintained that way , and when changes happen within the kernel , your driver code will be fixed for you .
If I have to change an API , I change it everywhere .
That approach also lets us see commonality .
If see that a driver ’s doing the same thing as another driver , I might merge them together in the shared core .
That way , everybody benefits .
The new driver gets smaller and easier to maintain .
That ’s happened a lot .
We ’ve merged a lot of drivers from a lot of different companies , and everybody ’s happy about that .
The companies are happy , the users are happy with the smaller code base , and it ’s easier to maintain .
The Linux Driver Project started out because of the perception that Linux does n’t support many devices .
It turns out that Linux supports all devices out there .
There ’s really nothing manufactured today that Linux does n’t support , in a major consumer market .
There are some one - offs , like some small video - capture devices I know of that we do n’t have support for , but people are actually working on those .
The initial goal of the Linux Driver Project was to remove all barriers that could possibly be there , which were mostly managerial .
To attain that goal , we said that we will write and maintain any driver for free for any company .
It turned out that not very many companies really needed that .
A few niche markets needed it , and we ’re writing some drivers for them , but most companies had existing drivers floating around inside their company .
Their challenge was typically that they needed to get it into the kernel tree , and they did n’t know how .
So , the Linux Driver Project , over the past couple years , has just been a big educational thing .
I work with the companies and show them how to get the code in .
I maintain the code , massage it and get it cleaned up , and then merge it into the kernel tree .
That ’s been the majority of the work we ’ve been doing over the past two years .
We ’ve also now codified a few ways that we can play in the kernel .
We can accept code into the kernel that does n’t meet our normal standards into a staging area .
Everybody can clean it up there , and then the code graduates into the real stuff .
That ’s worked out really well .
Scott :
That makes good sense , because someone coming in from the outside is n’t necessarily going to know everything from coding standards to the best practices for doing things the right way .
And so what you ’re saying is that you ’ve got a place to get that code in , where people who know the right way to do things can look for things that can be factored out of drivers , drivers that can be merged , and that kind of stuff .
It does n’t force every hardware vendor or everybody who needs to get a driver into the kernel to be a Linux driver development expert .
Do I have that right ?
Greg : Yeah , although we do have lots of documentation now .
We have free books on how to write Linux drivers , and we have documentation of things like our coding style and how to submit code .
If people do n’t know where it is , we ’ll point them in the right direction .
In case anyone ’s curious , it all starts in a file called HOWTO in the kernel , so they can start there .
Even though we do have those education tools , though , we will also work with companies that want it .
We have lots of people who have done this work before and who will do it for you .
It ’s a great place for people wanting to get involved in the kernel to start out , because they can just run a script to find some errors and go fix them .
We have people that have started off just wanting to get involved who have ended up maintaining whole drivers and subsystems over time .
Still , in the end , my goal is actually to work with engineers from those companies and have them maintain and own it , so they become full - fledged members of the kernel community .
That ’s the only way we ’re going to grow , and it ’s working .
The number of companies involved in the kernel has grown year over year .
Companies want to get the most value out of Linux , so I counsel them that they should drive the development of their driver and of Linux as a whole in the direction that they think makes the most sense .
If they rely on Linux and feel that Linux is going to be part of their business , I think they should become involved so they can help change it for the better .
Scott :
That makes sense .
In a different area , I saw somewhere that around half of the Linux code that ’s being contributed nowadays is driver code .
Do I have that right ?
Greg :
That ’s the percentage .
Like I said , everything ’s in the kernel itself .
We ’re at something like six or seven million lines of code , and over 50 percent of those lines of code are drivers .
I think 30 percent is architecture - specific stuff , for things like processors and networking .
The core kernel is like five percent of the overall code .
Those numbers have stayed pretty much the same over the past four or five years .
We change something like 5,000 lines a day , which is just scary .
Fifty percent of that change will be in the drivers , and five percent will be in the core kernel .
In other words , the kernel is being modified everywhere at that rate of change .
Scott :
Do I understand correctly that the core kernel is memory management , process scheduling , and those kinds of fundamental things that an OS has to do ?
Greg : Exactly .
Basic system calls , memory management , scheduling , and inter-process communications .
And the only reason we ’re changing is because people want that change .
It ’s not like we ’re sitting there and going , “ Hey !
Let ’s rewrite the scheduler again ! ”
[ laughter ]
We ’re doing this stuff because we have to in order to survive , because people want it and because people need it .
We do it for fun , but we do n’t gratuitously change things .
A big part of what drives that change is that what Linux is being used for is evolving .
We ’re the only operating system in something like 85 percent of the world ’s top 500 supercomputers today , and we ’re also in the number - one - selling phone for the past year , by quantity .
It ’s the same exact kernel , and the same exact code base , which is pretty amazing .
Nobody ’s ever created something like this before .
And we ’re doing it in a way that does n’t follow the traditional software design methodologies , which is fun .
I go and talk at a lot of colleges , and they ’re changing their education system based on how the kernel has changed development models for large - scale systems .
Scott : Like you mentioned , the kernel runs on some of the smallest devices , as well as some of the largest .
What makes that work is a lot of stuff that is or is n’t included , whether you ’ve got fairly bare - metal , embedded systems , or whether you ’ve got desktops and music players , or whether you ’ve got systems that are optimized for number crunching .
The kernel is an interesting thing .
When you talk to people who are n’t really in the Linux space , they often do n’t make a big distinction between the Linux kernel and a Linux distro .
There ’s a huge distinction though , right ?
The kernel is a fairly small piece of a distro .
Greg : Sure , but consider Android , which threw away everything from Linux except the kernel , and they built something totally new on top of it .
That ’s a great proof point that the Linux kernel itself has to be really , really flexible to let people do something like that .
It still meets the needs of a very big market , which is pretty funny to watch .
From an engineering standpoint it was a pretty neat hack .
Scott : Give us some sense of the kinds of people who are contributing to the Linux kernel .
Obviously , there are hardware vendors .
The distros out there are contributing –Red Hat and Novell , for instance , are big contributors .
Give me a sense of the categories of contributors working on the kernel .
Greg :
You ’ve got a pretty good short list there .
Some distros contribute ; some do not , and the same is true of hardware companies .
Intel has come on like crazy this past couple of years , and they ’re now one of the major contributors to Linux .
Consulting groups and educational institutions play a big role as well .
There are also a lot of companies that just modify code for one - off little things , making support better in their hardware .
Linux runs on yahts for a lot of automatic pilot steering things , and we ’ve had some contributions from there .
More than five or ten percent of the US ’s power is generated on turbines that are controlled by systems based on Linux , and those guys contribute some changes they need .
It ’s also interesting that 20 - 25 percent of all of our contributions by quantity are done by people that have no affiliation with anything .
Scott :
The proverbial guy in his basement or dorm room or whatever .
Greg : Yeah .
They needed something fixed , so they did it and moved on .
The quantity there is still large , but on the other hand , 75 to 80 percent is done by people who are getting paid to do it .
Scott :
What do you feel like is driving change ?
You mentioned Intel , and Linux seems kind of tailor made for a chip company , because it provides a great opportunity to put new things in a processor or a chip set .
Contributing to Linux lets them build support for those kinds of things and to see how they are behaving in a real production operating system .
I can kind of see that new hardware architectures and capabilities drive a certain amount of change in the Linux kernel .
I can just see the creation of new peripherals driving a certain amount of change .
What other types of change drive the Linux kernel forward ?
Greg :
Well , those two are major .
New hardware accounts for the majority of our changes .
We get more processors with more and more cores .
We had to do a lot of work to make , 8 - , 16 - , and 32 - way machines run really well , and now we ’re running 8000 processor machines really well .
The scalability is there , and I actually know of people who have booted larger ones , but we ’re not allowed to talk about it .
USB 3.0 was sponsored by Intel , and it was shown on Linux first –the first implementation of any operating system .
Intel gets their hardware working well fast , and working with the Linux community lets them get it out to developers and other people who are making devices fast .
The fact that they can do it for Linux much faster than they can for other operating systems is a huge driving factor for what we need to do for things like 10 Gigabit Ethernet or 40 Gigabit Ethernet .
Some of those speeds have required major changes to the way we do networking and the way we handle processes or data flowing through the kernel .
We also have to accommodate workload issues , like real - time workloads , which required big changes to the scheduler and the way we do locking and the way we do other things merged in .
Note that those are all requirements driven by people who are using Linux .
The real - time guys want to use operating systems like Linux for their stuff .
It also drives Wall Street and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Tokyo Exchange and the London Stock Market .
Scott :
What do you see on the horizon , in terms of hardware use cases that are n’t quite mainstream or available yet but that are going to drive some additional kind of significant change all the way down to the level of the kernel ?
Greg : 40 Gigabit Ethernet is going to need some changes , and the networking guys are actually working on that already .
There are also going to be more and more cores , better real time operation , and USB 3.0 .
The USB 3.0 devices are n’t out yet , so once we start seeing more of those , we ’ll start seeing optimizing things there .
SSDs are great ; they ’re growing fast .
People seem to forget that changes they want to the kernel that it seems like no one else will want very often end up being valuable to a lot of people .
For example , maybe the embedded group makes some power management changes , and it turns out that the server guys really want that , too .
Then the server guys want better scalability , and it turns out that the embedded guys love those scalability changes , because they ’re running dual - core ARM systems now .
Part of what ’s helped us make things work is that it turns out that a lot of changes benefit everybody .
We ’ve become such a flexible operating system by requiring changes to work for everything , and it ’s made everything work even better .
There are lots of power management changes in the pipeline to be reworked that help address a lot of the issues the embedded guys have come up with that servers traditionally do n’t have .
In servers , you ca n’t shut off that many discrete components , whereas in embedded , you can pretty much shut off every single discrete component in your system , depending how much you want to do with it .
Scott : I remember when we talked to the OLPC guys , one of their requirements was to be able to go to sleep , but not lose the network connection .
Greg : Mesh networking , right ?
Scott : Yes .
And they also needed super - aggressive power management , because they wanted to get the most battery life possible , because power is such a big issue in developing countries .
If I remember correctly , they were actually putting the processor in a sleep state between keystrokes .
Greg :
That ’s right ; they were , but it turns out that the hardware guys can do it better .
If you look at more modern processors , the hardware is putting itself to sleep faster .
In modern PCs and these new netbooks , the OS really does n’t have control of the power management stuff anymore , because the hardware can do it better .
It turns out it ’s better to run as fast as possible to get your work done , then go to sleep , than to run your CPU at medium speed .
The hardware guys realize this , and they know they can handle their workloads better than the operating system can .
Scott : I do n’t want to mischaracterize it , and I am intentionally overstating this to some extent , but when you talk to people at Intel , they always say , “ Well , that should be in silicon . ”
It ’s kind of like there ’s this drive to put more and more and more in silicon , but at the same time , obviously software is growing at a geometric rate .
Talk a little bit about that balance between what ought to be in hardware and what ought to be in software , as well as the notion that something that ought to be in one place today should maybe be in the other a year or two from now .
Greg :
The hardware guys are always like , “ Oh , I can solve that in hardware .
Let me do that .
You software guys are n’t ever going to get around to doing this . ”
And part of that is true .
If you look at the software adoption rates of some operating systems , it ’s very , very slow .
So , the fact that they make a change to the hardware , and they can save power today in the new processor , means that overall , the amount of power consumption in the world goes down .
People run old versions of Linux and other operating systems very frequently , so there ’s sometimes an advantage to solving a problem in both places .
They can add it to the hardware , and then they also add it to the software .
In the kernel , we know we typically can’t change user space applications , so we have to make changes in order to accommodate how they want to do things , even if we feel that they ’ve done it the wrong way .
So , there ’s also a tension there .
Some companies actually talk to the engineers really , really well .
Intel and IBM are very good at this .
They sit down , and they talk to the kernel people once a year .
“ Hey , this is what we ’re thinking of doing .
How should we do this ?
How are we going to implement this ? ”
And they get feedback from us directly .
And that ’s turned out to be a very , very valuable feedback loop .
It often works out very well in terms of how chips are designed , and how the operating system will take advantage of that .
Hopefully , we ’re all talking to all the right people , and everybody ’s interacting well .
Scott :
Let me spin back to something you said very early on , which is that basically that all hardware is supported in the Linux kernel , even though there seems to be the perception that not all the hardware works .
Certainly , one of the things that gets brought up is that if I buy a new device , it ’ll come with a driver disk that probably wo n’t have Linux drivers on it .
Talk a little bit about where do you feel like this disconnect comes from between the people working on the drivers in the Linux kernel and those incorrect user perceptions , even from people who are fairly experienced with Linux .
Greg :
That perception has existed for many , many years .
Back in 2006 , I gave a big keynote showing how it was all wrong .
Everything is supported , but , yes , that complaint comes up a lot .
I joke with Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation about this issue all the time .
If he publicly says , “ We ’re still working on drivers , ” I always say , “ No , we ’re done . ”
[ laughter ]
So , there ’s a disconnect there .
Part of the issue is that we support more devices than any other operating system ever has .
That ’s a fact that ’s been verified by other companies .
The problem is that people only care about the devices that they have .
Therefore , if your device does n’t work for some reason , you do n’t care how many thousands of other devices out there work .
When I started the Linux driver project , I ’d been hearing this from all the major companies that were shipping Linux and cared about Linux .
So , I went around to them individually and said , “ OK , what do you need me to do ?
What needs to be worked on ? ”
Every single major hardware company , said , “ Hey , you ’re right .
Everything works on Linux .
We ’re fine . ”
That ’s shown by these companies that ship Linux on their machines .
Dell , HP , and all the big hardware companies and laptop manufacturers now ship Linux , and we ’re working with them .
Some of the disconnect is if you buy a machine that does n’t have Linux on it , getting it to work sometimes requires weird BIOS tricks to get all the function keys working on a laptop , and things like that .
New hardware or hardware when you ’re updating a system should work .
If not , then we messed up .
The graphics guys have issues that they ’ve been addressing to help make that work much better .
Intel hardware works wonderfully now on Linux .
Their developers are very good .
ATI and NVIDIA both ship closed source drivers that work on all their devices .
Those all work and have very good support systems .
The drivers are n’t in the kernel , but they ’re out there .
Anything storage related or networking related has been working with Linux forever , and all new devices support Linux too .
They have to , because that ’s what those markets are going for .
Then you get to the tiny consumer devices , which is where I like having fun , because I do USB .
I work really hard to get everything supported , and we do n’t know of anything these days that is n’t .
I was in Tokyo the other day for the Kernel Summit and walking around Akihabara and trying to find devices that we do n’t support .
We had all the kernel developers there and we could n’t find anything .
I know there ’s a disconnect , but if you look on a mailing list for the Windows guys , they have a lot of driver problems , where things are n’t working .
Mac OS
X does not support very many devices at all .
If issues arise with exotic configurations , I ’ll be glad to work through them all .
If something does n’t work , tell me so I know to fix it .
Scott :
Is my perception correct that when hardware companies get into Linux , they sometimes start out with a bare - bones driver ?
It seems that often , the piece of hardware will work , but it wo n’t necessarily handle the full spectrum of services like power management with the device .
Then they ’ll provide more capabilities , gradually contributing code to use the device to its full capabilities .
Am I at all accurate in that perception , or is it more often the case that the driver they contribute offers the same level of functionality as on any other OS ?
Greg :
You ’re right .
Some things do n’t work , although we ’ve made it easier for companies to write a driver that will do everything , because we put core functionality like power management into the core .
Power management is now handled by the core of the kernel , so you do n’t have to add that .
You just have to add a few hooks in your driver and then you ’re done .
The average driver for Linux is about one third the size of an equivalent driver for another operating system , so you have less code to write and maintain .
Still , to your point , there are some new devices that come out whose value add is that they do X and Y differently .
Sometimes we do n’t support that yet , because the manufacturer did n’t tell us how to do it or we have to figure out how to fit it into the Linux framework to support it properly .
Those little webcams are a very good example .
New devices come out that can support features like additional bit rates , frame sizes , or screen sizes , and we need to go and add support to the core of the kernel to support those .
So , your statement is very fair , and that contributes to the disgruntlement you ’ll see on my face at times .
[ laughter ]
If a brand new device that says it can do X , Y , and Z is only doing X on Linux , we immediately start to try to figure out how to get it to do the other things .
Sometimes , we just have to work with the manufacturers to do that .
A lot of companies are getting better at working with us to come out with drivers at the same time the hardware comes out .
Sometimes we lag by six months just by virtue of that fact that Linux is n’t the first system they care about , so it takes us a while to get it going .
Also , if you ’re using an older distro , you may need to switch versions .
There are all sorts of configuration issues there , which is why Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation continues to say we need to work on driver development , and I agree with him there .
There ’s always going to be work , so I think I have a lifetime job here .
Scott : Correct me if I ’m wrong , but drivers never really leave the kernel , right ?
Is it more or less true that that ’s one of the reasons that Linux supports old hardware so well ?
That once it ’s in the kernel , it ’s probably going to be in the kernel for a very long time , so I can grab a six - year - old laptop or six - year - old server , throw Linux at it , and have pretty good confidence it ’s going to work ?
Greg :
Yes , and actually that ’s turned out to be a problem .
Because our kernel size is growing so much , we want to make changes , and we ’re running into places where we have drivers for hardware that we know has n’t been made in the past ten years .
It can be complicated to excise those pieces .
That came up at the kernel summit last week , and actually , I am going to be working on that .
We ’re going to move drivers that we think are broken if we are pretty sure that nobody out there uses them anymore .
We ’ll move those into the staging tree , keep them there for about a year , and if nobody complains , then we ’ll remove them .
On the other hand , if anybody shows up and says they need one of those drivers , we can use our source code tool to restore and test it .
If there is at least one user of an old device in the world , I will gladly maintain the support .
Scott :
We ’ve covered a lot of great stuff , and now I want to turn to a lazy interviewer trick and ask you what really interesting things I have n’t asked about .
In other words , I ’d like for you to supply both the insightful question and the brilliant answer .
[ laughter ]
Greg :
Well , just to touch back on that rate of change that I mentioned before , I just looked it up , and we add 11,000 lines , remove 5500 lines , and modify 2200 lines every single day .
People ask whether we can you keep that up , and I have to tell you that every single year , I say there ’s no way we can go any faster than this .
And then we do .
We keep growing , and I do n’t see that slowing down at all anywhere .
I mean , the giant server guys love us , the embedded guys love us , and there are entire processor families that only run Linux , so they rely on us .
The fact that we ’re out there everywhere in the world these days is actually pretty scary from an engineering standpoint .
And even at that rate of change , we maintain a stable kernel .
It ’s something that no one company can keep up with .
It would actually be impossible at this point to create an operating system to compete against us .
You ca n’t sustain that rate of change on your own , which makes it interesting to consider what might come after Linux .
For my part , I think the only thing that ’s going to come after Linux is Linux itself , because we keep changing so much .
I do n’t see how companies can really compete with that .
Scott : Like you said , a lot of the rate of change in Linux as a whole is due to changes in the drivers .
It ’s fairly unique to Linux that it carries the drivers in the kernel , so as the ecosystem grows , you ’ve got more and more people contributing code to Linux .
That ’s not the case with other operating systems .
Greg : Right .
And while that rate of change is consistent across the whole thing , it ’s also easier to write drivers .
As I said before , your driver for Linux is one third the size of your driver for Windows , so even at this rate of change , writing a driver for Linux is less work than it is for other operating systems .
In Linux , we ’ve re-written our USB stack three or four times .
Windows has done the same thing , but they had to keep their old USB stack and a lot of their old codes in order to work for those old drivers .
So , their maintenance burden goes up over time while ours does n’t .
Also , as people change jobs , they generally stay with the Linux kernel community .
I ’ve been doing USB work for over 10 years now for Linux , and that ’s a big body of knowledge .
Within other companies , engineers usually move around , and that body of knowledge does n’t necessarily stick around .
For driver maintainers and driver authors within Linux , it does stick around .
The networking guys have been doing that work for 15 years with Linux , and they know this stuff in and out .
They can tell you what you need to change in your driver to make it work really well .
They ’re unique , and they ’ll help out any company .
Scott :
Thanks ; we ’re out of time , and that ’s a good place to close .
Greg :
All right .
Thanks a lot ; this was fun .
Tipps zur Schweinegrippe : Machen
Sie alles falsch !
So geht es in zehn Schritten über die Angst vor der Seuche , die Furcht vor der Zwei- Klassen - Medizin und die Abneigung gegen Politiker hin zum totalen PR - Desaster .
1. Sorgen Sie für eine diffuse , angstverbreitende Problemlage und nennen Sie das Problem beim Namen eines Tieres , das für seine Körperhygiene nicht bekannt ist .
Prophezeien Sie das Ende der Menschheit , mindestens aber das Ende aller menschlichen Körperkontakte .
2. Sorgen Sie dafür , dass durch dieses alarmistische Meldesystem jeder einzelne Fall bekannt wird .
Heizen Sie damit die Stimmung an .
Gut auch , wenn das Problem aus dem bösen Ausland stammt und jede Minute herüberzuschwappen droht .
Verbreiten Sie in den Medien flächendeckend Bilder von vermummten Menschen hinter Quarantänezellenfenstern , die Augen blicken traurig bis verzweifelt .
Scheuen
Sie sich nicht , dafür Kinder zu benutzen .
3. Vermeiden Sie einfache Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Krankheit , wie die Aufstellung von Desinfektionsmitteln in öffentlichen Räumen .
Ignorieren Sie gute Beispiele aus dem Ausland .
Sie wissen ja :
Es kommt ganz dicke , da nutzt das sowieso alles nichts .
4. Bringen Sie stattdessen zwei verschiedene Impfstoffe in Umlauf .
Raten
Sie der einen Gruppe zum einen und warnen Sie die andere Gruppe vor dem anderen .
Sorgen
Sie dafür , dass Kinder - und Frauenärzte frühzeitig Bedenken an dem für die Normalbevölkerung gedachten Impfstoff anmelden und gerade die weltschützenswerteste Gruppen der Schwangeren und Kleinkinder in Gefahr scheinen .
Je mehr Mediziner sich äußern , desto besser .
Tun Sie alles , um die Lobby der Impfgegner zu stärken .
5. Verteilen Sie den Impfstoff , der nicht in der Kritik steht , an in der Bevölkerung ohnehin nicht unbedingt sympathieerzeugende Gruppen wie Beamte , Politiker und Bundeswehrsoldaten .
Schüren Sie in den Medien dank Ihrer guten Kontakte zu Sozialverbänden und SPD - Gesundheitspolitikern die aufwühlende Debatte um die Zwei-Klassen - Medizin in Deutschland .
Nur zwei Klassen ?
Reagieren
Sie auf diese Vorwürfe aber erst mal gar nicht .
6. Behandeln Sie die Bestellung von Impfstoffen als eine Art Nebensache .
Als Innenministerium : Nehmen Sie das billigste Mittel , aber bestellen Sie möglichst früh .
Bei billig muss man schnell zuschlagen .
Wenn das Mittel keine Wirkstoffverstärker hat , umso besser .
Warten Sie ab , es wird sich noch auszahlen .
7. Rücken Sie erst später mit der Sprache raus .
Damit , dass der teurere Impfstoff in 50 Millionen Dosen übers Land verschippert wird .
Schieben
Sie alles auf die böse Pharmaindustrie .
Demonstrieren Sie Machtlosigkeit .
8. Gehen Sie da als Kanzlerin vorneweg .
Mit der Aussage , erst mal Ihren Hausarzt fragen zu müssen , wie sinnvoll eine Impfung überhaupt ist , beweisen Sie Kernkompetenz beim Thema und distanzieren Sie sich von der eigenen Entscheidungsmacht .
Überlassen
Sie das nicht Ihren Partei - Hardlinern wie den beiden Wolfgangs , Schäuble und Bosbach , die sich gar nicht erst impfen lassen wollen .
9. Vertreiben Sie auch noch die letzen Impfwilligen , indem Sie klarmachen : Ist alles schlecht .
Oder : " Gleichgültig , was verimpft wird , es gibt immer Nebenwirkungen . " ( Klaus Vater , Sprecher des Bundesgesundheitsministeriums )
10 . Die von Ihnen medienwirksam in Szene gesetzte Pandemie bleibt aus .
Gänzlich ungeimpft .

Final arguments are expected to begin today in the criminal trail of Dymond Milburn , the 12 - year - old Galveston resident who is accused of assaulting cops who tried to arrest her outside her home after mistaking her for a hooker .
We first wrote about her here , in a story that rocketed around the web .
Galveston police got a call that three white prostitutes were working Milburn 's neighborhood ; the girl was outside her home dealing with a tripped breaker .
Saying she was wearing provocative clothing , the cops tried to arrest her as she yelled for her hather .
She was hospitalized .
They later arrested her at her school .
We wrote a follow - up item from the transcript of the first trial , which ended in a mistrial .
Attorneys for the police have told the current jury , KHOU reports , that all proper procedures were followed .
Milburn is facing assault charges ; her attorney , Anthony Griffin , has also filed a federal suit over her arrest .
-- Richard Connelly
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether it is too late for an Alabama man to argue that the murder that sent him to death row was not a capital crime when he committed it .
The inmate , Billy Joe Magwood , shot and killed Sheriff Neil Grantham in 1979 in front of the Coffee County jail .
At the time , Alabama law imposed two requirements before the state ’s judges could sentence defendants to death : the commission of one of 14 listed offenses and the existence of certain “ aggravating circumstances . ”
The murder of a peace officer like a sheriff was a listed offense .
But Mr. Magwood ’s crime did not satisfy the second requirement .
The question before the Supreme Court is whether he took too long to raise the argument that he could not have lawfully been sentenced to death .
Although Mr. Magwood ’s lawyers challenged his sentence on other grounds over the years , it was not until 1997 that they raised the question of whether his was a capital crime under Alabama law .
In the meantime , a federal judge , acting on other grounds , ordered Mr. Magwood resentenced in 1985 .
He was again sentenced to death the next year .
DANIEL :
This is Anaheim Calling to the hockey world .
The Ducks have just come off a very disappointing 0 - 3 - 1 road trip , where they had the same amount of power play goals ( 2 ) as shorthanded goals surrendered .
Arthur , before this trip we both , essentially , said this was a do - or - die trip , and the Ducks obviously died .
Right before the Detroit game , Carlyle called out his top line for poor play despite their impressive numbers .
He said that the contracts of his top line players justify the pressure being applied to them in these clutch situations .
Since the top line does consist of the Ducks go - to - guys , is it fair to say that the overall poor play of the top line is what led to this poor road trip ?
ARTHUR :
It 's not fair to say that , and it's not fair to say that because Carlyle decided to run the big line into the ground after the Koivu / Carter injuries .
Carlyle is right that this point streak is little more than a streak ; the line has lacked consistency all season .
But if we 're going to lay a knock on them for the failure of this road trip , then we'd have to assume that Sheldon Brookbank did n't sit for an entire period , that Getzlaf was n't double - shifted at center , that Artyukhin was given a chance before the Pittsburgh game and that Carlyle did n't systematically wear down key players in his TOI management .
Not everyone is Scott NIedermayer , no matter how much they get paid .
The mistakes on this road trip were the same mistakes the team has made all season -- no execution , players trying to do too much and a lack of consistent effort .
Most of the Ducks team has been guilty of that , including the big line .
And I think the proper reaction when you lose your most consistent players ( Koivu and Carter ) is to let the entire team play .
Give everyone a chance to step it up .
Do n't force ice time on the guys you WANT to step it up .
When we drafted Getzlaf , the scouts flagged him for consistency and attitude , and five years into his career , they were n't wrong .
Getzlaf needs to fight sometimes , he needs to wait until he gets into the offensive zone to slash a guy back and he needs to make a host of other bad calls , probably just to stay focused .
And I do n't know if Perry 's ever as effective as when he 's needling another player .
These guys wear the ' A ' because they 're superstars , not because they give the workmanlike performances that steady a team .
I frankly think Carlyle is trying to pigeonhole them as players that they are n't , and I do n't see how they can be effective that way .
If anything , this team needed a blue collar guy on a blue collar paycheck to eat ice time responsibly .
Asking the game - breakers to game - dominate is what leads to Ryan or Perry making that extra move , doubling the turnover numbers and leaving this team with the same problems they had before the injuries .
DANIEL :
I agree that Carlyle should have been rolling a steady 4 lines instead of double shifting the top line , but these guys are supposed to be able to get it done in high pressure situations .
ARTHUR :
You do n't think that 's pee - wee hockey thinking ?
That you can just tap your star player on the shoulder and tell him to score five goals so the rest of the team can take the night off ?
I mean , this is the pros , with neutral zone traps and modern butterfly goaltenders ; is it fair to tell any three players that they have to go out there and manufacture a three - goal lead or they 're not earning their paychecks ?
DANIEL :
Well , it 's fair to tell them not to turn the puck over in the slot .
And it 's fair to tell Getzlaf not to take a Fighting Major with Old Man River to open the 3rd when you 're only down 2 goals .
And it 's pretty fair to ask Perry to play the new penalty killing system and eliminate the passing lane to the slot instead of pressuring the point like we used to .
I understand what you 're saying about Getzlaf , but if he 's supposed to be the captain of the future , ca n't he grow out of some of that ?
ARTHUR :
Well , I do n't know if I want to see Getzlaf outgrow that ; I do n't trust how competitive or involved he is in a game without it .
But , with Perry , are we really nitpicking his defensive play ?
Because he 'll never outgrow that .
Selanne 's ridiculous turnovers the other night should be proof enough of that .
Some forwards are allergic to defense and backchecking .
DANIEL :
Maybe .
But Perry said he wanted to play the PK .
He ASKED to be out there .
If you 're going to ask to be out there , you should know the system we 're using .
All I 'm saying is that these guys make some very unacceptable mistakes .
I thought that Carlyle should have been rolling 4 lines so as to not wear them out , but at some point , these guys have to look in the mirror and decide to set the best example .
I coach college speech .
I know it 's not hockey , but as a coach you recognize that everyone has a different way of keeping their head in the game .
If Getzlaf needs to do something stupid to keep his intensity up , like get in a fight , or take a ridiculous slashing penalty 100 feet away from the play , then he at least has the responsibility to do it at a time that is not detrimental to the team .
It 's the same thing I tell anyone who competes for me , you have to do what you have to do in order to turn in your best performance , but it can't be detrimental to the needs of your team .
If Getzlaf insists on doing things like this , despite what it does to the team , then he 's being a little childish .
He has to do what he needs to do , but based on his salary , it 's not too much to ask him to do it responsibly .
Perry 's situation is a little bit different .
I think he 's been really effective this year without having to be an agitator .
He 's letting his goals do the talking , but he still needs to be more defensively responsible .
Yes , he essentially created our shorthanded goal against the Pens , but he also made the mistake on the kill that put us down 2 - 0 .
And his inability to clear the puck from the zone cost us a goal on Monday .
He admitted that championship teams start with defense ( ibid ) , which means he needs to do more in terms of making us a solid defensive team .
Our problems this year have been , for the most part , defensive .
Part of this stems from line rotation and the inability for anyone to find comfort in their role , part of it is because Bob Murray acquired bad players , and part of it is because no one is standing up and saying , enough is enough .
Perry and Getzlaf are supposed to be THE guys .
They need to grow up a little and act like it , no matter how tired they are .

Advertisement German author Herta Mueller has been awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Literature , the academy in Stockholm has announced .
The Romanian - born writer follows last year 's French winner Jean - Marie Gustave Le Clezio , while British writer Doris Lessing won in 2007 .
Mueller , born in 1953 , is renowned for her depiction of the harsh conditions under Nicolae Ceausescu 's regime .
She said she was " stunned and still cannot believe it " .
The Swedish academy praised Mueller for both her poetry and prose .
Literary prizes
It said the writer had an ability to " depict the landscape of the dispossessed " and wrote " with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose " .
Mueller was born to a family from Romania 's German minority and her mother was deported to a labour camp in the Soviet Union after World War II .
A bit like Franz Kafka writing in German in Prague , Mueller saw in her mother tongue a direct and poignant expression of alienation
Razia Iqbal , BBC Arts correspondent
Read Razia 's blog Profile : Herta Mueller
She emigrated to Germany in 1987 , after being dismissed from her job in Romania during the 1970s due to her refusal to co-operate with the regime 's secret police .
Her first collection of German language short stories , published in 1982 , was censored in Romania .
Mueller 's initial works were smuggled out of the country , while in later years she was awarded several literary prizes , including the Irish Republic 's Impac Award in 1998 .
One of her later books , 2001 's The Appointment , goes into great detail about living under a stagnated dictatorship .
Only a few of the author 's works have been translated into English , including The Passport ( 1986 ) , The Land of Green Plums ( 1994 ) and The Appointment .
Mueller will receive a prize of 10 million Swedish Kronor ( £ 892,000 ) along with her Nobel honour , which will be presented at a ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the author " more than deserved " the prize .
" Especially now , 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , it 's a beautiful signal that such high quality literature and this life experience are being honoured , " she said .
" We are of course happy that Herta Mueller has found a home in Germany and I congratulate her from the bottom of my heart . "

When people ask whether modern synthetics are damaging their health and endangering future generations , Topic A is nearly always bisphenol A ( BPA ) , a synthetic estrogen , an integral component of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins and one of the highest volume industrial chemicals in existence .
Now a ground - breaking study released in the journal Human Reproduction offers what its authors call “ the first evidence that exposure to BPA in the workplace could have an adverse effect on male sexual dysfunction . ”
BPA factory workers suffer sexual problems
The scientific team , underwritten by Kaiser Permanente ’s Division of Research in Oakland , CA. , spent five years studying 634 Chinese factory workers whose bodies had been severely contaminated with BPA .
Animal studies link BPA to extraordinary array of subtle but serious chronic health problems , including impairment of the ability to think and behave normally , reproductive and cardiovascular system damage , cancer , diabetes , asthma and obesity .
Evidence of BPA ’s impact on human health has been more elusive – which is why the Kaiser Permanente study is making headlines around the globe .
After a year of being bombarded with BPA , the Chinese workers reported disturbing sexual problems : four times as much erectile dysfunction and seven times as many ejaculation difficulties as a control group , the Kaiser team found .
Nearly all Americans are BPA - positive
Most people do n’t experience BPA exposure nearly as intense as the factory workers .
But nearly all Americans test positive for low - level BPA contamination , as evidenced by body burden testing by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Environmental Working Group and other academic and non-profit organizations .
As Kaiser research team leader De-Kun Li , MD , Ph.D. , put it , the China workers study “ raises the question :
Is there a safe level for BPA exposure , and what is that level ? ”
AMA takes up BPA battle
Many scientists specializing in hormonal and reproductive systems say there ’s no such thing as a “ safe ” dose of BPA , a powerful endocrine - disrupting chemical .
Earlier this week , the American Medical Association Board of Delegates resolved to work with the federal government to minimize the public ’s exposure to BPA and other endocrine - disrupting chemicals .
The measure was proposed by the Endocrine Society , which , with 14,000 hormone researchers and medical specialists in more than 100 countries , recently warned that “ even infinitesimally low levels of exposure [ to endocrine - disrupting chemicals ] –indeed , any level of exposure at all– may cause endocrine or reproductive abnormalities , particularly if exposure occurs during a critical developmental window .
Surprisingly , low doses may even exert more potent effects than higher doses . ”
“ The AMA represents a very important constituency of physicians who have a lot of credibility and clout , ” says Andrea Gore , Ph.D. , a University of Texas - Austin researcher who co-authored the Endocrine Society statement .
“ If members of the AMA can now get behind the statement and actually affect regulations , then I think we can consider it a victory . ”
It ’s in the cans
Most of the BPA in Americans ’ bodies is believed to come from leaching from BPA - based epoxy food can linings and polycarbonate baby and drink bottles , sippy cups and other food containers .
Under pressure from EWG and other scientific and environmental health groups , the federal Food and Drug Administration is weighing proposals to ban the chemical in food packaging .
Because of FDA inaction , last October EWG president Ken Cook wrote major infant formula and canned food producers urging them to take voluntary measures to remove BPA from their can linings .
20 of 28 canned food brands contaminated
Laboratory tests commissioned by EWG in 2007 found BPA in 20 out of 28 brands of canned food and drink , including B&M , Bush ’s Best , Campbell ’s Condensed ( soup ) , Campbell ’s Chunky , Campbell ’s SpaghettiOs , Chef Boyardee , Chicken of the Sea , Coca - Cola , Del Monte , Dole , Ensure , Green Giant , Kroger store brand , Libby ’s , Nestle Carnation , Pepsi-Cola , Progresso , S&W , Slim - Fast , Swanson and Wolfgang Puck .
An EWG survey found that all four leading makers of liquid infant formula sold in North America used BPA to line their cans .
These included Nestle ( Good Start ) , Ross - Abbot ( Similac and Isomil ) , Mead Johnson ( Enfamil ) , and PBM ( maker of store - brand formulas sold at Target , Kroger and dozens of other retailers ) .
Last week , Consumers Union , an advocacy organization , reported that its laboratory tests had found BPA in canned food packaged under the brand names Campbell ’s Condensed , Progresso , Del Monte and Nestle .
Top environmental regulator , scientist act on BPA
The FDA ’s plans are , as yet , unclear .
But other top administration scientists and regulators are zeroing in on BPA .
Lisa Jackson , administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , has identified BPA as a priority for regulatory action .
And Linda Birnbaum , director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences , has recently committed $ 30 million in federal stimulus funds to research the many unanswered questions about BPA .
We know this much : with every day that passes , the cases against BPA hardens , like the plastics it makes .

There has been a lot of talk today about Murdoch wanting to have Google stop indexing his news sites .

There has been a lot of talk today about Murdoch wanting to have Google stop indexing his news sites .
I ’m not going to go into the piss poor business decision this is , but I do need to highlight this :
Mr Murdoch also indicated that he would use legal methods to prevent Google and other search engine “ news aggregators ” from taking his newspapers ’ material .
Really – going to sue Google over this ?
Let ’s take a look at how much Fox News tries to keep Google out .
When a search engine goes to a website it reads a file called robots .
txt .
This is like an instruction manual for search engines on what to search and not to search .
You can view my robots .
txt file here .
So what does the robots .
txt file on foxnews.com say ?
Well look at that .
Not only is Fox allowing Google , but they are giving specific directions to Google to read files and index those items .
The best way to explain this I can think of is the example of a robber .
Let ’s say you open the door and ask the robber to come on in .
You then walk him around your house , pointing out all your valuables for him to take .
Now after he takes them and leaves you decide to go after the robber legally .
Of course a robber would be a person engaged in illegal activity generally , something Google is n’t .
But the tech behind robots .
txt is n’t the only way to stop Google from indexing your site .
Google offers numerous ways to have your site removed from their search engine , and have already said they will gladly pull his sites out of there , if he so wishes .
There does seem to be something more sinister to Murdoch ’s master plan than all this :
Asked how he reacted to the challenge of Google and others for newspapers such as his to remove their newspapers from search results , Mr Murdoch said that once they had in place the means to charge for news , “ I think we will ” .
He also challenged the idea that Google and others could take just the headlines and opening lines from his papers ’ stories , indicating that he would not tolerate even that .
“ [ They use ] a doctrine called fair use , which we believe can be challenged in the courts and will bar it altogether , ” he said .
So Murdoch is planning on using Google until he decides it ’s time to make people pay , after that it is all him .
So how are you going to know what his new “ pay sites ” offer if you ca n’t even find them , let alone have an idea of what is published ?
One would think that a well written headline would be a sure seller for his new product , but apparently old Rupert does n’t even want that .
Instead it appears as though he is going after a “ fork over the money then see what you get ” model of business .
Oh yeah – that will be a big success there .
I can’t wait for all this to happen .
It ’s a good thing I am not a big decision maker at Google because I would go ahead and save Rupert the very minimal headache of having to have his sites removed and just do it now .
That includes all News Corp sites , including things like Fox Movies .
Just imagine when someone wants to check out a trailer for some big new movie and decides to Google it ?
And let ’s not forget about all the Fox affiliates out there .
Hey they have a right to republish Fox items , so Google should n’t take a chance .
I also hope that Rupert does decide to file legal action against Google .
Can you imagine the trial if it ever went there ?
The defense would just have to say “ here are copies of documents placed on Fox servers by Fox people asking our software to index their site and place the information in our search results ” .
I think the only lawyer Rupert would be able to find to take this case if Orly Taitz .
The Constellation Space Suit System , or CSSS , is the first new suit since the shuttle " jet pack " of the 1970s .
It will come in two configurations : one that the astronauts will wear inside the spaceship during launch , landing and any spacewalks needed for emergency repairs en route to the moon ; and a second configuration designed to be worn on the moon 's surface .
The two suits will share many components — such as boots , legs , gloves , and cooling and communication systems .

Lo !
Yet another Windows 7 activation hack appears .
This one 's a little more creative in that it does n't require an OEM key at all , and instead bypasses the verification DLL completely .
Advertisement
The new hack nullifies sppcompai.dll , and even deactivates all the reminder popups that would otherwise ask you to activate indefinitely .
But do n't expect the party to last long .
This crack closely mirrors an old Vista key workaround , and if Microsoft patched it easily then , they 'll patch it easily now .
Advertisement
There 's one point to this story I find particularly annoying .
According to My Digital Life ,
The crack is possible probably due to leniency allowed on the part of Microsoft on [ the ] activation mechanism to avoid getting too many false - positive or complaint on activation error [ sic ] .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
It just sucks that this game will continue .
Microsoft obviously wants to make activation as painless as possible , but will probably beef up the security next time to fix these sort of exploits .
Like most of you , I 'm sick of DRM causing headaches for the ones who legally purchased the software , and developments like this certainly wo n't help .
And please , let me say this : I love you guys , and I really do love getting emails from readers .
But I do n't know how to do this hack .
I have no idea how the hack specifically works .
I do n't even have a copy of Windows 7 .
So please , send me emails about anything else , but not about how to unlock your new copy of Windows 7 .
Gracias .

The meatball must use standard ingredients , be made in one day , and be edible
A restaurant in the eastern US state of New Hampshire has broken the world record for the largest meatball .
Matthew Mitnitsky , the owner of Nonni's Italian Eatery in Concord , said the 222.5lb ( 101kg ) meatball had been verified by Guinness World Records .
Mr Mitnitsky said he wanted " to bring the meatball back to the East Coast " .
The old record of 198.6lb ( 90kg ) was set only two months ago after the US talk show host , Jimmy Kimmel , vowed to beat a record set in Mexico in August .
To break the record , the meatball must be a larger - scale version of the normal food item with the same classic ingredients , be made in one day , and be edible .
Mr Mitnitsky 's record - breaking meatball was later donated to the Friendly Kitchen in Concord to feed the hungry .
Guestblogger Arthur Goldwag is the author of " Cults , Conspiracies , and Secret Societies : The Straight Scoop on Freemasons , The Illuminati , Skull and Bones , Black Helicopters , The New World Order , and many , many more " and other books .
Hello everybody .
I 'm excited to be guest - blogging for Boing Boing for the next two weeks and I look forward to meeting some of you–many of you , I hope –through your comments .
As you know , I am the author of the book " Cults , Conspiracies , and Secret Societies " , which Vintage published last summer .
Around the time the book came out , I started my own blog , where I have been posting fairly regularly , sometimes about other things , but mostly on the issues of the day as they pertain to cults , conspiracies and secret societies .
In this season of birtherism , 9/11 Truth , death panels , sweat lodge homicides , C - Street Christians , The Lost Symbol , rogue balloons and Northwest Airline jets , I 've had no lack of fodder .
I make no effort to disguise my predispositions and biases –I am respectfully agnostic on most religious issues , lean leftwards politically , and am resolutely skeptical when it comes to the paranormal or the outlandish .
I hope I am not dogmatic or snide or gratuitously ad hominem , but please do n't hesitate to call me out if I am .
Today 's entry features conspiracy theorist Orly Taitz , DDS Esq. , the Moldovian - born emigrant ( via Israel ) to Orange County , California who has become instantly recognizable to Cable TV news viewers as " the wide - eyed queen of the so - called birther movement –that subset of individuals who still , despite all evidence , do n't believe Obama was born a citizen of the United States " ( Time magazine — click here for their " 2 - minute bio " ) .
On Friday , October 30 , Federal District Judge David O. Carter issued a devastating 30 - page ruling , dismissing Barnet et al vs Obama et al , the case Taitz had been pursuing on behalf of independent party candidates for the presidency , including Alan Keyes , as well as active duty military personnel who do n't acknowledge Obama 's legitimacy as Commander in Chief .
The defendants included Mr. and Mrs. Obama , Hillary Clinton , Joseph Biden , and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates .
Taitz responded to this latest setback to her quest to overturn the election of 2008 with a blast on her website , in which she compared herself to another victim of character assassination , Sarah Palin .
As my mother might have said , she
should only be so lucky –then she could quit her triple practice of dentistry , law , and realtoring and reap millions too .
Taitz also revisited the issue of Obama 's social security number (s ) :
There is a vicious circle that you see in a regime .
There is no unbiased media .
So far no one in our media had integrity of character to report on multiple social security numbers of Obama , even though it is a criminal offense , and with 39 social security numbers a person should be criminally prosecuted and should be serving a lengthy prison term .
When media reports nothing , the public and the judges are misinformed .
The judges are afraid to make decisions , that they think , will upset the public , and in turn , their timid and lopside decisions influence the media .
Though freepers have been buzzing about the Obama family 's social security numbers since last spring , there 's been nary a word about the matter in the MSM .
Here 's the story : Taitz hired two private detectives ( former Scotland Yard Inspector Neil Sankey and Ohio Private Investigator Susan Daniels ) to look into Obama 's past .
According to Taitz 's miscellaneous filing on October 11 :
These two private investigation reports , although slightly duplicative , show beyond reasonable doubt a pattern of manipulation of Barack Hussein Obama 's identity , employment , and residence information .
The use of a multitude of social security numbers alone is indicative that Mr. Obama appears to have committed a substantial number of felony violations , including but not limited to violations of 42 U.S.C. § 408 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( B ) . which shows dishonest political advantage during 2008 election .
Plaintiffs submit again that " the American People Reserve the Right to know " .
Furthermore , the examination and decipherment of the trail of deception so casually left by this successful candidate will ( 1 ) lead ultimately to discovery of the truth about his origins and citizenship , ( 2 ) reveal the nature of the scheme to defraud by which this Mr. Barack Hussein Obama became President , and ( 3 ) show the degree and nature of the collusion of other people and parties in the scheme of defraud leading to his election , including but not limited to the other Defendants .
Daniel 's affidavit attests that she discovered that Obama 's social security number was issued in the state of Connecticut in the 1970s –and appeared to have been previously assigned to someone who was born in 1890 ( who was deceased ) .
Earlier Taitz had submitted a lengthy list of social security numbers associated with people named Dunham , Sutoro , and Barack Obama ( also Barok , Baraq , Barake , and Barbara Obama ) that Sankey had collected by running the names through Intelius , Lexis Nexis , Choice Point and other publicly accessible sites .
He also claimed to have discovered that Obama 's late mother had used the social security number of a woman who is alive and well and living in Washington State .
Never mind that there are other Obamas–and even other Barack Hussein Obamas–in the world , and that Internet databases are replete with errors ( as are some government databases ) .
Conspiracists have seized on these revelations as proof that Obama used the numbers to launder the ill - gotten money , obtained through drug dealing , Rezko , and Ford Foundation grants , that they believe financed his political machine .
And where did he obtain them ?
According to at least one conspiracist web site , you need n't look far :
As a volunteer at the Oahu Circuit Court Probate Department , Obama 's grandmother Madeline Dunham had access to deceased people 's social security numbers .
Or perhaps there was an even more sinister source .
I 'm thinking that the KGB agents who inserted the Kenyan - born Obama into the US as a sleeper years ago assigned him those bogus numbers precisely so that his imposture would be discovered and exposed–but not until after he was elected , precipitating the constitutional crisis that would topple the American Colossus at last .
Of course they'd have to have an agent in place to expose him on schedule .
And I think I know just who they used .
If Obama is a creation of the Communists , does n't it stand to reason that the Soviet - born Taitz is their tool as well ?

The quest to uncover new business models and revenue streams has become something of a crusade for the games business in the past five years .
After decades of selling full - price games and the occasional expansion pack , the industry has been forced into rethinking its models by a combination of factors - demographic expansion on the one hand , and technological advancement on the other .
Games are hardly alone in this , of course .
The advent of high - speed connections and the rapid pace of change in digital media technology has forced every media business to look hard at its fundamentals .
New opportunities have been opened up , of course - consumers now want to access media in contexts which were undreamed of even a few decades ago , which has expended old markets as well as creating brand new ones .
Old doors are also shutting , leaving businesses which fail to adapt to new market realities to die slowly , their oxygen supply cut off not only by piracy but by fundamental changes in consumer behaviour and perception .
As such , finding new ways of making money and new classes of product is a healthy and necessary exercise for any industry which wants to survive .
However , the recent behaviour of Zynga - possibly the world 's most successful casual games company - is a salutary example of the kind of pitfalls which businesses face in creating such new opportunities .
Zynga is a San Francisco based company which creates games for Facebook , MySpace and other social network platforms .
If the name of the company is not familiar , their games certainly will be .
Anyone who uses Facebook is bound to have run across Mafia Wars , Dope Wars or FarmVille - the company 's most successful game , with over 60 million active users .
These games are fairly straightforward in their concepts , but well - designed in their execution - by no means the pinnacle of casual game design , but good enough to be able to leverage the advantage of their social setting to create a compelling ongoing experience .
Scratch the surface , however , and you find that they all share a common business model - one which has come under a great deal of unwelcome scrutiny in recent weeks .
Essentially , the games are based on a " freemium " model .
Players can enjoy them for free , in which case Zynga makes a bit of money from straightforward advertising revenues .
If they want to buy extra items ( or simply to play for longer , by acquiring more " action points " instead of waiting for them to recharge over time ) , they can do so either with real money ( a direct revenue stream from consumers ) , or by signing up to an offer from one of Zynga 's partners .
It 's the last part of the equation which has caused the scandal around Zynga 's business model .
Some of those partners were perfectly legitimate - Netflix , for example , encouraged people to subscribe to a 30 day trial of their service , and provided action points for Zynga games in return .
Others , however , amounted to little more than scams , often promising people free items and then signing them up for subscription services which cost vast amounts of money and were nigh - on impossible to cancel .
Other partner offers would install applications on players ' computers which were little more than malware , interfering with their programs and operating system and providing no clear way to uninstall the offending software .
Some of them were merely extremely morally dubious - others may well have been illegal , at least in certain jurisdictions which do n't take kindly to companies deliberately scamming their consumers .
What 's certainly the case is that such scams were a breach both of Zynga 's own restrictions on advertising - which the company appears to have completely ignored - and of Facebook 's restrictions .
As such , Facebook pulled the company 's most high - profile game launch , FishVille , after only two days of operation , only restoring it to the site when Zynga had removed the offending partner offers .
Estimates of just how much money Zynga was making from these offers vary .
The company 's own executives dismissed it as a " mere " 20 per cent of their revenues , then revising the figure downward again to 10 per cent in a move which feels suspiciously like an attempt to downplay the importance of the whole scandal .
Other sources peg the income from partner offers as being as high as a third of revenue , with some even suggesting that it could be as high as 70 per cent .
For a company which has been ( perhaps optimistically ) valued at around a billion dollars , and which expects to post revenues of over $ 200 million this year , that 's big money - even at the lower end of the estimates .
It does n't take a great business mind , of course , to understand that scamming your consumers is not a fantastic long - term model .
It essentially prevents you from building a loyal following , instead burning through consumers ( which are not , contrary to what some business leaders seem to believe , a limitless resource ) who , once mistreated , become disillusioned not only with your specific business but with the entire sector in which you operate .
It 's a quick way to make money , certainly , but also a certain way to limit your sector 's growth .
The whole situation has been further compounded by Zynga 's CEO , Mark Pincus , who appears to be a walking disaster in corporate communications terms .
Not only did he address a meeting of entrepreneurs in which he proudly announced that he had done " every horrible thing in the book " in order to get revenues - and admitted that he " could n't get rid " of a piece of malware which the company foisted on its consumers in return for some poker chips for one of its games - he allowed this to be videoed and posted on the Internet .
PR people reading may wish to pause at this juncture to slap themselves melodramatically in the forehead .
Needless to say , the whole situation has now developed into a series of pledges from Zynga not to do anything naughty ever again - none of which ring particularly true , especially in the light of earlier protestations that the scammy nature of the partner offers was none of its business - and a class action lawsuit being filed against both the company itself and against Facebook .
The fallout is likely to be limited , assuming Zynga can actually clean its act up .
Even if the class action succeeds ( which it probably wo n't ) , it is unlikely that it will seriously damage Zynga 's revenues .
But some damage has been done ; consumers have become more wary , and some have left the industry entirely , while advertisers , too , have been disillusioned by the whole affair .
If you 're a big , reputable company like Netflix , why would you want to hitch your cart to the social gaming space when they have a track record of associating your good name with scammers and con artists ?
The whole affair is an object lesson in how not to do new business models .
The key watchword here is ethics - because while many of Zynga 's ideas are fine , and its games are perfectly decent ( albeit not terribly original , which has led to accusations that it ripped off other developers ) , its owners decided to leave any sense of business ethics or of responsibility to their consumers at the door when they started up the company .
That kind of behaviour is not uncommon , of course - but in the long term , it has the potential to be extremely damaging .
Zynga got lucky ; its scandal has not broken into the view of the public , at least not yet .
The next company to try to fund its operations through underhanded dealing and sharp practice , however , may not find itself quite so lucky - and if that happens , the impact could be immense , not just for one company but for the entire casual games sector .

TARP Inspector General Neil Barofsky keeps committing flagrant acts of political transparency , which if nothing else ought to inform the debate going forward over financial reform .
In his latest bombshell , the IG discloses that the New York Federal Reserve did not believe that AIG 's credit - default swap ( CDS ) counterparties posed a systemic financial risk .
Hello ?
For the last year , the entire Beltway theory of the financial panic has been based on the claim that the " opaque , " unregulated CDS market had forced the Fed to take over AIG and pay off its counterparties , lest the system collapse .
Yet we now learn from Mr. Barofsky that saving the counterparties was not the reason for the bailout .
In the fall of 2008 the New York Fed drove a baby - soft bargain with AIG 's credit - default - swap counterparties .
The Fed 's taxpayer - funded vehicle , Maiden Lane III , bought out the counterparties ' mortgage - backed securities at 100 cents on the dollar , effectively canceling out the CDS contracts .
This was miles above what those assets could have fetched in the market at that time , if they could have been sold at all .
The New York Fed president at the time was none other than Timothy Geithner , the current Treasury Secretary , and Mr. Geithner now tells Mr. Barofsky that in deciding to make the counterparties whole , " the financial condition of the counterparties was not a relevant factor . "
It is time for me to put my money where my mouth is — metaphorically that is , I ’m not going to eat money , that ’s far too extravagant for me — the Slanch Report has started an online petition asking the MLB Network to air the Dock Ellis no -hitter he threw on June 12 , 1970 against the San Diego Padres .
The moment was a seminal piece of baseball history and is certainly as worthy of being rerun as the Mark Fidrych games the network showed earlier this year just before Fidrych ’s unfortunate death .
Please PLEASE PLEASE join us in this cause and sign the petition below so we can all share in this special and fantastic moment of baseball history .
THANKS !
SIGN THE PETITION HERE !
AND PLEASE TELL YOUR FRIENDS AND PASS THIS ALONG !
[ Air the Dock Ellis No-Hitter ]
*( UPDATE ) *
I received an email from the folks over at MLB Network , our petition WORKED — well , in that it attracted their attention — unfortunately , they ’ve searched their archives and MLB does NOT have any footage of the game .
Or at least that ’s what they claim .
I did ask for them to air the Dock Ellis game where he tried to bean all the Cincinnati Reds and was thrown out after the 5th batter instead .
They have n’t gotten back to me on that one .
So , MLB may not have footage but there has to be SOME SOMEWHERE right ?
Spread the word , check your attics , we MUST find this footage .
And to everyone who signed or passed along this petition , all 1200 +(! ) of you , I am most most most incredibly thankful .
You ’re all heroes in my book .

[ Q ] : I have a toothache and legal troubles , can you help me ?
-- Jenny
[ A ] :
if you have a toothache and legal problems , you should definitely join my fight against Obama , as with his health care plan you will get cr—y treatment instead of decent dentistry and there will be no lawyers to help you , as they all will be scared of sanctions and neither they nor you will be allowed to open your mouth at all .
Guess , how will your dental care be done , through what point of entry ?

Review : Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
by Ben Brody [ Friday , 13th of November 2009 - 03:33 AM ]
Over 300 people were standing in the cold for some four hours waiting for the same thing .
Many of them planned on calling in sick the next day or skipping out on school just to get some playtime in .
Many people were reminiscing about COD4 or saying how they played a bunch of COD4 to get psyched up about MW2 .
So did it live up to the hype ?
Is MW2 the best FPS of all time ?
The answer is both yes and no .
Yes , it is a really good game that expands upon the COD4 universe , it ties up some loose ends and sets the table for what will most likely be an amazing sequel .
No , it 's not amazing and mind - blowing enough to make non-gamers gamers like Half Life or Wolfenstein or Doom all did .
There 's a fine line between a story thats great with lots of twists and turns and a story thats downright too confusing .
MW2 crosses that line but it does n't matter much in the face of action .
You have n't lived until you 've breached a wall , then cleared out the room with an automatic shotgun ( AA - 12 ) whose rate of fire is greater than that of an M4A1 .
Or maybe busting out akimbo Desert Eagles is more your thing .
In any event , the action is unsurpassed in terms of FPS's .
The story takes place five years after the end of Modern Warfare 1 , and features two main characters ( four are playable , okay five , but he does n't really count , you 'll know what I mean ) : Private Ramirez , who is an Army Ranger , and Roach , of Task Force 141 , an elite team of different nationalities ( think Rainbow 6 ) .
For any of you that have n't played the game , I do n't want to spoil the story for you , but I will say that the ending sets up perfectly for a sequel .
It is very very short and while the plot is fairly easy to understand once the game is finished , I do feel that adding about four to five missions would 've really fleshed out the story and made it flow better than it did .
The story 's a paltry five and a half hours long but the game includes a bunch of mini-missions in the form of Special Ops .
Each mission lasts anywhere from two to ten minutes and can be played by yourself or with a friend .
The missions range from maps in game to what could either be missions cut from the game , or missions built specially for Special Ops .
The Golden Gate bridge mission is not in the campaign mode for instance , but it is in Special Ops and is my personal favorite .
The locales , while maybe not as gorgeous and beautiful as Uncharted 2's , are stunning graphically wise .
The maps are more realistic and down to earth than Uncharted 2's , and range from a snowy clifftop to the barrios of Rio de Janeiro to a bustling airport in Moscow to an oilrig and everywhere in between .
The graphics are about the same on both the 360 and PS3 however I felt the 360 was a little crisper and clearer where the PS3's were a little more smoother and polished , whichever you prefer is the one to get , they mostly look the same otherwise .
What the game lacked in single player , it certainly makes up for it in multiplayer .
The basic modes are back with the addition of new perks and killstreaks and weapons .
Deathstreaks are new as well , if you manage to get yourself killed a whole bunch of times without killing anybody yourself , you will get a deathstreak bonus like last stand ( where you can still move around and shoot after you 've been taken down , and can even get back up after awhile ) and painkiller ( which raises your health for a period of time ) .
My favorite new attachment , the heart beat sensor , completely negate the need for a UAV , as a small screen attached to your gun shows the position of any teammates and enemies that happen to be nearby .
The third person mode is really really unnecessary .
It 's about as fun as the third person mode in Fallout 3 and while it does add another new feature to the game , I feel that it really could 've been cut .
The issue with third person shooters is that you can manipulate the camera to see around corners and peek over edges when the other person can't .
While its only available in the third person playlist , the one time I played it is the only time I ever will .
The killstreaks are awesome too .
My favorite is the AC - 130 , which allows you to take control of the gunning controls of said plane ( it 's like the COD4 mission , Death from Above ) .
While it 's a little one sided ( you can basically wipe out the other team ) it is really really fun .
The predator missile ( which is also controlled by the user ) is a blast as well .
The bottom line about Modern Warfare 2 is that while it is an awesome game , it 's not a perfect game .
It 's more of the same , not much has changed since COD4 but as the phrase goes , do n't fix what 's not broken .
While I wish that the single player campaign was longer , I do feel that it is very action packed and the inclusion of the Special Ops mode helps bolster the game .
The multiplayer is the bread and butter of the game and many people will still play the game without touching the single player side of things ( though they will be missing out ) .
The game is available as on the 360 , PS3 , and PC .

Andy Cobb , who once tried to sell Floridians on a Blue Cross health insurance plan , says he ’s fed up with the industry .

“ Call me a spokesjerk .

“ They , by which I mean I , make money by standing in the way of reform , ” Cobb says in the ad , which appears as a spoof of something like a freecreditreport.com ad .
“ It ’s time for change . ”
“ That ’s why I ’m calling on leaders from the spokesjerk industry , ” Cobb continues .
“ The freecreditreport.com guy .
The Shamwow dude .
And Senator Bill Nelson , recipient of big money from insurance companies — to lead us .
To walk away from their cash cows and tell American people the truth .
“ And us spokesjerks , we ’ll be fine , ” Cobb adds .
“ There ’s plenty of room in entertainment for people who tried to sell you the worst product in American history .
Private health insurance . ”
( CNN ) --
At first , James Sevigny did n't know where he was .
He was sprawled on the ground when he came to , and he shivered as he noticed how much of his blood had splattered across the snow .
Sevigny had had a premonition that he would die like this .
He just did n't have any inkling that it would happen on this spring morning .
Only moments earlier , the 28 - year - old mountaineer was climbing in an isolated part of the Canadian Rocky Mountains .
Suddenly , he heard a tremendous roar : avalanche .
Sevigny blacked out as a wall of snow hurled him 2,000 feet below .
When Sevigny awakened , he could barely stand .
His back was broken in two places , his knees were busted , and he had internal bleeding .
He gave up hope of surviving and curled up in the snow to die .
But then he felt an odd sensation .
He felt someone behind him and heard a voice : " No , you can't give up .
You have to live . "
Read all about cheating death
" It was right over my right shoulder , " Sevigny said .
" It was like if I would sneak up to you and put my nose a quarter of an inch from your neck .
It was that kind of physical sensation . "
What happened next was so profound that Sevigny , a scientist who disdains organized religion , says he could n't talk about it for years afterward without crying .
Sevigny still does n't know who that voice belonged to , but another man does .
He calls it " The Third Man . "
Who is the Third Man ?
John Geiger has sifted through the survival stories of people like Sevigny for six years .
Adventurers , sailors , prisoners of war and pilots , they all tell strikingly similar stories of being saved from death by a mysterious presence , he says .
In the book " The Third Man Factor : Surviving the Impossible , " Geiger attempts to solve the mystery of that presence .
Most of the people who 've encountered the Third Man are n't mystics , says Geiger , a senior fellow at the University of Toronto and governor of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society .
They include a NASA astronaut , aviator Charles Lindbergh , polar explorer Ernest Shackleton ( he coined the " Third Man " term ) and atheists .
Third Man encounters are n't restricted to exotic locales , either , Geiger says :
He experienced a Third Man - like encounter in the study of his home while writing his book .
" When I give talks about the book , there are always a few people who will come up afterward to say they have similar stories , " Geiger said .
" The debate around the book is not ' are people actually encountering an unseen being ' but rather , ' what is it ? ' "
What science says about the Third Man
Ron DiFrancesco thinks he knows who it is .
He recently experienced one of the most publicized Third Man encounters .
DiFrancesco was working in the World Trade Center 's south tower on September 11 when the building was hit by a hijacked plane .
He was trapped on the 91st floor of the 110 - story building , gasping for air as the smoke and flames closed in .
How doctor recovers after showing " no signs of life "
He was about to pass out when he sensed someone near him .
Then he heard a male voice .
He says it told him to get up , and it guided him through a maze of hazards to safety .
DiFrancesco was the last person to get out of the south tower before it fell , Geiger writes .
DiFrancesco never saw nor could he ever find out who helped him .
But he does n't think the presence was something his subconscious conjured .
" It was a higher being rather than an internal being , " DiFrancesco said .
" Maybe it was an angel .
I did n't see the face of God , but I know somebody came and helped me . "
Geiger says the Third Man could have several explanations .
He says scientists studying the phenomenon were able to evoke the sensation of someone standing next to a solitary person in a lab by stimulating certain parts of the subject 's brain .
Yet that presence did not have the active , benevolent and intelligent presence that others often cite during Third Man encounters , he says .
Maybe the Third Man is a coping mechanism , Geiger suggests .
The brain creates a companion to help a person survive a terrible situation .
Or perhaps there is an " angel switch " in the brain that 's activated in life - or - death struggles .
How some explain near death experiences
The Third Man appeared to him during one of the worst struggles in his life , Geiger says : over grief .
Geiger alludes to that moment at the beginning of his book , where the dedication page reads : " For James Sutherland Angus Geiger , June 15 - 21 , 2007 . "
James was Geiger 's son .
He died a week after birth because of heart problems .
Geiger calls the experience " the worst stress I 've ever had . "
Geiger says that while working on the book alone in his study , he felt an odd sensation .
Someone entered the room .
It felt like his son .
This happened several times .
" It 's instantaneous , and it 's overwhelming , " Geiger said .
" It 's like you 're sitting in a room with the light off and someone enters the room .
It 's that kind of vividness . "
Mountain climber led to safety
Sevigny , the mountain climber , says the presence he encountered in April 1983 was just as real .
After the avalanche , Sevigny says , he was passed out for about an hour in the snow before he came to .
The crumpled body of a climbing companion was nearby .
The fall had killed him .
" Blood was everywhere , " he said .
" We had fallen 2,000 feet . "
When he first heard the voice , Sevigny says , it reminded him of a woman .
It was warm and nurturing , and it gave practical advice : " You have to get your jacket on .
You have to get water . "
It even told him to arrange the blood dripping from his body in the shape of arrows , pointing to the way he was walking in case rescuers came up on his trial .
" I did n't question it , " Sevigny said .
" I did n't think about it .
I did exactly what the voice said . "
The presence led him through a valley to Sevigny 's campsite .
It constantly encouraged him when he felt like giving up .
When he arrived at the campsite , Sevigny saw three people skiing nearby and called for help .
At that moment , the presence left him , he says .
The trio rushed toward Sevigny .
One was a mountain guide , another was an elite cross-country skier , and the final person was a nurse .
" If you were to be in a place and you could find three people to help you , you could n't pick three better people , " he said .
Sevigny spent months in the hospital .
Today , he 's an environmental consultant in Canada and a father .
For about two years afterward , he could n't talk about what happened .
" It made me cry , " he said .
" It was so powerful .
I just could n't tell many people . "
As he talked about his experiences , his 1 - year - old son , Tuzo , started crying in the background after falling .
" He 's like his father , " Sevigny said with a chuckle .
" He climbs , and then he falls . "
Sevigny says the experience did n't make him religious .
He sees himself as a scientist and has little use for organized religion ( " Organized religion and organized crime share a number of parallels " ) .
" I do n't give it great thought , " he said .
" I 'm not a spiritual person .
I do n't say it was God or a guardian angel .
I have a Ph.D. in chemistry . "
What he will say is that mysterious presence was the only reason he got off that mountain alive .
" If it was n't for the Third Man , I would be dead , " he said .
" There 's no way that I would have the strength to get up and walk across that valley and do the things I did to survive . "
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Erlang 's Process Dictionary
The rise of languages based upon hash tables is one of the great surprises in programming over the last twenty years .
Whatever you call them -- hash tables , dictionaries , associative arrays , hash maps -- they sure are useful .
A majority of my college data structures courses are immediately negated .
If you 've got pervasive hash table support , then you 've also got arrays ( just hash tables with integer keys ) , growable arrays ( ditto ) , sparse arrays ( again , same thing ) , and it 's rare to have to bother with binary trees , red - black trees , tries , or anything more complex .
Okay , sets are still useful , but they 're hash tables where only the keys matter .
I 'd even go so far as to say that with pervasive hash table support it 's unusual to spend time thinking about data structures at all .
It 's key / value pairs for everything .
( And if you need convincing , study Peter Norvig 's Sudoku solver . )
If you do n't believe the theory that functional programming went mainstream years ago , then at least consider that the mismatch between dictionary - based programming and functional programming has dealt a serious blow to the latter .
Now , sure , it 's easy to build a purely functional dictionary in Erlang or Haskell .
In fact , such facilities are already there in the standard libraries .
It 's using them that 's clunky .
Reading a value out of a dictionary is straightforward enough , but the restrictions of single - assignment , and that " modifying " a hash table returns a new version , calls for a little puzzle solving .
I can write down any convoluted sequence of dictionary operations :
Add the value of the keys " x " and " y " and store them in key " z " .
If " z " is greater than 100 , then also set a key called " overflow " and add the value of " extra " to " x . "
If " x " is greater than 326 , then set " finished " to true , and clear " y " to zero .
and in Python , Ruby , Lua , or Perl , minimal thought is required to write out a working solution .
It 's just a sequence of operations that mimic their textual descriptions .
Here 's the Python version , where the dictionary is called " d " :
d ['z ' ] = d [ 'x ' ] + d [ 'y ' ] if d ['z ' ] > 100 : d['overflow ' ] = True d[ 'x ' ] += d[' extra ' ] if d['x ' ] > 326 : d[' finished ' ] =
True d['y ' ] = 0
I can certainly write the Erlang version of that ( and , hey , atoms , so no quotes necessary ! ) , but I can't do it so mindlessly .
( Go ahead and try it , using either the dict or gb_trees modules . )
I may be able to come up with Erlang code that 's prettier than Python in the end , but it takes more work , and a minor change to the problem definition might necessitate a full restructuring of my solution .
Well , okay , no , the previous paragraph is n't true at all .
I can bang - out an Erlang version that closely mimics the Python solution .
And as a bonus , it comes with the big benefit of Erlang : the hash table is completely isolated inside of a single process .
All it takes is getting over the psychological hurdle -- and the lecturing from purists -- about using the process dictionary .
( You can use the ets module to reach the same end , but it takes more effort : you need to create the table first , and you have to create and unpack key / value pairs yourself , among other quirks . )
Let me come right out and say it : it 's okay to use the process dictionary .
Clearly the experts agree on this , because every sizable Erlang program I 've looked at makes use of the process dictionary .
It 's time to set aside the rote warnings of how unmaintainable your code will be if you use put and get and instead revel in the usefulness of per-process hash tables .
Now what 's really being preached against , when the horrors of the process dictionary are spewed forth , is using it as a way to sidestep functional programming , weaving global updates and flags through your code like old - school BASIC .
But that 's the extreme case .
Here 's a list of situations where I 've found the process dictionary to be useful , starting from the mildest of instances :
Low - level , inherently stateful functions .
Random number generation is the perfect example , and not too surprisingly the seed that gets updated with each call lives in the process dictionary .
Storing process IDs .
Yes , you can use named processes instead , and both methods keep you from having to pass PIDs around , but named processes are global to the entire Erlang node .
Use the process dictionary instead and you can start multiple instances of the same application without conflict .
Write - once process parameters .
Think of this as an initial configuration step .
Stuff all the settings that will never change within a process in the dictionary .
From a programming point of view they 're just like constants , so no worries about side effects .
Managing data in a tail recursive server loop .
If you done any Erlang coding you 've written a tail - recursive server at some point .
It 's a big receive statement , where each message handling branch ends with a recursive call .
If there are six parameters , then each of those calls involves six parameters , usually with one of them changed .
If you add a new parameter to the function , you 've got to find and change each of the recursive calls .
Eventually it makes more sense to pack everything into a data structure , like a gb_tree or ets table .
But there 's nothing wrong with just using the simpler process dictionary for key / value pairs .
It does n't always make sense ( you might want the ability to quickly roll back to a previous state ) , but sometimes it does .
Handling tricky data flow in high - level code .
Sometimes trying to be pure is messy .
Nice , clean code gets muddled by having to pass around some data that only gets used in exceptional circumstances .
All of a sudden functions have to return tuples intead of simple values .
All of a sudden there 's tangential data hitchhiking through functions , not being used directly .
And when I start going down this road I find myself getting frustrated and annoyed , jumping through hoops to do something that I would n't even care about in most languages .
Making flags or key elements of data globally accessible , is a huge sigh of relief , and the excess code melts away .
( If you 've read this and are horrified that I 'm completely misunderstanding functional programming , remember that I 've gone further down the functional path than most people for what appear to be state - oriented problems . )

David Chisnall takes a look at a number of optimization techniques that have been recommended over the years , discussing why they no longer work on modern architectures .

It 's often said that there are two rules to follow when optimizing code :
Do n't optimize .
Do n't optimize yet ( experts only ) .
Although this thinking is slightly facetious , there 's a good reason why the second rule is marked as " experts only . "
Optimizing code means either making it run faster or making it take up less space ( ideally both , but in most cases it 's a tradeoff ) .
Generally speaking , you can do two kinds of optimizations :
Algorithmic improvements .
If you go from using a bubble sort to using a merge sort , for example , your code will be faster .
A quick sort usually will make it even faster , although this result depends somewhat on the input data .
If you go from using a bubble sort to using a merge sort , for example , your code will be faster .
A quick sort usually will make it even faster , although this result depends somewhat on the input data .
Choosing good algorithms is generally the best way of making your code go quickly .
This practice has the nice advantage that it works independently of the programming language you use or the architecture of the underlying system .
Sometimes , however , even the best algorithm you can design is still too slow .
Optimizations specific to a language or implementation .
This type of optimization requires a thorough understanding of how your compiler and CPU work .
Unfortunately , over the years many of these techniques have been incorporated into rules that made sense for some architectures in the past , but no longer are practical .
This article examines some of these popular ( but now outdated ) rules for optimization .
A Load of Shift
On older CPUs , multiplication was very slow ; in particular , multiplying by a constant was no faster than multiplying by a variable .
One common trick was to decompose multiplications into sequences of add and shift operations .
If you were compiling for an early RISC CPU , this would be done for you , because the CPU had no " multiply " hardware .
On other machines , it was done for speed .
Multiplication by a power of two can be translated trivially into a left - shift operation .
Essentially , any multiplication can be rewritten in terms of add and shift operations .
For example , multiplying by 5 is equivalent to multiplying by 4 and adding the result once .
The following two statements are equivalent :
// Multiply directly a *= 5 ; // Multiply using shift - and - add a = a + ( a << 2 ) ;
You can rewrite any multiplication operation in this way , and on a lot of systems this technique used to be much faster for multiplying by a constant .
This was such a good trick that some compilers including GCCused to do this translation automatically .
Then hardware multipliers got better .
CPUs like the AMD Athlon could do integer multiplication quickly .
Because most programs contained a lot of multiplications and not many shifts , AMD put two shift units and one multiply unit in the Athlon , which meant that it could do two multiplications at a time , but only one shift .
Because most multiplication by a constant requires several add - and - shift operations , suddenly the code was faster ( not to mention clearer ) if you wrote the multiplication instead of the add - and - shift .
Most modern CPUs are superscalar , meaning that they can execute two or more adjacent instructions simultaneously if the operations are n't dependent on each other and the CPU has enough free execution units .
The independence requirement is important here ; while two multiplications can often be done in parallel , each shift and add needed to simulate the multiplication depends on the result of the previous one , so this practice can cause pipeline stalls on in - order architectures ( and even on out - of - order architectures ) when other instructions are pushed too far back in the instruction stream to be seen .
Modern CPUs get a lot of their speed from pipelining .
Many instructions on something like a Core 2 take 10  20 cycles to execute , but because they 're decomposed into a large number of independent steps , you can start a second operation only one or two cycles after the first one has started .
This practice is even more pronounced on modern systems .
To demonstrate this principle , I wrote two simple programs for the Core 2 Duo .
Both loop 1,000,000,000 times , multiplying a running counter by 12345 .
Program A uses a multiply instruction ; program B uses a sequence of shifts and adds ( 10 in total ) .
Program A takes 3.7 seconds to complete , whereas the shift - and - add version in program B takes 21.3 seconds .
Thus , the " naïve " version is almost 7 times faster than the " optimized " version .
This result is n't just because the multiplication is faster .
A lot of the extra time is taken up with loads and stores , and program B's add - and - shift version involves a lot of moving of operands between hidden registers inside the execution units , and shuffling data from the end of the pipeline back to the start .
Another version , with just a single shift , ran marginally faster than the program A multiplication ; even turning a " multiply by 2 " into a " left - shift by 1 " gives almost no performance improvement ( less than 1 % ) on a Core 2 .
The important point here is that just because something used to be slow on old CPUs does n't mean that it 's still slow .
You should always time your optimizations and make sure that they really offer an improvement in speed .
When I started programming in C , most processors did n't have floating - point units .
Any floating - point calculations were implemented entirely in software , and typically were two orders of magnitude slower than integer operations .
These days , floating - point operations are done in hardware and are often within a factor of 2 of the speed of integer operations .
Floating - point has gone from being something that should be used only when absolutely necessary to something to be avoided only in performance - critical code , or in code intended to run on embedded systems with no floating - point unit ( FPU ) .
Gizmodo reports that it in its media briefing prior to last week 's introduction of new hardware , Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller noted that the company has completed its holiday hardware lineup and will not be introducing any more new products before then .
This time we got official word in the last one - on - one media briefing from Apple , in which they told Brian about the new iMac 27 , the new Unibody MacBook , and new Magic Mouse .
We were talking casually about about it , and he mentioned something that Phil Schiller told him :
There are not going to be any new Apple products this year .
Yes , that 's what my favorite Apple VP said .
After the initial report , Apple contacted Gizmodo to clarify that Schiller 's exact comment was " The holiday lineup is set . "
Apple made a similar comment in early November last year , squashing rumors of hardware revisions circulating at that time .
No specific near - frame hardware rumors have been circulating at this time , although the recent discovery of unreleased MacBook Pro models listed in a configuration file in the latest Mac OS X 10.6.2 build has sparked some minor speculation of a possible refresh .
Mysterious comments from Apple executives at the company 's earnings conference call last week regarding unusual air freight costs in the current quarter had also generated some discussion about possible major product introductions beyond the revised iMac , MacBook , and Mac mini models released the following day .
A little known fact about the unibody touchpad is that it can distinguish between up to eleven touch points - i.e. , fingers .
Another little known fact is that the sensor knows about the contact surface area ( in terms of ellipsoids ) .
Another yet less known fact is that Johan Nordberg did n't sleep much last night , and wrote a neat OS X application which simply plots what the trackpad ( or Magic Mouse ! ) is saying about touches .

Update : Apparently works on older MacBooks as well !

The tragedy of the commons is the name economists use to describe the abuse of common property .
For example , overfishing in international waters .
Someone who owns a lake will not over fish his own lake because he knows he will benefit in the future from restraining his fishing now .
But in international waters , no individual has an incentive to restrain fishing .
Mankind as a whole certainly benefits from restraint , but single fishermen do not .
Michael Heller discusses an opposite effect , the tragedy of the anti-commons , on the EconTalk podcast .
The tragedy of the commons describes the over -use of a resource nobody owns .
The tragedy of the anti-commons describes the under-use of resources with many owners .
For example , suppose an acre of land belongs to 43,560 individuals who each own one square foot .
The land will never be used for anything as long as thousands of people have to agree on what to do .
The example of land being divided into tiny plots is a artificial .
A more realistic example is the ownership of patents .
Building a DVD player requires using hundreds of patented inventions .
No company could ever build a DVD player if it had to negotiate with all patent holders and obtain their unanimous consent .
These patents would be worthless due to gridlock .
Fortunately , the owners of the patents used in building DVD players have formed a single entity authorized to negotiate on their behalf .
But if you ’re creating something new that does not have an organized group of patent holders , there are real problems .
According to Michael Heller , it is simply impossible to create a high - tech product these days without infringing on patents .
A new drug or a new electronic device may use thousands of patents .
It may not be practical even to discover all the possible patents involved , and it is certainly not possible to negotiate with thousands of patent holders individually .
Small companies can get away with patent violations because the companies may not be worth suing .
But companies with deep pockets such as Microsoft are worth suing .
These companies develop their own arsenal of patents so they can threaten counter suits against potential attackers .
This keeps the big companies from suing each other , but it does n’t prevent lawsuits from tiny companies that may only have one product .
Listen to the EconTalk interview for some ideas of how to get around the tragedy of the anti-commons , particularly in regard to patents .
O , no !
Bill O'Reilly , Maureen O'Hara , Rosie O'Donnell Face Airline Ban Apostrophe in name could get you thrown off flights in ID mix - up .
Nov. 5 , 2009  -- Bill O'Reilly , Rosie O'Donnell and Maureen O'Hara could soon be thrown off U.S. flights under tough new airline rules .
The reason ?
The Transportation Security Administration will soon insist on matching passengers ' boarding passes to their IDs - including any apostrophes hyphen and initials .
The problem there is that most computer systems do n't recognize apostrophes which means it 's Bad Luck O '
The Irish for people with an O ' in their name - like half the Irish population .
Once the new rules are in place , Mary O'Connor wo n't be flying unless her boarding pass says Mary O'Connor .
But it wo n't be Mary 's fault .
The airline systems can't handle Irish O'Names so they run the last name as OConnor .
Which is not the same as the name on Mary 's passport or driving licence .
Irish Central founder and publisher Niall O'Dowd found this out the hard way when he was trying to book a flight to Atlanta .
" I had to drop the apostrophe and run my name as ' ODowd , ' " he said .
" I felt like I was giving up my national identity . "
Another frequent Irish flier , Sean O'Hare , said he regularly has trouble in the U.S .
" I do n't understand why the airlines can't cope with apostrophes , " he said .
" Every time I come to the U.S. I have trouble with it .
" The irony of it all is that the airport I use the most is O'Hare in Chicago .
" I pointed out that I had the same name as the airport but they were n't happy about it . "
The Transportation Security Administration says the program , which is part for the Secure Flight initiative , is expected to be fully operational in 2010 .

Breathing too easily ?
Well here , swallow DeMint ...
by Jeremy Hooper
This from Bloomberg News :
[ Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) ] takes a hard line on social issues , passionately anti- abortion and pro-guns .
He has been most outspoken as an opponent of any form of gay marriage .
“ Marriage is a religious institution .
The federal government has no business redefining what it is , ” DeMint says .
This is one issue where he does n’t support states ’ rights ; state government should n’t have the right to permit gay marriage : “ Governments should not be in the business of promoting a behavior that ’s proven to be destructive to our society . ”
He cringes at the notion of a gay or lesbian president : “ It would be bothersome to me just personally because I consider it immoral . ”
DeMint 's Back - to - Basics Plan for Republicans : Albert R. Hunt [ Bloomberg ]
( H/t : Towle )
Okay , so let 's process this :
He says that marriage is a religious institution , even though religion is not at all a requirement for a civil marriage .
He does n't think the federal government has the right to weigh in , unless , apparently , it 's for an FMA ( which he supported ) .
He also does n't think states have a right to allow marriage equality , which apparently makes gays and lesbians the one group of citizens who are barred from following through the proper channels of state government to secure their rights .
He outright says that we are destructive to society , a toxic idea that is almost too unfathomable and DeMinted demented to even believe is coming from a sitting U.S. Senator in the 21st century .
He has no qualms telling his many thousands of LGBT constituents that they 're immoral and unpresidential , simply because they were born to love in a different way than he was .
And the only criteria that he , someone who 's sworn to act in accordance with the constitution , feels that he needs in order to make such harsh pronouncements is the personal personal belief that stems from his own interpretation of certain biblical passages .
Happy holidays , South Carolina gays !
Your senatorial Santa apparently mistook his naughty / nice list for an unprincipled homo - hostile hit list .
So sleep well while these visions of forced " ex - gay " therapy dance in your heads .
Or better yet :
Find out the best way to exchange his harmful rhetoric for a one way bus pass from D.C. to SC !
Just because we 're told that the senator 's 2010 reelection is all but assured , it does n't make it so .
With the way he shoots these bullets at us , a self - inflicted foot - shot in not at all an impossibility !
Your thoughts
If he really believed his own rhetoric , he would have to oppose the government standing in the way of the various religious institutions that wish to conduct same - sex marriages .
Posted by : Dan T. | Dec 14 , 2009 5:08:31 PM
IF marriage is a religious institution , and the Federal govt .
has no business " redefining " [ sic ] it , then it also has no business defining it , nor even promoting or sanctioning it .
In other words , according to Demint 's logic , no govt , state or federal should have anything to do with marriage at all !
But then again , we 're talking about civil marriage , are n't we ?
Posted by : keltic | Dec 14 , 2009 5:16:29 PM
Is he also stating that heterosexuals who do n't subscribe to any particular religion should also be barred from civil marriage ?
Fail .
Posted by : SammySeattle | Dec 14 , 2009 5:34:51 PM
In this case , if your breath already stinks , a DeMint will make it even worse .
Posted by : Mike Tidmus | Dec 14 , 2009 5:54:22 PM
“ Marriage is a religious institution . "
Which religion - oh wait , it must be Biblical ( christianity ) .
In that case there are over one dozen different " definitions " of marriage .
• He does n't think the federal government has the right to weigh in , unless , apparently , it 's for an FMA ( which he supported ) .
Why would the blatant hypocrisy surprise you ?
Posted by : Dale | Dec 14 , 2009 6:30:09 PM
Ha !
I love that he asserts that marriage is a religious instuition and that the federal government has no business redefining what it is .
Then why Mr. Pepper - de- mint has the government defined marriage as the union between one man and one woman ?
I guess ya' like that the federal government has overstepped their bounds there huh ?
I wish that people would stop making same - sex marriage some moral holier than thou issue .
It 's a civil rights isssue .
I do n't want to get married in a Baptist Church or have the Pope bless my marriage , I just want the same rights all those hetero's get .
Oh , and Mr. Pepper - de- mint , the thought of a homosexual as president makes you sick , that 's about how I feel knowing someone like you is sitting in the senate making important decisions about my life .
Posted by : Chandler Crook | Dec 14 , 2009 7:58:43 PM
I seriously know how pathetic the lives of these christian freaks are .
As I make the most of my life skydiving , learning even more theoretical mathematics , enjoying my racing stable and my one and only sister ( the other is a southern baptist - no need to explain that we have n't communicated in two decades ) it almost makes me sad that these people have wasted their lives .
Did I say " almost ? " I take that back .
These pathetic excuses for human beings deserve to live lives of hatred .
It must be worse than hell .
Posted by : Dale | Dec 14 , 2009 8:20:27 PM
I am giving my vote to any candidate Senator DeMint did not endorse .
I think the Republicans have potential if they focus away from the social issues , young people are n't buying much of it these days .
I hope the Republicans get under 35 US Senate seats and keep on losing until they realize what is wrong with them .
I do refuse to vote Democratic , but I will vote Libertarian if there is ever any more DeMint acolytes running in my area .
In California Chuck DeVore ( DeMint endorsed ) is going to be eaten alive by Boxer if he wins the nomination .
But Carly is going to be eaten alive by Boxer for her lackluster skills at HP .
Boxer is one lucky dog .

Senator DeMint : “ Governments should not be in the business of promoting a behavior that ’s proven to be destructive to our society . ”
He 's right .
Government should not be promoting bigotry .
While there is no evidence that homosexuality is destructive to our society , there is plenty of evidence that bigotry is destructive .
The only " evidence " the DeMinted crowd can cite is really along the lines of :
The presence of homosexuality in society bothers me and my friends , therefore homosexuality is destructive .
Posted by : Richard Rush | Dec 15 , 2009 2:06:40 PM
Richard , he * is* right that homosexuality is destructive to civilization .
It shatters every illusion of cultural power he has .
Derrick Jensen put it best : " The realization [ of why many people hate homosexuals ] came , oddly enough , when I was listening to a military spokesperson outlining reasons gays should not be allowed into the military [...]
His main reason was that it would destroy the chain of command .
' Can you imagine what would happen , ' he asked , obviously rhetorically , 'if a private had sex with a captain ?
The captain would no longer have any authority . '
" It was clear from the context his point was not intimacy , but rather penetration .
If the inferior penetrated the superior , the superior would no longer be such .
I suddenly understood what a lot of feminists have been saying for many years , that within our system , sexuality is an act of power , with a fucker , and a fucked .
" And in a culture where men consider themselves superior to women , men fucking women is a sign that all is well with the world .
Feminist author Catharine MacKinnon put this as succinctly as possible : ' Man fucks woman , subject verb object . '
Any deviation from that behavior - And homosexuality is certainly not the only way to deviate - chips away at the illusions that it 's natural for men to rule women and that it 's natural to manifest this rule through sex ( as opposed to ' using ' sex for pleasure and communication , is I may venture a wild and crazy idea ) .
" Recognizing that our most intimate relationships need not be based on power points toward an even more dangerous possibility , that all of our relationships can have as their basis pleasure and communication : that they can consist of communion . "

Sally Sara reported this story on Saturday , October 17 , 2009 08:03:00
ELIZABETH JACKSON : Another suicide car bombing in the Pakistani city of Peshawar has killed at least 12 people and injured seven .
It 's the second attack in as many days and comes as the Pakistani government prepares for a sustained assault on Taliban strongholds .
Our South Asia correspondent Sally Sara is in Islamabad .
I spoke to her a short time ago and asked her whether the Pakistani people were unnerved by the fact that this latest attack happened in an area which is considered to be one of Pakistan 's most secure , near an army garrison .
SALLY SARA :
That 's right , and that 's a pattern that we 've seen with a lot of the attacks in the past three or four days , is that the militants from the Taliban have been able to hit what they call ' hard targets ' - those that are heavily , protective ... protected , and also targets which are very iconic .
So being able to hit military and police targets and also areas where civilians are ; that 's the pattern that we 've seen in these attacks which have claimed so many lives over the past few days .
ELIZABETH JACKSON :
And this was quite obviously aimed directly at Pakistan 's police service .
I think three officers were among those killed this time ?
SALLY SARA : That 's right .
But again , unfortunately , when these attacks are happening in busy areas , many of the victims as it was the case with this particular attack , were civilians ; women and children in this case , lost their lives ; those who happened to be walking past when such powerful explosives were detonated .
In this case police were saying up to 70 kilograms of high - quality explosives was detonated .
And if you look at some of the television pictures of this attack a mosque which was nearby , a two story building , part of the wall on the upper floor of that is just completely gone .
So you can imagine the force of those explosives and the effect that that would have on a human body of those people who just were walking past when the blast happened .
ELIZABETH JACKSON : Sally , what 's been the reaction ?
Is the Pakistani Government still claiming that Taliban militancy is still on the back - foot ?
SALLY SARA : The Government has been giving some mixed messages ; praising the security forces and then in the same breath saying that some members of the security forces simply are n't equipped or experienced to deal with this kind of threat .
The Interior Minister Rehman Malik was talking yesterday and said that it 's very important for people in Pakistan to unite in the war against terrorism , but also important for them not to underestimate the Taliban .
So , the Government have really seen that , particularly with these high profile police targets that the militants from the Taliban have been able to attack these high priority , high profile targets seemingly with very little effort at all .
ELIZABETH JACKSON :
And of course these latest wave of attacks come as Pakistan 's military prepares for what the Government has said is an imminent assault on the Taliban stronghold in South Waziristan .
SALLY SARA :
It is partially to do with that .
The Government approved this military operation into South Waziristan back in the middle of the year .
It has n't happened yet .
The negotiations between the military and the Government are now drawing closer , and of course in that part of the world near the border with Afghanistan , winter and snow are coming soon so the Government is running out of time for the military to go in there .
So the feeling is that that operation is imminent .
More than 90,000 civilians have already fled their homes from that area because their fears are very strong that this operation is about to get underway .
So the Taliban has said to the Government that if you go ahead with this operation in South Waziristan in the heartland of the Taliban , if you target our leadership , we are giving you a taste now of what will happen .
ELIZABETH JACKSON : That 's our South Asia correspondent Sally Sara , joining us from Islamabad .
A number of modern Web features cannot be used pervasively on the Internet because Microsoft 's dominant browser , Internet Explorer , often fails to support current and emerging standards .
Google has a plan to drag IE into the world of modern browsing by building a plugin that will allow it to use Chrome 's HTML renderer and high - performance JavaScript engine .
Microsoft has recently taken promising steps forward by engaging with the standards community and adding much - needed features in Internet Explorer 8 .
Although this demonstrates a willingness to improve , it does n't change the fact that Microsoft is still lagging far behind other browser vendors .
Perhaps more troubling than the deficiencies of IE8 is the tragic longevity of IE6 , which was released in 2001 and is long overdue for retirement .
Some companies unfortunately cannot give it up , either , because they depend on proprietary Web software that only supports legacy versions of IE .
Google hopes that delivering Chrome 's rendering engine in an IE plugin will provide a pragmatic compromise for users who can't upgrade .
Web developers will be able to use an X - UA - Compatible meta tag to specify that their page should be displayed with the Chrome renderer plugin instead of using Internet Explorer 's Trident engine .
This approach will ensure that the Chrome engine is only used when it is supposed to and that it wo n't disrupt the browser 's handling of legacy Web applications that require IE6 compatibility .
Installing a plugin is arguably less disruptive to users than migrating them to a different browser .
It is unclear , however , if IT departments that refuse to upgrade their users to a better browser are going to be comfortable deploying new plugins .
I discussed this issue with Google software engineer Alex Russel and group product manager Mike Smith who cited the ubiquity of Flash as an example of how the plugin strategy could have the potential to move the Web forward .
We asked Google if it will be providing packages and tools to make it easier for IT departments to deploy the plugin .
It 's still much too early for that , Google explained , but it 's something that Google might explore when the project matures .
The search giant will , however , provide scripts and other mechanisms that Web developers can integrate into their pages to encourage Internet Explorer users to install the plugin .
Google is opening the source code now to get feedback and assistance with testing .
The plugin will include Google 's speedy V8 JavaScript engine , support for Canvas , SVG , and all of the other features that users enjoy today in Chrome .
That also includes the next - generation CSS rendering features of WebKit such as rounded corners .
The pages will look just like they would if they were rendered in Chrome .
Mozilla has previously experimented with similar initiatives , but none that match this scope .
Mozilla 's Screaming Monkey project , for example , aims to make Mozilla 's JavaScript engine accessible through IE as a plugin .
Mozilla also has an experimental prototype that provides the Canvas element as a plugin .
Google is going much further by providing the entire renderer .
If the plugin is adopted by a sufficiently broad number of users , then Web developers will never again have to contend with IE 's limitations .
It could also open the door for adoption of HTML 5 and other important emerging standards .

Shytle 's discovery of successful new clinical uses for mecamylamine , a drug once used to treat hypertension , has led to several issued patents on mecamylamine and related compounds .
Earlier this month , Shytle , associate professor and research scientist at the USF Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair and the USF Silver Child Development Center , received the university 's 2009 " Excellence in Innovation " award .
The award recognizes Shytle 's translational research achievements in developing new intellectual property based on clinical research and novel pharmacological discoveries which have led to newly commercialized therapeutics .
His most recent success is with a new experimental antidepressant , known as TC - 5214 , which is covered by USF patents and licensed to Targacept , Inc. , a clinical - stage biopharmaceutical company that develops neuronal nicotinic receptor therapeutics .
Targacept recently announced the positive results on TC - 5214 as add - on treatment in a large clinical trial of adult patients with treatment - resistant major depressive disorder .
While the Innovation Award encourages USF faculty to " think out of the professorial box , " for Shytle the road leading " out of the box " and to the success of TC - 5214 was long , winding , and strewn with professional and emotional ups and downs as well as moments both serendipitous and Eureka .
" TC - 5214 is a unique form of an old Merck drug called ' mecamylamine , ' once used to treat severe hypertension in the 1950s , " Shytle said .
" Because later research suggested that mecamylamine interacted with brain nicotine receptors , we thought it might have a variety of therapeutic effects similar to nicotine , but without the side effects and addiction . "
Building on earlier USF clinical research using transdermal nicotine to treat patients with Tourette 's syndrome ( characterized by body movements ( tics ) and vocalizations ) , Shytle , worked closely with USF professors , Archie A. Silver , MD ; David Sheehan , MD ; and Paul Sanberg , PhD , DSc , to investigate the effects of mecamylamine in Tourette 's patients to see if it could help control their symptoms , as observed with nicotine .
" After carefully designing and conducting a large clinical trial in children with Tourette 's syndrome in 1999 , we were shocked and disappointed to find that the drug had no effect on the tic symptoms , " Shytle said .
" After reading several reports about how many antidepressants appeared to be interacting with nicotine receptors the same way as mecamylamine did , we decided to go back and take a second look at the data from our clinical trial .
And there it was , like finding a gold nugget buried under the sand , clear evidence for an antidepressant effect of mecamylamine , but not for the placebo , in those Tourette 's subjects who had depressive symptoms . "
Based on those clinical findings , the researchers published a hypothesis paper in the prestigious journal , Molecular Psychiatry , proposing that nicotine receptor blockade might represent a novel pharmacological target for achieving therapeutic antidepressant properties .
That hypothesis has now been supported by three clinical trials with mecamylamine , one by a group at Yale and two larger studies conducted by Targacept .
The latest trial was conducted using TC - 5214 , a unique form of mecamylamine , predicted by the USF patents to be more effective with fewer side effects when compared to the older parent drug .
The results of this study are expected to have profound implications for the future treatment of major depression , making TC - 5214 's impact on the market potentially huge .
" The Excellence in Innovation Award that Dr. Shytle received is a testament to the kind of creative translational research that attracts excellent industry partners , like Targacept , who have the vision and technical expertise to take our intellectual property to the next level of commercial development , " said Sanberg , associate vice president for research and innovation at USF .
The USF license agreement with Targacept includes a percentage of sublicense and milestone payments as well as a royalty stream through 2021 should the drug achieve FDA approval .
Shytle is an inventor on several USF patents in addition to four on mecamylamine and related compounds .

For updated information regarding Typhoon Lupit and the Philippines CLICK HERE
Within the previous post , I made the following comment regarding the Typhoon Lupit Forecast Track : “ I would also keep my ears on if I were in Taiwan .
The fact that the storm has slowed down may allow for some other environmental factors that would cause the track to change significantly . ”
What I was talking about is that the forecast track that has been so consistent for so long with a landfall for the northern Philippines was based on the assumption of the storm maintaining a consistent forward motion .
I had noted that Typhoon Lupit was slowing down .
The problem with that is that as it slows down , it allows for the increasing potential that the steering mechanisms will change .
That appears to have happened .
The models , which had been tightly packed are now all over the place .
It is no longer a probability that Typhoon Lupit strikes the Philippines but instead just one of a number of possibilities .
There is even the real possibility that this storm hits nothing ; that is curves north of the Philippines , stays east of Taiwan and gets picked up in the flow such that it races northeast off the Japan coast .
But again , that is but one possibility .
As it stands now , the official track takes Typhoon Lupit just along the northern coast of Luzon at a very slow pace if not nearly stationary .
That would be potentially very bad as the center of circulation would stay offshore and heavy rain potential for over 48 hours over Luzon could be extremely problematic .
I would almost venture to say that this is a worse scenario than a direct quick hit and passage .
But , if you read the forecast reasoning from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center below , you can read the number of times that they speak of uncertainty .
The reason for that is that , as previously stated , the models are all over the place .
There are indications that the steering ridge to the west over China is eroding .
That would tend to support the models contention that the ridge over the Pacific will become more dominant with its influence .
Think of it as a weakness between ridges and if that is the case , then the storm will want to go poleward between the ridges in that weak channel .
But , the potential problem lies in the time it takes for that weak channel to develop .
Until it does , the storm will sorta drift around in a quasistationary state until the steering currents get more established .
That is what the early morning forecast track on October 22 reflects .
This is no longer a forecast of high confidence .
The Philippines is still not out of the woods .
But , Taiwan and Japan face a possible threat .
I had noted that there seemed to be some dry air within the storm that may inhibit intensification .
The JTWC , however , notes dry air to the northwest but reports that the Total Precipitable Water imagery does not indicate that dry air has gotten into the flow .
If the storm does in fact have enough momentum to take it down toward the Philippines before it begins to drift , the JTWC feels like there is some chance for an increase in intensity but it is almost unthinkable for this to get anywhere close to its former super typhoon status .
I would think that the biggest concern for Luzon will be rainfall and the proximity of the storm to the coast when it does become quasistationary .
If this guy lingers around too long , it may get killed by some unforseen outside influence .
So many possibilities and so many questions .

PEARL HARBOR HI / JTWC // SUBJ / PROGNOSTIC REASONING FOR TYPHOON 22W ( LUPIT ) WARNING NR 033// RMKS / 1 . FOR METEOROLOGISTS .
2 . 12 HOUR SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS .
A. TYPHOON 22W ( LUPIT ) , LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 340 NM NORTHEAST OF MANILA , PHILIPPINES , HAS TRACKED WEST - SOUTHWESTWARD AT 05 KNOTS OVER THE PAST SIX HOURS .
RECENT ANIMATED MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY SHOWS A SYSTEM WITH GOOD RADIAL OUTFLOW AND DEEP CONVECTIVE BANDS WRAPPING TIGHTLY INTO A LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER ( LLCC ) .
THE SYSTEM REMAINS IN A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT , TRANSITIONING BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE ( STR ) TO THE EAST AND THE STR TO THE WEST .
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THE SYSTEM UNDER AN UPPER -LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IN A REGION OF FAVORABLE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND LOW VERTICAL WIND SHEAR .
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE SYSTEM HAS SIGNIFICANT DRY AIR TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE SYSTEM , BUT PRECIPITABLE WATER DOES NOT YET SHOW DRY AIR INTRUSION .
POSITION IS BASED ON FIXES FROM PGTW AND RJTD .
INTENSITY IS BASED ON ESTIMATES FROM PGTW , RJTD AND KNES .
3 . FORECAST REASONING A. THIS FORECAST REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY SINCE THE LAST PROGNOSTIC REASONING BULLETIN .
THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS THE SYSTEM BECOMING QUASISTATIONARY IN THE VICINITY OF THE STRAIT OF LUZON WITH THE VERY PROBABLE SCENARIO OF A POLEWARD TURN .
B. TY 22W IS EXPECTED TO SLOW AND LOITER IN THE WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT BETWEEN THE STR TO THE EAST AND THE STR TO THE WEST .
THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY INTENSIFY IN A RELATIVELY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT AS IT APPROACHES THE NORTHERN TIP OF LUZON .
THE FURTHER WEST THE SYSTEM TRACKS , THE LESS OF AN INFLUENCE THE STR TO THE WEST BECOMES .
THE WESTERN RIDGE , HOWEVER , IS BEING ERODED BY DRY , NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BECOME A DOMINANT INFLUENCE ON THE SYSTEM IN THE EARLY TAUS .
NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE REMAINS ERRATIC , A COMMON INDICATOR OF A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT .
UNTIL THEY STABILIZE , NOT A LOT OF CREDIBILITY IS BEING PLACED ON THE MODELS .
CURRENTLY , THE MAJORITY OF AIDS HAVE THE SYSTEM MAKING A SUDDEN POLEWARD TURN BETWEEN TAUS 12 AND 24 ; PRESUMABLY THEY HAVE THE STR TO THE EAST BECOMING THE MAIN INFLUENCE ON THE SYSTEM .
CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL
ANALYSIS OF THE REGION DOES NOT REVEAL A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE SYNOPTIC STEERING FLOW , LIKELY DUE TO THE WEAK ENVIRONMENT .
THIS FORECAST PRESENTS THE SYSTEM TRACKING VERY SLOWLY IN THE ILL DEFINED STEERING FLOW .
C. AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES THE NORTHERN TIP OF LUZON , IT IS EXPECTED TO START WEAKENING SLIGHTLY AS INFLOW BECOMES DISRUPTED .
THE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK SLOWLY , AND SHOULD SEE A SLIGHT POLEWARD TURN DURING THE PASSAGE OF A SHORT - WAVE MIDLATITUDE TROUGH .
THERE REMAINS A VERY LIKELY CHANCE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE STR TO THE EAST SOMETIME BETWEEN TAU 12 AND TAU 36 , IN WHICH CASE IT WILL TURN POLEWARD AND START TO ACCELERATE INTO THE MIDLATITUDE WESTERLIES . // NNNN

Picture a day in first - century Alexandria .
You ’re relaxing in the summer sunshine , listening to learnèd philosophers discuss their thoughts , watching as workmen hoist blocks of marble to build yet another shining temple .
As you munch on olives and sip a cup of wine , you hear the sound of a train whistle and watch a paddleboat go steaming past –
Wait a second — train whistle ?
Paddleboat ?
Steam ?
It could have happened .
The Greek inventor Heron ( or Hero ) of Alexandria was an expert on the mathematics of the Babylonians , the Egyptians , and his predecessors in the Greek world ; he also invented an odometer , the vending machine , surveying instruments , and a mechanism for opening doors automatically .
Heron seems to have been delighted in creating models , perhaps as novelties , perhaps as miniature depictions of larger projects .
One of these was the æolipyle , or “ doorway of Æolos ” ( god of the winds ) , a hollow metal ball with two spouts coming out opposite sides .
When partially filled with water and then heated , it spun around at great speed .
Heron ’s æolipyle was an amusing toy .
But what if he had thought to attach pistons to it ?
Reciprocating pistons apparently were n’t invented until 1100 years later , by the Arab engineer al - Jazari , and it was another six hundred years before James Watt put the two together .
Just imagine — the Industrial Revolution in the ancient Mediterranean !
Smokestacks towering over Alexandria , locomotives puffing through the Attic countryside , the Roman Empire expanding as steamships set out across the Atlantic . . .
Never mind .

Recently by Gary North : On Sacrificing for an Idea
Three decades ago , I was visiting a friend .
He was a graduate of the Harvard Business School .
He was beginning a successful career as an entrepreneur .
We were outside , watching his son play .
His son was about five years old .
“ Robbie , ” he said , “ why does daddy have to go to work every day ? ”
“ To buy money , ” Robbie replied .
“ No , Robbie .
I go to work to earn money . ”
I responded : “ Robbie ’s right .
You go to work to buy money . ”
Robbie now owns a highly successful microbrewery , Allagash .
He goes to work every day to buy money .
Out of tradition , we speak of buyers and sellers .
But they are both buyers , and they are both sellers .
We refer to “ buyers ” when we mean “ sellers of money . ”
We refer to “ sellers ” when we mean “ buyers of money . ”
Why ?
I think the reason goes back to Ludwig von Mises ’ definition of money as the most marketable commodity .
The seller of money is the universal buyer , because that which he offers for sale is the most widely used commodity for making bids .
Why universal ?
Because money is the medium of exchange .
The person who has money to spend has the upper hand in most transactions .
There are lots of people who want his money .
There are fewer people who want whatever the producer or middleman offers for sale .
Over millennia , the public has understood the seller of money as a buyer of goods and services .
He specializes in allocating the most marketable commodity .
He stands before a crowd and says : “ I ’ve got what you all want .
Make me an offer . ”
He is a specialist in getting producers of all sorts of goods to make offers in the common unit of account .
The sellers are specialists in bidding for money .
They focus on the most marketable commodity as buyers .
They must specialize in producing for a narrow segment of the community .
Not everyone wants what they have .
By tradition , we designate as a buyer the person who owns a universal good .
We designate as a seller the person who owns the less universally demanded good .
THE STRONG HAND
The buyer is in a position to negotiate .
He can take his money elsewhere .
There are lots of offers for his money .
The person who does not understand economic theory generally thinks of the owner of money as the weaker party .
Why ?
Because the buyer is a victim of advertising techniques .
He is a victim of organized cartels .
He is a victim of insufficient knowledge of products .
In contrast , a seller is rich .
He can set the terms of exchange .
The most famous modern economist to promote this idea was John Kenneth Galbraith .
He offered a theory of countervailing power .
He thought the U.S. government should regulate the terms of exchange in order to defend the helpless consumer , i.e. , the seller of money .
He began his career as a senior official in World War II ’s Office of Price Administration , which set prices below market and then handed out ration coupons to offset the widespread shortages created by the controls .
The black market was the countervailing power to the OPA .
He resented this intrusion into the government ’s power .
This hostile attitude toward the market never left him .
What about advertising ?
The seller uses advertising to compete against other sellers .
The consumer can pick and choose among advertisers .
By the way , the critics of advertising rarely apply this criticism to national elections , where political candidates hire the same advertising firms that businesses do .
The inventor of the modern political sound bite was Rosser Reeves .
He used brief film clips to help sell Eisenhower to the voters in 1952 .
He was also the man who came up with the phrase , “ melts in your mouth , not in your hand . ”
What about organized cartels ?
They are the creation of governments .
The most powerful one is the bankers ’ cartel , which operates the monetary system in today ’s regulated world .
The enforcer is the central bank .
The critics of the free market never mention this .
This includes the economists who write the textbooks .
The buyer is supposedly the victim of insufficient knowledge .
This was not true when Galbraith wrote .
In the era of the Web , this argument is no longer even remotely plausible .
The seller of money has the strong hand because everyone wants what he owns .
The sellers of goods have what relatively few people want .
They hold the weak hand .
BUYING MORE CERTAINTY
Because money is the most marketable commodity , people can hedge against unexpected bad events by accumulating money .
We cannot know all of the bad things that may come .
We can not plan for every contingency .
The word “ contingency ” points to the problem : uncertainty .
Because we cannot afford to take steps to defend ourselves against all the things we want to avoid , we accumulate money .
Money is the most marketable commodity .
It therefore offers us ways to buy our way out of any number of bad circumstances .
When we accumulate money , we are saying , “ I do n’t know what ’s coming .
I do n’t want to be caught flat - footed .
Money lets me escape a broad range of potential disasters .
I do n’t have to become a specialist in disasters . ”
In contrast , a seller of solutions to disasters has to specialize in those types of disasters for which he can produce solutions at a profit .
He can not sell solutions to everyone who may someday want to buy his way out of a disaster .
The amount of knowledge required for such an endeavor is too great .
The capital required for such an inventory is too great .
To escape a major calamity , people rely on money , prayer , and the state , not always in this order .
When they run out of money , they look to God or the state .
Some look to the state as the only available god .
The seller of a solution to a specific calamity is in a strong position when that calamity hits .
He can sell his inventory of solutions at high prices .
There are lots of buyers and few competing sellers .
Then he gets arrested for price gouging .
Sellers then get the message .
They do not bother to stockpile solutions .
Why bother ?
The government will not let successful sellers sell to buyers who stockpiled money .
Government officials resent both forms of stockpiling .
The seller of solutions is willing to bear a lot of uncertainty .
The disaster may not hit .
A rival supplier may offer a better solution at a cheaper price .
Or he may be arrested for price gouging .
Notice what is happening here .
One person is uncertainty - averse .
He accumulates money .
The other is less uncertainty - averse .
He accumulates solutions : an inventory of goods or skills .
The two work out a deal .
One person stores up what he wants : money .
The other stores up what he wants : solutions .
Because anyone can hoard money , the rate of return on near - money assets will be low .
There are few entrepreneurial opportunities here .
The smartest entrepreneurs on earth are looking for profit opportunities in currency exchange .
The obvious opportunities get bid up in price .
So , the rate of profit falls .
You can not buy low and sell high when sharp forecasters have bid up the asset .
In contrast , the seller of highly specialized future solutions has lots of profit opportunities .
They are matched by loss opportunities .
But he is less uncertainty - averse , so he rushes in where angels and competitors fear to tread .
PROFIT AND LOSS
There is less profit from depositing money in a government - insured bank account than there is in successfully forecasting a disaster .
There are lots of people who want to buy greater certainty .
They pay for their preference by purchasing a low rate of return .
Market pricing bids down the rate of return .
“ Buy high , sell slightly higher . ”
In contrast , the entrepreneur wants a high rate of return .
He buys this by purchasing wads of uncertainty .
When an entrepreneur thinks he has had enough — enough money , enough uncertainty — he switches from supplying services to supplying money .
He no longer expects to get richer .
He expects at best to hold on to what he has .
Entrepreneurs make money by buying uncertainty with whatever money they own or borrow .
Security - seekers gain their goal by forfeiting opportunities to get rich .
In a free market , each participant is allowed to bid for the outcome he prefers .
INFLATION AND UNCERTAINTY
The great threat to a buyer of security is inflation .
When the banking system expands the money supply , it introduces uncertainty .
Prices will rise .
Which prices ?
That is uncertain .
The boom bust cycle will begin .
How soon will the boom turn into a bust ?
That is uncertain .
The person who wants security is threatened by inflation .
But he does not know what is causing price inflation .
He does not know that a rise in the money supply sets off the boom - bust cycle .
The person who revels in uncertainty has an advantage in times of monetary inflation .
The supply of uncertainty increases .
But he may guess wrong .
He may find that the uncertainty he planned for does not arrive on schedule .
In such cases , he may lose .
However , hanging onto money is highly risky in a time of monetary inflation .
The security - seeker does not understand this .
Keynesian economists do not understand this .
Politicians do not understand this .
The result of inflationary central bank policies is the production of uncertainty in excess of what the public wants to accept .
But the public does not understand Mises ’ theory of the business cycle .
Voters do not demand a halt to the increase in money .
It would not matter if they did .
Central bankers do not answer to voters .
They also do not answer to politicians .
“ Monetary policy is too important to be left to politicians , ” the paid propagandists called economists assure us .
The politicians believe this .
Until the crisis of 2008 , so did voters .
The economists also add : “ Monetary policy is too important to be left to the free market . ”
This leaves only central bankers .
Surprise , surprise .
THE GOLD COIN STANDARD AND UNCERTAINTY
Under the gold coin standard of the nineteenth century , central banks found it difficult to expand the monetary base , in order to fund the national government .
Other central banks began demanding payment in gold .
So did depositors in commercial banks .
The outflow of gold would call into question the wisdom of expanding the monetary base .
Prices remained relatively stable , 1815 — 1914 .
For the period 1870 — 1900 , prices in the United States fell .
The money supply was stable .
Output increased .
Sellers of goods and services were forced by market competition to reduce their selling prices .
Because market participants could more easily forecast the direction of prices , there was reduced uncertainty .
They did not worry much about rising prices .
They did not worry about rising prices in a foreign currency .
The gold standard was international .
Currency exchange rates were stable , not because of a government exchange rate system but because the various nations ’
IOUs to gold kept currency exchange rates in a tight band .
This way , those participants who wanted greater security at the old price level could buy it .
There were few price increases .
Those participants who wanted greater uncertainty could specialize .
They did not have to factor in general price increases .
Europe lost that system at the outbreak of World War I , when governments allowed banks to defraud depositors by refusing to pay in gold coins , as promised .
The United States lost it in 1933 , when Roosevelt confiscated as much gold as the government could get its hands on .
The result was predictable : increased uncertainty .
CONCLUSION
The free market lets us buy and sell uncertainty .
Buyers of uncertainty spend money , buy capital goods , and restructure production .
Then they sell their output for money .
Then they repeat the process .
Sellers of uncertainty ( buyers of security ) accumulate money ( cash ) and exchange this for digital promises ( bank accounts ) .
They are promised instant currency withdrawal on demand or instant spending with plastic cards .
But the international value of the digital money they accumulate has much wider zones of fluctuation .
The central banks of the world have been offering less uncertainty for large banks in the capital markets .
They do this by creating new money and spending it to buy assets , i.e. , promises to pay .
The public can therefore expect what it got in 2008 : much greater uncertainty .
As the uncertainty of money accelerates , the uncertainty of future financial events increases .

Air Force Uses Airborne Lasers to Create High - Speed Data Links
Researchers have tested the laser links at distances of almost 22 miles during flight
It was just a glimpse , but it gave us such hope .
More than two years after being knocked off his scooter and sustaining serious head injuries , Jacksoul lead singer Haydain Neale made his first public appearance in the audience of Bravo 's Motown At The Concert Hall which was recorded Oct. 4 and aired Nov. 10 .
After the house band , comprised primarily of his bandmates , announced that their performance was dedicated to Neale , the camera panned to him .
He did n't smile or wave with that erstwhile exuberance , but jerked his head as wife Michaela put an arm around him .
It was n't a long - enough glance to gauge the lingering effects of the Aug. 2007 accident .
And with the Nov. 3 release of a new Jacksoul single " Lonesome Highway " and an album of new material , Soulmate , slated for Dec. 1 , fans could n't help but think the Hamilton - born Neale was on the upswing .
His family has always been optimistic , but tightlipped , about his condition and intensive rehabilitation .
In a press release about the production of the new tunes – written , and seemingly recorded , prior to his accident – Neale says : " It takes me more time now , but I still orchestrate the room . "
Sadly , Jacksoul 's fifth album will now be the posthumous legacy of its gravelly - voiced frontman .
Relatives announced late Monday that Neale died in hospital on Sunday after a seven - month battle with lung cancer .
" Through all these challenges , Haydain 's sense of humour and love of music were ever - present , " said Michaela in the statement .
" He constantly brightened the room with his singing and his smile .
His joyful presence and beautiful voice will be missed by us all . "
Soulmate 's 10 - song collection of " songs that tell of love , hope and endurance " will join a fine catalogue anchored by " Still Believe In Love , " the No.1 most - spun Canadian track and the No.1 track on all formats simultaneously in 2004 .
" Who do you compare him to ? " said Toronto R&B singer Wade O. Brown , 39 , on whether the two - time Juno winner was the country 's most successful male soul singer .
" In terms of accolades and compositions , he was in a rare , rare class .
In a country where there 's no soul scene , he succeeded in spreading soul music without toning down his sound to cross over .
That needs to be acknowledged and heralded , " Brown said Monday .
Sultry and given to much vibrato , Neale 's distinct vocals captivated with emotional conviction .
" You felt what he sang , " said Halifax - born , Toronto - based R&B singer and Canadian Idol finalist Gary Beals .
" And he was an excellent songwriter .
The Canadian music industry has truly lost an amazing , powerful performer . "
In the liner notes for 2006 's MySoul – mainly covers from the likes of Radiohead , Teddy Pendergrass and Sam Cooke – Neale wrote : " I think music can heal and educate .
If Jacksoul never makes another recording , I 'll always be proud that our music was a positive force for not just love between couples , but love of self , community and the world . "
An interment with a private family gathering will take place later this week .
All proceeds from the sale of Soulmate will go to the Haydain Neale Family Trust .

A US major believed to have killed 13 people in a gun attack at a Texas army base was due to be deployed soon to Afghanistan , a military official said .
Maj Nidal Malik Hasan , 39 , a US - born Muslim , opened fire on fellow soldiers at Fort Hood on Thursday .
Relatives of the army psychiatrist said he had strongly opposed his deployment and had wanted to leave the army .
US officials said investigations into what prompted the attack had continued through the night .
Early on Friday the commander of the Fort Hood base , Lt Gen Robert Cone , told NBC News that , according to eyewitnesses , the gunman had shouted the Arabic phrase " Allahu Akbar ! "
[ God is great ] before opening fire .
Military officials said 12 soldiers and one civilian had been killed .
MAJOR NIDAL MALIK HASAN Born in US to Palestinian parents Joined the army and trained to be a psychiatrist Treated soldiers returning from combat zones Described as a devout Muslim Said to have been unhappy about imminent overseas deployment
Profile : Major Nidal Malik Hasan
Of the 28 people who remained in hospital , 14 had required surgery but all were in a stable condition , Col Dr Steven Braverman said .
Deputy base commander Col John Rossi declined to comment on what might have triggered the attack .
" We 'll let investigators find that out , " he said .
Maj Hasan was shot four times during the attack and is currently being treated in hospital under armed guard .
The policewoman who shot him first - named as Kimberly Munley , 34 - was among those wounded .
President Barack Obama described the shooting as " a horrific outburst of violence " .
He said : " It is difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas .
It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an army base on American soil . "
' Could have been worse '
The shooting began at about 1330 ( 1930 GMT ) on Thursday at a personnel and medical centre at Fort Hood - the largest US military base in the world , home to about 40,000 troops .
In an e-mail to the BBC , a US soldier stationed at the base described the venue as a large , open room where hundreds of soldiers were queuing up to get their pre-deployment checklists signed off .
SHOOTINGS AT FORT HOOD Shooting started at 1330 local time at Soldier Readiness Processing Center in Fort Hood , the world 's largest US military base

In pictures : Fort Hood shootings Gen Cone said a graduation ceremony for a group of soldiers was taking place nearby .
" Thanks to the quick reaction of several soldiers , they were able to close off the doors to that auditorium where there were some 600 people inside , " he said .
" As horrible as this was , I think it could have been much worse . "
A picture is beginning to emerge of the suspect , a psychiatrist who was transferred to the Texas base in July .
Reports suggested that he had been increasingly unhappy in the military and that his work at his previous post - Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington DC - had been the subject of concern .
The gunman 's cousin Nader Hasan posted a message on the Washington Post website on behalf of the family .
" We are shocked and saddened by the terrible events at Fort Hood , " it said .
" We send the families of the victims our most heartfelt sympathies . "
The cousin also told US media that Maj Hasan had been opposed to an imminent deployment overseas , describing it as his " worst nightmare " .
He said that Maj Hasan had been battling racial harassment because of his " Middle Eastern ethnicity " .

More from BBC World Service Surveillance video showed he was wearing religious attire on the day of the shooting .
A fellow Fort Hood soldier told the BBC that the incident could put pressure on Muslim American soldiers .
" It kind of puts a negative light on them and makes people distrust them because everybody is going to look at them [ and think ] : ' Well , you 're probably going to pull something like this ' , " the soldier said .
" And it 's a sad fact that that will happen . "
The New York Times said the FBI had been investigating internet postings by a man called Nidal Hasan that appeared to back suicide bombings - but said it was not clear whether it was the suspect .
Texas Governor Rick Perry ordered all flags in the state to fly at half - mast as a tribute to the victims .

One victim in the YouTube hit " Worst Parking Job Ever ! " found a brand - new car in his parking space Friday .
Todd Jamison planned to take the day off to shop for a used vehicle a week after a driver trashed his 2004 Hyundai Elantra , which he had just finished paying off .
But when colleagues called him into the office on a pretense , he found a shiny 2010 Hyundai Elantra in the lot along with a smiling Hyundai representative .
" She gives me the car , " Jamison said in a phone interview .
" I am just in shock .
I say , ' Thank you . ' "
The Oct. 22 security video , viewed more than one million times on the video - sharing website , shows a driver approaching a parking curb at an Extreme Fitness location in Thornhill .
The BMW mounts the curb and charges onto the hoods and windshields of two facing cars , smashing them .
Jamison 's car is the one in the foreground .
Then the BMW backs up and slinks away .
" We wanted to help the guy , " said Hyundai Canada representative Barb Pitblado .

Whatever comes to my mind
Rachel Maddow with the second half of her report on the political witch hunt of ACORN and the problems that the De- Fund ACORN
Act is going to bring for private war contractors if it actually passes .
As Rachel notes the De- Fund ACORN Act has a bill of attainder problem .
The Constitution prohibits the legislature from enacting bills of attainder , which means the De- Fund ACORN
Act must also include " any company that 's ever been indicted for breaking campaign finance laws , or that 's ever filed fraudulent paperwork with any federal agency " .
That means a good deal of our military contractors are going to be swept up under the law as well and it cannot only be enforced against ACORN .
Rachel reads off a list of all of the military contractors that would have their funding cut off and goes into the list of other crimes like murder , prostitution and contract fraud that they have committed as well which pale in comparison to what ACORN has been accused of .
Jeremy Scahill is asked whether the war contractors are worried about this law touching them .
His answer .
" Hell no . "
It 's all about politics and too many in Congress are bought and sold by our military industries .
And as he notes , ACORN got pennies when compared the massive sums of money these private contractors received .
And as Media Matters has documented , the media has done their part to hype the ACORN corruption story while completely ignoring the real fraud that Scahill talks about in this segment .
REPORT : ACORN OBSESSION : Beck , Hannity obsess over ACORN while virtually ignoring major corruption scandals :
SUMMARY : In light of the recent attention Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity have devoted to a supposed corruption scandal involving ACORN , Media Matters for America reviewed the coverage each host has provided on his respective television programs to a selection of well - documented political scandals and instances of corruption by companies that have received thousands of times more money from the government than ACORN has in the past 15 years .
Our findings show that both hosts have been obsessed with ACORN , devoting a massively disproportionate amount of attention to the story in comparison to their coverage of controversies involving military contractors that have received billions of dollars in federal contracts and instances of Republican corruption at the highest levels of the U.S. government .
Furthermore , since Beck joined Fox News , the amount of attention he has devoted to ACORN has skyrocketed , while his interest in other corruption scandals has remained limited .
Please go read their entire report but I wanted to share the charts they provided there to show just how slanted the media coverage has been on this issue .
Four of the biggest companies involved in Brazilian cattle farming have joined forces to stop the purchase of cattle from newly deforested areas of the Amazon .
Meat companies Marfrig , Bertin , JBS - Friboi and Minerva yesterday signed a formal moratorium in which they pledge better protection for the rainforest .
The move follows a three - year Greenpeace investigation , reported extensively in the Guardian in June , which exposed the link between forest destruction and the expansion of cattle ranching in the Amazon .
The investigation prompted calls for action from key international companies , including food group Princes and footwear manufacturers Clarkes , Adidas , Nike , and Timberland , which threatened to cancel contracts unless their beef and leather products were guaranteed free from raw materials linked to Amazon destruction .
John Sauven , head of Greenpeace , said : " Today 's announcement is a significant victory in the fight to protect the Amazon .
Cattle ranching is the single biggest cause of deforestation globally , and the fact that these multibillion dollar companies have committed to cleaning up their supply chains will lead to real change in the Amazon . "
He added : " British companies have helped make this happen by getting tough with their suppliers , but this is not the end of the story .
We now need to make sure that this agreement is properly enforced and extended to the entire cattle industry in Brazil . "
Blairo Maggi , governor of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso , which has the highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon and the largest cattle herd in Brazil , attended the signing in São Paulo .
Maggi has announced the state will support efforts to protect the Amazon and will provide high - resolution satellite images to monitor the area .
Clearing tropical forests for agriculture is estimated to produce 17 % of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions – more than the global transport system .
The Greenpeace investigation compiled government records , company documents and trade data from Brazil , China , Europe , Vietnam and the US to piece together the global movement of meat , leather and cosmetics ingredients made from Brazilian cattle .

Tens of thousands of politicians and celebrities will be allowed to keep their names off a new Government children ’s database , ministers said yesterday .
Their identities will be ‘ shielded ’ on the list which will carry details of 11 million children in England and their parents .
The £ 224 million ContactPoint database was designed in the aftermath of the Victoria Climbie murder in 2000 with the aim of ensuring that children in trouble can be identified by doctors , social workers or police officers .
Labour had already granted selected individuals the right to heavily restrict the information about their children .
Children ’s Minister Delyth Morgan said the change would merely extend practice as it applies currently with paper records .

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation , livestock is responsible for 18 per cent of the the Earth 's greenhouse gas emissions .
Cows produce harmful methane gas and environmentalists argue beef production causes greater damage than any other farming because it requires far more land and water than for any other form of animal husbandry .
Photographers take pictures of the new Japanese Nissan Motor 's electric vehicle called " Leaf " during the opening ceremony for the new company headquarters in Yokohama , Kanagawa prefecture , on August 2009 .
Move over hybrids -- the biggest buzz at this year 's Tokyo Motor Show looks set to come from electric cars as the dream of affordable zero-emission vehicles moves closer to reality .
Japanese automakers , pioneers in hybrid cars powered by a mixture of petrol and electricity , are now looking to take fuel - efficient motoring to the next level with vehicles that run on rechargeable batteries .
Nissan will put its electric car , the Leaf , on display to the public for the first time at the Tokyo Motor Show , which kicks off on Wednesday with press previews and opens to general visitors on Saturday .
The mid-sized hatchback , which will go on sale in late 2010 in Japan , is billed by Nissan as " the world 's first affordable , zero- emission car . "
It can travel more than 160 kilometres ( 100 miles ) on a single charge , at a top speed of 140 kilometres per hour .
The world 's largest automaker Toyota , which has said it aims to launch an electric vehicle by 2012 , will display a new version of its electric concept car -- the FT - EV II -- at the show .
" We think the time is almost ripe for cost levels , batteries and performance to evolve one step further , " said Toyota 's Akihiro Yanaka , who oversees the project .
Nissan will also show off a futuristic electric concept car that leans to the side when going around bends .
The " Land Glider , " just 1.1 metres ( 3 feet 7 inches ) wide , seats two people -- one in the front and one in the back .
Inspired by motorbikes and glider aircraft , it has tilting wheels that enable it to lean by up to 17 degrees .
From Honda comes the EV- N , a cute new electric concept car that can store a one - wheel personal mobility device inside its door .
The dream of an electric car , which has been around since the time of Thomas Edison , has so far failed to break into the mainstream because of the high cost and limited battery life .
But after technological advances in the development of long - lasting lithium - ion batteries , the dawn of affordable zero-emission automobiles may be approaching .
Nissan says it plans to sell the Leaf at a similar price to a comparable model with a petrol - powered engine .
The battery will be leased separately for a monthly charge that , together with the electricity cost , will be cheaper than gasoline , it says .
The Leaf will not be the first electric car on the market .
Mitsubishi Motors recently started selling its " i MiEV " minicar .
But at 4.6 million yen ( 50,600 dollars ) , for now it is aimed at corporate and government clients .
Subaru meanwhile launched the Plug - in STELLA for about 4.73 million yen but plans to deliver just 170 of the vehicles between late July and next March .
Some experts are sceptical about whether electric cars can enter the mainstream within the next decade given the lack of recharging stations and the high production costs , particularly in the current economic climate .
Mass recalls of lithium - ion batteries for laptop computers by some makers due to fears of overheating have also stirred safety concerns .
" If you look at the next four or five years , especially for electric cars , the business case is pretty challenging , " said Ashvin Chotai , the London - based managing director of Intelligence Automotive Asia , a consultancy firm .
Even by 2020 , " it 's hard to see how penetration levels of electric cars will increase significantly .
There 's still a lot of challenges in terms of concerns about the safety of the lithium - ion batteries and reducing costs . "
But others see a brighter future for electric cars given growing concerns about global warming , the prospect of a decline in production costs and the fact that many governments are offering subsidies for zero-emission vehicles .
If the price for consumers of an electric car declines below two million yen ( 22,000 dollars ) , " then demand will grow dramatically , " said Tatsuya Mizuno , director of Mizuno Credit Advisory .
" The biggest cost comes from the rechargeable batteries .
I expect the price will decline at a relatively high speed , " said Mizuno , who also thinks that safety issues surrounding lithium - ion batteries have now been resolved .

Explore further Toyota unveils ' green ' sports car
Before Columbus , Dobyns calculated , the Western Hemisphere held ninety to 112 million people .
Another way of saying this is that in 1491 more people lived in the Americas than in Europe .
New evidence of both the extent of the population and its agricultural advancement leads to a remarkable conjecture : the Amazon rain forest may be largely a human artifact
The worst thing the Spaniards did , some researchers say , was entirely without malice — bring the pigs
The Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán was bigger than Paris , Europe 's greatest metropolis .
This great essay by Charles C. Mann question the current notions about what America was like before the European conquest - how large were the native population , how advanced was their agriculture , and how much they modified the environment .
I highlighted several passages from this paper , that can be found here — — — — — — —
—————-Erickson and Balée belong to a cohort of scholars that has radically challenged conventional notions of what the Western Hemisphere was like before Columbus . [...] in their opinion this picture of Indian life is wrong in almost every aspect .
Indians were here far longer than previously thought , these researchers believe , and in much greater numbers .
And they were so successful at imposing their will on the landscape that in 1492 Columbus set foot in a hemisphere thoroughly dominated by humankind .[...]
The Beni is a case in point .
In addition to building up the Beni mounds for houses and gardens , Erickson says , the Indians trapped fish in the seasonally flooded grassland .
Indeed , he says , they fashioned dense zigzagging networks of earthen fish weirs between the causeways .
To keep the habitat clear of unwanted trees and undergrowth , they regularly set huge areas on fire .
Over the centuries the burning created an intricate ecosystem of fire - adapted plant species dependent on native pyrophilia .
[...]
The Indians in Peru had faced plagues from the day the conquistadors showed up . [...]
Smallpox claimed the Inca ruler Huayna Capac and much of his family , setting off a calamitous war of succession .
So complete was the chaos that Francisco Pizarro was able to seize an empire the size of Spain and Italy combined with a force of 168 men . [...]
In 1539 , Hernando de Soto landed his private army near Tampa Bay , in Florida .
Soto , as he was called , was a novel figure : half warrior , half venture capitalist .
He had grown very rich very young by becoming a market leader in the nascent trade for Indian slaves . [...]
He came to Florida with 200 horses , 600 soldiers , and 300 pigs .
From today 's perspective , it is difficult to imagine the ethical system that would justify Soto 's actions .
For four years his force , looking for gold , wandered through what is now Florida , Georgia , North and South Carolina , Tennessee , Alabama , Mississippi , Arkansas , and Texas , wrecking almost everything it touched .
The inhabitants often fought back vigorously , but they had never before encountered an army with horses and guns .
Soto died of fever with his expedition in ruins ; along the way his men had managed to rape , torture , enslave , and kill countless Indians .
[...]
Soto 's force itself was too small to be an effective biological weapon .
Sicknesses like measles and smallpox would have burned through his 600 soldiers long before they reached the Mississippi .
But the same would not have held true for the pigs , which multiplied rapidly and were able to transmit their diseases to wildlife in the surrounding forest .
When human beings and domesticated animals live close together , they trade microbes with abandon .
Over time mutation spawns new diseases : avian influenza becomes human influenza , bovine rinderpest becomes measles . [...]
The fact is that what scientists call zoonotic disease was little known in the Americas .
Swine alone can disseminate anthrax , brucellosis , leptospirosis , taeniasis , trichinosis , and tuberculosis .
Pigs breed exuberantly and can transmit diseases to deer and turkeys .
Only a few of Soto 's pigs would have had to wander off to infect the forest .
[...]
One reason is that Indians were fresh territory for many plagues , not just one .
Smallpox , typhoid , bubonic plague , influenza , mumps , measles , whooping cough — all rained down on the Americas in the century after Columbus .
( Cholera , malaria , and scarlet fever came later . )
Having little experience with epidemic diseases , Indians had no knowledge of how to combat them .
In contrast , Europeans were well versed in the brutal logic of quarantine .
They boarded up houses in which plague appeared and fled to the countryside .
In Indian New England , Neal Salisbury , a historian at Smith College , wrote in Manitou and Providence ( 1982 ) , family and friends gathered with the shaman at the sufferer 's bedside to wait out the illness — a practice that " could only have served to spread the disease more rapidly . " [...]
To Elizabeth Fenn , the smallpox historian , the squabble over numbers obscures a central fact .
Whether one million or 10 million or 100 million died , she believes , the pall of sorrow that engulfed the hemisphere was immeasurable .
Languages , prayers , hopes , habits , and dreams — entire ways of life hissed away like steam .
The Spanish and the Portuguese lacked the germ theory of disease and could not explain what was happening ( let alone stop it ) .
Nor can we explain it ; the ruin was too long ago and too all - encompassing .
In the long run , Fenn says , the consequential finding is not that many people died but that many people once lived .
The Americas were filled with a stunningly diverse assortment of peoples who had knocked about the continents for millennia .
[...]
The Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán dazzled Hernán Cortés in 1519 ; it was bigger than Paris , Europe 's greatest metropolis .
The Spaniards gawped like hayseeds at the wide streets , ornately carved buildings , and markets bright with goods from hundreds of miles away .
They had never before seen a city with botanical gardens , for the excellent reason that none existed in Europe .
The same novelty attended the force of a thousand men that kept the crowded streets immaculate .
( Streets that were n't ankle - deep in sewage !
The conquistadors had never heard of such a thing . )
Central America was not the only locus of prosperity .
Thousands of miles north , John Smith , of Pocahontas fame , visited Massachusetts in 1614 , before it was emptied by disease , and declared that the land was " so planted with Gardens and Corne fields , and so well inhabited with a goodly , strong and well proportioned people ... [ that ]
I would rather live here than any where . " [...] I asked seven anthropologists , archaeologists , and historians if they would rather have been a typical Indian or a typical European in 1491 .
None was delighted by the question , because it required judging the past by the standards of today — a fallacy disparaged as " presentism " by social scientists .
But every one chose to be an Indian . [...]
When scholars first began increasing their estimates of the ecological impact of Indian civilization , they met with considerable resistance from anthropologists and archaeologists .
Over time the consensus in the human sciences changed .
Under Denevan 's direction , Oxford University Press has just issued the third volume of a huge catalogue of the " cultivated landscapes " of the Americas .
This sort of phrase still provokes vehement objection — but the main dissenters are now ecologists and environmentalists .
The disagreement is encapsulated by Amazonia , which has become the emblem of vanishing wilderness — an admonitory image of untouched Nature .
Yet recently a growing number of researchers have come to believe that Indian societies had an enormous environmental impact on the jungle .
Indeed , [...]
Planting their orchards , the first Amazonians transformed large swaths of the river basin into something more pleasing to human beings . [...]
William Balée , the Tulane anthropologist , cautiously estimated that about 12 percent of the nonflooded Amazon forest was of anthropogenic origin — directly or indirectly created by human beings .
In some circles this is now seen as a conservative position .
" I basically think it 's all human - created , " Clement told me in Brazil .
He argues that Indians changed the assortment and density of species throughout the region .
So does Clark Erickson , the University of Pennsylvania archaeologist , who told me in Bolivia that the lowland tropical forests of South America are among the finest works of art on the planet .
" Some of my colleagues would say that 's pretty radical , " he said , smiling mischievously .
According to Peter Stahl , an anthropologist at the State University of New York at Binghamton , " lots " of botanists believe that " what the eco-imagery would like to picture as a pristine , untouched primeval world in fact has been managed by people for millennia . "
The phrase " built environment , " Erickson says , " applies to most , if not all , Neotropical landscapes . " [...]
Ecotourist brochures evoke the immensity of Amazonia but rarely dwell on its extreme flatness .
In the river 's first 2,900 miles the vertical drop is only 500 feet .
The river oozes like a huge runnel of dirty metal through a landscape utterly devoid of the romantic crags , arroyos , and heights that signify wildness and natural spectacle to most North Americans .
Even the animals are invisible , although sometimes one can hear the bellow of monkey choruses .
To the untutored eye — mine , for instance — the forest seems to stretch out in a monstrous green tangle as flat and incomprehensible as a printed circuit board .
[...]
Terra preta , Woods guesses , covers at least 10 percent of Amazonia , an area the size of France .
It has amazing properties , he says .
Tropical rain does n't leach nutrients from terra preta fields ; instead the soil , so to speak , fights back .
Not far from Painted Rock Cave is a 300 - acre area with a two - foot layer of terra preta quarried by locals for potting soil .
The bottom third of the layer is never removed , workers there explain , because over time it will re-create the original soil layer in its initial thickness .
The reason , scientists suspect , is that terra preta is generated by a special suite of microorganisms that resists depletion .
" Apparently , " Woods and the Wisconsin geographer Joseph M. McCann argued in a presentation last summer , " at some threshold level ... dark earth attains the capacity to perpetuate — even regenerate itself — thus behaving more like a living ' super ' - organism than an inert material .
"
In as yet unpublished research the archaeologists Eduardo Neves , of the University of São Paulo ; Michael Heckenberger , of the University of Florida ; and their colleagues examined terra preta in the upper Xingu , a huge southern tributary of the Amazon .
Not all Xingu cultures left behind this living earth , they discovered .
But the ones that did generated it rapidly — suggesting to Woods that terra preta was created deliberately .
In a process reminiscent of dropping microorganism - rich starter into plain dough to create sourdough bread , Amazonian peoples , he believes , inoculated bad soil with a transforming bacterial charge .
Not every group of Indians there did this , but quite a few did , and over an extended period of time .
[...]
Faced with an ecological problem , I was thinking , the Indians fixed it .
They were in the process of terraforming the Amazon when Columbus showed up and ruined everything . [... ]
Dr. William Brydon , the only British survivor of the 1842 defeat of an entire British army between Kabul & Jalalabad
The 9/11 attacks were planned in Germany and Spain , and conducted mainly by U.S. - based Saudis to punish America for supporting Israel .
Taliban , a militant religious , anti-Communist movement of Pashtun tribesmen , was totally surprised by 9/11 .
Taliban received U.S. aid until May , 2001 .
The CIA was planning to use Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaida to stir up Muslim Uighurs against Chinese rule , and Taliban against Russia 's Central Asian allies .
Al - Qaida only numbered 300 members .
Most have been killed .
A handful escaped to Pakistan .
Only a few remain in Afghanistan .
Yet President Barack Obama insists 68,000 or more U.S. troops must stay in Afghanistan to fight al - Qaida and prevent extremists from re-acquiring " terrorist training camps . "
This claim , like Saddam Hussein 's non-existent weapons of mass destruction , is a handy slogan to market war to the public ...
Taliban are the sons of the U.S. - backed mujahidin who defeated the Soviets in the 1980s .
As I have been saying since 9/11 , Taliban never was America 's enemy .
Instead of invading Afghanistan in 2001 , the U.S. should have paid Taliban to uproot al - Qaida .
The Pashtun tribes want to end foreign occupation and drive out the Afghan Communists , who now dominate the U.S. - installed Kabul regime .
But the U.S. has blundered into a full - scale war not just with Taliban , but with most of Afghanistan 's fierce Pashtun tribes , who comprise over half the population .
Obama is wrestling with widening the war .
After eight years of military operations costing $ 236 billion US , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan just warned of the threat of " failure , " a.k.a. defeat .
Canada has so far wasted $ 16 billion Cdn. on the war .
Western occupation forces will be doomed if the Afghan resistance ever gets modern anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles .
The U.S. is sinking ever deeper into the South Asian morass .
Washington is trying to arm - twist Pakistan into being more obedient and widening the war against its own independent - minded Pashtun tribes -- wrongly called " Taliban . "
Washington 's incredibly ham - handed efforts to use $ 7.5 billion US to bribe Pakistan 's feeble , corrupt government and army , take control of military promotions , and get a grip on Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal , have Pakistan 's soldiers on the verge of revolt .
Obama has been under intense pressure from flag - waving Republicans , much of the media , and the hawkish national security establishment to expand the war .
Israel 's supporters , including many Congressional Democrats , want to see the U.S. seize Pakistan 's nuclear arms and expand the Afghan
war into Iran .
Obama should admit Taliban is not and never was a threat to the West ; that the wildly exaggerated al - Qaida has been mostly eradicated ; and that the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan is causing more damage to U.S. interests in the Muslim world -- now 25 % of all humanity -- than Bin Laden and his few rag - tag allies .
The bombing in Madrid and London , and conspiracy in Toronto , were all horribly wrongheaded protests by young Muslims against the Afghan war .
We are not going to change the way Afghans treat their women by waging war on them , or bring democracy through rigged elections .
I ’ve been to 175 countries all around the world including Afghanistan , including every country in that region , and what I ’ve seen everywhere I go is that there are some commonalties everywhere you go .
Everywhere you go people want to fall in love .
It ’s an interesting thing .
Everywhere you go , people love children .
Everywhere , they love children .
Everywhere you go , there ’s a taboo against violence .
Every single place you go .
And everywhere you go , people want to be left alone .
And that ’s the best foreign policy of all .
Just to leave people alone .
Although the phrase has been reworked and endlessly repeated -- primarily by high school history teachers -- I believe it was George Santayana who first said " Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it " ( in the first volume of The Life of Reason ) .
Today , though , I have nothing to say about Alexander the Great , the Czarist Russians , The British , the Great Game or the Soviets and their misadventures in Central Asia .
Let 's keep this little history lesson all post - 9/11 .
Eric Margolis is best known as " an expert " on the Middle East , primarily in Canada , where he 's a contributing editor for theand a go - to journalist for all things Asia and all things Islam .
Here in the states we know him as someone who CNN and Fox use frequently .
He made his bones embedded with the mujahadeen when they were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan before most Americans knew what embedded journalists were .
Margolis is a conservative , though decidedlya neo-conservative .
Yesterday he endeavored to teach his Canadian readers a little history about the current conflict in Afghanistanonce mentioning Alexander and Roxanna , the Simla Manifesto , or even Leonid Brezhnev or Mikhail Gorbachev .
He starts with a version of another much - quoted aphorism , California Senator Hiram Johnson 's 1918 statement that " The first casualty when war comes is truth , " although some insist he got it from either Aeschylus or Sun Tzu .
Margolis 's point is that the current tragedy in Afghanistan is based on an utterly false premise , that " we 've got to fight terrorists over there so we do n't have to fight them at home . "
Few know better than him , through years of on - the - ground , gritty first hand experience how utterly untue this is .
Americans , though they oppose escalating the war and though they tend to be unfocused and confused about Afghanistan , also tend to think the World Trade towers attacks were planned out either by the Taliban or by al - Qaeda in Afghanistan with the connivance of the Taliban .
" False , " says Margolis .
The U.S. presence in Afghanistan , which , understandably is now widely looked at by the people there as a horribly foreign and often brutal and deadly occupation of their country , is making the resistance bigger , stronger and more widespread .
In Friday 's Bryan Bender pointed to American intelligence reports showing that the insurgents battling U.S. troops are fighting for lots of reasons but being religiously motivated Talban supporters is not high on the list of most of them ; some are anti-Taliban .
Only about 10 % of the insurgency is Taliban - oriented now .
No doubt , though , thousands will flock to collect the bribes Obama is leaning towards giveing Afghans who agree to forsake the Taliban .
Americans do n't get Afghanistan , do n't get Pashtunwali and need to pack up and leave the Afghans to themselves .
As Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) said a few days ago , the best foreign policy is to just leave people alone .
Grayson : Make sense to you ?
Grayson was one of the 32 Democrats who voted against the supplemental budget to fund the war back on June 16 .

i Phone service provider AT&T plans to test ways to get the company ’s heaviest network traffic hogs to stop spending all waking hours choking AT&T ’s pipes with their unlimited - access phones .
But there ’ll be no draconian usage limits or surprise fees .
Ralph de la Vega , who runs the wireless and consumer arms of the company , spoke to attendees and reporters at a conference in New York held by financial services giant UBS .
He said Dallas - based AT&T would offer “ incentives , ” rather than punishment , to get the top users to back down on their data use .
The top three percent are responsible for 40 percent of the data traveling through AT&T ’s network , said De la Vega .
“ What we actually found out is customers did n’t know how they were using data , ” he told the Wall Street Journal .
“ But once you alerted them to it , they actually reduce their consumption significantly . ”
i Phone buyers can get an unlimited data plan from AT&T for as little as $ 69 per month base price .
In fact , unlimited plans are the only kind AT&T currently sells .
It makes the iPhone plus plan an attractive package , but AT&T has been unable to keep up with the resulting demand for data downloads and uploads .
If De la Vega is correct , it might be easier than expected to keep AT&T ’s data pipes from clogging again .
( Bonus Trivia :
It was Ralph de la Vega , then the COO of Cingular before it became AT&T Mobility , who suffered the onstage humiliation of debuting Motorola ’s doomed iTunes phone onstage in 2005 .
De la Vega flew to San Francisco from New Orleans , where he had been heading Cingular ’s restoration of communications in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , to demo the Motorola ROKR and its TV ads to a VIP audience .
Alas , he was immediately followed by Steve Jobs , who pulled an iPod Nano out of his pocket and , holding the gumstick - sized music player aloft , erased the memory of the ROKR from attendees ’ minds .
Being a wireless exec seems to guarantee a life of uncool . )

What has made Walmart the world ’s largest corporation ?
According to scholar Bethany Moreton , the reason largely is a strong religious base .
“ If you want to reach the Christian population on Sunday , you do it from the church pulpit , ” said Moreton , quoting the executive director of the Christian Coalition from 1995 .
“ But if you want to reach them on Saturday , you do it at Walmart . ”
Moreton , author of “ To Serve God and Wal - Mart : The Making of Christian Free Enterprise ” ( Harvard University Press , 2009 ) , was on campus Tuesday ( Nov. 17 ) to explore the ideological foundation behind the company ’s corporate ethos , one that she said has successfully fueled the megacorporation ’s bottom line .
She appeared at Harvard Divinity School as part of its Business Across Religious Traditions colloquium series .
The connection , she said , is largely the product of Walmart founder Sam Walton , who started the discount retail chain in Arkansas in 1962 , and gradually tapped into the strong fundamentalist Christian culture across the Sun Belt .
Moreton , assistant professor of history and women ’s studies at the University of Georgia , said Walton worked into the company ’s corporate structure the notion of “ service leadership ” that ties worker roles into the concept that “ Christ was a servant leader , ” and emphasizes the importance in Christian tradition of serving others .
With this vision , said Moreton , men at the company “ earned their power through their superior ability to serve , ” while women had “ an enthusiastic audience for labor that was formally considered unskilled . ”
Even an ongoing sex- discrimination case against Walmart illustrated the strong religious connection many of its employees associate with the company .
Many of the plaintiffs in Dukes v. Walmart Stores Inc. , a class - action discrimination suit filed in 2000 that alleged that the firm offered women fewer promotions and lower pay than men , admitted to an initial strong attraction to Walmart ’s “ values . ”
According to Moreton , citing a story on the suit that appeared in The Nation , the plaintiffs ’ “ original enthusiasm for their jobs had much to do with Walmart ’s reputation as a pro-family , Christian company . ”
Another critical element of Walmart ’s success , she said , was Walmart ’s savvy ability to connect into the underlying social structure of Christian families .
In the 1980s , during regular business meetings with Walmart managers and their spouses , Walmart ’s director of family living spoke on the changed relationships between husbands and wives , which were , Moreton noted , “ fundamental to the company ’s business model . ”
Meeting attendees were told , “ Men should start expressing their appreciation to their overburdened wives .
After all , had n’t they been motivated this very weekend by Sam Walton ’s thanks for their own hard work at Walmart ?
Did they in turn show that appreciation to their wives ?
Did they show it to the women working in the stores ? ”
The message , Moreton said , picked up on the notion of the Christian model of “ headship ” and submission in Christian marriage with a similar one developing in secular management texts .
It then married them “ within a service workplace . ”

Interstellar overdrive - Linux and astronomy

Desktop astronomy has become more accessible over the last few years as hardware and software have come down in price .
For an outlay not much greater than a top of the range PC it is possible to put together a CCD powered telescope that is more than adequate for hunting comets or prospecting for asteroids which are still popular pastimes among amateur astronomers .
This optical hardware can be augmented by a substantial range of free software to process the raw images and guide amateur astronomers on where to look and what to see .

At a more prosaic level , anyone with an appropriately enabled smart phone can sit beneath the stars and view a labelled Google Sky Map that uses Android , GPS , compass data , date and time to fix your place on earth , and learn the names of the stars .
Anyone with a laptop can access the vast star catalogues that are made available across the net , and view the skies through software packages such as KStars , Stellarium or XEphem , which allow the user to scan the celestial landscape from any perpective on earth in the comfort of their living room .
Stellarium and KStars are licensed under the GPL .
XEphem is open source and free for non-commercial use .
Each of these packages can be coupled through a laptop to a telescope , and with the use of filters , dedicated CCD ( charge - coupled device ) cameras and GOTO technologies , anyone with access to a relatively modest telescope can hope to sidestep the negative effects of light pollution and observe and photograph asteroids and planets , distant nebulae and faraway moons in the kind of detail that not so long ago was the preserve of large scale observatories .

Astronomy is the oldest of the sciences .
Observing the heavens and our place among them has been a preoccupation of mankind since the beginning of time .
The need to understand and interpret the stars was a pivotal feature of the religion and philosophy of the ancients from Stonehenge to Hipparchus , from the Babylonians to the Chinese , and played a big role in the growth of mathematics and the sciences .
On a philosophical level astronomy provided a window into the mechanics of life and the universe .
On a practical level astronomy gave the means to navigate by land and sea , to construct a calendar and to tell time .
These approaches come together in the Antikythera mechanism , " an ancient mechanical calculator designed to calculate astronomical positions " , which was found on an ancient shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901 .
The Antikythera mechanism is dated to circa 150 BC and has been described as the world 's oldest analogue computer .

The use of computing devices is not new to astronomy , but was transformed during the latter half of the twentieth century by the progressive accumulation of data from satellites and radio telescopes , opening new possibilities for non-optical observation and data capture , and creating new fields of research within stellar astronomy , many of which are far beyond the reach of amateur observation - although amateurs have continued to make surprising discoveries .
GNU / Linux , with its hobbyist traditions and Unix - like appearance , accessible code and scalability from mobile device to supercomputer , has been uniquely placed as an operating system for the specialist requirements of astronomers .
Linux is used for the software that runs telescopes , the software that is used to pass instructions to satellites , and for the supercomputers and desktop utilities that enable astronomers to interpret their data .

detainee063.com : " This is the interrogation log of Mohammed al - Qahtani .
It is being published in real time : each entry will appear exactly seven years after it was first recorded .
The interrogation took place at Guantanamo Bay . "
That is him in the photo above .
He is still imprisoned in Guantanamo .
The serialized logs are not for the faint of heart .
By way of background , al - Qahtani was the first " war on terror detainee " the United States admitted to having tortured .
Snip :
Over the course of the fifty days , Al - Qahtani , Detainee 063 , is questioned by teams of interrogators working in shifts , typically for twenty hours a day .
While individual entries of the log are sometimes brutal and unpleasant to read , what is particularly disturbing about the treatment Al - Qahtani receives is its relentlessness .
By publishing the log in real time , this site is intended as a kind of re-enactment – to show how mistreatment which might not appear immediately as terrible as , for example , waterboarding , can nonetheless come to amount to nothing short of torture , how by being prolonged and unceasing it can become unbearable .
More about the project here .
Apart from the brutality , it just gets really weird .
Some of the entries go , " Played Christina Aguilera music , " or ,
Control began " birthday party " and placed party hat on detainee .
Detainee offered birthday cake – refused .
Interrogators and guards sing " God bless America " .
Detainee became very angry .
The entries are also available through an RSS feed and a Twitter account .
To those of you in the US , remember that your tax dollars paid for every word of it .

Boy , AT&T sure is n't taking Verizon 's Map for That campaign too well .
After losing a request for an injunction ( for now ) , the company seems to have decided that the only thing to do in the short term is to start advertising right back at Verizon .
Unfortunately , it looks like AT&T threw this one together in a hurry , grabbing a bucket of magnets and a board and sticking them into some abandoned warehouse with Luke Wilson and some Apple - ad - style music .
Luke did n't even have time to shave !
As for the claims made by Luke 's magnetic board , it 's hard to take issue with them since they do n't really say lot .
So AT&T 's present and accounted for in this newly minted ad war , but Verizon clearly still has the upper hand ... though this is clearly just the beginning .

( CNN ) -- Worms , spam , viruses and hackers -- they 're not just for your desktop or laptop anymore .
According to internet security experts they could be well on their way into your pocket or purse .
The popularity of smartphones -- like the Blackberry , iPhone , Palm and the emerging Droid -- is on the rise and shows no signs of letting up .
And that 's making the phones a sweeter target for online ne'er do - wells looking to , at the very least , cause mischief and , at worst , rip off unsuspecting phone owners .
" It 's guaranteed that almost everything we see on a computer will show up on a smartphone -- and some new things , " said Jake Widman , a San Francisco - based technology writer and analyst .
Last year , more than 139 million smartphones were sold worldwide , a 13.9 percent increase from 2007 , according to the British technology analysis firm Gartner .
With Apple planning to release the iPhone in China , and a more affordable Android handset expected to hit the market by the end of the year , the pool of potential targets is only expected to get deeper .
And compared to even a year ago , when analysts say most people used smartphones mostly for voice calls and e-mail , an increasing number of users are now surfing the Web , paying bills and doing other activities that open them up to abuses .
" When the market increases , there are generally more people going after it because there 's a bigger potential for gain , " said Andrew Storms , who directs safety efforts at online security company nCircle .
Security companies already have seen several threats hitting smartphones .
In most cases , they say , they 're targeted at individuals rather than the millions of desktop or laptop users that a typical e-mail attack can impact .
" What we have n't seen is the massive anonymous attacking across all of the smartphone bases , " Storms said .
" [ Traditional ] worms and viruses continue to breed and move on from computer to computer -- the attacks we see today on the smartphone market are targeted attacks . "
Security analysts say they 've already seen all of the major online threats -- Trojan horses , viruses , worms -- spreading on smartphones , often through e-mail attachments sent to the phones .
One attack even used a Bluetooth headset to try to attack other Bluetooth users within 20 feet of the infected unit .
Security problems were most pronounced in the early days of the smartphone -- when a majority of them ran on a single operating system and it was easier for malware to spread from one phone to the next .
One of the problems now , analysts say , is that people who take security precautions on their home computers either forget to do so with their phones or do n't think they need to in the first place .
" We 've not become accustomed to thinking twice about it , " Storms said .
" The risk exists .
It 's going to continue to exist and continue to increase . "
A survey by security firm Trend Micro Incorporated suggested that only 23 percent of smartphone users enable security software already loaded onto their phones and 44 percent think surfing the Internet on their phone is as safe or safer than doing so on a desktop computer -- even with no security software .
The good news , experts say , is that phones present problems for hackers and other bad guys that traditional computers do n't .
Most viruses and other malware are designed for Windows , because that 's the most popular operating system .
Since smartphones use a variety of different platforms , someone writing malicious software needs to pick and choose .
And while e-mail databases exist that enable phishers , spammers and others to blast their messages to huge chunks of users at once , it 's tougher to get lists of telephone numbers , much less numbers specifically for smartphone users .
" There 's a greater barrier to entry for the black hats , " Storms said .
" It 's a little bit more of a difficult platform to attack . "
Khoi Nguyen , a group product manager for security provider Symantec , said that in a world of sophisticated online technology , smartphone users are most likely to fall prey to a more basic attack -- old - fashioned theft .
He said phone users are 15 times more likely to lose that device than a laptop .
That 's a recipe for disaster when their phone is n't protected by a password , he said .
" It 's easy for someone to go in and get automatic access to their e-mail , automatic access to their mobile banking accounts , " he said .
" A lot of thieves are realizing that there 's not just value in the phone any more -- there 's value in the data . "
The makers of the world 's most popular smartphones say they 're constantly working to keep up with the latest threats .
Scott Totzke , vice - president of Blackberry 's security group , said the number and severity of mobile attacks he 's seen so far have been minimal -- but that that could easily change .
" When you look at the evolution of malware , it never gets worse -- it always gets more sophisticated and more refined , " he said .
" As an industry ... we have to really look at where those trends are going and understand that everything we saw in the last 25 years in the PC world is probably going to happen much faster in the mobile world . "
Totzke advises all smartphone users to enable a password , quickly download security updates from their phones operator system and carefully consider the source of any applications they download .
The bottom line , according to experts ?
Treat your smartphone like a computer , not a telephone .
" There 's a terrific upside to having a smart phone in your hand , but buyer beware , " Storms said .
" With that power comes an inherent risk . "

Robert Enke the goalkeeper of Hannover holds his daughter Lara after a Bundesliga match
Hundreds of supporters mourn in front of a soccer stadium in Hanover , northern Germany , early Wednesday , Nov. 11 , 2009 .
German football was in shock today after it was confirmed that national team goalkeeper Robert Enke was killed in an incident at a railway level crossing .
The 32 - year - old was struck by a regional train travelling between Norddeich and Hanover at a railway crossing in Neustadt am Rubenberge and died at the scene , police have confirmed .
Enke leaves behind his wife , Teresa , and an eight - month - old daughter who the couple had adopted in May .
The Enkes lost their own daughter Lara in 2006 when she died of a rare heart condition at the age of just two .
On the field , Enke 's career had taken him from his local side Jena into the Bundesliga with Borussia Monchengladbach before spells abroad with Benfica , Barcelona , Fenerbahce and Tenerife .
He returned to the Bundesliga , joining Hannover in 2004 and earning his first cap for Germany on March 28 , 2007 after impressing year after year for his club .
He went on to make eight appearances for Germany and was regarded as the favourite to be their number one at the World Cup in South Africa next summer , but a mysterious bacterial infection forced him out of their World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan in September .
He only recently recovered from the illness and made his return for Hannover in their Bundesliga win over Cologne on October 31 .
However , he was omitted from the Germany squad for their upcoming friendly matches against Chile on Saturday and the Ivory Coast next Wednesday .
Germany coach Joachim
Low nevertheless insisted that Enke was one of the favourites to be his number one in South Africa , saying that the decision to leave him out of his squad was " not a decision against , but rather a decision for Robert " .
His national team colleagues learned the tragic news after training in Bonn today .
" We are all shocked , " said Germany 's general manager Oliver Bierhoff .
" We are lost for words . "
The president of the German Football Association ( DFB ) Dr Theo Zwanziger added that he and the rest of the football community in Germany " are stunned and in mourning . "
" All our sympathy goes to the wife of Robert Enke and his family , " he added on the DFB 's website .
Enke 's death may force a postponement of Saturday 's game against Chile .
Fans were flocking to Hannover 's Niedersachsen Stadion tonight where they were laying flowers and lighting candles at the gates in memory of their captain who had dedicated himself to the club since joining in 2004 .
A press conference has been scheduled today at 12:30 when more light will be shed on the death of one of Germany 's most respected and talented footballers .

There is a deep and deliberate double deception at the heart of the Conservative position on Europe .
David Cameron has been refusing for months to come clean on Europe – but he 's about to be found out .
Such is the visceral anti-Europeanism in his party , ever since he became leader of the Tories he's had to keep on suggesting that he would hold a special referendum on the Lisbon treaty , even if it has been ratified and brought into force .
But now the moment is virtually upon us , with the Czech Republic set to ratify it , Mr Cameron will have to come clean .
I would bet my bottom dollar he wo n't guarantee a referendum on Lisbon .
Instead he will almost certainly unveil a heavily disguised fudge of a promise , with a guarantee that any future treaty that would cede powers away from the UK would be subject to a referendum .
It 'll be a remarkably hollow promise .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
After all , there are no plans anywhere in Europe to start drafting new European treaties .
But Mr Cameron hopes he 'll appease the Tory and UKIP right .
He hopes people will blink and not spot the sleight of hand .
I very much doubt he 'll succeed , and his fudge will melt under heated sceptic scrutiny .
But the other deception Mr Cameron wants to get away with is his constant use of deliberately vague hints that sound tough but guarantee nothing .
So he suggests they would renegotiate the treaty , but he must know this is impossible .
Any treaty negotiation requires the unanimous agreement of all 27 governments – and every other government in Europe is absolutely clear they do not want another round of treaty talks .
Indeed the one thing that unites every government and every political party in Europe ( apart from the Tories ) is that they do not want any more treaty negotiations and will do all in their power to block them .
Quite rightly they want to get on with the real issues that matter to European citizens – jobs , industry , competition with China and India , and tackling international crime .
A
Tory government determined to secure yet another new treaty would have to spend vast amounts of political capital needlessly trying to force the 26 other countries into doing a special new deal .
What would they offer France , Spain , Germany , Poland and Italy ?
There is an additional irony .
Under the Lisbon treaty it is even more difficult to renegotiate the European treaties .
The European Parliament now has a blocking power and can insist on a full - blown treaty convention , which would take years to complete .
Since Mr Cameron has walked away from the mainstream in the European Parliament by abandoning the EPP grouping , he has next to no friends who would vote his way .
So a renegotiation is a virtual impossibility and threatening it would simply set up a fruitless war with Europe that would be doomed to failure .
Mr Cameron also coyly intimates he would " repatriate powers to the UK " , with a nod towards the social chapter .
Again he flatters to deceive .
Quite simply , the social chapter does n't exist any more ; elements like the right to paid leave and maternity pay are embedded parts of the single market now , scattered across several treaty clauses .
Any attempt to opt out of these provisions would rightly be seen by Paris and Berlin as an attempt to dismantle the common market and undermine the union .
Leave aside the fact that I believe these measures are an important part of being a fair and competitive economy , the uncomfortable truth for Mr Cameron is that if he tried unilaterally to opt out , the European Court of Justice would immediately decide that the UK was in contravention of its treaty obligations .
Mr Cameron would have set us on the path towards Britain leaving the EU , or being thrown out .
Already Tory isolation is damaging British influence .
The Tories have abandoned the European People 's Party group – the largest group in the European Parliament – and set up their own hand - picked group .
The trouble is threefold .
First , British businesses now have no direct access to the largest group in the Parliament .
Second , the Conservatives are in a group of right - wing extremists with very dubious pasts , a matter which has already brought British conservatism into disrepute .
And third , because a grouping has to have MEPs from seven countries and four of the countries represented in Mr Cameron 's new group are solo figures from their country , the group would collapse if any one of them chose to leave .
So Mr Cameron is completely in hock to the whimsy of four MEPs .
It is easy to point to the failings of the EU , but pursuing the British interest does not mean macho posturing .
Our membership of the union is vital to our economic future .
The single market has given British people the freedom to trade and work in the largest market in the world .
That has meant three million extra jobs and annual exports of £ 370bn .
Half the UK's inward investment comes from the EU , rising from £ 16bn to £ 106.5 bn .
British businesses do n't want their futures put in peril by a reckless Tory policy of European wrangling .
The head of the British Chambers of Commerce has said that Mr Cameron 's policy " could do significant damage to British business interests " .
This is a warning that should not go unheeded .
We also have to ensure that the EU plays a far more effective role on the world stage .
There are many global issues where a united EU voice added to ours will deliver real benefits to the UK .
Last week the debate was about climate change , but I would add the Middle East peace process , Afghanistan and Pakistan , Russia and relations with the growing giants of India , China and Brazil .
But all of that requires a European Union that has actively decided not to spend its every waking hour arguing about the internal architecture of the treaties , but deliberately focusing on enhancing the prosperity and security of its citizens .
In the end , that 's the greatest Tory deception – to suggest that another bout of treaty negotiations would serve Britain or Europe well .
The choice for Britain , and for Europe , is simple .
Help the EU , with Britain at its heart , be a real leader on the world stage ; or become spectators in a G2 world shaped by the US and China .

Crystals that can confine both light and vibrations could create better biosensors .
The crystal traps vibrations and light in the same place .
Eichenfield M. , et al .
Light and mechanical vibrations have been imprisoned together for the first time ever in the same place .
An artificial crystal that traps both could lead to ultra- sensitive biosensors , create an interface for devices on a chip and provide an elegant cooling mechanism to help test quantum limits .
The communications industry has long used specially patterned materials , called photonic crystals , to guide light through optical fibres .
Similar structures , known as phononic crystals , manipulate mechanical vibrations and are used , for instance , in mobile phones to filter out unwanted frequencies .
Now Oskar Painter at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and his colleagues have created an ' optomechanical ' crystal that combines these qualities to control , guide and trap light and mechanical vibrations together .
Although photonic and phononic crystals have different uses , their physical make - up is almost identical , says Painter .
" If you make one type of crystal , you almost automatically make the other type , " he says .
This has not been exploited earlier , he says , because the vibrations set up in crystals of the size commonly used in the optics industry are extremely small and difficult to detect .
The team fashioned their crystal from a 10 - micrometre long strip of silicon , etching out rectangular sections of the strip at regular intervals to create what looks like a mini railway track .
Computer simulations showed that light waves passing along the track should be partially reflected at each track boundary .
Although most wavelengths would still eventually pass across , interference between forward and reflected light with wavelengths that are multiples of the distance between the rails should ' lock ' that light at the centre of the track , says Painter .
At the same time , mechanical vibrations with the same wavelength should also become trapped , making the central rails of the track oscillate back and forth .
Bounce back
Painter 's team tested that this was the case by firing laser light of various frequencies across their crystal .
In most cases , all the laser light was transmitted to the other side .
But at certain resonant frequencies , they saw a dip in transmission , indicating that some of the light had become trapped .
To find out where it had collected , they poked their silicon - railway track with a glass - tipped probe and saw light scatter out from the track 's centre .
To check that the centre of the track was also vibrating , they examined how the transmission of light varied for a small range of laser frequencies below the resonance .
" The transmission intensity oscillated up and down because the vibrations of the crystal were affecting the transmission of light , " says Painter .
Optical physicist Marko Lončar at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in Cambridge , Massachusetts , says that the results are " surprising and impressive " .
" It 's not an easy experiment , " he says .
" Intuitively , I would n't have expected those [ crystals ] to shake so strongly that the vibrations could be picked up . "
The fact that the team has built its optomechanical crystal from silicon has implications for the computing industry .
" For the first time we can start talking about optomechanical circuits , " says Florian Marquardt an expert on optomechanics at the Ludwig - Maximilians University of Munich , Germany .
" I can envisage chips that integrate these crystals . "
Quantum bridge
Painter thinks that one of the crystal 's main future uses will be to bridge together different types of quantum - computing processors on chips .
" Right now , quantum - computing systems have many niches — some are based on atoms , some on photons , some on superconductors — but these experiments can't be put together because they need to be connected by light of very different frequencies , " he says .
Optomechanical crystals provide a way to dump quantum information carried by light from one type of quantum processor into vibrations , which can then be translated back into light of a different frequency to be sent to another processor , explains Painter .
" I think these crystals will be ideal interfaces in quantum hybrid systems , " says Painter .

The fact that light at frequencies just off resonance is so sensitive to the crystal 's vibrations could also be used in highly sensitive biosensors that can detect DNA sequences or dangerous pathogens .
Adrian Ionescu , an expert on mass sensors at the Swiss Federal Institute in Lausanne ( EPFL ) , Switzerland , thinks that the crystals could be used to help develop arrays to detect single gas molecules in real time , beyond the limits of any existing gas sensor devices .
" This is an exciting field of research with high potential for innovative applications in sensing , " he says .
Painter also hopes to use the technology for a slightly more esoteric purpose — exploring the limits of the quantum world .
There has been a lot of interest in whether quantum effects can survive in relatively large mechanical systems , made of a few billion atoms .
But these delicate quantum features are usually obscured by jitters caused by heat noise .
The light - matter interactions within optomechanical crystals could help get round the problem , by providing an elegant cooling system .
" Light can suck the thermal energy out of a mechanical system , taking that energy into the light field , " says Painter .
" It would really be great to use this to see if we can then see quantum effects in a real physical mass with a size that we can relate to . "
Status Quo have topped the list for the second year running
Status Quo are the hardest - working band in British music , according to a list compiled by the Performing Rights Society ( PRS ) .
The rockers performed to more than 250,000 fans at 27 arenas in 2009 - more than any other band .
" Performing in front of thousands of fans is the ultimate experience for any band , " said frontman Francis Rossi .
Fellow music industry veterans Cliff Richard and the Shadows were in second place with Take That in third .
Coldplay and Kings of Leon made up the rest of the top five .
Status Quo have built up an army of fans in a career spanning five decades .
The band , whose hits include Rockin ' All Over The World and Whatever You Want , have spent 415 weeks in the UK singles chart and sold more than 118 million recordings worldwide .
PRS is the organisation which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters .
Chairman Ellis Rich said : " Being an ardent supporter of live music , whether it is in the smallest pub or the largest arena , I 'm delighted to see Status Quo , giants of live performance , topping this chart for the second year running . "
Singer and guitarist Joe Brown was the busiest performer at smaller concert venues in 2009 , followed by Manchester band Twisted Wheel and last year 's X Factor runners - up JLS .
Why do atheist activists focus so much time and energy on what we do n't believe ?
What 's the point of a worldview and a social / political movement that 's all about not believing in something ?
Ca n't we be open to possibilities ?
Why do we have to be so negative all the time ?
I 've been , as is my wont of late , debating religion on Facebook .
( By the way , if you 're on Facebook , friend me ! )
In one of these recent debates , I was exhorted by a believer to " be a little more open to the universe " ( an exhortation I 've heard many times now , from many different believers ) .
In another , I was told that " a belief system based on what is n't seems reductive , " by someone who added that , " When I turn my mind toward the things I do n't believe in , my world gets smaller . "
So today , I want to talk about some of the positive things that , as an atheist and a humanist , a materialist and a rationalist , I do care about and believe in .
I want to talk about what being " open to the universe " means to me .
And I want to talk about why the things I do n't believe in -- namely , God or any kind of supernatural / immaterial / spiritual entities or forces -- are a crucial part of what I do believe , and a crucial part of how I practice being open to the universe .
***
My belief system is not , in fact , based on " what is n't . "
And neither is that of any atheist I know .
My conclusions about " what is n't " are only part of my belief system , and not necessarily all that big a part .
I have a positive worldview , a set of priorities and values that shape how I live .
I could gas on about the positive things I believe in for hours , days , years , and still not be done .
But here 's the short version of the part that 's relevant to this discussion :
I believe in reality .
I believe that reality is far more important , and far more interesting , than anything we could make up about it .
Pretty much by definition .
And I believe that trying to understand reality , to the best of our abilities , is one of the most important , most interesting , most deeply valuable , most richly satisfying things we can do -- individually , and as a species .
The real universe , the universe as we currently understand it , is magnificent , and awe - inspiring , and far weirder than anything we would have made up about it .
Solid matter that 's mostly empty space ?
Black holes at the center of every spiral galaxy ?
Billions of galaxies all flying away from one another at breakneck speed ?
Space that bends ?
Continents that drift ?
Life forms that are all cousins to one another ?
Consciousness that somehow arises from brain chemistry ?
That rocks my world .
And we 've found all this stuff out , not by giving up on trying to understand it , not by saying , " It 's a mystery and we 'll never fully understand it , " but by saying , " We may never fully understand it -- but let 's try .
Let 's understand it to the best of our abilities . "
We 've found all this stuff out by being willing to let go of beliefs and preconceptions and opinions we were attached to -- and being willing to reject all ideas except the ones supported by the rigorous gathering and testing and cross-checking of evidence .
( A very humbling process , I might add . )
But here 's the thing .
The negative part of that process ?
It 's absolutely crucial .
We can't say , " Yes , the earth orbits the sun , " without saying , " No , the sun does not orbit the earth . "
We can't say , " Yes , the universe is expanding and will continue to expand , " without saying , " No , the universe is not in a steady state . "
We can't say " Yes , all life on earth evolved by descent with modification from a common ancestor , " without saying , " No , life forms were not created fully formed all at once , more or less as they exist today . "
We can't say , " This what almost certainly is true about the universe , " without saying , " That is what almost certainly is not true . "
There is an impossibly huge infinitude of things that we could imagine about the universe .
Only the tiniest fraction of those things are actually true .
If we 're going to be truly open to the mind - altering magnificence and hilarious freakiness of the universe , if we 're going to truly understand and accept and explore what is true about the universe to the best of our ability , we have to be willing to say " No " to the overwhelming majority of things we can imagine about it .
We have to be rigorous in sorting out reality from unreality ... and relentless in our rejection of unreality .
Which leads me to this business of being open to the universe .
And which leads me to this :
It was being open to the universe that convinced me there was no God , and no supernatural world .
It was being open to the universe that convinced me to let go of my spiritual beliefs , on the grounds that they just were n't internally consistent , or consistent with the evidence , or in any way plausible .
It was being open to the universe -- i.e. , paying careful attention to what the universe , through evidence , was saying about itself -- that led me to let go of what the inside of my head , based on confirmation bias and wishful thinking , believed about it .
It was being open to the universe that led me to the conclusion that the universe is almost certainly an entirely physical entity , and that God and the supernatural have no part in it .
That was an extremely difficult thing to do .
I was very emotionally attached to my religious beliefs .
In particular , I was deeply attached to my belief in an immaterial soul that survives death .
I do n't like death any more than anyone else does , and accepting the finality of death -- mine , and that of the people I love -- was among the hardest things I 've had to do .
But reality wins .
The universe wins .
The carefully gathered , rigorously tested , relentlessly cross-checked evidence about the universe wins out over my biased , demonstrably flawed , wishful - thinking - based intuitions and opinions about it .
The most reasonable evidence - based conclusion about what 's probably true wins out over my hypothetically possible but entirely unsupported and thoroughly implausible belief about what might be true .
Being open to the universe does n't just mean being open to possibilities about what might be true .
It means being open to possibilities about what might not be true .
It means being willing to say " No " to most of the stories about the universe that we can imagine -- even the stories we 're most attached to -- if it turns out that those stories are n't likely or plausible .
Let me be very clear : I have absolutely no problem with making up stories about imaginary realities .
I love stories about imaginary realities .
They can help us frame our experience and give it meaning ; they can give us fresh perspectives on the world , and even help us see new things about it .
Stories and imagination are essential parts of what make us human .
And besides , they 're just fun .
But if we care about reality , we need to not deceive ourselves into believing that our stories are true .
We need to be very careful about distinguishing between our useful metaphors about the world , and our accurate descriptions of it .
We need to be very careful about distinguishing between the stories we make up in our own heads about the universe ... and what the universe , through evidence , is saying about itself .
Our world does not get bigger when we place our subjective experience of the world over the world itself .
Our world does not get bigger when we treat every possibility that we can imagine as equally likely ... and then choose between them based on which ones we find most attractive .
Our world does not get bigger when we hang onto beliefs about reality that are almost certainly not true , clinging to the gossamer - thin thread that " it might be true , you can't absolutely prove that it is n't . "
Our world does not get bigger when we treat the space inside our head as more important than the space outside of it .
Our world gets bigger when we let the world in .
Our world gets bigger when we let the world itself take priority over whatever ideas we might have about it .
Reality is bigger than we are .
Our world gets bigger when we let that reality be what it is ... and when we pay careful attention to what it is , the most careful attention we possibly can .
And that 's why I care about what is n't .
That 's why I spend so much time and energy thinking and writing about what I do n't believe .
Yes , I do often focus on " what is n't " in my writings .
I do this , in large part , because the beliefs in entities that almost certainly do n't exist ( a ) are very widespread , ( b ) have a real effect on the choices people make , and ( c ) on the whole do , IMO , more harm than good .
But I also do it because caring about " what is n't " is a central and crucial part of caring about " what is . "
I do it because , when we fill our brains with stories about what almost certainly is n't true or even plausible -- and convince ourselves that these stories are true or plausible , and hotly defend the stories against the evidence opposing them -- we are armoring ourselves against reality .
We are practicing the mental gymnastics that help us ignore or deny reality .
And reality is what I believe in .
Underpinning resurging concerns about carbon trading is the world 's crisis of faith in capitalism itself .
Markets have proved to be more capricious and uncontrollable than anyone imagined possible in the last year .
Where does that leave the theory behind an artificial trading system set up to pursue a single , ethical goal ?
The economic concept is simple , but the practice itself has been fraught with complications .
In Europe , since 2005 , policymakers distribute permits to emit carbon to utility companies and heavy industrial polluters – at first for free .
It is amazing how easy it is to sail through a Computer Science degree from a top university without ever learning the basic tools of software developers , without ever working on a team , and without ever taking a course for which you do n’t get an automatic F for collaborating .
Many CS departments are trapped in the 1980s , teaching the same old curriculum that has by now become completely divorced from the reality of modern software development .
Where are students supposed to learn about version control , bug tracking , working on teams , scheduling , estimating , debugging , usability testing , and documentation ?
Where do they learn to write a program longer than 20 lines ?
Many universities have managed to convince themselves that the more irrelevant the curriculum is to the real world , the more elite they are .
It ’s the liberal arts way .
Leave it to the technical vocational institutes , the red - brick universities , and the lesser schools endowed with many compass points ( “ University of Northern Southwest Florida ” ) to actually produce programmers .
The Ivy Leagues of the world want to teach linear algebra and theories of computation and Haskell programming , and all the striver CS departments trying to raise their standards are doing so by eliminating anything practical from the curriculum in favor of more theory .
Now , do n’t get me wrong , this is n’t necessarily a bad thing .
At least they ’re replacing Java with Scheme , if only because “ that ’s what MIT does . ”
( Too late ! )
And they are teaching students to think a certain way .
And given how much the average CS professor knows about real - world software engineering , I think I ’d rather have kids learn that stuff at an internship at Fog Creek .
Greg Wilson , an assistant professor at the University of Toronto , gave a talk at the StackOverflow DevDay conference in Toronto , which was entertaining , informative , and generally just a huge hit .
We got to talking , and he told me about his latest brainchild , UCOSP , which stands for “ All The Good Names Are Taken . ”
It ’s a consortium of 15 universities , mostly in Canada , which are organizing joint senior - year capstone projects .
They ’re setting up teams of a half - dozen undergraduates from assorted universities to collaborate on contributing to an open source project , for credit and for a grade .
As soon as I heard about the program I volunteered to sponsor a team to make a contribution to Mercurial .
Sponsoring a team consists of offering to pay for a trip to Toronto for all the undergrads to get organized , and providing a programmer to mentor the team .
Browsing around the UCOSP blog , I was reminded of why student projects , while laudatory , frequently fail to deliver anything useful .
“ One of the points of this course is to give you a chance to find out what it ’s like to set and then meet your own goals , ” Greg wrote .
“ The net result is pretty clear at this point : in many cases , students are doing less per week on this course than they would on a more structured course that had exactly the same content . ”
College students in their final year have about 16 years of experience doing short projects and leaving everything until the last minute .
Until you ’re a senior in college , you ’re very unlikely to have ever encountered an assignment that ca n’t be done by staying up all night .
The typical CS assignment expects students to write the “ interesting ” part of the code ( in the academic sense of the word ) .
The other 90 % of the work that it takes to bring code up to the level of “ useful , real - world code ” is never expected from undergrads , because it ’s not “ interesting ” to fix bugs and deal with real - world conditions , and because most CS faculty have never worked in the real world and have almost no idea what it takes to create software that can survive an encounter with users .
Time management is usually to blame .
In a group of four students , even if one or two of the students are enterprising enough to try to start early in the term , the other students are likely to drag their heels , because they have more urgent projects from other classes that are due tomorrow .
The enterprising student (s ) will then have to choose between starting first and doing more than their fair share of the work , or waiting with everyone else until the night before , and guess which wins .
Students have exactly zero experience with long term , team - based schedules .
Therefore , they almost always do crappy work when given a term - length project and told to manage their time themselves .
If anything productive is to come out of these kinds of projects , you have to have weekly deadlines , and you have to recognize that ALL the work for the project will be done the night before the weekly deadline .
It appears to be a permanent part of the human condition that long term deadlines without short term milestones are rarely met .
This might be a neat opportunity to use Scrum .
Once a week , the team gets together , in person or virtually , and reviews the previous week ’s work .
Then they decide which features and tasks to do over the next week .
FogBugz would work great for tracking this : if you ’re doing a capstone project and need access to FogBugz , please let us know and we ’ll be happy to set you up for free .
We can also set you up with beta access to kiln , our hosted version of Mercurial , which includes a code review feature .
I ’ve been blaming students , here , for lacking the discipline to do term - length projects throughout the term , instead of procrastinating , but of course , the problem is endemic among non-students as well .
It ’s taken me a while , but I finally learned that long - term deadlines ( or no deadlines at all ) just do n’t work with professional programmers , either : you need a schedule of regular , frequent deliverables to be productive over the long term .
The only reason the real world gets this right where all - student college teams fail is because in the real world there are managers , who can set deadlines , which a team of students who are all peers ca n’t pull off .

Mariam Staford Bandaba is too scared to return to her home village
One year ago , Mariam Staford Bandaba , an albino woman living in Tanzania , was viciously attacked by a machete - wielding gang who tried to kill her and sell her remains for witchcraft .
She escaped with her life , but only just .
The attackers chopped off one of her hands - the other had to be amputated in hospital , where she spent weeks recovering from her horrific injuries .
Traumatised , Ms Staford Bandaba then took the brave step of identifying her attackers .
She was taken to a safe - house where she lived under government protection .
But the government recently decided she could no longer live there , leaving the 28 - year - old fearing for her safety .
The administrative officer in the village where she was re-housed , Erasmus Rugarabamu , told the BBC Swahili service that the situation had improved and no albinos had been killed in her home village in the north - western Kagera region in the past year .
The decision by the authorities comes just a few weeks after a court sentenced three men to death for the murder of an albino boy .
Albino murders
Ms Staford Bandaba is one of thousands of people with albinism who live in fear in Tanzania .
Her harrowing tale has become commonplace in a country where 53 albinos are believed to have been murdered in the past two years .
Albinos , who are pale because of a lack of pigment in their skin , have been routinely killed because witchdoctors say that potions made with their body parts will bring good fortune in love , life and business to those who use them .
The killings have also spread to neighbouring Burundi where at least 12 people have been murdered .
The victims were mutilated and their body parts are believed to have been sold in Tanzania to make potions .
One man was sentenced to death and eight others were jailed in Burundi earlier this year .
Ms Staford Bandaba 's alleged attackers have been caught in north - western Tanzania , the region where the vast majority of the murders have been carried out .
Tears
The story of her eviction caught the attention of a businessman who has agreed to let her and her mother live in a room in his house for a year .
But after that she has no idea what will happen to her .
Before moving out of the safe house , she told me that she broke down in tears when the district commissioner told her the news .
" I can't imagine what will happen .
What I did in front of him was just start crying . "
I was born an albino , but my attackers have made me disabled
Mariam
She is even more upset because it is not just her who had to leave .
Her father and four siblings who were taking care of her and feeding her were also evicted .
They have had no choice but to return to the village where she was so brutally attacked .
Her father , Staford Bandaba , admitted he was very anxious about reprisal attacks being carried out on his family .
" Those who are responsible , all their relatives are still living there in the village , and those released from prison , are still living where we were living .
So how can we stay there ? "
But Mr Rugarabamu defended the government 's decision .
" Some of the attackers were found not guilty , so we can't keep them in prison , so they will be allowed to return to the village according to the law .
But those found guilty are still in prison awaiting their fate . "
That is little comfort for Ms Staford Bandaba 's father .
Now that she no longer has government protection , " We are worried that they will finish her off . "
And he is not the only one who thinks that could happen .
Condemnation " Albinos are still being hunted and we do n't yet know how to solve the problem , " one local resident says .
" We cannot understand this decision . "
" The government only seems to be doing half its duty .
They started well and they should continue to help Mariam get a permanent house which will be safe , " another person tells me .
Tanzania 's president has introduced measures to protect albinos President Jakaya Kikwete has said the albino murders have brought shame to Tanzania and his government has taken steps to identify and prosecute the perpetrators .
In March thousands of people took part in an exercise to identify those they suspected of being involved , by filling in forms anonymously .
The authorities have also issued a ban on all traditional healers , and several people have been arrested .
The government has now given Ms Staford Bandaba a plot of land to build a house away from her village .
But she says she has no money for the construction work , leaving her feeling abandoned at a time when she needs the help most .
" I was born an albino , " she says .
" But my attackers have made me disabled .
I am begging all Tanzanians to kindly keep on helping me , because my situation is now worse .
I have no hands . "
Fortunately , a local businessman has heard her plea .
But in a year 's time , Ms Staford Bandaba will once again be faced with the prospect of having to return to the village where she was nearly killed .

It will not quite have the significance of Nixon in China – I can't see an opera about it – but President Obama 's visit there does have huge significance .
In 1972 , when President Nixon went there , it was the leader of the world 's largest economy opening up the relationship with the leaders of the world 's most populous country .
Now it is the leader of the world 's largest economy meeting the leaders of the second largest economy , for China is currently passing Japan in the economic league table to take the number two spot .
If , in another 37 years ' time , the president of the US visits China , it will be the leader of the world 's second largest economy visiting the world 's largest one .
That is the context that overshadows this meeting : the stark fact that over the next generation the baton of economic leadership is being passed from one giant to another .
It is as important as the shift of power that took place from Europe to the US in the last century .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
All the debate in Beijing about trading relationships , climate change , human rights , intellectual property and so on – the whole caboodle – has to be seen in this context .
For the time being the Chinese economy remains much smaller than that of the US .
But soon it wo n't be .
China knows that , and more thoughtful people in the West know it too .
But in the US , and also Europe , we have hardly begun to think through the consequences of this shift of power : not just what it will mean for geopolitics or economics but also what it will for our whole western societies .
It is such a breathtaking transition that the reaction of many people will be one of denial ; that it can't happen .
So perhaps the first question to be tackled is whether China 's advance really is durable or whether there will be some bump that will deflect its course .
The most helpful framework for looking at the progress of the Chinese economy is the work of the investment bank Goldman Sachs .
For the past eight years it has been modelling the growth of the main emerging economies and contrasting it with the performance of the main developed ones .
It coined the clever acronym of the " BRICs " , to describe the four largest emerging economies , Brazil , Russia , India and China .
As it has turned out , China has actually been growing even faster than early versions of the model predicted , with the result that it has been passing the big Western economies even earlier than expected .
The latest projections suggest that China will pass the US in 2027 ; the earlier versions suggested some time in the 2040s .
A long - term proposition has become a possibility within 20 years .
Economic models are only economic models and we have had enough experience of economists getting things wrong in the past couple of years to take all growth projections with a certain scepticism .
Remember too the way , a generation ago , many people thought the Japanese economy would come to dominate the world .
Nevertheless the BRIC model has been a good intellectual anchor and it would be silly not to take its projections extremely seriously .
My own view is that it is the best place to start from when thinking about the rise , not just of China , but of India and the rest of the developing world .
If you want to list the possible blocks to growth that China faces , you can bang on quite a while .
They include a squeeze on energy and raw material supplies ; environmental challenges , particularly over water ; the ageing of the population and eventually the shrinking of the workforce ; the dependence on foreign export markets including the US ; the need to import technologies ; and of course all the questions about the viability of an authoritarian political system continuing to coexist with an increasingly liberal economic one .
My feeling is that you have to acknowledge that the challenges are enormous and that any linear projections of anything should be distrusted .
Nevertheless , you have to postulate some almost unthinkable catastrophe to believe that the country 's progress will be completely blocked .
Growth will inevitably slow from its heady 10 per cent a year or more as the population ages , but the Goldman model takes this into account .
We should surely accept its advance as probable and indeed desirable .
Growth may not be quite as fast as Goldman suggests , though it may actually turn out to be even faster , but the broad direction is pretty much set .
If that is right , China 's advance will go far beyond the economic sphere .
There are already some obvious political consequences , such as its role in shaping economic development in Africa .
Chinese investment there is putting in far more infrastructure than all Western aid put together .
But the thing that is perhaps hardest to get our head round is the extent to which Chinese ideas about society will start to influence our own .
We have in the West an inbuilt presumption that the way we organise our societies is , if not optimal , at least a rough model for the rest of the world .
But that is in some measure an authority based on economic power .
Our self - confidence in the values of our economic system was much increased by the collapse of the alternative version developed in the Soviet Union and the conversion of China towards some sort of market economy .
But if we experience stagnation and China experiences growth then we will inevitably do some rethinking about the way we run things .
That re-thinking will surely spread beyond narrow economics .
I am not saying that Mr Obama 's successors will have to listen patiently to criticism from Chinese leaders about America 's approach to human rights .
What I am saying is that as we move to a more balanced world in the sphere of economics we will move in parallel to a more balanced world in the spheres of politics and society .
The more that mainland China moves towards the Hong Kong model – Hong Kong , for example , is ranked at the top of the economic freedom league tables – the more we may feel we need to learn .
We should surely welcome that .
We in the West have been too arrogant for too long .
We do n't have to buy every aspect of the Chinese model , or the Indian model , or the many other emerging economies models , to respect them and seek to learn from them .

Inset is a Spire camera map of VY Canis Majoris
The death throes of one of the biggest stars known to science have been spied by Europe 's Herschel space telescope .
The observatory , launched in May , has subjected VY Canis Majoris , to a detailed spectroscopic analysis .
It has allowed Herschel to identify the different types of molecules and atoms that swirl away from the star which is 20 - 25 times the mass of our Sun.
VY Canis Majoris is some 4,500 light - years from Earth and it could be seen to explode as a supernova at any time .
It is colossal .
If VY Canis Majoris were sited at the centre of our Solar System , its surface would extend out towards the orbit of Saturn .
The star , in the constellation Canis Major , has been recorded by astronomers for at least 200 years .
It is what is called a red hypergiant - a highly evolved object that is exhausting its nuclear fuel .
HERSCHEL SPACE TELESCOPE
The observatory is tuned to see the Universe in the far - infrared Its 3.5 m diameter mirror is the largest ever flown in space Herschel can probe clouds of gas and dust to see stars being born
It will investigate how galaxies have evolved through time
The mission will end when its helium refrigerant boils off Perhaps once 30 - 40 times as massive as our Sun , the end days of VY Canis Majoris see it spew vast quantities of gas and dust into interstellar space , including elements such as carbon , oxygen and nitrogen - the raw materials that will go into the production of future planets , and , who knows , perhaps life elsewhere in the galaxy .
Herschel has trained the spectrometers in its Pacs and Spire instruments on the extensive cloud of material billowing away from the object .
Spectrometers capture and split light into its constituent wavelengths , creating a kind of " fingerprint " that will reveal information on the chemistry of a light source .
Pacs and Spire , for instance , detect copious amounts of carbon monoxide ( CO ) and water ( H2O ) in the vicinity of VY Canis Majoris .
" One of the most common molecules you see in this type of observation is carbon monoxide , " explained Professor Matt Griffin , the Spire principal investigator from Cardiff University , UK .
" That 's because carbon and oxygen are two of the most common materials produced in stars and they like to get together , so interstellar space is full of carbon monoxide .
From our CO lines we can measure the temperature of the gas and by comparing them with other lines we can also measure density and optical depth and all kinds of other parameters .
" The other lines we 're seeing in abundance in both Pacs and Spire spectra are water .
Water is very important astrophysically because it is a diagnostic - it tells us a lot about the physical and chemical processes going on in a gas .
The Spire camera shows the star at the edge of a huge cloud of gas and dust " And of course water can not be seen from the Earth because there is so much of it in the atmosphere , its signal gets swamped ; and that 's why we have to go into space to do these kinds of observations . "
Herschel studies like this should help to establish a detailed picture of the mass loss from stars and the complex chemistry occurring in their extended envelopes .
Scientists have models to describe what they think happens in stars like VY Canis Majoris and Herschel will give them some " ground truth " to constrain their ideas .
The European Space Agency 's billion - euro Herschel observatory was sent into orbit on 14 May on an Ariane rocket .
It has been positioned far from Earth to give it an unobstructed view of deep space .
The observatory works at longer wavelengths - in the far - infrared and sub-millimetre range ( 55 to 672 microns ) .
This means it can pick up details that are beyond the vision of other telescopes which operate in different parts of the electro - magnetic spectrum , such as Hubble which is tuned to see visible light and the near - infrared .
Herschel is demonstrating it has sensitivity and resolution beyond anything previously sent into space to work in its particular wavelengths .
Hifi experienced a damaging voltage peak in August Moreover , there are some parts of the electro - magnetic spectrum that Herschel will show scientists for the very first time .
The mission is now entering routine operations after completing commissioning and demonstration phases .
However , its third instrument is currently down after experiencing a fault .
Engineers are expected to upload the software next month needed to reactivate the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared ( HiFi ) .
The Dutch - led HiFi spectrometer has even better resolution than the Pacs and Spire instruments .
A glimpse of its capability is demonstrated in a spectrograph of a comet released on Friday but taken before the shutdown .
The data on Comet Garradd shows up a strong water signal as is expected from an object composed of ice and dust .
Comets will be a key target for HiFi .
It will be used to pick out the various chemical elements and molecules - some quite complex - that boil off these objects as they sweep in towards the Sun from the outer Solar System and heat up .
Some of the first science results from Herschel observations are expected in the coming weeks .
" Everything we have done so far , we 've done extremely well , " said Dr Göran Pilbratt , Herschel 's project scientist .
" We have not been able to do everything we wanted because of HiFi , of course ; but what we have released today and put on the [ Esa website ] for instance , you can judge for yourself .
I think it is very impressive . "

Pressure is mounting on the Government to ease the tax regime governing North Sea oil and gas in next month 's pre-Budget report .
Critics claim that the Government 's talk of a need for a successful British industry to end the dependence on financial services and the City is undermined by the reality of a world - leading hydrocarbons industry that is being taxed into premature decline .
The common perception is that the North Sea is finished .
But while some 40 billion barrels of oil and gas have been produced from the North Sea so far , there is another estimated 25 billion still to come .
That 's the good news , both for the UK 's increasingly uncertain energy security and for the economy .
The bad news is that North Sea oil is by far the most highly taxed part of the economy with its own special rate of 50 per cent , rising to 75 per cent on production from older fields .
The regime was created when the North Sea was still gushing with oil , and is in danger of choking the technically difficult – and more expensive – exploration and drilling required to make the most of what is left .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Industry representatives hope to meet Lord Davies , a minister in the Department for Business , in the coming weeks to discuss their concerns .
But given the response from Lord Hunt , a minister at the Department of Energy , in recent talks , confidence is not high .
" The North Sea is the UK 's unsung industrial hero , " says John Gallagher , vice president of Shell 's European upstream business .
" This is about both maximising the UK continental shelf ( UKCS ) and keeping the world - leading industry even after that is over .
The Government has not fully grasped the importance of what we 've got at the moment , and what potentially might be lost . "
There are major economic implications .
Of the 25 billion barrels that are left , 10 billion are accounted for in commercial production plans .
But the rest are not .
If the last , hard - to - reach resources are too expensive to pursue , the difference to the UK economy – at an oil price of $ 70 – would be more than £ 1 trillion .
The woeful state of the public finances will no doubt make it harder for the Government to rein back on a regime that produces an annual £ 20 bn in taxes .
" They might just want to squeeze harder but that would be to the detriment of the longer term benefit of the asset , " Mr Gallagher warns .
" The Government needs to be careful how they nurture a national asset into middle age . "
It is not just a question of the valuable reservoirs of oil and gas .
It is also about the industry itself .
Trickle - down spending amounts to £ 12bn per year and there are 450,000 people who work in the sector .
And as global hydrocarbon reserves run down , and companies take on greater technical challenges , UK expertise is becoming a valuable export commodity .
Export levels are rising at a rate of 10 per cent a year , hitting £ 5 bn in 2008 .
The UKCS pioneered a range of offshore technologies when the industry began in the 1970s , and continues to lead the world in a number of areas .
One UK strong suit is sub-sea drilling , for example .
The technology involved in offshore oil and gas production is awesome at the best of times .
Sub -sea drilling is mindblowing .
Rigs may stand in hundreds of metres of harsh sea conditions , before drilling hundreds of metres more into the rock below , dealing with the temperatures and pressures within the earth , as well as the immense complication of the sea .
Sub -sea is the same drilling process , but from a boat , ending with only a pipe leading back to a nearby oil rig as a hub .
The difference in cost of a so - called " sub- sea tie - back " and a whole new rig is phenomenal .
In a world where oil resources are depleting and demand is pushing companies to exploit larger numbers of smaller reservoirs , sub - sea tie - backs are a good place to be .
And Aberdeen leads the world .

But the North Sea oil and gas sector is already showing signs of strain .
Capital expenditure is falling – from £ 5.6bn in 2006 , to £ 4.8bn in 2008 , and trade group Oil & Gas UK estimates it could fall as low as £ 4bn this year .
Drilling operations have declined by more than half in the last year , with only 15 exploration wells drilled in the three months to June , compared with a 50 per cent increase just over the border into the less heavily - taxed Norwegian North Sea .
" In this country , once we get an industry , we are not very good at holding on to it , " Mr Gallagher complains .
" The leading spending industry in the UK is being forgotten about . "
The Government has not been completely deaf .
April 's Budget included slightly more favourable treatment of new field developments .
But the industry says the amounts are not enough to make a difference .
And though Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , told the Labour Party conference that the future is " less financial engineering and a lot more real engineering " , there is rarely any mention of the North Sea .
Malcolm Webb , chief executive of trade group OGUK , says : " Lord Mandelson says the UK needs to build on its industrial strength , and the North Sea is a huge one .
" We need to be clearly open for business in oil and gas in the UK and we need support from the Government in that message . "
All at sea : Life on the rig
* It is hard to imagine the scale of an offshore rig .
Some 100 km out into the North Sea off Aberdeen , Shearwater 's nine decks tower 20 metres above the 150 metre - deep , dark turquoise water .
It is home to 92 people , who work a 12 - hour shift pattern , with two weeks on the rig , then two weeks off , another two weeks on , then a month off .
" You have to be a special type of person to work on a platform , " says Dave Blackburn , Shell 's operations manager for three North Sea rigs .
" But there is the most incredible atmosphere and teamwork . "
The culture has changed out of all proportion in recent years .
Since the Piper Alpha disaster that claimed 167 lives in 1988 , the macho ethos has been replaced by an overwhelmingly safety - conscious approach .
The advent of new technology in the form of commodity TV sets and the internet has also changed life on the rig .
Stuart Sibbald , the medic on Shearwater , says : " Twenty years ago when there were no TVs or computers , there was a film every night and more communication between people .
New technology means better communication with the rest of the world , but the people here communicate less . "
Thank you for the music – or rather thank you for paying for the music – to misquote Abba .
Record labels are pointing to the dramatic rise in music sales in Sweden , just months after the country introduced anti-piracy laws , as evidence of what a similar crackdown in Britain could do to the flagging market .
Figures from the record labels association IFPI Sweden show revenues rose 18 % in the first nine months of this year , a significant reversal from seven consecutive years of decline .
Much of the rise came after April 's implementation of an anti-piracy law and a ruling against the operators of The Pirate Bay , the filesharing site .
The two events generated a great deal of interest and deeply divided debate about copyright in Sweden .
Music executives in Britain are looking to Sweden 's experience for signs that their own tumbling sales can be stemmed by new laws outlined by the government last week .
Business secretary Lord Mandelson 's digital economy bill includes controversial plans to send warning letters to the most flagrant unlawful filesharers and paves the way for persistent offenders to have their broadband suspended from 2011 .
Opponents of the British proposals are quick to point out that the Swedish sales rise coincides with the emergence of new legal digital services such as the popular Spotify .
Music industry groups concede that too , but they insist the combination of carrot and stick is the key to changing consumer behaviour .
" The increase in sales in Sweden , set against the backdrop of innovative new digital services and tighter copyright laws , is encouraging , " said John Kennedy , the chairman and chief executive of IFPI .
" It is too early to say if Sweden has permanently turned a corner , but we hope that users there will permanently switch from unlicensed filesharing networks that give nothing back to the music community to great value legal services whose operators recognise continuous investment is needed to discover and promote the talent of tomorrow . "
The 18 % rise in Swedish sales over the past nine months reflects an 80 % increase in the digital market and a 9 % rise in physical format sales .
IFPI also points out that four new physical music retailers have opened in Stockholm this year .
Consumer push
Ludvig Werner , who chairs IFPI Sweden , said even if the new law had not changed people 's perceptions of whether copyright owners should be properly remunerated , it had changed their behaviour .
A crackdown on illegal sites combined with the spread of legal sites supported by advertising had helped push consumers from one to the other .
" It 's like speeding , put up cameras and people will start to ease off the gas pedal .
Even if it does n't change the attitudes , they find legal alternatives because they do n't want to get caught , " he said .
The rise in sales has been as " dramatic as when the figures started to drop in 2002 " , he says .
But music bosses in the home of Abba and Ace of Base are not cracking open the bubbly just yet .
" The music business in Sweden has been so used to negative sales information for the majority of a decade , so they do n't stand up and drink champagne when they see these figures , " said Werner .
" They are saying : ' It 's interesting … but let 's wait and see if this is a change in trends or is it just a deviation from the downward spiral ? ' "
The IFPI also flags up rising sales in South Korea , another country that recently introduced an anti-piracy law and where several legal services have launched .
It says music sales there were up 18 % in the first half of 2009 on a year ago , as CD sales rose for the first time in five years .
Geoff Taylor , the chief executive of BPI , the UK record labels group , says the figures from Sweden and South Korea show how legislation can steer people into legal services .
He hopes Britain 's experience will follow suit .
" We hope that even the announcement of the new legislation will have some educational effect by reminding people illegal downloading is against the law and that there 's a huge range of legal services out there , " he said .
On the other side of the debate over similar proposed laws in Britain , Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group , questioned how much the Swedish figures reflected a legal change there .
" We should n't be surprised that digital revenues are going up in countries like Sweden now that new services have been online for a while .
The question is whether it is necessary to have harsh enforcements , " he said .
Killock believes music companies and other rights holders are already alienating consumers .
He points out that Sweden 's Pirate party , which wants to legalise internet filesharing , has won a seat in the European parliament .
His own group , which is running a " say no to disconnection " campaign , has seen its membership grow by 20 % in the last two months , to just over 1,000 people .
" If the music industry wants to build a movement of people that are angry with the way they are being treated they are going about it the right way , " he said .
He and many of the internet service providers argue the way to curb piracy is for music companies to provide more legal online music sources such as Spotify .
" Filesharing is not the root of the problem .
It 's a symptom not a cause .
It 's a symptom of a lack of relevant services , " said Killock .
Broadband provider TalkTalk , whose chief executive , Charles Dunstone , has been an outspoken opponent of Mandelson 's planned clampdown , said the sales rise in Sweden did reflect " some movement towards more accessible and reasonably priced content " .
Undetectable
But the company questioned whether piracy was on the wane .
" We have almost no idea how much content is being accessed illegally because people are migrating away from P2P ( peer to peer ) platforms and increasingly access content via proxy servers , encryption , ripping from internet , radio and so on – all of which is undetectable , " said a spokesman .
" At best , the Swedish system has hastened the migration from P2P .
The development of better legitimate models is very welcome and it probably explains the uptick in sales .
But it seems highly implausible that it is legislation which has prompted any reversal of fortune , " he added .
The debate over how much new laws can actually help music sales over the long term has also deeply divided musicians .
In Sweden many artists came out in support of new legislation , says Werner .
But many opposed it as counterproductive .
Alex Jonsson , the keyboard player in Maze of Time , a Swedish progressive rock band , describes the new law as " absolutely horrid " , partly because of the privacy implications , but also because he believes many bands have benefited from filesharing .
" If I could , I would put everything out there .
The way the music business has developed means that spread is much more important than short - term gain …
It 's a changing climate and you have to look at new ways of getting your music out , such as the live scene and bundling music together with other services and so on , " he said .
" I do get a smaller piece of the pie but the pie is getting bigger .
People in Kuala Lumpur would never have known before about a band in a suburb of Stockholm . "
Activision claimed yesterday that Modern Warfare 2 was the " biggest launch in history across all forms of entertainment " .
Not just games .
All forms of entertainment .
That 's a big claim .
Let 's see if it holds up .
Advertisement
That means it did n't just have to be the biggest game launch of all time .
It had to beat the biggest album , book and movie launches , too .
Which you 'd think would be no easy feat , but remember : Activision 's boast rests solely on two self - imposed criteria : that the launch applies only to North America and the United Kingdom , and that it 's based on the total revenue gained over those first 24 hours .
Advertisement
That 's a little too selective for our tastes .
We 're going to be a little fairer , and size MW2 up not only in terms of revenue - which will always favour games , which are relatively expensive - but units sold / people entertained as well .

MODERN WARFARE 2 vs MUSIC
It 's difficult to get hold of accurate music statistics , mostly because global figures are rarely combined .
And because until the early 90's , even the US records were a mess .
Still , not that any of that matters ; the biggest - selling album launch in US history is ' N Sync 's " No Strings Attached " , which moved only 2.4 million copies in seven days ( with estimates of 1.4 million sales in the first 24 hours ) .
Advertisement
And in the UK ?
It 's Oasis ' " Be Here Now " , which sold just under one million copies in its first week on sale .
So MW2 is the clear winner here ; it sold more units in 24 hours than 'N Sync and Oasis combined could manage in a week , and with games more expensive than CDs , earned far more revenue as well .
Winner ( Revenue ) : Modern Warfare 2
Winner ( Units ) : Modern Warfare 2

MODERN WARFARE 2 vs BOOKS
Books are able to put up more of a fight .
The reigning champ when it comes to the printed word is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , which in 24 hours sold 8.3 million copies in the US and a further 2.65 million in the UK .
That 's 10.95 million customers , easily trumping Modern Warfare 2's 4.7 million .
Advertisement
But remember : this is all based on revenue , not units .
And with Potter 's final adventure averaging around $ 18 at retail , that puts revenue at $ 197 million , nowhere near MW2's $ 310 million figure .
Even allowing for Deathly Hallows ' worldwide launch figures , at $ 15 million , it still can't overhaul Infinity Ward 's shooter .
Winner ( Revenue ) : Modern Warfare 2
Winner ( Units ) : Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

MODERN WARFARE vs MOVIES
Again , a little messy due to sloppy record - keeping and a lack of global cooperation , but as you 'll see , that does n't matter .
The current record - holder for a movie launch is 2008 's The Dark Knight , which in its first 24 hours in the United States made $ 66.4 million .
Factor in what would be far smaller figures for Canada and the UK and it 's still not even within shouting distance of $ 310 million .
Advertisement
Things are , however , looking a little healthier for the movie business when you look at units sold .
With ticket prices in 2008 averaging $ 7.20 , that works out to be around , oh , 9.2 million movie - goers .
And that 's just in the United States .
Winner ( Revenue ) : Modern Warfare 2

MODERN WARFARE 2 vs VIDEO GAMES
Last year , Grand Theft Auto IV set a new record for " biggest game launch " , selling 3.6 million copies and earning $ 310 million .
Which , at least in terms of revenue , is awful close to Modern Warfare 2's figures .
Advertisement
Thing is , Take - Two 's GTA numbers were worldwide .
Modern Warfare 2's $ 310 million was made just in the United States , Canada and United Kingdom .
Factor in Europe and Australia , which no doubt Activision will in the weeks to come , and it 'll be a lot more .
Winner ( Revenue ) : Modern Warfare 2
Winner ( Units ) : Modern Warfare 2 .
So there you have it .
Modern Warfare 2 definitely holds the record for the biggest launch in video game history .
It can also stab in the face anything the music business can throw at it .
But as you can see , going up against movies and books , Activision 's claims had a lot more to do with how they chose to define " biggest " than how many people actually picked up their product in a 24 - hour period .

Hope this put things in perspective for you !
Note - DVD sales were not included because cumulative figures are a complete mess .
But if you 're curious , the # 1 - selling DVD of all time is Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End , which has lifetime revenues of $ 295 million .
Evolution has done to our profiles what glaciers do to mountains .
Gone is the jutting jaw .
Washed away is the bulging brow ridge .
Our faces are relatively flat compared to what they once were .
This means there ’s not much to look at to get your bearings .
According to a study by Javid Sadr and his colleagues at MIT , eyebrows are a crucial part of facial identification .
The behavioral neuroscientists discovered that faces without eyebrows are like land without landmarks .
The study : Volunteers were asked to identify fifty famous faces , including that of former U.S. president Richard Nixon and actor Winona Ryder .
The photos were digitally altered and shown either without eyebrows or without eyes .
When celebrities lacked eyes , subjects could recognize them nearly 60 percent of the time .
However , when celebrities lacked eyebrows , subjects recognized them only 46 percent of time .
The lesson : eyebrows are crucial to your identity — they ’re at least as important as your eyes , if not more so .
If you put colored contacts in your eyes , pumped collagen into your lips , or put on a pair of funky sunglasses , people would probably still recognize you easily .
But try shaving off your eyebrows .
Chances are that everyone will say they did n’t recognize you at first glance .
As Sadr points out , eyebrows pop out against the backdrop of your face — and for that reason not only identify who you are but how you ’re feeling .
Along with the lips , they may in fact be the most expressive part of your body .
The single raised eyebrow is a universal sign of skepticism , and the dual raised eyebrow a sign of surprise .
Think about it — entire Charlie Chaplin movies are spoken in the language of brows .
The shape of your eyebrows also says , in a glance , a lot about your age and other characteristics .
Bushy , gnarly , salt - and - pepper brows : old , powerful men .
Thin , graceful arcs : young , stylish women .
Sparse , light brows : childlike .
When waxed and tweezed , the brow is a sign of good grooming .
Eyebrows sometimes meet each other halfway across the bridge of the nose , especially on men , to form a “ monobrow , ” which resembles the vanished browridge of our primate ancestors .
Distinctive ?
Yes , and also brow - raising .
CrunchGear published that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) is forecasting it may need yottabytes of storage to keep all of its surveillance data by 2015 .
What is a yottabyte ?
1000 gigabytes = 1 terabyte
1000 terabytes = 1 petabyte
1000 petabytes = 1 exabyte
1000 exabytes = 1 zettabyte
1000 zettabyte = 1 yottabyte
In other words , a yottabyte = 1,000,000,000,000,000 gigabytes .
How Much Will This Cost by 2015 ?
On the one hand , what makes this even tougher is that typical storage systems cost 10 times the price of the raw hard drives .
Thus , the likely actual cost of storage for the NSA is $ 1,000 trillion for a complete storage system .
The NSA may need to partner with NASA to see if it can spin off about 15 more planet Earth ’s so their combined GDP could pay for its storage requirements .
On the other hand , this is based on prices and storage technology in 2009 .
But the cost per gigabyte has dropped consistently 4 % per month for the last 30 years .
Assume the trend continues for the next five years , by the time the NSA needs their yottabyte of storage .
Then costs in 2015 would be $ 8 trillion for the raw drives or $ 80 trillion for a storage system .
Well , that ’s getting closer — a bit less than today ’s global GDP .
How Much Space Will This Take by 2015 ?
Per historical metrics , a drive should hold 10 terabytes by 2015 .
The NSA would require 100 billion hard drives or two billion Backblaze Storage Pods .
And of course , they would probably want this data backed up .
That might really test our offer of $ 5 for unlimited storage .
To be fair , the original analysis states that the need for yottabytes of information may not be accurate because it assumes that data is collected in a way similar to today .
Instead , it purports they may only need hundreds of petabytes of data storage by 2015 ; significant , but completely manageable .
Hard drives are also the assumed technology — which has been a good assumption for 30 years and may continue to be a good one for the next five years .
SSD and other technologies may provide some interesting options , but in the near term , the price and density winner will likely continue to be spinning platters .
Regardless of how much data the NSA ends up needing to store , could we perhaps recommend a storage design ? ;-)

A passenger jet is to be deliberately crash - landed as part of a scientific experiment on Channel 4 that the broadcaster hopes will be one of its biggest hits of next year .
Two pilots will parachute from the 300 - seat airliner after setting it on autopilot to crash at high speed into the desert .
The plane will be loaded with cameras and sensors recording the impact of the crash , which Channel 4 said would provide invaluable information about how planes react in potentially fatal accidents .
The time and location of the crash are being kept under wraps by the broadcaster , which will air the documentary , Plane Crash , next year .
In a separate programme , Channel 4 will recreate a typical row of 1940s terraced houses before blowing them up with bombs identical to those used by the German airforce during the war , including a V2 rocket .
It said the series Blitz Street would examine the " profound psychological phenomenon " of the Blitz spirit .
The head of Channel 4 , Julian Bellamy , said Plane Crash would be " one of the most ambitious and audacious TV events of 2010 " .
" It is an extraordinary idea and only Channel 4 would be brave enough to do it , " he said today .
" Not even aircraft manufacturers have crashed something this big . "
The programme - makers said footage and data from the plane would provide an " unprecedented insight " into what happens when a plane crashes , enabling experts to study how areas such as seatbelt design , seat arrangement and overhead baggage can have an impact on passenger safety .
" As well as making spectacular television , we hope Plane Crash will be one of the most useful experiments ever in the history of aviation , " said producer Geoff Deehan , of independent production company Dragonfly .
" It will give us unprecedented answers to the big question : how can we make air crashes more survivable ? "
The plane will be piloted by two former US navy pilots , who will set its autopilot to crash - land before ejecting from the airliner .
In case of system failure , it will also be remote controlled from a helicopter and from another control unit on the ground .
The idea for the programme grew out of the crash of a British Airways Boeing 777 at Heathrow airport in January last year .
It baffled aeronautical engineers because the structure of the plane did not react the way scientific modelling had predicted .
Channel 4 refused to reveal when or where the plane would crash , or even which continent it would be on .
However , it will not be in the UK .
" We are working with the local environment agencies to ensure a proper clean - up and to make sure we do n't leave anything behind , " said Channel 4's head of specialist factual , Ralph Lee .
" It 's going to be designed as a survivable crash .
There is no point in atomising the plane – we would n't learn anything from it . "
Asked about those viewers who will watch for purely voyeuristic reasons , Lee said : " If people tune in for the wrong reasons and learn something from it , then I am quite comfortable with that .
Informing and entertaining are not separate categories . "
The costs of the documentary , which will air on Channel 4 by the middle of next year , are being shared by its international co-producers , National Geographic Channel and the German television channel ProSieben .
Lee said the budget was " not outrageous " .
Blitz Street will be presented by Tony Robinson .
" 70 years on it explores the profound psychological phenomenon that was the ' Blitz spirit ' via the recreation of a typical row of 1940s terraced houses , " said Channel 4 .
" The houses are subjected to a range of high explosives and incendiaries , similar to those used by the Luftwaffe , to give a new perspective on this period of British history . "

Have a happy and safe Halloween tomorrow .
I 'm off to start with the other Jack .
My previous pessimistic diary on this matter being including in the bill now may be proven incorrect .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing this morning on this very matter :
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing entitled , " Prohibiting Price Fixing and Other Anticompetitive Conduct in the Health Insurance Industry " scheduled for Wednesday , October 14 , 2009 .
The hearing concerns identical new bills ( S. 1681 and H.R. 3596 ) that NASW is watching .
The legislation would eliminate a long - standing federal law that excludes the insurance industry from federal anti-trust regulation .
This has been an issue I 've been blogging about for some time .
If you 'd like to read the background of big insurance 's antitrust exemption , read this diary .
If you think the public option has the insurance industry shaking in their boots , you 're mistaken .
THIS is what keeps them up at night : a Federal Master overseeing an antitrust consent agreement .
And that is exactly what they are going to get under aggressive antitrust action .
If you want to know how the Obama Administration is handling antitrust issues , read this diary .
Big props to Chuck Schumer and Pat Leahy for aiming the big artillery right at Big Insurance .
I 'm trying to find a way to watch the hearing , taking place right now , and I 'll be updating as news is made .
Update :
Thanks to commenter accumbens for providing live webcast link : Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing
Testifying : Senate Majority Leader Hon. Harry Reid , Hon. Christine Varney , Department of Justice Antitrust Chief , J. Robert Hunder , Consumer Federation of America , Prof. Lawrence Powell , PhD , University of Arkansas .

Methinks AHIP is scrambling !)
MAJOR UPDATE !!!:
I just heard Chuck Schumer on MSNBC say that he believes the removal of the exemption will be included in the final bill , either in the merged legislation or as amendment on the floor .
He said repeatedly that it will be in the final bill .

Three to four cups a day appeared to offer some protection Tea and coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes , a large body of evidence shows .
And the protection may not be down to caffeine since decaf coffee has the greatest effect , say researchers in Archives of Internal Medicine .
They looked at 18 separate studies involving nearly 500,000 people .
This analysis revealed that people who drink three or four cups of coffee or tea a day cut their risk by a fifth or more , say researchers .
The same amount of decaffeinated coffee had an even bigger effect , lowering risk by a third .
Type 2 diabetes usually starts after the age of 40 and develops when the body can still make some insulin , but not enough , or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly .
Type 2 diabetes is treated with a healthy diet and increased physical activity .
In addition to this , medication and / or insulin is often required .
The identification of the active components of these beverages would open up new therapeutic pathways for the primary prevention of diabetes mellitus
The study authors
If the findings prove true , doctors may well start advising people to put the kettle on as well as take more exercise and watch their weight , say the researchers .
When the authors combined and analysed the data , they found that each additional cup of coffee consumed in a day cut diabetes risk by 7 % .
Lead researcher Dr Rachel Huxley , from the University of Sydney in Australia , said because of the finding with decaffeinated coffee , the link is unlikely to be solely related to caffeine .
Instead , other compounds in coffee and tea - including magnesium and antioxidants known as lignans or chlorogenic acids - may be involved .
Special brew " The identification of the active components of these beverages would open up new therapeutic pathways for the primary prevention of diabetes mellitus .
" If such beneficial effects were observed in interventional trials to be real , the implications for the millions of individuals who have diabetes mellitus , or who are at future risk of developing it , would be substantial . "
Dr Victoria King , of Diabetes UK , said : " Without full information about what other factors may be influencing the type 2 diabetes risk of the studies ' participants - such as their physical activity levels and diet - as well as what the active ingredient in tea or coffee appears to be , we can not be sure what , if anything , this observed effect is down to .
" What we can be sure of is that the development of type 2 diabetes is strongly linked to lifestyle , which means that many cases could be prevented by keeping active and eating a healthy balanced diet that is low in fat , salt and sugar with plenty of fruit and vegetables . "

WASHINGTON —
The influential seniors group AARP said Tuesday it would be willing to endorse a health care bill without a public option of any kind .
“ It ’s not a priority for us , ” said David Certner , Legislative Policy Director of AARP , in an interview with Raw Story .
“ We ’re more concerned about prohibitions due to pre-existing conditions and cost spikes of up to 10 times for 60 - 64 - year - old seniors . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The AARP is n’t opposed to the public plan as it formally endorsed the House bill , which included it .
“ Half of our members are already on a public option — it ’s called Medicare , ” Certner said .
“ So we understand its benefits . ”
But the group has n’t taken a strong position on the contentious provision — partly , it seems , because of heated internal disputes over health reform , resulting in tens of thousands of members quitting since this summer .
Certner told Raw Story that while the public plan would be helpful , the reforms can still contain costs and extend coverage without it .
“ The defining questioning for us is whether or not there ’s going to be affordable insurance for our membership , without these kinds of exclusions , ” he said .
“ It does n’t matter if you get there through private insurance or public insurance . ”
Seven - figure ad buy aimed at ‘ distortions and misinformation ’
ADVERTISEMENT
AARP and the American Medical Association this week launched a multi-million - dollar ad buy to slam opponents of health reform who they believe have been dishonest .
The ad , launched Monday , is scheduled to air nationally until December 6 , 2009 .
It ’s aimed at attacking the “ distortions and misinformation ” put forth by special interests and members of Congress , said David Allen , an AARP spokesman .
It features a man called a “ real doctor ” and another named “ spin doctor ” trading barbs about the nature of the Democratic reform effort .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I ’m here to give you the facts about Medicare , ” says the former , who declares that it ’s “ not actually true ” when insurance companies say “ you ’ll lose your Medicare . ”
The AARP has declined to single out a party or legislator , but it ’s clear the group is in part targeting the GOP , which has fiercely opposed the effort .
Just 1 out of 177 Republicans supported the House bill , and not a single Senate GOP member backed Saturday ’s motion to begin debate , which every Democrat and Independent supported .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We know opponents of health care reform wo n’t rest , ” said AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond .
“ We ’ll continue to fight for older Americans and to protect and strengthen Medicare , not only for today , but for generations to come . ”
The AARP ’s ad follows .
" Thirty years ago in the turmoil of the revolutionary zeal an indefensible act of hostage taking was committed that the new generation of Iran are not proud of at all , " he said .
" We know very well how that deplorable action hurt the noble American people and how it led to three decades of unnecessary and painful bad relations between our two nations .
The unsettled stomach of a 120 - kilogram pig was to blame for a fumy false alarm near Bendigo on Tuesday night .
Fifteen firefighters and two tankers rushed to respond to a report of a strong smell of gas after their pagers sent an alert about 10.30 pm .
The area has been identified as one of the state 's most at - risk of bushfires and residents are able to use only bottled gas , thus increasing the risk of a blaze .
But when the crews arrived at the house in Axedale 10 minutes later , the source of the offending smell was clear .
CRITICS of the health care reform plan often refer to it derisively as “ ObamaCare . ”
On the policy merits , this is highly questionable : the White House has taken a hands - off approach toward the legislation that recently passed in the House and the version that is being worked out in the Senate .
But when it comes to politics , “ ObamaCare ” could hardly be more apt : lawmakers ’ support for or opposition to reform generally has less to do with the views of their constituents and more to do with the issue of presidential popularity .
Consider , for instance , the 39 Democrats who voted against the bill in the House , which approved the health care bill by a margin of 220 to 215 .
According to data compiled by The New York Times , 31 of the 39 Democratic naysayers hail from districts that John McCain won last November .
Although the upper chamber has a reputation for being less rigidly constrained by near - term political considerations , odds are that the same calculus will prevail in the Senate .
We ’ve crunched some poll numbers in order to relate senators ’ positions on the bill to public opinion in their home states .
First , we rated each of the 100 senators from 1 to 5 , based on their public statements and their committee votes on the health care initiative , with 1 meaning completely opposed ( like Jim DeMint of South Carolina ) and 5 meaning completely supporting the bill ( like Barbara Boxer of California ) .

We then compared these scores against several statistical indicators that would presumably affect lawmakers ’ positions , including their party affiliations and the rate of uninsurance in their home states .
We also looked at polling data from the National Annenberg Election Surveys , which asked voters in each state : “ Providing health insurance for people who do not already have it  should the federal government spend more on it , the same as now , less , or no money at all ? ”
( The Annenberg data are from 2000 and 2004 ; 2008 data have yet to be released . )
A SEVEN - year - old girl is working for her local radio station - as possibly the world 's youngest agony aunt dishing out advice on love and relationships .
Elaina Smith was offered the post after she rang a phone - in on Mercia FM and told a woman caller who had just been dumped to go bowling with friends and drink a mug of milk .
Her advice was such a hit that she was given a weekly slot on the station 's breakfast show , reports the Daily Mirror .
Now she gives tips on everything from ending a stale relationship and how to get a man to dealing with lazy older brothers .
Elaina , from Coventry , said : " I really enjoy it .
I say whatever comes into my head and people like what I say .
I used to want to be a vet , but now I want to be on the radio . "
Her mum Karen Harris , 31 , added : " Elaina 's dad and I separated .
She 's always trying to set me up with people in town .
" I 'm happy being single but if I do need advice I know who to ask . "
When one listener wrote to Elaina asking how to get a man , she replied : " Shake your booty on the dancefloor and listen to High School The Musical . "
Another girl asked what she should do about her lazy older brother .
Elaina answered : " Tell him to get a job and stop watching Loose Women on the telly . "
When a woman asked how to get her man back , Elaina told her : " He 's not worth the heartache .
Life 's too short to be upset with a boy . "

RECIFE , Brazil ( Reuters ) - Fishing nations agreed on Sunday to cut by about a third the quota for Atlantic bluefin tuna , a giant fish prized by sushi lovers , numbers of which have been decimated by commercial catches .
A man looks at dead bluefin tuna heads dumped by Greenpeace activists in front of the Agriculture Ministry in Paris to protest the continued mismanagement of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery that is leading to the commercial extinction of the species , in this November 17 , 2008 file photo .

The move was denounced as inadequate by environmental groups who had called on the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) to agree to a zero quota and list the fish as an endangered species .
ICCAT , an intergovernmental body of 48 nations that environmentalists say has consistently failed to protect bluefin , said the annual quota for bluefin next year would be 13,500 tonnes , down from 19,950 tonnes .
“ I think it ’s quite an achievement and in full conformity with the scientific advice , ” ICCAT chairman Fabio Hazin told Reuters after a week - long meeting in Recife , northeastern Brazil .
He said the cut and further measures agreed upon on Sunday -- including a cut in the tuna - fishing season to one month and a recovery plan -- gave a 60 percent probability that the bluefin stock would recover in 15 years .
ICCAT ’s scientists said last month bluefin catches must drop to below 15,000 tonnes a year to stabilize their numbers and start a recovery that would one day allow sustainable catches of around 50,000 tonnes a year .
Environmental groups said a quota of 8,000 tonnes was needed to give a 50 percent chance of a revival in stocks .
“ It ’s too little , too late , ” said Susan Lieberman , director of international policy for the Washington - based Pew Environment Group .
“ It is a decrease and that ’s nice , but it ’s not going to recover the species . ”
Fishing nations in the European Union including Spain , Italy , France , Cyprus , Greece and Malta have consistently opposed sharper quota cuts .
TRADE BAN EYED
ICCAT also agreed to ban fisherman from taking big - eye thresher sharks , one of several shark species endangered by overfishing .
Fisherman had previously been allowed to take the sharks if they came up dead in nets , but under the new rule will not be able to use them at all , said Matt Rand , head of the Pew Environment Group ’s shark conservation campaign .
The porbeagle and thresher sharks are fished for their fins , which are prized in Asia as an ingredient for soup and they struggle to recover their numbers because they breed so slowly .
Atlantic bluefin commands huge prices in Asia , particularly in Japan where a single fish can fetch up to $ 100,000 .
The warm - blooded fish can reach weights of over 1,300 pounds ( 600 kilograms ) -- heavier than an average horse .
ICCAT ’s scientists this year found Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks are at less than 15 percent of their historic size before large - scale commercial fishing started .
Environmental groups now aim to have bluefin added to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) next year , which would result in a ban on international trade .
“ A ban on international trade in Atlantic bluefin tuna is now the only remaining chance to save the iconic fish from extinction , ” said Francois Provost , international oceans campaigner for Greenpeace .

The " P vs. NP " problem is a central outstanding problem of computer science and mathematics .
In this talk , Professor Wigderson attempts to describe its technical , scientific , and philosophical content , its status , and the implications of its two possible resolutions .
A library employee in Kentucky was so offended by Alan Moore 's The League of Extraordinary Gentleman : The Black Dossier that she effectively took it out of circulation , and was recently fired for her efforts .
But God knows what the amateur comics censor would have thought of the prolific Moore 's other titles , some of which make The Black Dossier look like Harold and the Purple Crayon .
Here are seven arguably more controversial works that might have burned bigger holes in her pious backpack .
From Hell — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Most everyone knows the story : A deranged madman named Jack the Ripper terrorizes England , immediately rendering it less jolly .
But within Moore and artist Eddie Campbell 's roughly drawn monstrous diagrams ( pictured above ) of mad science , dark magic and intertextual history lie horrors that would have given the crusading Kentucky librarian the creeps for the rest of her afterlife .
Soaked in blood and sex , but with brains so dense that they might not fit in the Bluegrass State , From Hell is an epic masterpiece worth hiding from the authorities .
( Warning : Some might find the following images from adult comics shocking .
Please report your offense to the nearest God-fearing public library employee . )
Lost Girls — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
This sprawling erotic epic , which mashes a sexually explicit Dorothy , Alice and Wendy into World War I 's repressed meat - grinder , is probably the most conventionally profane title in Moore 's enormous catalog of work .
By design , of course .
" I 've been insistent on calling Lost Girls pornography right from the start , " Moore told me in 2006 , mainly because he believes the difference between porn and erotica " is the state of the person reading it . "
" Pornography is such a degraded genre with absolutely no standards , " he added .
" It does n't serve any function other than to make people feel wretched , ashamed and alone .
It reinforces our loneliness and our wretched human misery .
And it should n't . "
It 's charged territory , the sexual plane .
But Moore is adamant that charting its outer and inner reaches with smarts and artistry is a must .
Plus , it 's already been done , if indirectly , in the parent texts that Lost Girls cleverly samples .
Where do you think all those Disney films come from anyway ?
Swamp Thing — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
Although there 's lots of human and vegetable horror to be had in Moore 's storied run on DC Comic 's freaky earth spirit , one memorable moment , pardon the pun , sticks out .
That 's when Moore makes Swamp Thing and Abby Arcane mate in a hallucinatory state .
( She eats his tuber .
There , I said it . )
It 's a hard issue to find , even if you 're an outraged library employee .
But a little fungus told us that it 's collected in DC Comics Saga of the Swamp Thing Book 2 , out Nov. 25 .
Watchmen — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
How do two people have a threesome ?
When one of them is Watchmen 's quantum superhero Dr. Manhattan .
That and other hero - on - hero sex can be had in this legendary comic — as well as rape , murder , pillage , apocalypse and worse .
( Note to offended parties , especially library employees : The Watchmen film came out this year .
You might want to rifle through the DVD section as well , just to be fail - safe . )
Promethea — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
Speaking of magic , Moore is a practicing conjurer who knows his Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn from his Aleister Crowley and David Blaine .
His philosophical and supernatural concerns come brilliantly to life in this psychedelic coming - of - age metafiction about a time - traveling avatar .
Outraged parents who do n't want their kids watching a young female immortal having sex with a really old one should probably not get involved with Promethea .
They might have an out - of - body experience .
The Mirror of Love , a poetic homage to same - sex relationships by Alan Moore and José Villarrubia , is pretty , but could turn Kentucky libraries ugly .
Images courtesy Top Shelf Productions
The Mirror of Love — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
To combat gay - haters , Moore fired off this dense , evidenced epic uncovering the loving roots of same - sex history through the ages .
Starring the people you usually see in libraries and museums — Michelangelo , Shakespeare , Emily Dickinson , Oscar Wilde — and featuring visuals ( above ) from José Villarrubia , The Mirror of Love is a lauded defense of amour in all its formats .
What 's to hate ?
Brought to Light — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
Had enough of the transgressive sex and violence ?
How about some old - fashioned treason ?
This condemnation of what Dick Cheney called the dark side of American power contains Moore and artist Bill Sienkiewicz 's Shadowplay : The Secret Team , which is literally told by a drunk , grumpy American eagle that also happens to be a retired CIA agent .
If you thought a jaunty adventure like The Black Dossier was scandalous , wait until you get the Olympic swimming pools of blood found in Shadowplay , thanks to the United States ' various black ops .
Forget disappearing comics ; you 'll be ready to call Homeland Security .

Recently I ’ve been really interested in functional , concurrent programming languages , such as Erlang .
This prompted me to have some fun in C , and try to implement a simple library that is based on the Actor Model .
Right now it is usable , although it may not be ready for production .
It uses pthreads and the library handles all of the threading issues , so you do n’t have to worry about any of it at all .
In a future version I plan to add more sandboxing to the actors , so that when one actor crashes , they do n’t all go down !
Right now it supports the following :
Spawn actor
Sending messages
Broadcast message
Actor memory management convenience functions ( when an actor dies , the memory is freed ! )
Here is what a simple ping / pong example looks like :
#include < stdio.h > # include < libactor / actor.h > void * pong_func ( void * args ) { actor_msg_t * msg ; while ( 1 ) { msg = actor_receive ( ) ; if ( msg -> type == PING_MSG ) { printf ( " PING ! " ) ; actor_reply_msg(msg , PONG_MSG , NULL , 0 ) ; } arelease ( msg ) ; } } void * ping_func ( void * args ) { actor_msg_t * msg ; actor_id aid = spawn_actor ( pong_func , NULL ) ; while ( 1 ) { actor_send_msg ( aid , PING_MSG , NULL , 0 ) ; msg = actor_receive ( ) ; if ( msg -> type == PONG_MSG ) printf ( " PONG !
" ) ; arelease ( msg ) ; sleep ( 5 ) ; } } void * main_func ( void * args ) { struct actor_main * main = ( struct actor_main * ) args ; int x ; /*
Accessing the arguments passed to the application */ printf ( " Number of arguments : %d
" , main -> argc ) ; for ( x = 0 ; x < main -> argc ; x ++ ) printf ( " Argument : %s
" , main -> argv[x ] ) ; /* PING / PONG example */ spawn_actor ( ping_func , NULL ) ; } DECLARE_ACTOR_MAIN( main_func )

Some of you may wonder what the deal with the nickname is .
It ’s short for Suburban Commando , a nick I picked up in high school .
A few companions that were a little left of center though it was quite funny , I accepted it out of spite .
In case you have n’t noticed , I ’m a bit of a Glocker .
I really ca n’t have nice things , so the basic black pistols work just fine for me .
I ’ve also shot rimfire benchrest .
I even managed to win a local match .
My best score to date was shot with a completely rebuilt Ruger 10 / 22 with a KID trigger and barrel , although my Remington 40 XRBR is more consistant .
I started shooting rimfire benchrest in 2004 , I think .
I got into action pistol competitions in 2006 .

ITV is closing in on a deal to take a significant stake in Hulu , the US online TV venture backed by News Corporation and NBC Universal , which would make programmes including Coronation Street available on a UK service .
Hulu has been exploring options to launch a UK service with broadcasters since Project Kangaroo , the homegrown online TV joint venture between ITV , Channel 4 and BBC Worldwide , was blocked by competition regulators in February .
It is understood that Hulu has offered ITV an equity stake – thought to be significant and possibly more than 25 % – in the UK venture .
It is not thought to have made an equity offer to other UK players such as Channel 4 .
In its US operation NBC , News Corporation and ABC each hold about 27 % in Hulu .
" It is about proportionality and if ITV product drives Hulu in the UK , which it must do , then they need to get out of it what they put in , " said one industry source .
" They should be able to negotiate a significant stake in Hulu UK . "
ITV is understood to be close to agreeing to give Hulu the rights to shows from ITV Productions .
A sticking point , as it was with Project Kangaroo , has been the question of ad sales .
ITV has been reluctant to give up control of selling its own ads – it had wanted the contract for all ad sales for Project Kangaroo content – and splitting the sales of online ads for content on ITV Player and a Hulu UK service is problematic .
Hulu US is understood to have allowed ABC to maintain control of ad sales around its programmes on the service , and ITV wants a similar arrangement for the UK deal .
" The trouble for ITV is if there is a third - party sales deal [ for ads around shows on Hulu ] there can be difficulties in pricing and deals that are different from what ITV Sales is doing on the ITV Player , " said the source .
According to analysts , ITV has been successful in monetising shows on the ITV Player and is at a crucial stage in growing the operation .
A big part of its success is being able to keep ad prices high because it has not allowed its shows to be made available on any other service , thereby restricting the amount of ad inventory for advertisers to buy .
" The prices ITV has been able to charge at a premium have come from being able to choke off [ ad ] supply , " said one analyst .
" Selling ads is about maximising reach while maintaining the price of ads .
Hulu is not actually market leading in monetising its service " .

Canadian researchers have pioneered a new way to mend a patient 's breastbone after open - heart surgery , using a Superman - strength glue that cuts healing time and reduces pain .
The technique uses a state - of - the - art adhesive called Kryptonite that rapidly bonds to bone and accelerates the recovery process , says Dr. Paul Fedak , a cardiac surgeon and scientist at the University of Calgary .
" We can now heal the breastbone in hours instead of weeks after open - heart surgery , " he said Thursday .
" Patients can make a full recovery after surgery and get back to full physical activities in days instead of months . "
Fedak said he came up with the idea of using Kryptonite , a biologically compatible adhesive made by a U.S. company , after watching many patients struggle with the aftermath of the surgery , which requires the breastbone to be split vertically to allow access to the heart .
" So I fix their heart and they 're usually fine from a heart point of view , but a lot of them have prolonged pain after the surgery in the region of their breastbone , " he said from Calgary .
" We have n't really innovated anything since cardiac surgery became routine 50 years ago , in terms of the chest closure .
We 're still closing the chest the same way we always did with stainless steel wires and waiting for the bone to heal over six to eight weeks and hoping that it fuses . "
Augmenting the wires with the adhesive produces a solid bond within 24 hours , reducing time in hospital and allowing patients to resume physical activity sooner – an important component of surgical recovery in general and for heart rehabilitation in particular .
Fedak has used Kryptonite to mend the breastbones of more than 20 patients who had open - heart surgery as part of a pilot study .
He is set to head an international trial using the technique , which will involve 500 patients over the next year or two .
One patient in the initial trial has had both methods of knitting his breastbone back together – and he said the glue takes the prize without question .
After Richard Cuming , 62 , had cardiac bypass surgery two years ago , the wires holding his sternum together pulled out of the bone , leaving the two halves to rub together whenever he moved .
The condition , called sternal disruption , is one of the potential complications arising from open - heart surgery .
" I could n't accomplish simple tasks like squeezing toothpaste , turning the steering wheel in my car or pulling open a heavy door without discomfort and pain , " he said .
Coughing or sneezing was " brutal , " Cuming said from his Calgary home , describing his pain level as up to eight on a scale of 10 .
But when he had another open - chest operation in July to re-mend his breastbone using Kryptonite , there was a huge difference in his recovery .
" First of all , my chest was solid .
I mean it was rock - hard , no movement .
I could tell immediately that there was a significant improvement , " Cuming said .
" The pain never did get much above a three on a scale of one to 10 , and I managed it for the first couple of days in hospital with ibuprofen instead of any narcotic . "
" In three weeks I felt I could do pretty much anything I wanted to do .
I 'm sure I could have done it sooner . "
Fedak has begun teaching the technique to other cardiac surgeons , both within and outside Canada .
Among them is Dr. George Christakis of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto , who calls the use of the adhesive " a terrific idea . "

" I think it will be very good for patients who are at high risk of sternal disruption , " he said .
" Presumably , if you use this material Kryptonite , this will happen infrequently or not at all . "
" It will be good for patients and also great for hospitals , too , because keeping a patient in hospital for a long period of time takes up an enormous amount of money and resources .
This would be very , very cost - effective . "

Usually I try to tell you something intelligent about Perl 6 , but this night 's frustrating hours of debugging very simple mistakes demonstrated that my wits have left to 90 % at least .
Still there 's the Iron man blogging challenge , so I 'll write a few lines about something entirely subjective .
I 've found that there 's really momentum in the Perl 6 community , and I 'm even more happy to to observe that people hack on other people 's projects .
For example Johan Viklund , co-author of the November wiki chimed in with the installed - modules branch of proto , making it usable rather quickly .
Martin Berends jumped on the train that diakopter set off by starting his new pet project , a Perl 6 interpreter that emits javascript and runs it through the V8 engine ( more on that project in one of the next blog posts ) .
Solomon Foster joined the Rakudo development and did some very significant work on the trigonometric functions and the corresponding tests .
However it suffered from rather weird dispatch where some some methods that are defined in parrot 's Complex PMC were not overridable .
So today I started a branch which aims to implement the Complex class completely in Perl 6 , and using the Complex PMC only by delegation through inline PIR .
I just ripped out all the old stuff , and Solomon and I started to re-add them .
On a completely unrelated note I want to point out that we have some SQL support in Perl 6 now , through Tene 's perl6 - sqlite module .
The image above shows the development of the numbers of projects known to proto over time - another indication of the momentum we 're gathering .
The document - leaking site Wikileaks says it ’s preparing to release 500,000 intercepted wireless pager messages from a 24 - hour period encompassing the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
Site operators say they plan to start rolling out the texts beginning at 3:00 a.m.
New York time , paced to display as they were broadcast at the corresponding time on September 11 , 2001 .
American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center ’s North Tower at 8:46 a.m. , and United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower 17 minutes later .
“ Text pagers are mostly carried by persons operating in an official capacity , ” reads the description on the site .
“ Messages in the archive range from Pentagon and New York Police Department exchanges , to computers reporting faults to their operators as the World Trade Center collapsed . ”
A sample of the alphanumeric pages appeared on the site Tuesday night .

Wikileaks did n’t identify the source of the messages , but the site has a solid track record for releasing authentic information .
Unencrypted pager traffic has been subject to interception by hackers and others for years — an easy video tutorial made the rounds just last May .

“ While we are obligated to protect our sources , it is clear that the information comes from an organization which has been intercepting and archiving national US telecommunications since prior to 9/11 . ”
Cool Artworks Surrounding the H1N1 Flu
The swine flu , H1N1 flu or H1N1 influenza has caused some different responses around the world : panic , indifference , doubts , worries and sometimes simply nothing .
But for some artists the swine flu became a theme , something new to explore and produce some cool pieces .
You will see here lots of different styles of artworks surrounding the H1N1 flu ( illustration , photography , graphic and so on ) , most of them are funny , others more serious , but they are all very cool .
What a cat - astrophe !
A ferocious feline turned her owners into a pair of scaredy cats in their Midtown apartment yesterday , holding them hostage at claw - point until the cops came to their rescue .
Rosa Davila and her son , Victor Marte , 27 , cowered behind a bedroom door at their pad on West 42nd Street about a half an hour while the raging Russian blue held them at bay .
The fur began flying shortly after 3 p.m. when 16 - pound Carmen , who was suffering from health problems , launched herself at the unsuspecting Marte .
“ All of a sudden Carmen got violent and started making strange noises , ” a tearful Davila told The Post after the hair - raising incident .
“ I yelled , ‘ Carmen !
Calm down ! ’
I wanted her to jump off , but then she started attacking my son .
I was in shock — I was very scared for my son . ”
Davila and her son made a dash for it , but the 10 - year - old Carmen gave chase , hissing all the way .
Marte managed to scramble back into the bedroom to safety , leaving his mother to tame the beast .
Davila then tried to herd the cat into the bathroom , but she would n’t go , so she sprinted for the bedroom , slammed the door shut and called 911 .
With Carmen still screeching outside , Davila said she told the operator that her cat was attacking her son and they needed help .
Twenty - five minutes later , rescuers pulled up to the building near Dyer Avenue , she said .
“ I thought we ’d show up and there ’d be a bobcat or something in there , ” said one responding officer .
But instead of a wild animal , they found the furious furball .
Using a stick , they were able to quickly corral her into a cat carrier , ending the dramatic standoff .
“ I was surprised to see so many police — like it was for a tiger , ” Davila said , weeping as she recounted the attack , which left her son with scratches to his legs .
“ I was so surprised because I knew she was moody , but this just does n’t make sense , ” she said .
Carmen began acting strangely a few months ago , wanting food “ every five minutes ” and gaining weight , she said .
The vet diagnosed the animal as a borderline diabetic with a thyroid condition .
But Davila was unable to afford treatment , so Carmen just kept eating .
Police took the cat to the Manhattan Animal Care and Control Center , where she will be held for 10 days .
Depending on her health and behavior , she may be available for adoption thereafter , since a heartbroken Davila said she can’t afford to pay for Carmen ’s diabetes treatment .
“ I just do n’t want people to think she ’s a bad cat , ” she said .
“ I think she just had a reaction to her medical condition . ”

An MP accused of using expenses to pay his own company has said he is " deeply hurt " by the reports and has referred his case to the standards commissioner .
Tory MP for Spelthorne David Wilshire said the company never made a profit and it was approved by the Fees Office .
The Daily Telegraph reports he paid £ 105,000 in three years to Moorlands Research Services ( MRS ) .
A Conservative spokeswoman said : " This will be resolved either way long before the general election . "
She added : " The standards commissioner 's in - tray can not be used as an excuse to drag this out . "
' Never made profit ' Mr Wilshire is understood to be meeting Conservative chief whip Patrick McLoughlin at the Commons on Thursday afternoon .
Mr Wilshire said the company , which was owned by him and his partner , provided administrative , secretarial and research support for him and had been formally approved by Commons authorities .
It is not unusual for MPs to claim about £ 30,000 - a- year on such work .
I am deeply hurt by the way in which the Daily Telegraph has reported on my expenses and disappointed that it has not published all of my response to their enquiries
David Wilshire However Parliamentary rules say MPs " must ensure that claims do not give rise to , or give the appearance of giving rise to , an improper personal financial benefit to themselves or anyone else " .
Mr Wilshire said that neither he nor his partner Ann Palmer had ever received any payment from MRS , which he said had never made a profit .
The Telegraph reported that the company appeared not to have been registered in the UK .
BBC chief political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg said MRS did not appear to be on Companies House records but Ms Palmer had insisted to the BBC that it was " entirely false " to claim it was not registered .
Mr Wilshire said it was a properly constituted business which had submitted annual accounts to the Inland Revenue .
Standards inquiry
The MP said : " I am deeply hurt by the way in which the Daily Telegraph has reported on my expenses and disappointed that it has not published all of my response to their enquiries .
" My constituents are rightly entitled to the truth about these allegations .
I have therefore written to the commissioner for standards asking him to conduct an inquiry .
" Until I have had an opportunity to take his advice , I think it best if I say nothing further . "
Sir Thomas 's review has been making waves at Westminster Standards Commissioner John Lyon 's office received the request on Thursday and said it would decide whether to launch an official inquiry after consulting MPs on the committee on standards and privileges .
Several MPs have referred themselves to Mr Lyon after questions were raised about their expenses claims , which were leaked to the Daily Telegraph and published in May .
This week he ruled former home secretary Jacqui Smith had breached the rules and should apologise to the Commons for claiming her main home was her sister 's house in London , where she paid rent .
And a separate independent audit of all MPs ' claims under the second homes allowance , ordered by Downing Street after the scandal broke , has resulted in many MPs being asked to repay money claimed up to five years ago - even though they were within the rules at the time .
Harman warning Auditor Sir Thomas Legg has retrospectively applied his own limits to gardening and cleaning claims of £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 and asked MPs who claimed more to pay back the difference .
On Thursday it emerged London Mayor Boris Johnson had repaid £ 1,266 claimed when he was an MP relating to a council tax " administrative error " .
His office said he believed the figure to be closer to £ 700 but decided to " pay up and move on " rather than go through a " long drawn - out " process of questioning it .
Obviously we have to judge things by the rules and standards that obtained at the time , to do anything else would be arbitrary
Harriet Harman
Commons leader Mr Wilshire 's payments to MRS were made through his office expenses which were not part of that inquiry .
The Conservatives also carried out their own internal scrutiny of their MPs ' expenses after the furore .
MPs usually have two homes - one in their constituency and one in London near Parliament - and can choose which to designate as their " second home " on which they are entitled to claim expenses .
But Mr Wilshire confirmed that his designated " main home " is in Somerset , more than 100 miles from his constituency - which is on the outskirts of London .
He claimed the maximum allowed for his second home in 2007 - 8 , £ 23,083 , and a total of £ 160,542 in all allowances that year .

Macaques find fake monkeys creepy
Human suspicion of realistic robots and avatars may have earlier origins than previously thought .
The phenomenon , called the uncanny valley , describes the disquiet caused by synthetic people which almost , but not quite , match human expressiveness .
Experiments with macaque monkeys show they too are suspicious of replicas that fall short of the real thing .
The research suggests a deep - seated evolutionary origin for the reactions such artificial entities evoke .
Evolution influence
The phrase the " uncanny valley " was coined by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori and shows that human disquiet increases as avatars and robots look more and more human .
Many people who watched films such as Beowulf , Polar Express and Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within reported that , despite the impressive 3D animated effects , the people portrayed were not entirely convincing .
Many explanations have been put forward for such responses , said Princeton neuroscientist Dr Asif Ghazanfar who carried out the research on the monkeys .
Some suggest the reactions are caused by a suspicion that those who look human but act oddly are ill and avoiding them makes good evolutionary sense .
Others have advanced cultural reasons to explain the response .
" The range of explanations for the uncanny valley in humans is large and by doing this experiment we can reduce it quite a bit , " said Dr Ghazanfar .
The Princeton team was led to investigate whether monkeys show uncanny valley responses because of work they were doing on the best way to investigate macaque communication .
Despite the avatars being simple , monkey reactions were consistent " What we wanted to do was make a monkey avatar to interact with real monkeys .
That would allow us to have real time social interaction occurring where we monitor brain activity in a real monkey , " he said .
" Having an avatar gives us complete control over one side of the interaction which is unprecedented , " Dr Ghazanfar told the BBC .
The reactions of real macaques to the artificial monkeys were intriguing , he said .
" We were not terribly surprised that they show an uncanny valley effect , " he said .
" What I am surprised by is that we can evoke it using such a rudimentary procedure - measuring simply how long they look . "
" The animals were not trained or rewarded yet they were completely consistent in their reactions , " he added .
The results were reported in the journal PNAS .
Macaque monkeys are a favourite among researchers because of their biological similarity to humans .
Their social lives have enough in common with humans to make comparisons apt , said Dr Ghazanfar .
Macaques have a " despotic " social network that means monkeys that are physically frail , old or sick are excluded .
It also suggests , he said , that human reactions to almost human avatars do have an evolutionary origin .
" I think there 's a lot of interest in it because there 's an increasing number of folks who are pursuing human interaction with artificial agents , " he said .
" We can demonstrate that evolutionary hypotheses are tenable and that the uncanny valley has something to with social experience and neural processes across many primate species . "
The Princeton team plans to keep on using artificial macaques to investigate monkey vocal communication .
" The positive spin is that we have made an avatar realistic enough that it has produced expectations from our real monkey , " said Dr Ghazanfar .
" The monkeys , like humans , quickly habituate to the creepiness of the avatar . "

BERLIN ( AP )  World - record holder Haile Gebrselassie won the Berlin Marathon for the fourth straight time on Sunday despite struggling in the last third of a race run in sunny , warm weather .
The Ethiopian was on a pace to break his record for the first 18 miles but slowed once his last pacemaker dropped out .
Gebrselassie was gritting his teeth by the time he finished under the Brandenburg Gate in 2 hours , 6 minutes , 8 seconds .
" It was n't marathon weather , " he said .
" It was too warm in the last 10 kilometers .
...
At the beginning it was perfect .
I could have tried to push maybe , but really it 's wonderful .
I am OK . "
Francis Kiprop of Kenya was second in 2:07.03 and Negari Therfa of Ethiopia was third in 2:07.41 .
Atsede Besuye of Ethiopia won the women 's race in 2:24.47 .
Silvia Skvortsova of Russia was second in 2:26:24 .
Last year , Gebrselassie became the first man to run under 2 hours , 4 minutes , finishing in 2:03:59 to slash 27 seconds off his previous mark .
He is the only man to win the Berlin Marathon four times .
Gebrselassie 's pacemakers pushed him over the first two - thirds of the race and the Ethiopian looked capable of lowering the world mark again .
But when Kenya's Sammy Kosgei dropped out , Gebrselassie was left alone in the front and he could not keep up the pace .
" Maybe the first 30 K were too fast , " he said .

A scary realization came to me while thinking about my children ’s future the other day .
There ’s no guarantee of jobs for all the people in the world .
As a global trading network , we may have become so efficient in making shoes , shirts , and automobiles that there ’s no need for everyone to manufacture things or even to serve each other any longer .
A “ jobless recovery ” they call it .
What kind of recovery is that ?
The New York Times points out in a recent editorial ( NYT , October 4 , 2009 ) that the continuous job losses in the U.S. are unprecedented since 1939 .
We have lost jobs for 21 straight months , a total of 7.2 million since December 2007 .
But this does n’t even count the poor folks who have dropped out of the system , after searching for 27 weeks and given up hope .
Last month they amounted to 571,000 more people — those who are no longer captured in the “ unemployment ” statistics .
Officially , unemployment is now at 9.8 % or 15.1 million people .
But if one actually computes the “ employment rate ” as all those who have a job divided by the sum of those employed AND those who would like to have a job ( if one were available ) , we are down to only 58.8 % employment , the lowest percentage in more than 25 years .
That sounds like 41.2 % unemployment to me .
There ’s no dignity in joblessness .
Will we ever be able to replace these jobs , or is this the structural unemployment that economists have long warned us about ?
I am reminded of Joseph Schumpeter , 1883 −1950 , Austrian - born Harvard economics professor , who invented the notion of “ creative destruction ” .
Creative destruction holds that wealth is created by the natural periodic erasure of old production systems and replacement with something better .
Thus , Schumpeter would reason that transitioning from the fossil fuel age to a system of renewable energy and efficiency is just what the doctor ordered .
It certainly seems to be the elixir for China .
Hu Jintao and the People ’s Party have embraced renewable energy like no other country .
They are now the largest solar panel manufacturer in the world with more than 40 % of the market share .
China recently commissioned a U.S. company , First Solar , Inc. , to build the largest solar photovoltaic power plant in the world ( 2000 MW ) in the Inner Mongolian desert with 25 sq mi ( ∼65 km2 ) of solar panels , enough to power over 3 million homes .
Further , China has doubled its nameplate capacity for wind energy in each of the last four years , and will likely pass the leading country in wind power ( the U.S. ) within a year or two .
To illustrate how serious they are , 40 % of the stimulus funds in China are devoted to investment in green technologies , while only 14 % of the funds in the U.S. are so dedicated .
Not only China , but the entire world needs to create green collar jobs .
I ’ve seen it work in my native state of Iowa .
We ’ve lost thousands of jobs in appliances manufacturing and small industries , but we ’ve gained 7,702 clean energy jobs since 1998 , mostly in wind manufacturing , biofuels production , and as contractors for the weatherization of homes ( www.pewcenteronthestates.org).
In the past two years in Iowa , over $ 149 million in venture capital funds have been invested to create these jobs .
We have five wind power facilities which manufacture turbines , towers , and blades — and more are on the way .
And Iowa is just average in terms of inducing jobs from the New Economy .
Certainly , green jobs are not the entire answer to our nation ’s unemployment problem , but the sector is growing much faster than others and it constitutes a light at the end of the tunnel that we should harness .
That ’s the hope and promise for the meetings in Copenhagen this December to replace the 1997 Kyoto Climate Treaty which was not ratified by the U.S.
As of this writing , the U.S. again does not have serious support from the Senate needed to ratify a new treaty .
But on their side , supporters have the dramatically changing climate , the logic of creative destruction , and senators ’ strong desire for greater energy independence .
For example , we could replace our fleet of automobiles with hybrid and electric vehicles ( creating jobs ) , fill their lithium - ion batteries ( research and jobs ) with wind power at night ( wind manufacturing jobs ) and solar power during the day ( solar industry jobs ) , while solving the energy security problem of imported oil .
That ’s a powerful impetus .
Jobs , energy independence , and greenhouse gas emissions reduction in one fell swoop .
There ’s more good news .
Once wind and solar energy comes on line , we will no longer suffer the vagaries of price fluctuations and cartels as we do with oil and natural gas .
Who owns the wind and the sun ?
No one ... we all do .
The sun always rises in the east , and the wind will always blow from high pressure to low .
These energy sources fluctuate with earth ’s predictable periodicities , which is much different from the oil economy .
Solar and wind power create a cleaner , healthier life on this planet .
Joseph Schumpeter was right .
Renewable energy is creative destruction just when we need it most .
And green jobs are the result .

I hate these posts .
I hate them because I feel like I am drawing attention to another post which made me cringe a little bit .
But I think that reacting to these posts is good , because having a healthy debate about topics is good , especially if you can keep from devolving into mud slinging and attacks .
The post I am talking about is this one , which is titled “ It ’s OK Not to Write Unit Tests ” .
I was surprised to see that it is actually from March of this year , and maybe I have seen it before , maybe not , but this time I felt the need to respond to it .
One thing that I want to say first is that I want to keep this calm and mellow .
I used to react very calmly in retort to this kind of post , but over time as I wrote more and more on my blog , I found myself starting to become the “ everything is black and white and I ’m going to tell you that you ’re wrong with my blaring megaphone ” kind of writer that I often loathe when I read .
Sure , it might not make the best link - bait in the world , but maybe I ’ll feel a bit better after I write it .
Oh , and the blood pressure might stay down a little bit .
Having said all that , here we go …
Bad Experience Does Not Equal Bad Practice
The first thing I want to point out , which at first glace will seem blindingly obvious , is that a bad experience with a particular tool or practice does not mean it is necessarily bad .
It could be bad , but correlation is not causation and context is everything .
The experience we had was bad , but it is often hard to put all of the blame on the tool or practice .
For example , what if I went and tried to use Scrum on one of my projects and the entire project failed miserably .
Does that mean that Scrum is a bad framework for building applications ?
Of course not , many people find Scrum very very effective .
And if it works for a lot of other people , then sometimes the best thing to say is “ let me see how these other people are doing it ” , before you decide that the tool does n’t work for you .
You might find out that you were wrong , or you might confirm your beliefs , the important thing is to have an open mind .
Misapplication
We have all heard the saying “ when all you have is a hammer , everything looks like a nail ” .
It is one of my favorite sayings because people do n’t spend enough time looking outside of their own boxes in order to discover that the world is full of screws and nuts ( pun intended ) .
Not every screw can be banged in with a hammer , but at the same time , you ca n’t wield a screwdriver like a hammer and expect positive results .
In order to be successful with any tool or practice , you need to research in order to figure out how the tool works .
Or as almost any developer on IRC will tell you , RTFM .
If we are misapplying tools and techniques , then we are going to have bad experiences with them .
And because I believe in testing a system at a low level , and testing a system at a high level are both important , I am going to outline a few steps that I think need to be taken toward your testing enlightenment .
First Step : Admit You ’re Not As Smart As You Think You Are
Unit testing , like many other practices that the development community has adopted , are here for one simple reason .
We , individually and collectively , are not that smart .
We like to think we are smart , but as any Douglas Adams fan knows , the dolphins are the ones who really have it figured out .
We write unit tests because all of the pieces that are involved in building large and complex applications just ca n’t fit in our tiny little heads .
You ’ve heard of the magical number 7 right ?
Sure , people will argue it is a wives tale , but the point is the same , we can only hold a finite number of items in our head .
And for most of us , that number is not very big .
In order to alleviate the “ tiny head ” problem , we need to break things down .
Breaking things down wo n’t help us if we do n’t validate as we go along that each part is working .
Think about it , what if we were going to build an engine .
Would n’t it be easier to individually design , build , and test 150 different parts that make the whole before we assemble them ?
Surely it is easy to make an alternator and install that into the engine as a subsystem , rather than individually bring in every part that makes it up .
That does n’t mean we are n’t going to fire up the engine after we build it to make sure the whole thing works , but if we did n’t have each piece designed right , it would be a heck of a lot harder to figure out that the fuel injectors were n’t spitting out enough fuel if we had n’t already tested that independently as part of their design .
The author makes the point of saying :
Like , let ’s say I was writing a SHA - 1 hash implementation .
That ’s a lot of code .
And I would n’t write little tests all the way down .
But I would have a few tests validating that it works at a very high level , absolutely .
Okay , so writing an implementation of SHA - 1 is not exactly a common occurrence .
And quite frankly , a SHA - 1 hash algorithm is actually not that much code .
It is very complex , but it is not a huge amount of code .
To say that you are going to go through that algorithm without writing any tests as you go tells me that you are going to spend a huge amount of time in the debugger .
Or you are a genius .
Either way , why not formalize all of the intermediate testing that you are going to do anyways so that when someone finds a bug in your implementation , they do n’t have to retrace your steps .
Second Step : Admit You Need Training Wheels , Or At Least Some Crutches
The author of the article makes the statement that unit tests are akin to training wheels .
Something that you should do when you are n’t very good , and then get rid of when you become an expert .
I ca n’t wrap my head around this analogy for a few reasons .
First , unit tests are not testing your ability as a developer .
They are testing the correctness of your code .
Writing correct code is about being a domain expert , writing good code is about being a good developer .
The code you are writing probably involves significant business logic that you did not create , in a field that you are probably not an expert in , and is mixed with lots of code that you did not write .
And , in the future , will be modified by people which you will probably never even meet .
And those people will probably be idiots ( just sayin ) .
Let ’s just make it easier for everyone and assume that you and I are both going to break your code , so put some harnesses in place that will tell me that .
And no , I do n’t want to know that I broke your code from a test that is 10,000 lines above where I made my modification , I want to know at a much lower level than that .
So I do n’t waste a ton of time in the debugger stepping through line by line .
Third Step : Address The Problem Not The Symptom
Brittle tests .
Ugh .
I ’ve heard this argument so many times .
“ Unit tests are brittle , unit tests are brittle . ”
Brittle tests are a symptom .
Go grab a few books on writing effective unit tests .
There are many available .
All of them have strategies for mitigating this .
Most of the time these strategies do n’t involve complaining about brittle tests , they usually involve teaching people how to write tests which do n’t depend on external resources and which operate on public interfaces and not internal implementation details … which leads me to the next step .
Fourth Step : Understand That Encapsulation Is Your Friend
One of the practices that the author complains about is the process of making private methods public in order to test them .
Again , we are looking at the symptoms .
First , the only tool or entity that I have ever seen advocate this is Microsoft and MSTest .
The tool that MSTest provides which exposes private methods via proxies for unit testing was one of the biggest mistakes they made with their testing toolset .
Most unit testing experts will tell you that once you start digging into the internal implementations of classes you are , by definition , creating brittle tests .
A private method is a big flag that says “ DON’T CALL THIS METHOD EXTERNALLY , EVEN USING REFLECTION . ”
If you decide to do so , you are doing it at your own risk , knowing that you are creating a dependency on something that may change .
Encapsulation is one of those fundamental concepts that you should go out of your way to not violate .
The sooner you learn that you should only be testing the inputs , outputs , and public state on your classes ( which you should work to minimize ) , the happier that you ’ll be .
If you see something in your class that you need to really exercise fully and you ca n’t get to it because it is wrapped up in a sea of private methods , it sounds like it is time for some refactoring .
Pull it out into a class so that you can exercise the complex behavior in isolation .
That is the idea after all .
Fifth Step : Admit That You Don’t Know Statistics ( AKA : Combinatorics Are Not Your Friend )
If you are writing tests at the system level then you are n’t thoroughly exercising your system .
Simple as that .
Have you ever sad down and thought about the insane number of interactions within the applications that you are working on ?
If you have n’t , take a moment and ponder it .
Software projects are often giant spider webs of logic and interaction where the deeper you get into the web , the harder it is to understand how things at the top affect it .
If you have ever seen a game of Plinko then you ’ll know exactly what I am talking about .
You may be able to predict where the chip will go for one or two levels down , but past that point there are simply too many possibilities and too much randomness .
Testing “ in the small ” on classes that are at the lower levels of your system will allow you to have more confidence that you have actually exercised these pieces .
Sixth Step : Realize That Isolation Is The Only Way To Have Control
We all want control , right ?
Resorting to only doing “ whole system ” or “ acceptance ” testing makes it difficult to test anything in isolation .
But why would you want to test in isolation ?
This is one of the most frequent questions I receive when I talk about mocking to people .
And the best answer is that it allows you to control the execution environment .
How many times have you seen code where there are n’t any tests that cover an error case because there is no good way of forcing an error at test time ?
Or how many times have you not tested something thoroughly because you could n’t call out to a web service or read from a file during a test ?
These are common problems .
If you do n’t have a strategy for testing pieces of your system in isolation then you ca n’t thoroughly test your system .
Seventh Step : Understand That It Is n’t Just Integration Tests or Unit Tests
Many people , when they argue against unit tests , are merely saying that testing at the level of units is often just too small of a piece of code to be worth it .
To a certain degree , I agree with this .
Writing tons of tests that test itty bitty pieces of logic will probably not get you too much value in the end , and will probably end up being an anchor around your neck .
But many of those same people seem to think that if you are n’t writing tests at the unit level , then the only other option is to write tests at the system level .
Argh !
The more you work on a system , the better of a feeling you will get about what level most of your testing needs to occur at .
For me , that level of testing is mostly at the class level and frequently at the sub -system level .
Sure , you also want whole system tests , but as I said earlier , you should n’t lean on those too heavily .
Do n’t Take My Word For It
In the immortal words of LeVar Burton , “ you do n’t have to take my word for it ” .
Go out there and grab a few books like xUnit Test Patterns or Pragmatic Unit Testing .
Try to write tests the way that many of the experts out there would prescribe , and see if it does n’t make your life easier .
I know that the author of the referenced article said that he did n’t think find grained tests caught regressions , but I have never worked on a system which had a good suite of lower level tests that were n’t constantly catching unexpected regressions .
I just do n’t know what to think about that .
And that is why I say it is so important to try it out for yourself , I have worked on well tested projects and in the end they ended up higher quality , better designed , and more maintainable because of the tests , not in spite of them .
I heart Clare Crespo .
I first saw her crocheted sushi and desserts in Bust magazine , then found her web site Yummy Fun with crazy and inventive recipes .
She has two books The Secret Life of Food and Hey There , Cupcake ! , both filled with exquisitely clever food ideas .
She created a few things for Hostess , and it seems her Twinkie Sushi catches the fancy of most everybody .
I was invited to a sushi making party and I figured what better time to try the twinkie sushi .
She has a sushi cupcake recipe in her book The Secret Life of Food that incorporates a Swedish fish atop a mound of rice , which I think is just so darn funny .
You can see a picture of this half way down this Gothamist interview .
( The recipe for these are also in the Feb / March 2005 Bust magazine . )
But , I knew I would n’t have time to make little fake rice rectangles , so I used half of a Hostess powdered donette instead .
I sliced just a little bit off of the top of the donut as well , it allows the fish to stay in place more easily .
Things I learned along the way .
I read in someone elses experience that if you make the treats ahead of time and leave them at room temperature , the fruit roll ups can melt and become gooey .
I made a few for a test run and left them in the fridge overnight , and while the fruit roll up did n’t actually melt it become more sticky and not as fun to eat .
So , make these the day of and store them in the fridge .
Shavings of dried mango or papaya can serve as slices of pickled ginger .
I could only find green fruit roll ups with punch out faces in them , it still worked ok .
But , here is a recipe for apricot fruit leather , I ’m sure adding a little food coloring would make a nice murky green .
The fruit roll ups stick nicely to themselves , and stretch if they do n’t quite reach all the way around a twinkie slice .
How do they taste ?
Not the greatest really , you ’ll want to pick the components apart .
But look how darn cute they are !
I found myself wondering what results you could get from dipping fruit in chocolate and slicing it — bananas , kiwi , strawberries .
They all seem like they could make an interesting fruit sushi dessert .
There is a bunch of great faux sushi stuff I came across in my searches :

WINDSOR , England — Leaders representing the world 's major religions , including the Baha'i Faith , gathered yesterday at historic Windsor Castle to formally launch a series of action plans involving their communities in a long - term effort to protect the environment .
They were joined by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and HRH Prince Philip , the Duke of Edinburgh , in a celebratory meeting that emphasized the role religion can play to inspire grassroots change and make " peace with the planet . "
" I have long believed that when governments and civil society work toward a common goal , transformational change is possible , " said Mr. Ban .
" Faiths and religions are a central part of that equation .
" Indeed , the world 's faith communities occupy a unique position in discussions on the fate of our planet and the accelerating impacts of climate change , " he said .
The three - day event – which ended at noon today – was sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the Alliance of Religions and Conservation ( ARC ) , which was founded in 1995 by Prince Philip .
The core session of the gathering was yesterday 's meeting at Windsor Castle , where representatives of each religious group presented a seven - year plan designed to promote " generational change " in attitudes towards the environment .
Thirty - one plans were presented , reflecting representation by virtually all of the world 's independent religions : the Baha'i Faith , Buddhism , Christianity , Daoism , Hinduism , Islam , Judaism , Shintoism , and Sikhism .
In general , the plans sought to offer concrete , practical steps for action .
The Muslim plan , for example , calls for the establishment of an umbrella organization , Muslim Associations for Climate Change Action ( MACCA ) , that will represent Islamic nations and faith communities from around the world .
It also calls for an Islamic environmental labeling system , a " Green Hajj " so that within 10 years the traditional Islamic pilgrimage will be recognized as environmentally friendly , and the construction of a model " green mosque " to showcase best practices in heating , light , and design .
The Sikh plan urges all Sikh gurdwaras – temples – to recycle , compost , use green energy , use eco-stoves , start rainwater harvesting , purchase reusable plates and cups .
Representatives of the Baha'i Faith presented a plan that focuses on using a system of regional training institutes to encourage within the worldwide Baha'i community " acts of service related to environmental sustainability . "
" Baha 'is believe that religious belief and spirituality lie at the foundation of human motivation and behavior , " said Tahirih Naylor , a Baha'i International Community representative to the United Nations who was one of two Baha 'i delegates to the Windsor event .
" We believe that efforts to change harmful human behavior – such as those actions that contribute to global warming or environmental degradation – can be greatly facilitated by processes that lead to a better understanding of our own relationship to God , and of humanity 's relationship with nature .
It is from such understanding that action naturally arises . "
The approximately 200 representatives from religious communities , environmental groups , and international agencies who gathered in Windsor also met in a series of plenary sessions and workshops at the Harte and Garter Hotel to discuss how they can reach a new level of collaboration in the face of global warming , water shortages , deforestation , and other environmental threats .
" Climate change is complex , and dealing with it requires us to change at many levels , " said Olav Kjorven , assistant secretary general of the United Nations and director of the Bureau of Development Policy at the UN Development Programme .
" It requires a change of ethos .
Religions have an unparalleled ability to reach out to people at the grassroots and to touch hearts and minds .
Religious institutions are the third largest actors in international markets .
Environmentally friendly purchasing decisions by them would have a huge impact across the world . "
Tony Juniper , special adviser to the Prince of Wales ' Rainforests Project and former executive director of the Friends of the Earth , likewise emphasized the important role that religions can play .
" Scientific rationalism gave rise to good science , which in turn gave rise to strong political arguments for cleaning up the environment , " Mr. Juniper said .
" As a result , governments dealt with acid rain and other environmental threats .
But these changes were only superficial , " he said .
" Purely scientific rationalism cannot change our fundamental understanding of who we are and how we should live .
Religion and science must work together to bring about a fundamental transformation in our relationship to the world .
This kind of change needs a spiritual foundation , " he said .
As the name suggests , the First Else 's main objective is to be different .
This may sound like a marketing hype but Else seems serious -- it wanted to create not just another phone , but rather a brand new mobile user experience ( especially the ergonomics , aesthetics and the content delivery system ) to upstage the iPhone and the latest Android devices , both of which Else considers to be the market leaders .
Eldad Eilam , CTO of Else , explained that this required starting from scratch and using custom technology where possible ( such as its proprietary graphics engine ) , while at the same time the technical details are well - packaged so that they do n't intimidate the users ( but not just by wrapping an aging OS with some fancy skin ; yes , we 're staring at you , Windows Phone ) .
Else started with ALP 's Linux foundations , and after two years and 33 partner agreements , it unveiled the Else Intuition OS .
When asked about other Linux - based platforms like Android and webOS , Eilam expressed little concern .
" Android 's a game - changer ... [ but ] people need to consider that Android does n't bring good user experience .
Most [ manufacturers ] have failed .
The Droid is improving , has a great infrastructure but they treat Android as just a component . "
Interestingly , Else did n't comment on webOS -- probably to avoid stirring up Access 's bitter memories of Palm , but it could 've been just a miss .
While there 's some good old Linux doing the donkey work underneath , the First Else 's futuristic and intuitive user interface mesmerized us during the presentation and our hands - on , all thanks to " sPlay " -- a right - thumb - controlled , sci - fi - like fan menu interface .
Else actually did a live demo on its prototype First Else with no visible glitches , and when we had our hands on the device we got the same great responsiveness .
Else CEO Amir Kupervas made a good point about how " smart " phones should actually be adapting to us instead of us having to adapt to cluttered menu systems , which led the to birth of sPlay and the fisheye display which provide minimal but necessary information , while keeping a consistent layout and visual aesthetics across different applications .
At the same time , these features are positioned within reach of the right thumb , and sPlay takes it further by letting you easily browse different content by just a simple swipe of the right thumb .
Kupervas went as far as saying this single - hand operation is " the death of main menu , " mocking most other smartphone platforms .
You 'll probably appreciate more of what Else is trying to achieve after watching its presentation ( followed by its campaign video which is also available at the ' Source ' link ) :
While Else 's focus is on the user experience , it has n't compromised on the hardware front : inside it 's got a powerful TI OMAP 3430 processor ( as found on the Motorola Droid and Palm Pre ) , a brilliant 854x480 3.5 - inch capacitive LCD touchscreen , a 5 - megapixel camera which promises to capture 480 p video at 30 fps , and a 1450 mAh battery which claims to outlast the iPhone 3GS by at least one hour .
Oh , we dig the OLED indicators at the top as well , leaving us some useful space on the screen .
Details on storage capacity are still vague , but right now Else is only saying anything up to 32GB .
There 's no word on where the First Else will make its commercial launch -- all we know is that it 'll only operate on HSDPA and EDGE ( sorry , Verizon fans ) .
Speaking of carriers ,
Else is also working on a self - branded media store which will require no credit card details , thus enhancing the " out - of - the - box experience " .
How will it do that , you say ?
Well , it 'll work very closely with carriers in full partnership , and let them charge you at the end of the month .
This is n't totally revolutionary -- with the iPhone it 's just a one - off setup on iTunes -- but it 's still a nice touch by Else , and we 're sure someone out there will appreciate this extra effort to create a seamless user experience .
Similarly ,
Else will be setting up an app store and they 'll release an SDK at launch .
We 've been told that some big names are already working on the first lot of apps -- World of Warcraft was mentioned -- and there 'll be an app approval process to ensure that they 'll have the same flow as the handset itself .
Good for the users , but probably not so good for the developers .
There 's a lot of potential here and well done to Else for the work so far , but there are still many uncertainties : pricing , availability , carriers , apps , final device specs and , most importantly , usability in the long run .
That 's a lot of of unanswered questions -- almost enough for us to call this vaporware -- but we 're optimistic , as we 've actually held and played with a working device in person .
We 're hoping to hear a lot more about what Else has in store -- until then , we can only drool over this final quickie demonstration .
Just remember to wipe up afterwards .
Meet the new President , same as the old President :
WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Eric
Holder says a lawsuit in San Francisco over warrantless wiretapping threatens to expose ongoing intelligence work and must be thrown out .
In making the argument , the Obama administration agreed with the Bush administration ’s position on the case but insists it came to the decision differently .
A civil liberties group criticized the move Friday as a retreat from promises President Barack Obama made as a candidate .
Holder ’s effort to stop the lawsuit marks the first time the administration has tried to invoke the state secrets privilege under a new policy it launched last month designed to make such a legal argument more difficult .
Under the state secrets privilege , the government can have a lawsuit dismissed if hearing the case would jeopardize national security .
The Bush administration invoked the privilege numerous times in lawsuits over various post - 9/11 programs , but the Obama administration recently announced that only a limited number of senior Justice Department officials would be able to make such decisions .
It also agreed to provide confidential information to the courts in such cases .
Under the new approach , an agency trying to keep such information secret would have to convince the attorney general and a panel of Justice Department lawyers that its release would compromise national security .
Holder said that in the current case , that review process convinced him “ there is no way for this case to move forward without jeopardizing ongoing intelligence activities that we rely upon to protect the safety of the American people . ”
In reality , of course , there ’s no substantive difference between two policies :
Kevin Bankston , a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a civil liberties group in San Francisco that is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the government , called Holder ’s decision “ incredibly disappointing . ”
“ The Obama administration has essentially adopted the position of the Bush administration in these cases , even though candidate Obama was incredibly critical of both the warrantless wiretapping program and the Bush administration ’s abuse of the state secrets privilege , ” said Bankston .
Any one of you who thought that the Obama Administration would end the over - reaching interpretation of Presidential power than we saw during the Bush Administration should realize just how foolish you were by now .
( Health.com ) --
Patients in the 13 states where medical marijuana is legal can now light up without fear of federal reprisal , but they may still have to answer to local authorities .
The Justice Department this week announced that it will no longer seek to prosecute people using , prescribing , or distributing pot for medical purposes , as long as they 're in compliance with local law .
However , regulations in some medical marijuana states remain murky .
For example , Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley recently announced a plan to crack down on all illegal medical marijuana dispensaries in his jurisdiction , arguing that they are illegal .
In California , as well as several other medical marijuana states , laws governing distribution vary from city to city and county to county .
Matters are simpler in Rhode Island and New Mexico , which formally license medical marijuana providers .
Nevertheless , advocates hail the news as a step in the right direction .
They say the move will likely encourage more doctors to consider prescribing medical marijuana in states where it 's legal .
And more patients may try using the drug , which can be prescribed for chronic pain , nausea , and other conditions .
The federal move could also embolden other states to make their own laws allowing medical marijuana use , they say .
" This is a very significant development , " says Bruce Mirken , the director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project , which advocates the full - scale legalization of marijuana .
" This is the most significant and most positive development on federal medical - marijuana policy since the Carter administration . "

Yvonne Westbrook , of Richmond , California , is in her 50s and has been using marijuana for decades to help manage her multiple sclerosis ( MS ) symptoms .
" I think it will help people who do n't want to break the law but need the medication , " she says .
" I think it 'll open the doors for other states to decide how they want to get the medicine to the people , because it is really very effective . "
Randy Barnett , the Carmack Waterhouse professor of legal theory at Georgetown University Law Center , in Washington , D.C. , says the new policy will make life easier for those in need of medical marijuana .
" It 's obvious that if they 're not going to be prosecuted by the feds , and they 're not going to be prosecuted by the states , they now are free of a huge legal threat , " says Barnett , an expert on constitutional law who argued a landmark medical marijuana case before the Supreme Court in 2004 .
" That 's big from the point of view of the sick and suffering . "

In March 2009 , U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder said drug enforcement officials would no longer prosecute medical marijuana use that was allowed by state law , even if it broke federal regulations .
The Justice Department 's announcement this week basically made the Attorney General 's policy official .
Dr. Donald Abrams , a professor of medicine at the University of California , San Francisco , says the announcement " certainly gives the nation sort of new hope that there 's beginning to be some recognition that there is some medical value to this ancient medicine . "
Abrams is a cancer doctor who prescribes pot to treat loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , and pain .
Instead of prescribing multiple medications for these symptoms , he says , " here we have one medicine that actually can speak to all of those different indications . "

Evidence that medical marijuana works is strongest for the symptoms that Dr. Abrams mentioned , as well as for helping HIV patients to cope with medication side effects and improve their appetite .
However , a host of other health claims are being made for marijuana .
Among the best substantiated are the benefits of pot for helping spasticity in patients with MS , Lou Gehrig 's disease , and similar conditions .
Advocates have also suggested using marijuana for treating psychological problems ranging from depression and anxiety to bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , but the evidence here is n't as solid .
Research on the risks of long - term marijuana use is also spotty .
Studies to date have found little solid evidence that marijuana is harmful to the lungs or otherwise toxic to the body , says Abrams .

But Dr. Jeannette Tetrault , an assistant professor of medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven , Connecticut , who has studied marijuana 's effects on the lungs , says her review of 34 studies found some evidence linking long - term use to symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , like coughing , sputum production , and wheezing .

The studies she and her colleagues did find were of middling quality , Tetrault adds .
" I do n't think we know enough to really be in a place where we can say that it 's something that we should be allowing , " she says .
" I think the jury 's still out in terms of what it may do in terms of long - term complications . "
However , Abrams argues that given the alternatives , pot is pretty safe .
" It 's not really a toxic agent , " he says .
" Compared to tobacco , alcohol , and sugar , it 's relatively benign . "

OTTAWA - The Conservative government is spending more than five times as many taxpayer dollars on promoting its economic plan as it is on raising public awareness about the flu pandemic .
And that 's once again raising a long - standing question : when does government advertising cross the line into partisan boosterism ?
Television viewers may have noticed the latest feel - good government ads about stimulus spending , including the Conservative - friendly , anti-election pitch : " We ca n't stop now , " and " We have to stay on track . "
All the ads direct viewers to a Tory - blue government web site that includes more than 40 different photos of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and refers repeatedly to " the Harper government " -- apparently in direct contravention of Treasury Board communications policy .
The TV spots are just the latest $ 4 - million salvo in a $ 34 - million media blitz trumpeting the Conservative 's recession - fighting budget .
Meanwhile , with public health officials fretting over an onrushing fall flu season , the spread of the H1N1 virus and widespread public apathy about the need for vaccination , no television ads are in the works to combat swine flu .
Health Canada 's home web page , however , does include a prominent link to the Conservative economic action plan website ( www.actionplan.gc.ca).
The Public Health Agency of Canada says it has a total marketing budget of $ 6.5 million to inform Canadians about the H1N1 virus and how to avoid infection .
Some $ 4.5 million of that was spent on ads in newspapers , public transit ads and on the web that ran from April to August .
The health agency has committed another $ 2 million to radio spots that began airing last week , just as new swine flu outbreaks were being reported .
Opposition MPs say the spending disparity in the two ad campaigns simply highlights the obvious :
The government is using public funds to toot its own horn .
" Guys , you 're spending all this money to promote yourselves .
Maybe some work on the prevention of H1N1 would be helpful , " Liberal critic Martha Hall - Findlay said in an interview .
The Liberals first objected to government ads earlier this summer that claimed the federal stimulus funding was " 80 per cent already implemented . "
That glossy campaign is also highlighted on the government 's action plan website .
Marketing experts say partisanship in government advertising is highly situational , ever - present and may or may not cross ethical lines .
Federal advertising guidelines speak vaguely of not promoting any political party or entity , but Hall - Findlay concedes the rules are so loose as to be unenforceable .
Ontario , by contrast , began screening provincial government ads in 2004 under a strict law that attempts to stop partisan messaging .
Jonathan Rose , a political communications expert at Queen 's University in Kingston , Ont. , advises the ad clearance group for the auditor general of Ontario .
Rose says the Ontario law requires examination of not just what the ads say , " but also the relationship between the ad buy and the campaign imperatives . "
That means ads that fall close to a scheduled election -- or , say , when a minority government 's defeat appears imminent -- will be given particular scrutiny .
" One might expect ads that require citizens to do something ( such as things to prevent swine flu ) have a stronger reason than those ads that have no information related to changing behaviour or attitudes in the public interest ( anti-homophobia ads for example ) , " Rose said in an email .
A case can be made for current government ads that promote the popular home renovation tax credit , which requires Canadians to keep receipts and actively apply for tax reimbursement .
But it 's harder to understand the public service utility of spending millions of tax dollars to advise Canadians that their money is being spent on infrastructure projects .
Tim Dewhirst , an associate professor at Guelph University 's marketing and consumer studies department , says government ads may be informational , persuasive , or serve as reminders -- with ads that focus on providing specific information to the public the least problematic .
Dewhirst said many of the Tory economic action ads appear to be aimed at persuading rather than informing .
" There 's probably a lot of other issues that people would say is money better spent than trying to be persuasive about an action plan that 's supposedly already 80 per cent implemented , " he said in an interview .
" If it 's 80 per cent done , is there much of an informing purpose still necessary ? "
The $ 34 - million economic ad budget is spread between four federal departments -- Canada Revenue Agency , Finance , Human Resources and Skills Development , and Infrastructure Canada .
But all inquiries were directed to the Privy Council Office , the bureaucratic arm of the Prime Minister 's Office .
PCO did not respond to a written list of questions from The Canadian Press over a three - day period last week .
Mérida , November 12th 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) --
As part of its efforts to fight crime , the Venezuelan government publicly destroyed more than 32,000 firearms on Wednesday , according to the head of the Armed Forces General Board of Arms and Explosives , Colonel Julio César Morales .
Workers in an iron factory in Lara state used blow torches to chop the weapons into scrap metal .
Nearly $ 5,000 in proceeds from the sale of the scrap metal will be donated to the Friends of Children with Cancer Foundation , Morales said .
The weapons were seized from people arrested for violent crimes and also from prisoners this year .
Nearly a third of the weapons were homemade , and the rest were produced industrially .
Minister for Justice and Internal Affairs Tarek El - Aissami attended the arms destruction ceremony and said , “ This act forms part of the disarmament policies that we have been promoting . ”
In polls , Venezuelans have repeatedly placed crime and insecurity as the most serious issue affecting the country .
According to government figures , the number of homicides rose from 5,974 in 1999 to nearly 13,000 in 2007 , then declined to fewer than 8,000 last year , in a national population of approximately 28 million .
In addition to confiscating and destroying weapons , the government has increased the number of police officers and renovated their equipment , begun training unarmed community police squads , and laid the groundwork for a network of local drug prevention educator schools .
In 2006 , the government began its police reform program with a nation - wide , public consultation process and the formation of a national commission to write new standards for police conduct .
Two years later , the National Assembly passed a law creating a new national police force , and this year the Justice and Internal Affairs Ministry set up a new university for training in police conduct .
Mr. Lévi-Strauss cited a series of North American myths that associate twins with opposing natural forces : threat and promise , danger and expectation .
One myth , for example , includes a magical hare , a rabbit , whose nose is split in a fight , resulting , literally , in a harelip , suggesting an incipient twinness .
With his injunctions , the Peruvian priest seemed aware of associations between cosmic disorder and the latent powers of twins .
Mr. Lévi-Strauss ’s ideas shook his field .
But his critics were plentiful .
They attacked him for ignoring history and geography , using myths from one place and time to help illuminate myths from another , without demonstrating any direct connection or influence .
In an influential critical survey of his work in 1970 , the Cambridge University anthropologist Edmund Leach wrote of Mr. Lévi-Strauss : “ Even now , despite his immense prestige , the critics among his professional colleagues greatly outnumber the disciples . ”
Mr. Leach himself doubted whether Mr. Lévi-Strauss , during his fieldwork in Brazil , could have conversed with “ any of his native informants in their native language ” or stayed long enough to confirm his first impressions .
Some of Mr. Lévi-Strauss ’s theoretical arguments , including his explanation of cannibals and their tastes , have been challenged by empirical research .
Mr. Lévi-Strauss conceded that his strength was in his interpretations of what he discovered , and he thought that his critics did not sufficiently credit the cumulative impact of those speculations .
“ Why not admit it ? ” he once said to an interviewer , Didier Eribon , in “ Conversations With Lévi-Strauss ” ( 1988 ) .
“ I was fairly quick to discover that I was more a man for the study than for the field . ”
Claude Lévi-Strauss was born on Nov. 28 , 1908 , in Brussels to Raymond Lévi-Strauss and the former Emma Levy , who were living in Belgium at the time .
He grew up in France , near Versailles , where his grandfather was a rabbi and his father a portrait painter .
His great - grandfather Isaac Strauss was a Strasbourg violinist mentioned by Berlioz in his memoirs .
As a child , he loved to collect disparate objects and juxtapose them .
“ I had a passion for exotic curios , ” he said in “ Conversations . ”
“ My small savings all went to the secondhand shops . ”
A collection of Jewish antiquities from his family ’s collection , he said , was displayed in the Musée de Cluny in Paris ; others were looted after France fell to the Nazis in 1940 .
From 1927 to 1932 , Claude obtained degrees in law and philosophy at the University of Paris , then taught in a local high school , the Lycée Janson de Sailly , where his fellow teachers included Jean - Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir .
He later became a professor of sociology at the French - influenced University of São Paulo in Brazil .
A Taste for Adventure
Determined to become an anthropologist , he began making trips into the country ’s interior , accompanied by his wife , Dina Dreyfus , whom he married in 1932 .
“ I was envisaging a way of reconciling my professional education with my taste for adventure , ” he said in “ Conversations , ” adding : “ I felt I was reliving the adventures of the first 16th - century explorers . ”
I finally got my copy of the Doctor Who : Adventures in Time and Space Roleplaying Game , and turns out I ’m in it !
Well …
I ’m not exactly IN the game , but I am mentioned in the credits and some of my playtesting group ’s contributions made it into the game !
Sorry to subject you to what follows .
I ’m not trying to brag , I ’m just sharing my excitement !
Here is a picture of me going all Gollum with my new prize .
I ’ve only just started flipping through the set , but I gotta say this is a truly gorgeous game !
Each book has glossy , full - color pages .
There are several loose character sheets , each printed on heavy - cardstock .
There are punch - out cardboard tokens for Story Points .
It ’s just well put together and beautiful .
For a video walk - thru of the box set contents click here .
For a seven - page PDF preview of The Player ’s Guide , click here .
I ’ve only scratched the surface of the contents and can’t wait to read it cover - to - cover .
For now though , here are a few things I ’ve noticed that relate to my playtesting group …
CREDITS
Here are the credits listed on the inside cover of The Player ’s Guide .
And a close up on the Playtester ’s paragraph …
Hooray !
My thanks to Cubicle 7 for the shout - out !
My group , called THE UNIQUE GEEKS , consisted of Sterling , SGhoul , Scott C , Shavenger , and myself .
We read through early drafts of the rules , ran a few adventures , and created lots of characters and gadgets .
Then provided feedback to Cubicle 7 on all of this .
I ’m happy to say some of our contributions made it into the final draft !
Now , I hope I ’m not breaking some unspoken playtester rule by talking about which contributions were from my group .
If so , I deeply apologize to the almighty playtester gods and humbly offer to sacrifice myself on the altar of the omniscient 20 - sider .
Additionally , I ’m not trying to take anything away from David F. Chapman or the folks at Cubicle 7 .
They ’ve created a great game and deserve to be praised for everything they did .
They did all the heavy - lifting creating the game from scratch , we just came along and piggybacked on their ideas and made a few suggestions .
I ’m honored to have been invited to the playtest and honored that the folks at Cubicle 7 thought some of our suggestions were good enough to include .
GADGETS
For one particular adventure , I developed four different gadgets .
Gadgets are unique devices or tools characters carry with them for specific purposes .
While going through the new box set , I was blown away as I stumbled across two gadgets I created printed right next to the Sonic Screwdriver and Psychic Paper !
Wow !
I created the “ Engineer ’s Mate ” and the “ Engram Eraser ” , both shown below .
Click the image to enlarge .
I created these gadgets for an earlier draft of the rules , so some of the stats have changed since I came up with the concepts .
However , the gadget name , traits , and purpose remain the same .
My compliments to whoever wrote the descriptive paragraph .
They did a great job taking the idea and explaining it succinctly and effectively .
Nicely done !
You ca n’t tell from this scan , but each gadget on the page below is perforated so you can pop them out of the page !
So cool !
TRAITS
One of the areas we provided lots of feedback and suggestions on was “ Traits ” .
I ’ve noticed looking over the new box set that several of the “ Traits ” we suggested have been incorporated .
Now it ’s quite possible that several other playtesters suggested the same particular “ Traits ” that we did , so I ’m not claiming that we ’re solely responsible for these .
“ Traits ” we suggested that appear in the final game include : Sense of Direction , Animal Friendship , Owed Favour , Unattractive , Owes Favour , Argumentative , Dark Secret , Impulsive , and Selfish .
Again , my compliments to whoever wrote the lengthy descriptions for each of these .
We just shared a germ of an idea from a game mechanic perspective , whereas someone at Cubicle 7 beautifully wrapped explanations and examples around it .
That ’s it for now .
I ’m going to take a deep - dive into these books and savor every detail !
In fact , I may be so wrapped up in this game that I fail to post here for a few days .

+ Rovers Home Spotlight On Mars - Image Second Extrication Drive Yields Slight Progress
Image and Caption
Spirit successfully completed the first step of its planned two - step motion on Sol 2090 ( Nov. 19 ) .
After spinning the wheels for the equivalent of 2.5 meters ( 8.2 feet ) in the forward direction , the center of the rover moved approximately 12 millimeters ( 0.5 inch ) forward , 7 millimeters ( 0.3 inch ) to the left and about 4 millimeters ( 0.2 inch ) down .
The rover tilt changed by about 0.1 degree .
Small forward motion was observed with the non-operable right front wheel , and the left front wheel showed indications of climbing , despite the center of the rover moving downward .
These motions are too small to establish any trends at this time .
The drive plan had imposed a limit of 1 centimeter ( 0.4 inch ) motion in any direction .
The second step of the drive was not performed , because Spirit calculated it had exceeded that limit .
The data downlink volume from the rover was much better than expected , with all drive - related imagery being received .
The team is continuing to analyze results from the drive .

More than three - quarters of the nation ’s 17 - to 24 - year - olds could n't serve in the military , even if they wanted to .
They 're too fat , too sickly , too dumb , have too many kids , or have copped to using illegal drugs .
The armed services are willing to grant waivers for some of those conditions - asthma , or a little bit of weed .
But the military 's biggest concern is how big and how weak its potential recruits have become .
" The major component of this is obesity , " Curt Gilroy , the Pentagon ’s director of accessions , tells * Army Times '* William McMichael .
" Kids are just not able to do push - ups ...
And they ca n’t do pull - ups .
And they ca n’t run . ”
23 percent of 18 - to 34 - year - old are now obese , up from just six percent in 1987 .
The group of potential enlistees is further slimmed by the “ propensity to serve ” among American youths , which social scientists say also is declining .
According to Gilroy , research shows that about 12 percent of all U.S. military - eligible youth show an interest in military service .
The military just had a big recruiting year .
But as the economy improves , and the war in Afghanistan drags on , it 's going to be tough to rely on such a tiny sliver of America 's youth to maintain an all - volunteer force .
Either the recruiting standards have to change – maybe the military 's new Cyber Command does n't need guys who can do a bunch of pull - ups .
Or the recruits themselves have to .

PHNOM PENH , Cambodia —
When the former Khmer Rouge prison chief , Kaing Ghek Eav , first took the stand eight months ago , most Cambodians had scarce knowledge of the tribunal that was trying him .
The notorious man — known best by his revolutionary name , Duch — stands accused of crimes against humanity for the medieval torture of 14,000 people at a secret prison code - named S - 21 during the Khmer Rouge 's reign from 1975 to 1979 .
At first , 85 percent of Cambodians “ had little or no knowledge ” of the U.N. - backed trial that was 30 years in the making , according to a University of California at Berkeley ’s Human Rights Center survey .
Outreach has stepped up considerably since the opening of testimony , though .
Perhaps no development has been more effective in disseminating the often - baffling work of the tribunal than a new weekly television program .
In a country of 14 million , where 85 percent of people live in rural areas , some 2 million Cambodians are tuning in to “ Duch on Trial . ”
Every Monday afternoon , along with fellow Cambodian journalist , Ung Chan Sophea , host Neth Pheaktra provides a sober summary and analysis of court testimony and the legal framework in which it is heard .
Local analysts weigh in on the use of legal strategies by the lawyers and Duch .
“ My relatives tell me , ‘ You look so serious on TV , ' ” said Neth , whose program launched in April with British and U.S. funding .
“ We ’re discussing the death of millions of compatriots , including many of my relatives , so it ’s not a time to smile . ”
The show plays clips of court testimony , including ghastly stories of men and women being bludgeoned , water - boarded and electrocuted before their execution , and of their babies being smashed against trees .
In total , an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died from overwork , starvation and murder under the Khmer Rouge ’s maniacal vision to transform the country into an agrarian utopia .
For the some 5 million Cambodians who survived Khmer Rouge rule , the regime ’s brutality remains deeply entrenched in their psyche .
Today , not even half the country 's more than 14 million people are over 20 years old , which means they never lived under the regime .
Their ignorance of firsthand atrocities has been compounded by the fact that , until this year , Khmer Rouge history was n’t taught in schools .
Many current government officials are former Khmer Rouge cadres and the subject matter remains highly controversial .
Unlike some other international war crimes courts , the Khmer Rouge tribunal has n't had community - based truth and reconciliation committees to extend its reach to the population .
The hosts of " Duch on Trial " explain how the court is run by Cambodian and international judges , lawyers and staff .
How subordinates and prisoners who were under Duch ’s control and are still alive today provided testimony , and how the maximum penalty for the five elderly former leaders in detention is to live out their few remaining years in prison .
For many viewers , such plain talk concentrated into engaging 24 - minute episodes lets them grasp the court ’s work for the first time .
“ Part of the reason for the show ’s popularity is that before there was a big lack of communication about the tribunal , ” said Neth .
“ So we ’re trying to help fix that . ”
The challenge , said Matthew Robinson , the show ’s British producer and head of Khmer Mekong Films , “ is how to cram into less than half an hour the highlights of a week ’s worth of the trial that a group of not legally - sophisticated people can relate to . ”
Previously , the bulk of outreach for the tribunal had been shouldered by a handful of NGOs , such as the Documentation Center of Cambodia ( DC - Cam ) , the leading custodian of primary documents on the Khmer Rouge .
Through this non-profit group , 10,000 rural Cambodians have been bussed into Phnom Penh to attend the tribunal and 300,000 textbooks about the Khmer Rouge have been distributed to high school classrooms across the country .
The group also makes regular trips to the countryside , assisting people in filling out paperwork to file evidence to the tribunal of crimes they witnessed under the regime ’s rule and , perhaps more importantly , helping people simply gain closure by gathering details on the fate of loved ones .
For a man whose sister was tortured and executed at S - 21 , where Duch presided , DC - Cam recently tracked down the order of execution signed by Duch .
The man ’s reason for filing with the court : “ So that she is remembered , ” he wrote .
“ The Khmer Rouge left the entire country shattered , ” said DC - Cam director Youk Chhang .
“ We ’re trying to help people connect the broken pieces , and without people ’s involvement the court is meaningless . ”
The court ’s own outreach has also been reinvigorated .
Since June , hearings that were previously attended by scant crowds of a couple dozen people began to see audiences numbering in the hundreds .
Reach Sambath , whose takeover of public affairs at the court coincided with this boom , attributed some part of the rising numbers to the nature of dialogue in the courtroom .
The stories of real witnesses caught the attention of lay people , who found the early procedural hearings hard to follow .
“ The testimony was very emotional , ” said Reach .
“ Duch cried .
Then the witnesses cried .
Then the audience cried .
And then I cried .
Seeing this is part of the healing process . ”
Reach also initiated announcements about the court on local radio stations — a move that had his office inundated with phone calls asking how to attend .
“ Before it was difficult for people to have trust in the court , ” he says .
“ But if seeing is believing , then coming to the court in person has people feeling that justice is being provided . ”
While such emotionally charged moments provided the catharsis the tribunal wanted to stage , in a country where some 90 percent of the population regularly views television — despite enormous poverty — the tube has proven the most efficient channel for engaging people in the war crimes court .
“ It ’s easy and interesting to learn about the tribunal this way , ” said 51 - year - old No Min , who lives in a remote village in the province of Kampong Cham where road access is limited and newspapers are scarce .
“ I ’ve learned more about the [ court ’s ] process and it seems fair . ”
“ I tell the younger kids in the village to come watch the show with me so they can learn about an important part of history that is easy to want to forget . ”

[ Trigger warning . ]
Frequently , I receive requests to provide a definition of the term “ rape culture . ”
I ’ve referred people to the Wikipedia entry on rape culture , which is pretty good , and I like the definition provided in Transforming a Rape Culture :
A rape culture is a complex of beliefs that encourages male sexual aggression and supports violence against women .
It is a society where violence is seen as sexy and sexuality as violent .
In a rape culture , women perceive a continuum of threatened violence that ranges from sexual remarks to sexual touching to rape itself .
A rape culture condones physical and emotional terrorism against women as the norm .
In a rape culture both men and women assume that sexual violence is a fact of life , inevitable as death or taxes .
This violence , however , is neither biologically nor divinely ordained .
Much of what we accept as inevitable is in fact the expression of values and attitudes that can change .
But my correspondents — whether they are dewy noobs just coming to feminism , advanced feminists looking for a source , or disbelievers in the existence of the rape culture — always seem to be looking for something more comprehensive and less abstract :
What is the rape culture ?
What are its borders ?
What does it look like and sound like and feel like ?
It is not a definition for which they ’re looking ; not really .
It ’s a description .
It ’s something substantive enough to reach out and touch , in all its ugly , heaving , menacing grotesquery .
Rape culture is encouraging male sexual aggression .
Rape culture is regarding violence as sexy and sexuality as violent .
Rape culture is treating rape as a compliment , as the unbridled passion stirred in a healthy man by a beautiful woman , making irresistible the urge to rip open her bodice or slam her against a wall , or a wrought - iron fence , or a car hood , or pull her by her hair , or shove her onto a bed , or any one of a million other images of fight - fucking in movies and television shows and on the covers of romance novels that convey violent urges are inextricably linked with ( straight ) sexuality .
Rape culture is treating straight sexuality as the norm .
Rape culture is lumping queer sexuality into nonconsensual sexual practices like pedophilia and bestiality .

Rape culture is encouraging men to use the language of rape to establish dominance over one another ( “ I ’ll make you my bitch ” ) .

Rape culture is a serial rapist being appointed to a federal panel that makes decisions regarding women ’s health .
Rape culture is a ruling that says women cannot withdraw consent once sex commences .
Rape culture is a collective understanding about classifications of rapists :
The “ normal ” rapist ( whose crime is most likely to be dismissed with a “ boys will be boys ” sort of jocular apologia ) is the man who forces himself on attractive women , women his age in fine health and form , whose crime is disturbingly understandable to his male defenders .
The “ real sickos ” are the men who go after children , old ladies , the disabled , accident victims languishing in comas — the sort of people who ca n’t fight back , whose rape is difficult to imagine as titillating , unlike the rape of “ pretty girls , ” so easily cast in a fight - fuck fantasy of squealing and squirming and eventual relenting to the “ flattery ” of being raped .

Rape culture is pervasive insistence that false reports are common , although they are less common ( 1.6 % ) than false reports of auto theft ( 2.6 % ) .
Rape culture is pervasive claims that women make rape accusations willy - nilly , when 61 % of rapes remain unreported .
Rape culture is the pervasive narrative that there is a “ typical ” way to behave after being raped , instead of the acknowledgment that responses to rape are as varied as its victims , that , immediately following a rape , some women go into shock ; some are lucid ; some are angry ; some are ashamed ; some are stoic ; some are erratic ; some want to report it ; some do n’t ; some will act out ; some will crawl inside themselves ; some will have healthy sex lives ; some never will again .
Rape culture is the pervasive narrative that a rape victim who reports hir rape is readily believed and well - supported , instead of acknowledging that reporting a rape is a huge personal investment , a difficult process that can be embarrassing , shameful , hurtful , frustrating , and too often unfulfilling .
Rape culture is ignoring that there is very little incentive to report a rape ; it ’s a terrible experience with a small likelihood of seeing justice served .

That ’s hardly everything .
It ’s merely the tip of an unfathomable iceberg .

Allah was kind to Dubai yesterday .
Just when the emirate 's unspeakable wealth appeared on the point of collapse – stock markets , of course , naturally ' trembled ' – along came the feast of Eid al - Adha and sent all the kings and emirs and sheikhs off to their diwans to celebrate the decision by the father of monotheism – the Prophet Ibrahim himself – not to kill his son Ismail .
But then again , Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid al - Makhtoum , knew that the week - long holiday in Dubai would close down the local markets even if it could n't stifle the rumours .
Among the latter came the old canard that Sheikh Mohamed will have to hand over his immensely profitable Emirates Airlines to his Abu Dhabi cousin , the ever - beneficent Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan al - Nahyan , who seems to spend much of his time bailing out Dubai 's outrageous tourist and oligarchical ambitions .
Indeed , Dubai may have the tallest tower in the world and the largest man-made island but it would help if it paid off the Japanese company that has just built the emirate 's first metro system – even if trains to the airport cannot carry passenger baggage .
There are , however , two basic truths about Dubai which , predictably , have not found their way into market speculation or newspaper analysis .
The first is that Dubai may soon find itself a satellite not of its Abu Dhabi capital but of India .
The biggest merchants in Dubai are Indian – they run the gold market , even the bookshops in Sheikh Mohamed 's playpen – and west India is only two hours ' flying time away .
In fact , until 1962 – and you have to be an oldie to understand the emirates ' economic world – the Indian rupee was the currency for most of the Gulf , including even Kuwait .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sheikh Mohamed 's angry dismissal of his three top executives a week ago will not change this , although it might curb those who took too much advantage of the Dubai boom .
The ruler may indeed have to reflect upon the future of Emirates , not to mention the invalid Dubai World , if he is to appease his friendly cousin up the road in Abu Dhabi , but in the end the emirs all know that Dubai – like the US and British banks that crashed so spectacularly this year – is too big to abandon .
If Dubai World really defaults , then the rating agencies will start downgrading the whole shebang and the sheikhs and financial elite of the UAE will find it hard to get money .
There 's always been a cosy relationship , of course , between haughty , starchy old Abu Dhabi and playboy Dubai .
Sheikh Mohamed likes tourism and foreigners and racehorses and even the Russian oligarchs whose henchmen apparently fought a gun battle in the world 's tallest building a few months ago .
Abu Dhabi , holder of the world 's sixth largest crude oil reserves , believes in industry and art , occasionally poking gentle fun at its bling emirate to the east ; the creation of Ettihad Airlines – ever expanding in the face of Emirates Airlines ' success – was both a joke and a warning .
But deep in their golden mosques , the ruling family are asking themselves some serious questions this Islamic holiday .
Why was the call for a moratorium on debt so crudely and unprofessionally put together ?
As one fine source – Independent readers must take on trust how high up the ladder he is , but he should have known of this announcement and did n't – said privately last night : " It came as a shock and a surprise to everybody , not only to me but to anyone I know .
All the information I had till yesterday was that everything was in hand .
We had the finding for everything coming due this year – there was the $ 10 billion [ £ 6 million ] issued back in February and then nearly $ 8 billion over the past month – the money 's there .
" So it 's a puzzle , particularly since it was very clear , to people who knew , that the bond coming due in December was a litmus test .
Everyone was planning to repay it .
The people of Abu Dhabi did n't know this was going to happen .
The market did not expect anything like this . "
Too true .
If Dubai World and all the other conglomerates symbolising Dubai were already in the process of being restructured , why Wednesday 's extraordinary statement ?
There was talk in Dubai last night of a " Diwan revolution " although you'd think this had commenced when Sheikh Mohamed started ditching his top guys seven days ago .
As one financial journalist in the Gulf put it : " To get a six - month standstill on payments for creditors , you can't just announce it before you 've talked to them .
They 're not going to get the creditors to accept this in a couple of weeks . "
Unless , of course , Sheikh Mohamed planned the whole fandango with Sheikh Khalifa .
Unlikely , since Dubai 's decision to allow foreigners to buy property in the emirate was taken without any reference to the nation 's laws – or warning to Abu Dhabi .
Or , rather than worrying about London and Tokyo , perhaps we should be watching the Indian stock market ...

Fact of the Day More Information Partially due to a history based on tolerance , Amsterdam is known for its acceptance of else - where - illegal recreational / medicinal drugs such as marijuana , psilocybin mushrooms , herbal ecstasy , etc .
An atmosphere like this only naturally goes hand in hand with more extravagant behavior than say the prudish puritan beginnings of a country like the United States .
One of the major problems resulting from Holland 's tolerance is public urination .
Legal for some time , people finally started to become fed up with the act recently .
Being as common as it was , making it illegal would make no dent into solving the problem .
Instead , the city appeased its leakers ' demands by installing urinals and stalls right out in the open on the sidewalk .
Outdoor stall where the drain is an incline into the canal :
Outdoor four - person freestanding urinal :
Women who like privacy and a toilet seat still need to go indoors , and sometimes even have to pay to use the bathroom .

Adobe today launched a prerelease version of Flash Player 10.1 for Windows , Mac , and Linux , an early step in the company 's effort to bring an integrated media experience to a wide variety of devices and platforms from desktops to smartphones .
Among the improvements available in the prerelease version are support for multi- touch and gestures , as well as local microphone access .
Unfortunately , one of the most significant improvements of Flash Player 10.1 , hardware - accelerated decoding of H.264 video , is presently only available in the Windows version .
According to the release notes for Flash Player 10.1 , the feature is unavailable on Mac OS X due to a lack of access to the programming interfaces needed to deploy it .
In Flash Player 10.1 , H.264 hardware acceleration is not supported under Linux and Mac OS .
Linux currently lacks a developed standard API that supports H.264 hardware video decoding , and Mac OS X does not expose access to the required APIs .
We will continue to evaluate adding the feature to Linux and Mac OS in future releases .
In an early review of Flash Player 10.1 , however , Anandtech still found significant improvements in CPU utilization under Mac OS X , dropping from 450 % CPU load to 190 % in viewing full - screen Hulu content on the Mac Pro used for testing .
Going from roughly 450 % down to 190 % ( or a bit over 10 % of total CPU utilization across 16 threads ) made full - screen Hulu playable on my machine .
In the past I always had to run it in a smaller window , but thanks to Flash 10.1 I do n't have to any longer .
With actual GPU - accelerated H.264 decoding I 'm guessing those CPU utilization numbers could drop to a remotely reasonable value .
But it 's up to Apple to expose the appropriate hooks to allow Adobe to ( eventually ) enable that functionality .
Until then , even OS X users have something to look forward to with the Flash 10.1 upgrade .
Additional information on the features of Flash Player 10.1 , including several video demos and interviews , can be found on Adobe 's site .
PinchMedia who provides the analytics for the application breaks down customer usage including what specific devices are being used .
This list of devices is reported to developers using internal device identification numbers assigned by Apple .
In this case , " iPhone3, 1 " was first spotted in Pandav 's usage logs in November .
The developer of iBart ( a transit application for San Francisco ) had apparently a very nice surprise today .
While consulting his Pinchmedia report he discovered that his app has been installed and used on an device that identifies itself as " iPhone 3.1 " : The latest iPhone , the 3GS identifies itself as " iPhone 2.1 " so apparently the new iPhone model would be undergoing real life tests in the San Francisco area .
All of this is not really surprising actually , the 3GS model was also first spotted online around november 2008 and we already saw references to the new model in Apple 's iPhone firmware .
I 'm personally hoping that it will feature a shaver and the latest ARM dual - core processors ... you ?
[ Update ]
One of our commenters ( Who would apparently be Saurik , Cydia 's creator ) is pointing out an interesting fact :
It is actually possible to " fake " your device identifier by jailbreaking your iPhone and changing the system files .
Also , do n't get excited about the picture , it 's a fake of course .
Would this just be a hoax ?

In the 10 + years since the iMac was born as Apple 's simple computer , it 's become visibly less of a computer and more of a display .
And what a screen this new iMac has .
Advertisement
But First , Simplicity
This 1998 ad has Jeff Goldblum narrating that there are two physical steps to setting up an iMac .
( " There 's no step three ! " )
Truthfully , they skipped the mouse and keyboard cable , though , which would bring it to 4 steps .
Today , an iMac is set up using just one power cable , depending on wireless networking and bluetooth peripherals to get the rest done .
So it 's even simpler than it was 10 years ago .
And as I said , the screen is becoming more prominent than ever .

The LCD
The 27 - inch iMac 's screen is the thing to focus on in this revision .
It is practically as bright ( and more contrasty ) than any of the previous iMacs — even Cinema Displays — and it looks astounding .
It 's LED - driven so it comes to full luminescence immediately and takes up less power .
It also has better side - to - side viewing angle as an IPS tech monitor ; like the iMac 24 before it , it goes 178 degrees without much change in color accuracy or brightness .
And here 's the kicker :
Although it has 19 % more area of LCD than the old 24 - incher , it has 60 % more pixels .
That makes it more pixel dense than any of the Cinema Displays at 109 ppi .
And with a 2560x1440 resolution it has 90 % of the dot count of a 30 - inch cinema display .
All these stats are great .
They sound great , and they make for a powerful picture .
But the actual view of the screen leaves me with a positive — but slightly imperfect — impression .

The default brightness is a bit much , but of course you can turn it down .
And the contrast is welcome ; even my new 13 - inch MacBook Pro looks yellowed and washed out next to it .
But at this pixel density , which is sharper than my notebook , it 's almost too sharp , requiring me to sit closer than I would ordinarily do with a 27 inch display .
I like the feeling of crispness — 16 % crisper than the last generation .
But my eyes feel like the pictures are being delivered by a land shark holding a laser pointer straight into my corneas , and I can feel the strain within minutes .
I would have to jack up as many font sizes as possible or sit as close as I do to my MacBook to make it work for long long periods of time .
Maybe I 'm just a wimp of a geek , but I 've never been sensitive to these sorts of things on any sort of machinery before .
Advertisement
This is the iMac next to a 13 - inch MBP and a Dell 2407 24 - inch monitor .
The iMac 's screen puts both to shame in brightness and clarity .
Apple is making a big deal of the fact this screen is 16:9 .
I think it looks better in this wider iteration , but it 's not an epic jump since the last gen was 16:10 .
You 're losing vertical pixel count here , on both the 21.5 and 27 - inch models , despite added diagonal inches .
Also , the glass cover is now edge to edge , without the thin silver rim around it , on the top and sides .
It 's still glossy and very very reflective , despite being covered in anti-reflective coating .
Advertisement
I will feel guilty for mentioning this , because it 's ever so slight , but I 'll feel more guilty if I do n't mentioning it to you :
The screen , when it 's white , has the tiniest bit of blotchiness to it .
The backlighting is slightly uneven in my model .
It had no impact on viewing quality once the screen was filled with an image other than one of pure white , so do n't sweat it .
My previous comparison to the 30 - inch Cinema Display was n't for academic purposes , either .
One of the most interesting features on the new iMac is that it can use its Mini DisplayPort ( normally an output ) as an input ; that is , it can become a secondary display for notebooks or other devices .
Factor in the near - identical specs to the 30 - inch Cinema Display , most notably its updated LED screen , and you have absolutely no reason to buy a 30 - inch Cinema Display when you can have this — but not just yet .

That 's what two full sized 1080 p trailers look like on this screen .
Eager to test this shit and be the first to the internet with an image of an Xbox linked into an iMac ( " Worlds collide ! " would be the headline , I decided ) , I ordered a monoprice Mini- Display Port - to - HDMI adapter .
Unfortunately , I discovered that the inputs would not work with a PS3 or Xbox at any res , HD or otherwise .
The current adapters on the market are unidirectional , I was told , and so they wo n't work to take HDMI sources and pipe them into the iMac .
I 'm sure someone is making a cable as we speak for this very abominable purpose of piping in Microsoft gaming to a desktop Mac — but it 's not here yet .
( New cables , by the way , will include audio , which the iMac is capable of taking through its connector and the iMac is able to display video sources up to its native resolution . )
The issue is , this could take months .
That 's a long time , so do n't buy an iMac planning to use it with a gaming console or Blu-ray player right away .
Advertisement
Using it with a laptop was an interesting situation .
Odd , for sure , but a welcome bonus and an obvious use .
Here 's how it works .
You plug in a Mini- Display Port - to - Mini - Display Port cable to the iMac , which must be turned on ( unlike Sony 's all - in - one , which works while off . )
The iMac flickers for a second and the laptop 's picture replaces the iMac's .
Here 's where it gets sort of weird .
When the iMac is acting as a monitor , the keyboard and mouse are all blocked from working , except a few keys :
The pause / play , FF , RR , volume controls and brightness keys all work .
They wo n't display the typical volume / brightness / FF / whatever iconography , because you 're actually still looking at your MacBook .
You can actually then use your iMac as a display for one computer while listening to music on another — but why would you want to ?
And if you were playing a game with an Xbox , you 'd be listening to the game .
To toggle between the iMac and the external source , you hit Command + F2 .

(* The 21.5 - inch iMac is not as sharp or impressive as the 27 , but a fine evolution nonetheless ; see chart )
Oh , one more thing :
The LED display is also thinner than the traditional panel .
Even so , when combined with the extra width and height , Apple 's designers are given adequate room to play with the layout and thermal properties of the iMac .
Which brings us to the chassis and internals .
Advertisement
The Chassis
Advertisement
The iMac 's chassis went from all plastic to aluminum and glass in 2007 .
The first aluminum models were stamped out in car factories because no computer factories could work with aluminum pieces that big .
Now , the iMac has even more aluminum in them with bigger cases and a seamless wraparound back made of metal instead of the black plastic cap .
Despite the loss of the slimming effect of a black plastic back , the computer 's dimensions work in its favor ; it 's about 1 mm thinner and obviously wider , so it still feels undoubtedly skinny .
Oh , and the stand is tapered by 1.1 mm on its front ( as is Apple 's wont ) , to further hide volume .
Advertisement
Aside from the more flattering aspect ratios , the chin — one of the only giveaways that this is not just a screen but a computer — has shrunk by 22 % .
It looks much better , in my opinion .
The case 's bigger size affects its internal layout , too .
Apple and iFixit brought several of these details to my attention .
Advertisement
The most important changes are that the GPU and CPU are placed at nearly opposite ends of the case , with their own heatsinks to throw off copious heat with three very quiet fans .
( The iMac 's sound profile at idle , for a stock build , is still just a whisper , less than 20db . )
Advertisement
Ports :
The back of the case has a Mini DisplayPort , 4 USB 2.0 ports , power plug ( the machine 's only wire ) , Firewire 800 , minijack / optical input and output , and Gigabit Ethernet .
There 's Bluetooth 2.1 EDR wireless with which the mouse and keyboard interface , and 802.11 N Wi-Fi .
Although the entire case is aluminum , the antenna has been cleverly hidden in a plastic Apple logo top center on the back .
Reception is a touch stronger than on my notebook .
The iChat camera and microphone ( the latter of which is made up of about a dozen closely - grouped pinprick holes , like on the MacBook Pro ) are situated on the top of the iMac .
And despite the new model 's height they sound fine ( if not a touch more distant because of the height ) when compared to previous models .
The top mount for the microphone keeps the sound from the new , more powerful two - way speakers from interfering with it ; measured using a song and SPL meter , my notebook came in at 70db and the iMac at 76db at sitting distance .
Louder , richer and noticeably so than a laptop , though I did n't have an iMac 24 on hand to compare with .
Advertisement
The larger case allows the iMac to use four sticks of user - serviceable RAM , accessible from the bottom .
( That 's useful futureproofing now that OS X Snow Leopard is shipping , and programs and the OS in 64 - bit can address more than 4GB at a time . )
How About Performance ?
The iMac I 'm testing is a 3.06 GHz Core2 Duo processor with 4GB of RAM and an ATI Radeon 4670 graphics .
Those are decent parts but not the highest - end quad - core i5 / i7 chips or ATI Radeon 4850 GPU that will ship in iMacs in November .
More importantly , the machine I have here that is shipping now is about on par with higher - end , custom - order machines from the last generation .
The system benchmarks I ran earlier this week indicate that everything performs practically the same .
And since we do n't have a Core i5 / i7 machine to work with , I 've included Apple 's approximations of how much boost the iMac will get from those parts — obviously , many grains of salt are necessary when reading , especially when measuring value of extra CPU cores as literal multipliers when most software still can't leverage those channels efficiently .
As for 3D , Maclife has some framerate scores from Doom 3 and Call of Duty that are not by any means exact but somewhat representative of the machine I 'm using today .
But again , the bottom line is that this machine that I have , shipping today , is not faster than machines equipped similarly from the last generation — they 're just cheaper for any given performance point .
Advertisement
But again , even if you wait for the higher end machines , there 's no guarantee you 'll be able to access most of that extra power .
Snow Leopard has n't seen many apps , besides the ones that ship with it that can take advantage of its multicore CPU and GPU technologies .
Programs will come , but immediate speed gains are n't guaranteed here if you buy the quad - core machines .

And yet , it could be their most important OS … Read more
Here 's an exception : Those Core i5 / i7 chips are also clocked slower than the Core 2 Duo chips on the lower - end machines , but have the ability to run single core applications at a greater clock speed .
Since all four cores wo n't be burning , the chip uses the spare electricity and the extra thermal overhead to dynamically and automatically overclock the core that is working :
The i5 chip goes from 2.66GHz to 3.2GHz and the 2.8GHz i7 chip goes to 3.46GHz ( with 4 cores that run hyperthreaded for up to 8 virtual cores . )
Advertisement
Sounds fast , but we 'll dive into deeper tests in November .
For now , you should be aware that if your desktop is less than 18 months old , you'd be somewhat silly to upgrade before the highest end chips from this generation of iMac are out .
What Else You Got ?

The iMac replaces its old mouse with the new Magic Mouse , with a multitouch surface and 360 degree scrolling and swiping , almost like the gestures you find on a Macbook trackpad .
I 've said it before : I primarily use Laptops because I love trackpads .
The gestures , fingertip precision and proximity to the keyboard make it a must have , and this mouse fixes some of those issues .
(* Jason Chen reviewed the mouse and liked it but it was not without flaws .
Read that if you 're considering buying an iMac , because it 's the only option Apple offers . )
I Love Trackpads !
Somewhere , as I transitioned from being a proud desktop user with parts scattered around my room , … Read more

The one detail I found problematic specifically with the Magic Mouse as it pertains to the 27 - inch iMac is that even when the pointer sensitivity is set to the highest level , a swipe of the wrist at a moderately fast speed goes only 2/3 across the giant pixel landscape .
Only by whipping my hand across my mouse pad can I trigger enough mouse acceleration to get across the screen .
They should turn up the sensitivity , frankly .
Software update please !
The keyboard is also changed , going from the old wired keyboard , which was stamped out of the screen cutout of the chassis , with a wireless Bluetooth model .
Apple states that the keyboard 's narrow profile makes it a better fit next to the mouse .
I think it also makes sense as a remote control for the computer from afar when watching media , since this is the biggest iMac ever that doubles as a monitor .
But it looks a little small and out of proportion with the machine itself , since the Mac got wider and the keyboard got shorter .
( Correction :
The keypad - less change happened last revision .
I just miss that numeric pad keyboard 's width from the first generation of Aluminum iMacs .
It seemed to fit perfectly . )
Advertisement
Oh , the white plastic remote that used to ship with all the laptops , AppleTV and iMacs has been replaced by an elliptical , aluminum remote with black rubber buttons .
It 's longer , and shaped like an iPod nano but no longer comes with the iMac .
It costs $ 19 .
I think when you buy a computer that is this expensive , they should THROW IN THE DAMN REMOTE .

Competitive Check
There are other all - in - ones from PC makers , but at the moment , none as large or high - res as the iMac 27 .
The ones from Sony ( like the L ) and HP have various extras like IR touchscreens , glowing monitor bodies , TV tuners and Blu-ray drives .
Some are pretty decent , like the Touchsmart we just reviewed .
If these things matter to you and you are not married to the Mac platform , you might consider them .
But that touchscreen functionality is still half - baked , so do n't do it for the groping potential .

Value
The sweet spot is the $ 1200 21.5 - inch config .
But do n't upgrade that model beyond base without seriously considering the big bad 27 - incher for $ 1700 .
And do n't upgrade that one at all without considering the quad - core models ; both look very promising at $ 2000 or $ 2200 .
Basically , the custom builds are not a great value until you get to the quads .
Go cheapest , 27 , or quad .
But cautious folks will wait on the quads ' til we test them .
Advertisement
There 's another angle here , too .
Again , comparing the 27 - inch iMac to the old as hell 30 - inch Cinema Display makes those standalone monitors look like a pretty bad value when it costs only $ 100 more for just 10 % more pixels — and , hey , it 's also not a computer .
Nerds , Sheathe Thy Wallet If You Can
Although the quad core benchmarks are n't here yet , I think you 've got enough information here to make an adult decision on whether to go cheap or double your price for something faster and bigger .
It 's not like those new chips will be slower .
But waiting a month on a new internal layout , design and screen is a great way to let Apple shake out whatever inevitable hiccups are there at the start of a new run .
Plus , if Snow - Leopard - specific apps make their way to market ( hello , < Handbrake ! ) and some performance scores come out in the meantime , hey , cool .

Some People OK With Obesity
Nearly one obese person in 10 feels no need to lose weight , a new study says .
Nov. 22 , 2009  --
Nearly one obese person in 10 feels no need to lose weight or prevent further weight gain , researchers found .
Most obese people with these body size misperceptions thought their health was above average and their lifetime cardiovascular and diabetes risk low , said Dr. Tiffany Powell of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and colleagues .
Their analysis of the Dallas Heart Study , reported at the American Heart Association meeting last week , suggested that physicians have a role in correcting these impressions .
" We ca n't necessarily just say you have to be comfortable with who you are , " Powell said .
" We have to really emphasize the direct link between obesity , risk factors , and cardiovascular disease . "
Obese individuals in the study who did n't think they needed to lose weight appeared not to be getting those messages .
They were much less likely than other obese individuals to have heard from any healthcare professional about diet ( 38 percent versus 64 percent ) , exercise ( 45 percent versus 66 percent ) , or losing weight ( 38 percent versus 68 percent ) .
Rather than trying to find and target patients with an unrealistic body image , physicians need to step up efforts to ensure that all patients understand their risk and what to do about it , she recommended .
Powell 's group analyzed the Dallas Heart Study , a representative population - based study of 6,101 residents of Dallas County ages 18 to 65 .
To measure body perception , the participants were asked to choose a silhouette on the gender - specific Stunkard figure - rating scale that they thought best represented how they looked , and also to select one that represented how they would ideally like to look .
Of the 2,056 individuals with a body mass index of 30 kg / m2 or greater , 266 -- or 8 percent -- reported an ideal body size that was greater than or equal to perceived body size .
Half of the individuals with these misperceptions thought they were in better health than most for their age , compared with 32 percent of those who knew they needed to lose weight .
They were also more likely than other obese people to think of themselves as low risk for heart attacks , diabetes , hypertension , and even obesity -- despite the fact that they already fell in that category .
" We have to help people understand that despite loving what you look like , if you are obese you are at risk , " Powell said .
" We walk a fine line in helping people understand the impact of obesity without making them feel bad about themselves . "
BOCA RATON , Florida ( Reuters ) - Corruption , whether in the form of crooked officials , financial fraudsters or even philandering sports stars , is tearing at the fabric of U.S. society and is the country ’s No. 1 criminal threat , a senior FBI agent said on Tuesday .

Addressing businessmen in Florida , where financial fraud cases jumped by 42 percent in the last year , FBI Miami Division Special Agent in Charge John Gillies said failures in personal ethics and integrity sowed the initial poisonous seeds of corruption in a society .
Gillies said transgressions by high - profile public servants and even perceived social role models , like top golfer Tiger Woods , currently embroiled in allegations that he had extramarital affairs , sent the signal to young Americans that cheating and stealing were acceptable .
“ Where do our children learn this ?
They see us , their elected officials , their sports stars , they see how they act and they figure , ‘ well it ’s OK , ’ ” he said , citing the case of Woods , whose early morning car accident in Florida last month triggered a storm of media questioning of his clean - living reputation .
“ Money ca n’t buy everything , ” Gillies said in a speech to the West Boca Chamber of Commerce in Boca Raton , Florida .
The special agent , who manages high - profile cases in Florida , the Caribbean and Latin America , in no way suggested Woods had committed any criminal offenses .
Florida police issued Woods a ticket for careless driving last week and said no criminal charges would be filed .
He quickly paid the $ 164 fine , his lawyer said .
Police also said no allegations of domestic violence were leveled .
Gillies , a 27 - year veteran of the FBI , called corruption in all its multiple forms , whether in law enforcement or in the judicial system , or involving tax cheats and fraudsters , “ our number one criminal threat ” in the United States .
“ It really gets at the soul and fabric of the United States when people are out there corrupting ... it all starts with simple ethics violations , ” Gillies said .
FOLLOW THE MONEY
He said public corruption investigations by the FBI were “ huge ” and had increased by more than 20 percent in the last five years , while financial scams -- from securities and hedge fund frauds to Ponzi schemes -- had jumped by more than 25 percent nationwide in the last year alone .
These cases involved hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars .
Florida in particular has been rocked by a number of high - profile Ponzi schemes this year , including fallout from the cases surrounding convicted Wall Street swindler Bernard Madoff and accused Texas financier Allen Stanford .
Gillies ’ FBI team last week arrested a flamboyant Fort Lauderdale attorney , Scott Rothstein , and charged him with bilking investors out of $ 1.2 billion in a Ponzi scheme that funded his luxury lifestyle and political largess .
Rothstein , now disbarred , has pleaded not guilty .
Asked why the “ Sunshine State ” of Florida appeared to be so increasingly prone to financial scams , Gillies told Reuters the concentration of money in the wealthy Southeast state was “ the number one ” factor .
He said a high concentration of out - of - state Americans and foreigners was also a factor .
In his speech , Gillies also cited the economic recession as a contributing feature , as many victims were -- often blindly , often out of greed -- seeking to improve returns on money and investments in hard financial times .
He said offers of 15 , 20 , 25 percent returns in a recession should be an automatic “ red flag ” of possible fraud .
For those frustrated by diminished earnings eroded by the crisis the FBI veteran offered the following caveat against temptation : “ The worst day at work is still better than the best day in jail . ”
The major digital TV switchover today in north - west England has coincided with a huge increase in dumped analogue TVs , environmental campaigners have revealed .
Figures from Cumbria county council , which administers a region of nearly half a million people , show that the number of TVs dumped at waste and recycling sites has risen by 70 % in the past year .
This year , the council has recycled 50,000 analogue TVs thrown away by households , of which 30,000 could have been upgraded to receive digital TV signals with a simple £ 20 set - top box .
Around 7 million viewers in Cumbria , Manchester , Liverpool and the rest of the Granada TV region had their analogue transmissions of BBC
Two switched off in the early hours of this morning .
BBC One , ITV1 , Channel 4 and Five will also be permanently switched off four weeks later on 2 December from households served by the Winter Hill transmitter .
Simon Birch , who is investigating the environmental impact of the digital switchover for Ethical Consumer magazine , said : " Digital UK is currently failing to tell the public of the environmental cost of throwing away their televisions .
If your existing television can be adapted to getting digital TV then do n't chuck it out but buy a digital set - top box – you 'll be doing the planet a favour as well as saving yourself money . "
The government 's Energy Saving Trust , which lists energy efficient electronic appliances , currently recommends 14 low - energy digital set - top boxes .
The most efficient option for anyone with an existing TV , it said , is to buy one of those recommended boxes .
However , the trust said that Ethical Consumer 's concerns about the " embodied energy " of old TVs – the carbon required to manufacture them – have to be balanced against energy running costs .
It added that a TV with a built - in digital tuner ( IDTV ) requires only one power supply and can save £ 7 and 20kg of carbon each year compared with an equivalent analogue TV combined with a set - top box .
A spokesperson from Digital UK , which is overseeing the digital switchover , said : " Viewers do not need to buy a new TV for switchover - virutally any set , even black and white models , can be converted using a digital set - top box .
This core messgae is included in leaflets sent to homes , in television advertising and on our website .
We recognise that some consumers may use switchover as an opportunity to upgrade their TV and dispose of analogue TV equipment sooner than they would otherwise have done .
Where they do , Digital UK encourages consumers to buy an IDTV and recycle any old equipment . "
Devon county council , which had a digital switchover this spring , saw a near doubling of dumped TVs between April and September , Ethical Consumer said .
Millions of TV viewers , including those in London , are yet to undergo the digital switchover , which is due to complete across the country in 2012 , freeing up valuable bandwidth for future high - definition broadcasts and other services .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Republicans boycotted a Senate committee hearing Tuesday on a major bill to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change .
Only one of the seven Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee -- Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio -- showed up for the panel 's opening session .
He left the meeting after delivering an opening statement .
Committee rules require at least two minority party members to be present to reach a working quorum .
However , an exception could allow the committee to proceed without any Republicans , according to committee staff members .
Matt Dempsey , a spokesman for the committee 's Republicans , told CNN that applying the exception would be a " nuclear option " by Democrats that would worsen the panel 's already strained political climate .
In his remarks , Voinovich asked the committee to hold off its debate until getting a full Environmental Protection Agency analysis of a bill that he said would affect every American .

The committee chairwoman , Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - California , responded that the panel has held dozens of hearings on the issue , and that she had taken the unprecedented step of scheduling a session with EPA experts later Tuesday to answer any questions by committee members .
Boxer also said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , has promised the full EPA analysis sought by Republicans before the bill comes before the entire Senate .
When the hearing proceeded , Voinovich left the room , leaving only Democratic members at the table .
Boxer said the panel would continue to meet , including the session with EPA experts later Tuesday .
" We 're going to just be here every day until they join us , " she said .
She also criticized the Republican boycott , saying , " The reason they give to not work on it just does n't hold up to the light of day in fairness and objectivity . "
The committee 's 12 - member Democratic majority ensures enough support to send the bill to the full Senate without any Republican support .
The House has already passed a similar bill , but Senate approval is considered a much tougher challenge for Democratic proponents of the " cap- and - trade " legislation that would contribute to reshaping the U.S. energy system .
CNN 's Lesa Jansen , Evan Glass and Tom Cohen contributed to this report .
Lt Adamson said the incident was " pretty terrifying " A British army officer who , after running out of ammunition , used his bayonet to charge a Taliban fighter has been awarded the Military Cross .
Lt James Adamson , who is 24 and serves with the Royal Regiment of Scotland , was given the medal for his " supreme physical courage " .
His actions while on tour in Afghanistan saved the lives of soldiers in his platoon .
He said he ran out of ammunition after killing one man , so charged the second .
Lt Adamson , who is from the Isle of Man , and part of the 5th Battalion , Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders , said : " To be honest it was pretty terrifying .
" I think more so after the event - as it was going on there was fractions of a second between the first guy and the second guy .
The Military Cross is awarded in recognition of exemplary gallantry " By the time I realised the danger was there , it was already gone .
" It was the kind of the two or three minutes after that , where myself and Corporal Hamilton were still on our own - just waiting for the reserve section to echelon through and pick us up - that we were pretty convinced that if there were two there , there could have been more .
" So we were there waiting for the rest to turn up and I think that was probably the longest two minutes of my life . "
The citation for Lt Adamson 's award - as detailed on the MoD website - reads : " Adamson ' supreme physical courage , combined with the calm leadership he continued to display after a very close encounter with the Taliban , were of the very highest order .
" His actions also neutralised an enemy flanking attack which could have resulted in casualties for his platoon . "

Editors Note :
This story is the result of a two - year CNN investigative report into peace talks held between the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group ( LIFG ) and the Libyan Government which recently culminated in the LIFG , a militant jihadist group once close to Osama bin Laden , repudiating al Qaeda .
" The Jihadi Code , " a documentary on the breakthrough against al Qaeda in Libya , airs on November 15 at 1200 GMT .
Tripoli , Libya ( CNN ) --
From within Libya 's most secure jail a new challenge to al Qaeda is emerging .
Leaders of one of the world 's most effective jihadist organizations , the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group ( LIFG ) , have written a new " code " for jihad .
The LIFG says it now views the armed struggle it waged against Col.
Moammar Gadhafi 's regime for two decades as illegal under Islamic law .
The new code , a 417 - page religious document entitled " Corrective Studies " is the result of more than two years of intense and secret talks between the leaders of the LIFG and Libyan security officials .
The code 's most direct challenge to al Qaeda is this : " Jihad has ethics and morals because it is for God .
That means it is forbidden to kill women , children , elderly people , priests , messengers , traders and the like .
Betrayal is prohibited and it is vital to keep promises and treat prisoners of war in a good way .
Standing by those ethics is what distinguishes Muslims ' jihad from the wars of other nations . "
The code has been circulated among some of the most respected religious scholars in the Middle East and has been given widespread backing .
It is being debated by politicians in the U.S. and studied by western intelligence agencies .
In essence the new code for jihad is exactly what the West has been waiting for : a credible challenge from within jihadist ranks to al Qaeda 's ideology .
While the code states that jihad is permissible if Muslim lands are invaded -- citing the cases of Afghanistan , Iraq and Palestine -- the guidelines it sets down for when and how jihad should be fought , and its insistence that civilians should not be targeted are a clear rebuke to the goals and tactics of bin Laden 's terrorist network .
CNN was given exclusive access to the Abu Salim jail where the code was written to talk to the LIFG prisoners .
The jail has a bloody reputation ; in 1996 prison guards put down a revolt by allegedly killing more than 1,200 prisoners in less than 24 hours .
Read how CNN got inside the prison
We also had exclusive access to the story behind the new code from two of its principle architects .
When Saif al Islam al Gadhafi , the son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , decided he wanted to open a dialogue with the LIFG he needed to convince them he was genuine so he sought out a former LIFG commander Noman Benotman , who was living in London .
The younger Gadhafi convinced Benotman he would free LIFG members from jail if they renounced their long war with the regime .
He promised Benotman immunity from prosecution and in January 2007 flew him back to Libya to meet with the LIFG leaders in the high - security Abu Salim jail .
Benotman and the other leaders in the LIFG had fought together in Afghanistan in the early 1990s helping the Afghan Mujahedeen overthrow the Soviet - backed government in Kabul .
During those years they 'd come to know bin Laden and many other of al Qaeda leaders .
Although they 'd been brothers in arms with bin Laden , the LIFG never merged its operations with al Qaeda due to differences in approach .
In particular the Libyan group never endorsed bin Laden 's global jihad , preferring to concentrate their attention on overthrowing the Gadhafi regime and replacing it with an Islamic state .
From the mid-1990s the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group 's Afghan - trained fighters waged a fierce insurgency against the Libyan regime .
In a face - to - face meeting in 2000 Benotman warned bin Laden not to attack the United States because any gains would be outweighed by the inevitable retribution , and undermine his group 's efforts in Libya .
By then Libyan security services had arrested many of the group 's fighters in Libya .
Despite their differences bin Laden respected the LIFG 's leadership .
Indeed , according to Benotman , in the years before 9/11 , bin Laden wanted to use the LIFG 's extensive global network for his own ends but the group refused to put its assets at al Qaeda 's disposal .
When Benotman met with the LIFG leaders in January 2007 it was the first time they 'd seen him in years .
Some had been in jail for more than a decade .
Others were captured in the international dragnet for jihadists thrown out by security services in the wake of 9/11 .
They agreed to consider Saif al Islam 's proposal but had demands of their own .
They wanted greater freedoms in jail , the right to consult with their rank and file membership , access to religious research books and more .
Over time and many meetings the security officials granted most of their demands .
Saif al Islam was motivated not just to bring a formal end to the civil war but to put a stop to al Qaeda 's growing influence in Libya .
As recently as 2006 al Qaeda documents captured by U.S. forces in Iraq showed per capita more Libyans than any other Arab nation were joining al Qaeda 's fight .
The regime 's fear was that they 'd bring their fight back to Libya .
In late 2007 as Benotman , the LIFG leadership and Libya 's security officials debated the way forward al Qaeda tried to derail the peace process .
Bin Laden 's deputy Ayman al Zawahiri issued a statement declaring the LIFG had joined al Qaeda .
Benotman fired back an open letter to Zawahiri questioning his credibility .
" I questioned their idea of jihad ... directly you know .
This is crazy , it is not Islamic and it's against the Sunni understanding of Islam , " Benotman told CNN .
Zawahiri chose not to respond .
As late as this August Zawahiri 's video statements included praise of LIFG leaders , in what may have been a desperate attempt to head off the condemnation he could see coming .
Even so progress in the jail was slow .
In April 2009 the talks were nearly derailed when Ibn Sheikh al Libi , a prominent jihadist was found hanged in his prison cell .
According to sources familiar with the talks , Saif al Islam feared his death , which some LIFG members considered suspicious , could put the whole process in jeopardy .
He put pressure on prison officials to meet the LIFG 's remaining demands , giving them greater freedom to consult with the rank and file .
That led the LIFG to start writing their Revisons .
In July 2009 the peace process received a boost when 30 LIFG members living in the UK , some of them senior figures in the group , signed on .
The group 's UK members , some of whom were under British government Control Orders because they potentially posed a danger to UK national security , had previously been openly skeptical of the talks .
In September the new code , the " Corrective Studies " , was completed , resulting in scores of lower and mid-level LIFG members being freed .
Moammar Gadhafi's son says the group 's leaders will be released at some point in the future , and will be encouraged to educate and dissuade Libya 's youth from going off to fight with al Qaeda .
According to Libyan sources , the British domestic intelligence agency MI5 passed on the Revisions document , after it was published , to a number of individuals subject to Control Orders in the UK .
Those sources say the peace process led to Control Orders being dropped against 11 members of the group living in the UK , leaving only one Libyan subject to the restrictions .
The process initiated in Tripoli appears to have directly made the West safer .
In their new code for Jihadists , LIFG 's leaders made it clear that battling extremism will be challenging .
" We have written this book knowing full well that the old motives and ideas which made us take up the armed struggle in the past are still to be found in the hearts and minds of many young Muslims today , " they wrote .
" We know there are many issues that might lead them to take the same path ; that 's why we are offering our advice and guidance to these brothers . "
Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al Qaeda , the LIFG 's about face may be an important step toward staunching al Qaeda 's recruitment .

( ifoAppleStore ) Within two weeks , Apple stores will begin retiring their current Windows CE - based portable computers and start using a custom - designed and crafted iPod touch to check out customers .
AppleInsider has a first look at the new system .
Those who have seen the system for processing credit card , debit card and cash purchases , dubbed " EasyPay touch , " said it combines iPod touch features with a magnetic stripe reader , advanced barcode scanner and Apple - written software to speed plastic and cash transactions .
Perhaps more significantly , the change to an iPod touch and Apple software will bring the entire point - of - sale ( POS ) system under Apple 's control .
In addition , the system will have the added benefit of advertising the usefulness of the iPod touch to customers who see it being used right in front of them .
It is unknown which manufacturer partnered with Apple to create the new device .
The outside shell resembles many of the protective cases sold at the Apple stores , while the back of the shell resembles several of the auxiliary battery packs sold for the iPhone .
In April , AppleInsider first reported that Apple would replace its Pocket PC - based EasyPay devices with the iPod touch , thanks to new accessory support in the iPhone 3.0 software .
New system aims to improve
The current portable computers are made by Symbol Technologies Inc. and run Windows CE , linked to Apple 's servers via Wi -Fi .
They were introduced just before the holiday buying season in 2005 , and allow any employee to act as a cashier , eliminating the traditional cash register positions that are common at other retailers .
But the system has drawn complaints from employees about software crashes , sluggish operation and the need to frequently reboot .
Customers have also complained about Apple 's check - out method , saying that it 's confusing to make a purchase without a conspicuous , well - identified POS counter or waiting line .
Employees at the two just - opened Microsoft retail stores also use a portable POS computer made by Samsung , with an attached card reader and a separate barcode scanner .
The Microsoft solution is about four times larger than an iPod touch and weighs five times as much .
Apple 's new EasyPay touch system uses the touchscreen interface to access nearly every feature a salesperson would need to help a customer , including purchases with credit and debit cards , cash and making returns .
There are numerous shortcuts available within the software , including pull - down menus and " flickable " lists .
Apple 's solution consists of a hard plastic , two - piece slip - on shell with a grip texture .
The magstripe reader is tucked onto the back of the shell , and the barcode scanner is installed within the top of the device .
Hidden inside the shell is a rechargeable battery to power the card reader and scanner .
A set of four tiny lights on the back indicate the unit 's state of battery charge .
Buttons on the side of the device connect through to the iPod touch , including the sleep and volume controls .
A mini-USB connector connects to an AC battery charger .
A large squeeze - button on the right side momentarily activates the barcode scanner .
Checking out
The EasyPay touch will handle credit , debit and cash transactions , as well as certain product returns .
But some other transactions will continue to be processed through the existing POS system , including using two or more credit / debit cards to pay for a single transaction , accepting bank or traveler 's checks , and processing returns for cash .
Credit card transactions will be handled very similar to the current method .
Customers will write their signature on the iPod touch using a Pogo Sketch stylus , which simulates the action of a finger , but allows finer entry and control .
Debit card transactions will be a hybrid of the EasyPay touch and the existing Hypercom desktop terminal .
A customer 's order will be entered and logged on the iPod touch .
The customer will be directed to one of the store 's existing Hypercom - brand credit card terminals , where they will swipe their card and enter their PIN .
When the card is approved , a code is returned to the iPod touch for matching with the order .
For the first time , cash transactions can be accepted by any Apple store employee who has an iPod touch .
After entering all the products and totaling the cost , the employee presses an on - screen " Cash " button to electronically open one of several cash drawers installed around the store .
According to tipsters , this feature will be rolled out only at selected stores over the next six months .
Customers will continue to have the option to receive a printed or e-mailed receipt , or both .
For product returns , the original purchase can be located by scanning the barcode of the purchase receipt .
Without a receipt , EasyPay can search for the purchase by the customer 's e-mail address , product serial number , or the credit / debit card number .
The device captures why the return is being made , and will then generate a credit to the customer 's account , along with a printed or e-mailed receipt .
i Phone purchasing streamlined
Purchasing an iPhone is said to be greatly simplified with the new EasyPay system .
The iPod touch scanner can detect and capture all four barcodes that are printed on the iPhone box , and will automatically fill in the appropriate data fields on the order screen .
i Phone - specific screens will collect the customer 's identification , and if they are a new or existing AT&T customer .
The Apple store employee can enter the customer 's choice of phone plan , indicate if they qualify for a reduced price on the iPhone and if the customer is porting their current telephone number to the iPhone .
Various other plan options can also be selected , including the text message add - ons .
The software even displays the iPhone " Terms and Conditions " for the customer to read , and then accepts the customer 's signature to verify their acceptance .
WICHITA , Kan . 
For the first time in years , only a Wichita police car has been waiting outside the abortion clinic of Dr. George R. Tiller , who was shot to death a week ago .
Gone are the trucks bearing enormous images of bloody fetuses , the signs offering the home addresses of clinic workers , the crowd of protesters yelling to women as they enter .
Over almost 20 years , a vocal , diverse constellation of anti-abortion forces has grown up in this conservative city with an intensity rarely seen elsewhere , converging around Dr. Tiller ’s practice .
With his death , its future suddenly seems uncertain , too .
This city of 358,000 people , once the focal point of protests because of four abortion clinics  most significantly Dr. Tiller ’s , which provided rare late - term abortions  last week had no abortion facility open for business , no target in chief , no immediate reason for this network of anti-abortion forces to be based here .
“ I do n’t know what the future holds , ” said Troy Newman , the president of Operation Rescue , one of the most well - known anti-abortion organizations .
Seven years ago , Mr. Newman moved his organization ’s national headquarters , its leaders and his family from Southern California to Wichita to focus a national spotlight on Dr. Tiller , whom he described as “ the flagship ” of the country ’s abortion business .

President Barack Obama says he 'll give U.S. troops a strategy and a clear mission if he decides to put their lives at risk protecting the American people or U.S. interests .
Obama addressed troops at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska on Thursday .
The president spoke as Air Force
One refuelled before he heads to Tokyo for his first visit to Asia .
Obama told thousands of troops and their loved ones that he will never hesitate to use force to protect America or its interests .
But if doing so is necessary , he promised them a strategy , a clear mission and the equipment and public support they need to do the job .
Earlier Thursday , Defence Secretary Robert Gates said Obama is close to making a decision about whether to send thousands more troops to Afghanistan .
Speaking to reporters accompanying him on a domestic trip , Gates said Obama did not choose any of the specific options laid out for him at a White House meeting on Wednesday , pushing instead for revisions to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government .
That stance comes in the midst of forceful reservations about a possible troop buildup from the U.S. ambassador in Afghanistan , Karl Eikenberry , according to a second top administration official .
In strongly worded classified cables to Washington , Eikenberry said he had misgivings about sending in new troops while there are still so many questions about the leadership of Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
Obama is expected to announce his revamped war strategy soon — most likely after he returns from a trip to Asia that ends on Nov. 19 .
Increase still likely
Military officials said Obama has asked for a rewrite before and resisted what one official called a one - way highway toward war commander Gen.
Stanley McChrystal 's recommendations for more troops .
The sense that he was being rushed and railroaded has stiffened Obama 's resolve to seek information and options beyond military planning , officials said , though a substantial troop increase is still likely .
The president was considering options that include adding 30,000 or more U.S. forces to take on the Taliban in key areas of Afghanistan and to buy time for the Afghan government 's small and ill - equipped fighting forces to take over .
The other three options on the table Wednesday were ranges of troop increases , from a relatively small addition of forces to the roughly 40,000 that the top U.S. general in Afghanistan prefers , according to military and other officials .
The key sticking points appear to be timelines and mounting questions about the credibility of the Afghan government .
Administration officials said Wednesday that Obama wants to make it clear that the U.S. commitment in Afghanistan is not open - ended .
The war is now in its ninth year and is claiming U.S. lives at a record pace as military leaders say the Taliban have the upper hand in many parts of the country .
Eikenberry , the top U.S. envoy to Kabul , is a prominent voice among those advising Obama , and his sharp dissent is sure to affect the equation .
He retired from the army this year to become one of the few generals in American history to switch directly from soldier to diplomat , and he himself is a recent former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Eikenberry 's cables raise deep concern about the viability of the Karzai government , according to a senior U.S. official familiar with them who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the classified documents .
Other administration officials raised the same misgivings in describing Obama 's hesitancy to accept any of the options before him in their current form .
The options presented to Obama by his war council will now be amended .
Military officials say one approach is a compromise battle plan that would add 30,000 or more U.S. forces atop a record 68,000 in the country now .
They described it as " half and half , " meaning half fighting and half training and holding ground so the Afghans can regroup .
The White House says Obama has not made a final choice , though military and other officials have said he appears near to approving a slightly smaller increase than McChrystal wants at the outset .
Among the options for Obama would be ways to phase in additional troops , perhaps eventually equalling McChrystal 's full request , based on security or other conditions in Afghanistan and in response to pending decisions on troops levels by some U.S. allies fighting in Afghanistan .

Woohoo , prototype works !.. well the flash part does , haven`t tested the 4x clockport splitter part yet .
Important stuff first , I will not be selling built adapters , kits or parts .
I don`t have the time , money or energy for it .
Once
I`ve got a finished board and I`m satisfied it works fine , the schematics , parts list and pcb files needed to make one will be posted here .
Anyway , onto the fun stuff ..
This adapter provides 1 Mb of flashrom , which can be configured as either 2 x standard roms , or as a std 512 kb rom , with a 512 kb extended rom .
There`s also a 4 x clockport splitter , since the original is covered by the board .. plus there was some spare logic left ;)
And just a sneaky preview of Remus , a rom splitter and builder , to create custom rom images to use with the flashrom adapter , UAE and the Algor and Highway + Romulus cards .
It can remove unwanted modules from a 3.x rom , add in any module from the 3.5/3.9 romupdate files , replace exec with Piru`s exec44.1 beta , use Blizkick modules and patches ( without taking up any fast memory as Extrares buffer ! ) , or any other resident modules you can think off such as the Posiedon USB stack , XSurf IDE driver etc .
Remus main window .. Finally updated a new grab !
NB .
The romfixes error messages are normal , it just means it could n't find the old buggy routines to patch because either it does n't apply to some residents ( eg. the A1200 does n't have the A4000's scsi.device ) or that the fix only applied to certain versions of a resident and was fixed in a later release ( such as the OS 3.5/3.9 RomUpdate )

Amman , Jordan
AS a young student at the multinational Aramco school in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia , Fadi Jaber , a son of Palestinian refugees , always preferred his American classmates ’ cupcakes , brownies and chocolate chip cookies to his mother ’s pastries : knafah , qatayef and baklawah .
But when he tasted a vanilla - frosted vanilla cupcake from the Magnolia Bakery in Greenwich Village in 2004 , it changed his life .
He quit his marketing job at Unilever and used his savings to enroll in a baking and culinary management program at the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan .
And after an internship at Billy ’s Bakery in Chelsea , he was ready for his next move :
In July 2007 , in Amman , Jordan , he opened Sugar Daddy ’s , the shop that brought the cupcake craze to the Middle East .
Cupcake shops have become as ubiquitous as hot dog stands in some American cities , and have spread to Rome ; Istanbul ; Berlin ; Seoul , South Korea ; and Sydney , Australia .
Now Mr. Jaber has proved that even the Arab world is not immune to such a Western frivolity .
Rosa 's Law to End Term ' Mentally Retarded ' Md. boy says calling sister with Down syndrome a " retard " is wrong , offensive .
Nov. 18 , 2009  --
On any given day at the mall , the sports field or the movies , 8 - year - old Rosa Marcellino hears people say , " That 's so retarded , " or " You 're such a retard . "
" Even good kids use the word , not realizing that they 're talking about people like my sister , " said Rosa 's brother Nick , a Maryland 14 - year - old .
" We 're not allowed to use the words at my house , it would be just like saying a curse word , " said Nick in testimony to Maryland legislators .
" We 're also not allowed to use other words that are hurtful to minorities or people who are different . "
Rosa -- who Nick calls the " smartest person I know " -- has Down syndrome and is now at the center of a bill in Congress to strike the term " mentally retarded " from the federal lexicon .
Last January , Nick , who is a freshman at South River High School in Edgewater , Md. , convinced his state legislature to change the official phrase to " individual with an intellectual disability . "
The law would affect how Americans refer to the more than 6 million adults and children who are diagnosed with intellectual disabilities .
" The word retarded is slang to call someone stupid , and we know Rosa is not stupid at all , " Nick told ABCNews.com .
" Words are important . "
So important that Nick and his family were there Tuesday as Sen. Barbara Mikulski , D - Md. , introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate .
The solution , Mikulski said , is to be called Rosa 's Law , and it will cost taxpayers nothing .
" It brings us out of the dark ages and into a world of evolved sensibilities by retiring an archaic term that equates the person with the disability and substituting it with a term that references the type of disability , " Mikulski told her fellow senators .
Today , the proposed federal health insurance bill from the House of Representatives still uses what many consider to be an offensive term , referring to " a hospital or a nursing facility for the mentally retarded . "
And even in Maryland , the term must be used to comply with U.S. Census designations .
It all began as a family effort when Rosa 's elementary school changed the coding on her education plan from " health impaired " to " mentally retarded , " said her mother , Nina Marcellino .
" When I came home and told the kids , they did n't know it was the word people used to describe their sister , " she told ABCNews.com .
The school principal agreed to drop the designation and Rosa 's sisters Gigi , 12 , and Maddie , 10 , set out to get petitions signed .
The family enlisted the support of Maryland state delegate Ted Sophocleus and ultimately changed the wording in the health and education code at the state level .
Nick , a lacrosse player and a " quiet kid , " became the family spokesman , his mother told ABCNews.com .
" I am so proud of all my kids . "
Rosa , who plays soccer and loves math and science , is particularly proud of her family 's efforts .
" She does n't really know what the law is about , but she 's excited that she gets her own law , " said Nick .
" And we thought she should be treated equally . "
At the turn of the 20th century , children like Rosa were institutionalized and the prevailing thinking was that they should not interact with so - called " normal " people .
Those who were intellectually challenged were labeled " feeble - minded " in federal statutes .
But by the 1960s , that term was thrown out for " mentally retarded . "
By 1990 , Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities
Act that outlawed many forms of discrimination against disabled people , but it was n't until much later that terminology changed .
In 2006 , the American Association on Mental Retardation voted to change its name to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities .
By 2008 , The Associated Press struck " mentally retarded " from its stylebook -- the Bible of mainstream journalism .
" My sister might be one of the smartest kids I 've ever met , and that 's the truth ! "
Nick told legislators .
" It might take her longer to learn some things , and you can't always understand everything she says .
She 'll never be ' just like ' most people , but hopefully , neither will I . "
Today , most advocacy groups use phrases like " mentally challenged " or " intellectual disability " or the broader term , which also encompasses autism and cerebral palsy , " developmental disability . "
" Mental illness , more than any other disability , has gone through these iterations of names , " said Donald Freedheim , professor emeritus of psychology at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio .
" It 's so prevalent , kids calling kids dummies -- it 's always a derogatory term , " he told ABCNews.com .
" We 've gone through moron , imbecile to mentally sub -normal to mentally deficient .
You can practically write a history of mental retardation . "
And no sooner does one term change than the new replacement becomes " stigmatizing , " he said .
Still , he agrees the words need to change .
" It 's a horrible added burden to children and families . "
Ron Drabman , a clinical psychologist and former director of psychology training at the University of Mississippi Medical Center , said schools need to do more than just change words .
" Words are important , but it 's more important to protect children , " he told ABCNews.com .
" But it 's much more difficult . "
And some are skeptical that a Senate vote would accomplish much .
" I am Nick , " said Kris Alexander Eschauzier of Portland , Maine .
" My brother Blake is ' mentally retarded ' and oh , how I hated it .
And I still do when people throw around those phrases such as ' retard ' and ' that 's so retarded . ' "
" Unfortunately , I do n't think changing an official government designation will do much to stop the hurt , " she told ABCNews.com .
But Nina Marcellino and her family say the issue is larger than just changing the lexicon .
" It was more than words to us , " she said .
" We all felt like you can not separate what you call people from how you treat people .
Attitudes have been changing and everybody felt that with a new term , it was a new beginning . "
ABC's Tom Shine contributed to this report .
American Express said Wednesday it would eliminate monthly fees on its popular gift cards , a move that is likely to pressure its competitors to do the same .
The company ’s decision , which takes effect immediately , goes further than legislation Congress enacted in the spring that would limit , but not eliminate , monthly fees on gift cards .
Alpesh Chokshi , president of American Express ’s Global Prepaid unit , said gift cards were popular , but consumers often complained about the monthly fee that ate away at their balance .
There were no monthly fees in the first year , but on the 13th month , American Express began charging $ 2 a month .
Mr. Chokshi said eliminating the monthly fee was now possible because the gift card business had enough scale to remain profitable without the fees .
The company will continue to make money from the purchase charge , which ranges from $ 2.95 to $ 6.95 , as well as from its share of transaction fees each time the card is swiped .
If I sound like a broken record , it 's because the obvious lesson from Tuesday 's elections is being lost on way too many people :
If you want Democrats to turn out and vote for you next year , start delivering on the 2006 and 2008 campaign promises .
If you do n't , Democrats will stay home .
It 's that simple .
There are , at best , even in the most conservative districts , only a handful of Democrats in the House that can survive reelection without Democratic support .
The lower the Democratic turnout , the more Democratic casualties we 'll have next year , and those losses will be inordinately high among Blue Dog and New Democrats .
So really , it 's in their best interest to see the Democrats succeed in Congress .
Sure , it might piss off their corporate benefactors , but corporate benefactors do n't vote .
Conservadem logic is actually kind of funny :
Do nothing this year , so they can get reelected
So they can do nothing again next cycle , so they can be reelected
So they can stick around to name post offices and issue " National Bratwurst Day " proclamations
Inspiring !
Luckily , there are Democrats who have figured out what really happened on Tuesday .
Blaming election setbacks on a drop in voter enthusiasm , Congressional Democrats said Wednesday that losses in governors ’ races in Virginia and New Jersey — and a striking House win in New York — should give new urgency to their legislative agenda , including a sweeping health care overhaul .
As they assessed the results , Democratic lawmakers and party strategists said their judgment was that voters remained very uneasy about the economy and did not see Democrats producing on the health , energy and national security changes they promised when voters swept them to power only a year ago .
" Most of us ran on that , " said Representative Gerald E. Connolly , Democrat of Virginia and president of the party ’s freshman class .
" We must deliver .
I need to give Democrats something to be excited about . "
And while conservatives may not like it , the two races that centered on federal issues -- the two federal races -- were won by you - know - who .
While not discounting the Republican wins in Virginia and New Jersey , Democrats said the New York and California House races were the only contests that centered on Congressional issues and Democrats won both despite months of Republican attacks on the legislative priorities of President Obama and Congressional Democrats .
" The governors of Virginia and New Jersey do n’t have a vote on the Obama agenda , " said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
Again : give Democratic voters a reason to turn out , and they will .
Abandon the Democratic agenda , and they wo n't .
And if you lose because you quit on the party and the nation ?
We 'll cheer .
President Obama in a speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures on March 2009 :
Now , no plan is perfect .
And I can't stand here and promise you that not one single dollar will slip through the cracks .
But what I can promise you is that we will do everything in our power to prevent that from happening , which is why we 're building on the provisions in the Recovery
Act to forbid the use of these funds to build things like dog parks .
Now , let me be clear .
I do n't have anything against dog parks .
[ Laughter ]
I intend to get a dog .
[ Laughter ]
What I do oppose is building them with funds from the Recovery Act , because that 's not how we 'll jumpstart job creation , and that 's not how we 'll put our economy on a firmer footing for the future .
Recently released images from Tim Burton 's upcoming Alice in Wonderland adaptation reminded moviegoers that the quirky London - based director possesses one of the most extravagant visual vocabularies of any filmmaker now working .
Underscoring that fact , New York 's Museum of Modern
Art kicks off a Tim Burton retrospective Nov. 22 with a collection of 700 art pieces produced by the goth maestro over the past three decades .

As a companion piece , the auteur behind fantastical spectacles Mars Attacks ! ,
The Nightmare Before Christmas , Batman and a host of other morbidly twisted movies is publishing The Art of Tim Burton , a 434 - page tome packed with more than 1,000 drawings , doodles , paintings and evocative concept art dating back to Burton 's teen years in Burbank , California .
" Most of what appears in this book was never intended to be seen by anyone , " Burton writes in a preface to the book , noting that his collaborators sorted through " 40 years of notebooks , scraps of paper , napkins , etc . "
Author and co-editor Leah Gallo writes that Burton 's intention is " to allow his fans a broad look inside his private pages . "
To that end , the book is stuffed with a wild assortment of aliens , flying saucers , evil clowns and miscellaneous mutants embodying Burton 's outsider sensibility .
The book also includes commentary from Johnny Depp , Helena Bonham Carter and other actors who have helped bring Burton 's bizarre visions to life on the screen .
Packaged in both limited - edition lithograph ( $ 300 ) and standard hardcover ( $ 70 ) versions , The Art of Tim Burton can be pre-ordered from Steeles Publishing and will be available at the MoMA bookstore in New York and Forbidden Planet in England .
Wired.com 's gallery offers an advance peek at the massive book , including several exclusive first looks at Burton 's artwork .

" During his daily visits to our workshop , Tim would do his crazy little sketches of these alien invaders .

" I always feel relief wandering into Tim 's office and seeing the scenes and characters pinned to the walls , " says August , who also penned Big Fish for Burton .

This week I ’ve been playing the English - language version of Stalker : Call of Pripyat .
While the game is already out in Russia and Germany , the English version is n’t coming out until January .
The version I am playing is therefore a preview build , and incomplete in a number of ways , mostly in UI English and some bits and pieces of presentation .
What does seem to be complete , however , is the new and transformed zone , and its surly denizens .
My impressions of this , the third Stalker game , follow .
Having photo - montaged its plot – in which , post - Shadow Of Chernobyl , military helicopters are lost in the zone – you ’re dumped straight into the game world .
While the opening of the first game , and of Clear Sky , were both fairly linear , and could be seen as something like tutorials , Call Of Pripyat is instantly open .
The first of the three maps , a clogged up and toxic river valley , is vast – perhaps three times the size of the largest area in the original game – and you can immediately wander its enormity , encountering neutral stalkers , and setting about investigating the crashed helicopters that are marked on your map .
Of course it soon becomes clear that the standard equipment supplied to you is n’t going to be good enough to keep you alive .
The environmental dangers are ramped up in Call of Pripyat , to the point where I ’ve been suffering mild radiation poisoning for almost the entire game .
The A - life is rampant too , with battles between stalkers , dogs , bandits , and snorks breaking out constantly across the spooky valleys .
Nor is the game as forgiving as the previous titles in terms of resources .
Previously selling guns and other loot to trades made for an easy living , but this time you ’re going to have to search for – and sell – the artifacts produced by anomalies if you want to stay alive .
The detector system from Clear Sky remains , so this is a necessary process .
You only occasionally find artifacts lying about , as in Shadow Of Chernobyl , and these are tied into specific plot lines .
What all this amounts to is a game that immediately presents you with the “ go , survive ” ideal that many Stalker players had said the original game should have espoused .
While Call of Pripyat has a very clear mission for you – investigating the helicopter crashes – your primary concern is really one of staying alive and working with and for the people who really belong here .
You need to scavenge better equipment , food , anti-radiation drugs , and ammunition , and trading with the locals is an essential part of that .
This , in part , requires you to rely on your equipment , and to get it fixed up .
The upgrades and repair guy you find in the first zone is crucial to progress .
You are going to be spending money on repairs and upgrades , because there ’s no other option .
The surplus of equipment in the first two games is gone , and the suit you have must be fixed and augmented .
Amusingly , the upgrades dude can be bribed with bottles of vodka – the greater the drunkenness , the cheaper the prices , until he falls unconscious and is inaccessible .
Fortunately , the sleep function that a number of mods unlocked for the first two games is now available from the outset , so you can kill time yourself .
But you must find a bed to activate it .
( Bunks can be found in some of the trade and mission hubs . )
What ’s been most interesting about Call of Pripyat , however , is how much more like an RPG it has so far been .
There ’s already been a backstab storyline which beautifully illustrates the game ’s subtle faction mechanics : I ca n’t get the revenge kill I want without alienating the quest hub I currently rely on .
If I slay the miscreant then other Stalkers end up attacking me , and traders do n’t want my goods .
I am certain , however , that he ’ll get his comeuppance .
There have also been a couple of missions which I ’ve felt uncomfortable about – including one seemingly insane blood - sucker hunter ( the invisi- beasts ) who took me through a lair of sleeping creatures , just to show off Call Of Pripyat ’s stealth mechanics .
Basically , crawling = quieter .
And walking on noisy surfaces , or shooting , gives you away .
I ’ve yet to see whether sneaking plays any greater role in the game , but I ’m hoping it ’s going to .
So far I ’ve only partially explored the first two areas .
As I said , they ’re vast compared to the original game , but I suspect the full game will nevertheless end up being smaller and shorter than Shadow Of Chernobyl .
It ’s also weirder , at least at an environmental level .
While there was some strange stuff in SHOC ’s world , Call Of Pripyat reminds me a little more of the open surrealism of Pathologic .
In the starting area there ’s a giant mutant tree , a grater full of fire - ghosts , and a slice through a hillside ( like the path of a giant blow - torch ) which puts you under psychic attack if you try to go inside .
There ’s also a bunch of cracked , warped , and otherwise anomalous sections of landscape that make the first two games look positively conservative in their level design .
The zone really has changed , even if its gas - masked populace remain much the same .
And I ’m not sure it has all changed for the better .
While some areas of the world retain the original bleak and desolate beauty , it feels like much of the level design is perfunctory .
The original game seemed to hide a lot of the cracks in technology by simply making the level design very beautiful indeed , but that ’s not so apparent here .
It seems a little hurried , a little under - imagined .
I wonder if the additional weirdness is a symptom of a lack of confidence with the original palette of post - Soviet dereliction .
While the surface issues of presentation are the most obvious problems with this build of the game , there are some more subtle issues at work in things like balancing .
The most obvious the reduce stamina capacity of your character .
Unlike the previous Stalkers in the zone , your military major is quite out of shape , and can only manage a fraction of the distance that the previous motorcycle - legged characters could manage .
It ’s a strange change of pace , presumably design to limit the zipping about , and to make the levels seem a little larger .
It ’s a peculiar choice – and one that might not make the final build , I suppose – and it seems to chime in with a number of things that do n’t feel like mature design within the game .
That anxiety is balanced , however , with a feeling that there ’s just a lot to do .
I ’m not going to be sure of this until I ’ve spent some serious time into completing the game , but it feels like I ’m scraping the surface of the mission arcs – especially the side missions – in the hours I ’ve already sunk into it .
A couple of the missions have been really interesting , and I ’m hoping the GSC team have made some of them complex enough to be memorable .
( I ’ve already had one good anecdote to tell , that I do n’t want to spoiler here . )
Naturally , I ’m hoping to review a release version , so I ’ll be able to offer a better judgment of it at that time .
Call of Pripyat feels a lot more like the Stalker game we wanted and expected than Clear Sky did .
It does n’t seem to quite capture the atmosphere and terrifying claustrophobia of Shadow Of Chernobyl , but perhaps nothing ever will .
I have n’t played enough to be able to judge whether it ’s ultimately going to frustrate , either , but it ’s already a stronger offering than Clear Sky .
For zone - junkies like me this is clearly going to be fascinating terrain , and I ’m going to go back to exploring it the moment I get this posted on the site .

Welcome to the shape of things to come - the driverless taxi .
The world 's first driverless taxis are being installed at Heathrow Airport .
The futuristic vehicles will carry passengers from the business car park into Terminal Five in less than five minutes .
The driverless taxi , or personal rapid transit , drives itself around a network of guideways using a combination of systems including laser sensors and computer controls .
The electric vehicles look a bit like the futuristic transport pods used in James Bond movies .
They can carry up to four passengers and their luggage , gently accelerating up to a speed of 25 mph ( 40 k ph ) .
The driverless cars are the brainchild of Professor Martin Lowson from Bristol who has been developing the system for 15 years .
He sees it as a possible solution to our congested city centres .
There is still a lot of work to be done before the vehicles are available to the public but the Heathrow system has just started testing with passengers .
BBC Inside Out TV presenter Josie d'Arby was the first member of the public to try out the Heathrow system .
Watch the full feature on BBC Inside Out West and London on Monday 30 November at 1930GMT on BBC One and nationwide on the BBC iPlayer .
President Barack Obama has begun to favor a plan that would send an additional 34,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan , military officials told McClatchy Newspapers according to a Saturday report .
The president ’s current plan would require 23,000 soldiers from Fort Campbell and Fort Drum to deploy .
An additional 7,000 would support a division headquarters in Kandahar , with 4,000 more trainers coming with them , McClatchy reporter Jonathan S. Landay wrote .

The report continued : “ The first additional combat brigade probably would arrive in Afghanistan next March , the officials said , with the other three following at roughly three - month intervals , meaning that all the additional U.S. troops probably would n’t be deployed until the end of next year .
Army brigades number 3,500 to 5,000 soldiers ; a Marine brigade has about 8,000 troops . ”
President Obama has been criticized by Republicans for “ dithering ” on making a decision whether or not to escalate troop levels in Afghanistan .
Speaking to right - wing television outlet Fox News on Thursday , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) claimed that he is “ past angry ” with the president for not having a decision in hand .
“ The fact is , we already have men and women over there , and , the longer we delay in sending them the needed resources they need , the greater danger they are in , ” he said .
“ And that is just a fundamental fact of warfare . ”
Admiral Mike Mullen , commonly attributed as America ’s top military officer , took a different position in a recent interview with the Christian Science - Monitor , saying he is comfortable with the president ’s time frame and the “ depth of the discussion ” taking place at the White House .
Should the president — who ran his campaign promising to end the wars — decide to commit more troops , a rough estimate by the Pentagon predicts the escalation will cost up to $ 20 billion per year , breaking down to some $ 500,000 per soldier , per year .

“ The actual costs could be higher , because the estimate does not include the cost of constructing additional facilities , providing support forces such as military intelligence assets that may be based outside Afghanistan or replacing damaged weapons or equipment , ” CNN noted .
An unnamed , senior administration official told Reuters recently that decision may not come for weeks and almost surely not before the president ’s trip to Asia from Nov. 11 - 20 .
Officials additionally told McClatchy Newspapers that the administration is highly unlikely to move on Afghan troop levels before discussing plans with NATO allies .

Every episode is stunning proof to anyone curious as to how future anthropologists will view our society , that American Idol fans are to our artistic culture what teabaggers are to politics - the triumph of mob rule over public debate , victory for the fallacy that everyone doing the same dumb fuck thing is synonymous with " democracy " .
Sometimes , however , something manages to escape the dipshit event horizon of that insipid show , and somehow becomes a moment with actual relevance .
In the late fall of 2009 , that something is the ridiculous outpouring of Gasp - thinkabouthtechildren pearls - clutching over Adam " Glambert " Lambert 's surprisingly interesting , if exceptionally unoriginal , performance at the American Music Awards .
Before we begin , it must be stated for the record that I 've wanted to stay out of this whole conversation - I really have .
I cannot stand American Idol .
Forget how excruciatingly boring it is .
Forget how it typifies the subtext of reality TV , which is of course that dumb dumb stupid heads love making fun of other dumb dumb stupid heads .
Forget the weekly assault on good pop music at the hands of people who seem to think " singing " is a synonym for " bukkake " .
No , what really gets my goat 1 is that the show allows people who approach music in the same way they approach food - shoveling gallons of McDonald 's down their throats at every opportunity , angrily avoiding anything that actually tastes good , because they do n't actually like to eat , they just like stuffing their faces full of sugar and oil - to be treated with greater deference and consideration than people who actually enjoy music 2 .
UPDATE 2 , 12/12/2009 : Apparently DCP finally got around to realizing how it looked that most of the other performances were easily available and they 've all been taken down .
No more sexy young women stripping for good , wholesome American entertainment .
Good job idiots , it only took you a few weeks .
Before going further , let 's examine Glambert 's performance , shall we ?
Oh , wait , we can 't .
Dick Clark productions has issued C&D orders and threatened to sue anyone who posts footage of Glambert 's act for copyright violations .
Which is of course their right , since they own that footage .
I 'm sure they 're just trying to protect their intellectual property , and make absolutely certain that all images from this year 's AMA telecast is shown how they , and only they , wish it to be .
Oh , except look at this :
And this :
This must obviously be a simple oversight .
Surely , the fact that almost every single performance remains online while Lambert 's is brutally C&D'd is coincidental .
Which means if you did n't see it on the night of , you 're just going to have to imagine what it was like .
Now , have a look at Madonna 's biceps tonguing America 's Sweethearts on the VMAs :
Set aside the awful singing , hackneyed faux lesbianism and the terrible continuation of Britney 's career and concentrate on what matters - Glambert , in essence , he pulled off nothing more than a re-staging of Xtina 's 2002 live show , with the sexual content reduced by 50 % .
His central innovation was to recast himself in Xtina 's place , making bumpy - grindy faces at his male dancers .
Yes , there was Kissing A Boy and Simulated Oral Sex , but let 's be honest , the sexuality so stylized as to be sterile .
The small minority of viewers who populate the few American cities that have actually made it past 1990 were interested for a second .
" Oh my , " we thought , " ' sexy ' people shoving ' sex ' into our faces .
again . "
" Ho - hum , " we added as we changed the channel to watch CNN pundits masturbating to idle speculation that Obama might escalate the war in Afghanistan , at which point we forgot all about the BOY KISSES .
Truth be told , for sheer volume of things to be outraged about , you simply could not find a more grotesque spectacle of bread and circuses than the cabaret of penis envy that is America 's war mongering media class .
Or so one would think , But no , this is America , after all , and this was The American Music Awards .
That event 's purpose is not to reward us for our excellence , but to reflect our image back at us for our endless onanistic delight .
We are , after all , a nation of prudish , preening moralists who bemoan our decay but simply cannot disguise the tenting in our pants at the thought of killing wayward a-rabs , of violent , homoerotic gay bashing , of militaristic imperialist fantasies , of obscene gore , and most of all , of hypersexualizing women while demanding their purity .
And the younger the better , do n't you know .
As the last 10 years surely demonstrates , the sagging testacles of our middle aged men can only stir at the sight of underage , or believably underage trim , waving their girl bits into our faces while proclaiming their adoration of traditional values .
And thank god for it , as this directs the barely contained pedophilic tendencies of America 's elder gentlemen outward , at younger women on TV , instead of inward , at their daughters watching TV with them .
Well , unless they 're fundamentalist Christians of course .
WWJD ?
Horny teenage Sluts , that 's what .
But I digress .
All of this is well and good , but American entertainment is just like porn , where the action is focused solely on the cooze , with any evident dicks strategically positioned so that the viewer can imagine , despite the fact that his name is Rick Warren , that he 's looking at his own massive schlong rogering that broken young cokehead , You simply cannot interrupt the fantasy with petty reality without pissing off the viewers .
Which brings us back to Glambert 's lapse in judgement .
If Glambert is guilty of anything , besides being highly derivative , it's that he crucially overestimated the maturity and moral consistency3 of the American viewing public .
And who could blame him ?
It 's not like he pretended to be a strapping hunk of heterosexual role model when he competed in and nearly won the last American Idol .
Who the hell did the people who supported him think they were voting for ?
Then again , perhaps it 's like how Obama voters are feeling these days4 - " Sure " , viewers thought , " Lambert might look like a queer but he 's probably just currying favor with that English guy Simon .
All Brits are gay , right ? "
That might make the hyperventilating ZOMGs somewhat understandable .
Except no .
It 's not like Glambert spent the entirety of the final episodes of the last season insisting on his het .
bonafides .
Hell , maybe like Obama , he felt like he now had a Mandate and unlike Obama , he decided to use it .
So poor Glambert performed a surprisingly interesting routine ( to a spectacularly uninteresting song ) , not realizing that such a relatively tame display of homosexual amore` would send viewers running for the fainting couch as though they 'd just found out that Strom Thurmond raped and impregnated his teenage maid , lied about it for 70 years , only to have his sacred memory disrespected by his illegitimate daughter who had the gall to actually admit her parentage5 .
Shrieking parents lamented the nefarious influence this might have on The Children !
Moral scolds intoned with deep regret in their voice their " concern " about the message it sends .
Pundits wondered aloud if this might be the end .
Obviously , Glambert 's interference with the child bride fantasies of the TV watching public was an unforgivable crime , at least where ABC ( subsidiary of Disney , who inflicted Britney , Xtina and a host of other underage fertility goddesses on us ) is concerned .
It not only flouted the same traditional values that a half - dressed teenager shaking her tits at the camera apparently embodies , it was the ultimate vicarious cockblock .
The powers that be clearly deemed that the Homosexual interloper must be stopped .
STOP MAKING US THINK ABOUT BUTTSECKS , LAMBERT in other words .
So the complaints rolled in , and Glambert was castigated in the press .
Then he was dropped from a scheduled Good Morning America appearance .
Soon after , he was dropped from Jimmy Kimmel .
ABC , it seemed , was letting the homo knowknow that ITHO being too ublicly - pay ay - gay was career suicide .
Even so , Glambert admirably and accurately pointed out the insane double standard of which he was clearly a victim .
So ABC pulled the trigger on his scheduled performance on New Year 's Rockin ' Eve .
Astonishingly , we now found ourselves watching the network that airs Ugly Betty , whose most recent episode clearly depicted unapologetic gay sexuality , waging war on someone for the foolish sin of making old people uncomfortable with change .
The final nail in the dignity coffin was Lambert 's recent appearance on Ellen .
Contra his prior defiance , Adam now posed contrite , not apologizing , exactly , but " admitting " that his performance might have gone too far .
But before we address that , let 's watch Madge covet Britney 's Vadge again :
Poor Lambert , obviously ordered by his handlers to admit having gone too far for a country that actually pretended to believe Britney was a virgin .
Awesome .
That Lambert is now reduced to trying to thread the needle between standing his ground and begging for ABC to please - please - please - I 'll - Be- nonthreateningly - gay - I - swear forgive him is enough to make one forget that his music is , objectively , bullshit .
This whole thing has been particularly bitter tea to have rammed down your throat in 2009 .
California , New York , and Maine have all proven they 're less morally developed than the American south - let 's face it , at least Southerners will just admit outright they hate faggots and want to kick their faggoty asses .
The Obama DOJ recently compared homosexuality to pedophilia and incest .
Fucking Uganda might pass a law mandating the execution of gay people and the imprisonment of anyone who speaks up in their defense .
In the wake of Lambert 's expulsion from the house of mouse , other networks and shows have jumped to have him as a guest .
Which is smart , as you 'd think that demographics are on our side .
That it 's just a matter of time before grumpy uncle Robert does n't get to determine the national median anymore .
That ABC would recognize the benefit of not coming across as a company full of gay hating dicks .
Which is why , despite the fact that I previously could n't bother to summon any interest in the man , watching America weep and rend its garments over something as mundane as overt gay themes in a stage performance is a living migraine .
It feels a lot like an argument I had in 9th grade with a friend who insisted that a 3.5 " floppy disc was a " hard drive " .
Except there 's no science teacher to whom I can drag America 's vast army of misanthropic troglodytes to verify that , no , you 're not protecting family values -- you 're just assholes .
If I could have one wish granted to me for Saturnalia , it 's this :
That every single one of America 's God obsessed moral scolds will be forced to visualize , in stark detail , a simple fact that those of us who are sexually mature managed to grasp years ago :
There are , right now , two or more people of the same sex having sex , in every neighborhood in America .
With Each Other even !
And assuming one of them is n't a Republican politician or an evangelical minster , they 're probably enjoying it in the same wholesome way Granpa enjoys giving the missus the old pickle tickle .
Those who do n't claw out their own eyes with hypocritical disgust may find that it 's really not the big deal they 're making it out to be , and far from defending their morals , all their constant freaking out really accomplishes is to ensure that Americans continue to be the world 's premier sexual neurotics .
Oh pish posh .
Who are we kidding ?
The only way Adam 's getting out of this one is if he sings " I Kissed A Girl " - both versions - on New Year 's Eve6 .
UPDATE 12/08/09 :
We did neglect to point out that Lambert has been booked on ABC's The View .
Do n't get too excited though ; his performance is going to be pre-taped .
Because , you know , he might scandalize the children !
Or something .
It 's not really clear why this could n't be resolved with a simple pre-appearance contract negotiation with stipulated limits on his performance .
It 's particularly confusing since his appearance last week on Ellen was the dictionary definition of " reserved " .
You 'd assume ABC is well aware that Glambert knows how to behave himself on daytime TV .
Let 's also consider - and I 'd love to find out either way but there 's nothing online ;
Anyone out there work for the AMAs and can let us know ?
- that it 's very likely , considering how racy and hypersexual the other performances were , that his appearance at the AMAs was well - rehearsed and pre-approved .
Rather than simply admitting that Lambert's " mistake " was actually ABC 's fuck up , they 're making it absolutely clear to the dumb dumb stupid heads that the gaybo is going to wear the homo dunce cap and sit in the corner until he learns his lesson .
I 'm sure Elizabeth7 Hassleback will still be allowed to spew her anti-gay venom without restraint , and Danny Devito will still be allowed to appear on the show drunk out of his mind , so it 's good to know that ABC is n't practicing a double standard or anything .
Footnotes :
Viele von uns verfolgen gespannt die Entwicklung bei der bevorstehenden Vergabe von einstelligen und zweistelligen Domains .
Es sollte eigentlich ein Grund zur Freude sein .
Obwohl der Grund für diese Aufhebung der bisher geltenden Restriktionen bei der Registrierung von .de Domains eher durch das VW Urteil erzwungen wurde , ist es wirklich ein Meilenstein .
Es sollen Tatsächlich Domains registriert werden können , die bisher restriktiv behandelt worden sind .
Ob einstellige Domains , zweistelige Domains , reine Zifferndomains oder bisher geschütze KFZ Kennzeichen Domains , sie sollen alle ab nächsten Freitag registriert werden können .
Auch die Vergabeprozedur hörte sich auf den ersten Blick sinnvoll an : Jeder Registrar , besser gesagt jedes Denic Mitglied , soll ab Freitag den 23 .
Oktober 2009 um 9:00
Uhr maximal 4 Registrierungsanträge für solche Domains pro Minute stellen dürfen und die Anträge sollen in der Eingangsreihenfolge bearbeitet werden .
Also hat theoretisch jedes Denic Mitglied die gleichen Chancen die Domain Bestellungen der eigenen Kunden zu erfüllen , also ein echtes , sauberes First come , first served Scenario .
Soweit so gut , aber schauen wir uns mal an , was in den 72 Stunden nach der Bekanntgabe alles so eingeleitet wird :
SEDO startet eine Auktion , in der Domains versteigert werden , die es noch gar nicht gibt .
Nach eigenen Aussagen , werden deren Partnerregistrare versuchen die Domains zu registrieren und dem Höchstbietenden übergeben .
Bieter , die parallel versuchen Ihre Domains anderweitig vorzubestellen werden mit einer Vertragsstrafe belegt .
Einige Registrare ( eventuell sind es sogar die , die SEDO als Partnerregistrare bezeichnet ) , nehmen keine Kundenseitigen Aufträge für diese Domains an .
Auf Anfrage hört man immer wieder Begriffe wie „ Registrierung Pool “ oder „ Catch Pool “ .
Einige Registrare Versuchen ihre Denic Mitgliedschaft für den angegebenen Zeitraum zu vermieten .
( Sehr fragwürdig wenn man bedenkt , dass es nicht klar ist , ob derjenige seine gewünschte Domains bekommt )
Andere wiederum Verkaufen ihre Warteschlangen Platzierungen
( Auch hier gleicht das Ganze einem Lotterie Spiel )
Dann gibt es noch einige Registrare , die bieten eine Kombination aus einem Festbetrag , um überhaupt aufgenommen zu werden , zuzüglich eines freiwillig festgelegten Betrages , der am Ende natürlich über die Warteschlangenposition entscheidet .
Es gibt auch weitere sehr „ kreative “ vorgehensweisen , die aber alle eines gemeinsam haben : Keiner kann garantieren , egal wieviel für die jeweilige Domain bezahlt wird , dass die Domainregistrierung erfolgreich sein wird .
Diese vorgehensweise , hochwertige Domains zu verteilen , gleicht einer Farce und ich halte sie für höchstgradig bedenklich .
Es dürfte mit ziemlicher Sicherheit am Montag zu einer Einstweiligen Verfügung kommen .
Meiner Ansicht nach wird eine der Großen Firmen , die unbedingt Ihr eigenes Markenzeichen als Domain haben will diese Einstweilige Verfügung einleiten .
Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen , dass beispielseweise eine Firma Telekom es auf sich sitzen lässt , dass sie keine Möglichkeit hat eine Domain t.de für einen bestimmten Betrag , egal wie hoch , zu registrieren .
Diese Vergabemethode widerspricht allen Regeln des seriösen Handels und ist der wichtigsten Länder TLD nicht würdig .
An die Denic :
Brecht die vergabe von einstelligen und zweistelligen Domains ab !
… und zwar , bevor es zu spät ist .
Macht Euch Gedanken , wie eine korrekte Vergabe erfolgen kann .
Eventuell ist eine Domain Auktion wirklich nicht die schlechteste Lösung , aber dann bitte zentral und von Euch als Ausrichter oder Auftragsgeber .
Da fließt Geld in Eure Kassen , das Ihr gerne für weitere Technische Entwicklungen nutzen könnt , oder unter Euren Mitgliedern aufteilen könnt , oder einfach spenden und dabei was gutes tun .
Nesbitt rushed for 122 yards and three touchdowns -- the last of them a 39 - yarder tiptoeing down the sideline with 3 minutes left -- as No. 19 Georgia
Tech ran to a 28 - 23 win over the fourth - ranked Hokies on Saturday night for its biggest triumph in years .
The gold - clad fans stormed the field , engulfing a team that did n't mind a bit , and wound up tearing down the goal post in the north end of Bobby Dodd Stadium .
No wonder -- this was Georgia Tech 's first win at home over a top - five team since the Dodd - coached Yellow Jackets beat Bear Bryant 's top- ranked Alabama Crimson Tide in 1962 .
" This is the biggest thing that 's happened since I 've been here , " said Nesbitt , a junior quarterback who plays more like a running back out of Georgia Tech 's spread - option offense .
Virginia Tech ( 5 - 2 , 3 - 1 Atlantic Coast Conference ) endured another doomed trip to Atlanta .
A season - opening 34 - 24 loss to Alabama at the nearby Georgia Dome was followed by a second defeat on the return trip south , this one hurting the Hokies ' ACC hopes and probably ruining their shot at a national title .
" What happened out there was n't because of lack of effort , " coach Frank Beamer said .
" Now is the time to come back and let 's go get the next one .
There 's a lot of football to be played . "
Georgia Tech ( 6 - 1 , 4 - 1 ) completed just one pass but ran for 309 yards -- all but 37 of those yards coming in the second half .
" Their offense , " Beamer said , " was just hard to stop .
Their quarterback was doing a great job , and we got into a little bit of a guessing game . "
Nesbitt made up for a fumble that gave Virginia
Tech life by finishing off the clinching drive with his best run of the night .
On third - and - 7 from the Hokies 39 , the quarterback ran to his left , saw two defenders peel away to shadow potential pitch targets , turned up through a huge hole and managed to stay in bounds along the sideline , even when Dorian Porch gave him one last shove around the 5 .
" He 's the heart of our team , " said running back Jonathan Dwyer , last year 's ACC offensive player of the year .
Nesbitt has run for six touchdowns over the last two weeks , also scoring three times in a 49 - 44 victory over Florida State .
It was the fifth time this season the quarterback was rushed for more than 90 yards , and Georgia Tech has certainly proven in Paul Johnson 's two seasons as coach that its run-oriented offense -- incorporating elements of old formations such as the wishbone and veer -- can win at the major - college level .
The Yellow Jackets ruined Virginia
Tech 's clear path to the ACC title game and made things real interesting in the Coastal Division , which also includes No. 9 Miami .
" We already have a loss and I do n't think you can win our side with two , " Johnson said .
" One loss is going to win it .
What we did tonight was stay alive and put everyone else back in it . "
On the heels of two straight shootout wins over Mississippi State and Florida State , the Yellow Jackets slogged through much of the first half .
Georgia
Tech managed only 37 yards on 21 carries before halftime , though Nesbitt 's lone completion -- a 51 - yarder to Demaryius Thomas -- set up a touchdown that gave the home team a 7 - 3 lead heading to the locker room .
Nesbitt burrowed over from the 1 with 32 seconds left .
My , how things changed after the break .
Virginia
Tech stuck with the scheme that had been working , but Johnson 's subtle adjustments started producing huge chunks of yardage on the ground , both inside and out .
Nesbitt scampered for 31 yards before finishing off the drive with another 1 - yard TD plunge .
Virginia
Tech had a chance for a quick response , but Beamer passed on a field goal try on fourth - and - 2 from the 18 , and Ryan Williams was stuffed short .
Beamer 's questionable decision turned out to be moot .
Getting a little greedy , Nesbitt went deep again and was picked off by Porch .
On the very next play , Williams went 66 yards up the middle for a touchdown that pulled the Hokies to 14 - 10 .
Georgia
Tech kept right on running .
Dywer carried five times for 48 yards on a 12 - play , 86 - yard drive that burned nearly 6 1/2 minutes off the clock .
Marcus
Wright finished it off by taking a pitch from Nesbitt and scooting 13 yards to make it 21 - 10 .
The Yellow Jackets were on the verge of clinching it when they drove deep into Virginia Tech territory before Nesbitt made an errant pitch that sailed behind Roddy Jones .
Davon Morgan fell on the loose ball , giving the Hokies new life with just under 5 minutes remaining .
They quickly took advantage of the turnover , scooting 77 yards in six plays .
Taylor scrambled the final 22 yards for a touchdown that closed the gap to 21 - 16 , but the 2 - point conversion failed .
After Nesbitt 's third TD , Taylor flicked an 8 - yard TD pass to Williams with 1:48 left .
But Jerrard Tarrant corralled the onside kick for Georgia Tech .
Williams ran for 100 yards , while Taylor had 159 passing and 63 on the ground .
" Our big plays , " Taylor said , " came a little too late . "
The " Unbe - LEE- able " tandem of Chase Utley and Cliff Lee carried the Phillies to an 8 - 6 World Series Game 5 win Monday night .
Mix in a ragtag effort from Phillies relievers and a bomb by Raul Ibanez and the Phillies staved off elimination to stay alive for at least another game .
The key to Game 5 was to replicate the effort from Game 1 when Lee pitched a complete game and Utley hit two bombs .
Citizens Bank Park was rocking as Lee pitched seven strong innings before falling apart in the eighth .
Despite giving up five runs he still earned his fourth postseason win .
Utley hit a three - run homer off Yankee starter A.J. Burnett to put the Phils on the board in the first inning .
He then followed it up with a solo shot in seventh to extend the Phillies lead .
He has eight RBI and has scored six runs in this World Series .
The Phils second baseman tied Reggie Jackson 's World - Series record by hitting his fifth dinger of the Fall Classic .
If Jackson was Mr. October does that make Utley Mr. November ?
" It 's pretty cool , " Utley said .
" It 's pretty surreal .
I 'm glad we got the win tonight .
We 're going back to Yankee Stadium . "
Chan Ho Park got three outs to get the Phils out of the eighth inning with a three - run lead .
Ryan Madson came in and gave up a run while recording a shaky save for the Phightins .
The Phightins now trail the Fall Classic 3 - 2 .
Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins summed up the urgency of being on the brink of elimination .
" We had to do it , " Rollins said .
" We did n't have a choice .
It was either go home and watch football and college basketball or extend the season . "
The key for the Phillies was getting to Burnett early .
The Yankee right - hander lasted just two - plus innings and gave up six earned runs on four hits and four walks .
The Yankees trailed 6 - 1 but would chip away with a RBI groundout by Johnny Damon in the fifth .
They would then blow up for three more runs in the eighth on a two - run double by Alex Rodriguez and a sacrifice fly by Robinson Cano .
Jayson Werth and Carlos Ruiz also knocked in runs for the Phillies .
Next up for the Phillies will be a Wednesday night showdown in the Bronx .
Pedro Martinez on full rest would likely take the Yankee Stadium mound against Andy Pettitte who will be on short rest .
A special post for those who would save us from the global warming .
The regulars already know we do these sea ice plots from the NSIDC gridded satellite data .
Sea ice – extent full satellite record , barely significant trend WRT high frequency weather noise .
Global sea ice area is even closer .
This one is interesting because it shows that without 1978 the past 30 years have not shown a statistically significant decline in sea ice .
What makes it even better is that in 1978 there are only 2 months of data starting from October 26 .
So the above graph which shows a less than 95 % confidence that the decline is not ‘ weather ’ noise is only missing the first 2 months .
So of course we should plot the stats for all the years , just to make sure I ’m not cherry picking .
Global Sea ice trend by year only ( barely ) crosses 95 % significance when the first two months of satellite data is included for the entire record .
Just for fun , from the uber - Scientific and obviously a-political Copenhagen Diagnosis report we learn that ‘ scientists ’ can only see Arctic Sea ice .
Rapid Arctic sea-ice decline : Summer - time melting of Arctic sea-ice has accelerated far beyond the expectations of climate
models .
The area of summertime sea-ice melt during 2007 - 2009 was about 40 % less than the average prediction from IPCC
AR4 climate models .
Below is the Arctic Sea ice anomaly .
So the question is , is sea ice declining – the easy answer is clearly yes .
However , the more nuanced answer is yes but it appears globally to be an insignificant amount of melt which could be due to short term variations caused by high frequency weather patterns .
What ’s more is that we only have 30 years of data here to work from and there is substantial evidence that this ice has melted in the past and the whole trend could quite easily be part of a much longer trend as shown in an awesome post on arctic history by Tony Brown .
I do a special plot of Global ice anomaly at tAV where I add back in the average ice area on the earth .
It ’s important for people to visualize because it gives a slightly different impression than the ‘ scientists ’ desperately want you to see .
As I say often here , do n’t take my word for it , make your own mind up . —
I say it for lurkers though , most blog commenter ’s have little trouble with expressing opinion right ?
Just to make the effects of variation of weather on Sea Ice and Polar bears ( which there are more of today ) below is a new and much improved video on global Sea Ice .
The resolution is better , both poles are shown at the same time and I ’ve brought it up to date for this year .
As my 3 YO said , smaller , smaller , smaller , bigger , bigger , bigger , smaller , smaller smaller , bigger big …..
The R code for this is a bit sloppy , but you ’re welcome to it – email me on the right .
The four playable characters / classes of borderlands are :
Lilith is a crit - stacking character with some area - of - effect spells .
Mordecai is the sniper .
( He also has the pet bird which is either completely worthless or the single most powerful attack in the game , depending on how you spend your skill points . )
Despite being the “ soldier ” , Roland is actually the team medic / re-supply engineer .
Brick is Brick .
Brick punches .
Brick also use rockets .
I ’ve clocked some serious hours on this game .
I ’ve taken two different characters ( a Brick and a Lilith ) into their 20’s as part of a group .
I ’ve taken a single - player character ( another Brick ) to level 40 .
( The initial play - through ends in the early 30’s . )
I ’ve also taken a Roland and a Mordecai into their 20 ’s solo .
That , and I have a couple of characters in their teens .
I have n’t done the math yet , but that ’s a lot of play time .
One of the things that is greatly confusing the discussions about the game mechanics is the number of different versions of the game .
I ’ve been told there are pronounced differences between the PC and Xbox offerings , which is further complicated by the fact that the PC version was patched at some point and important changes were made .
( And the “ full patch notes ” are not actually entirely full .
For example , try driving the car pre-patch and you ’ll notice how easily it was to get caught on the most trivial scenery .
Yet changes to the car are n’t even mentioned in the notes .
What other slight changes or fixes are in there ? )
So when we ’re arguing about what weapons “ work ” or are “ unbalanced ” we ’re not the group of blind men describing different parts of an elephant .
We ’re blind people describing what could be entirely different creatures , which may not even be part of the same zoo .
Guns each have stats , some of which ( like accuracy ) are shown in the interface and some ( like reload speed ) which can only be determined through use .
In the patched version , the sniping mechanics are broken .
I wondered why I was having so much trouble sniping in this game .
I ’ve done a lot of FPS sniping in my day , and I ’m familiar with how this usually works .
I had a lot of instances where I was pretty sure I should have hit someone but did n’t .
But you normally can’t make an accusation like this on the internet , or the people who have lashed their self - esteem to their “ skillz ” will dogpile with accusations of sucking , newbishness , and whining .
But the vanishing sniper bullet has happened often enough and reliably enough that I ’m prepared to say the hit detection is , in fact , utter hogwash .
Far too often I find myself thinking , “ What IS this dude ’s hit - box shaped like ?
Because it ’s not shaped anything like his body . “
I was giving the game the benefit of the doubt , assuming that the “ accuracy ” stat of the gun was throwing off my aim so that I ’d miss even when I had the target all lined up .
That ’s plausible enough , although the misses and hits were often grouped suspiciously .
After spending many hours with the sniper rifle , I ’m convinced it ’s a simple hit - box problem and not some slight subtlety with the accuracy rating .
In short : Sometimes you just ca n’t hit a dude , no matter what .
He ’s behind some knee - high cover and I ’m shooting at him over the top of ( say ) a box or something .
Yet round after round will magically pass through him .
Did I miss ?
Did the gun miss ?
Did I blink ?
Then , I move into the open and he stops standing behind the knee - high wall and suddenly I can repeatedly ding him in the forehead without fail .
I satisfied my doubts on this last week when I found myself above some dudes .
I aimed downward , put the dot right on the head of my target , pulled the trigger , and “ missed ” .
Again .
And again .
Every time .
He was standing still and he was n’t that far away .
And my aim was n’t off .
The bullet was passing through his skull and striking the ground behind him .
I could n’t see the bullet impact ( which was obscured by his head ) but I could see the dirt it kicked up , which from my vantage point formed a halo of dirt around his cheating , lame - ass skull .
I aimed center - torso , and still hit nothing .
Then the two of us changed position and I dropped him with a single shot .
Hmmm .
I suspect there is also a maximum distance , after which the bullet abruptly vanishes rather than dropping and losing effectiveness , but I do n’t know .
It ’s a bit hard to study when people are trying to kill you , and when people are n’t doing that there ’s no way to study .
This is not to say that the sniper rifle is underpowered .
Aside from frustrating hit - detection shenanigans the thing is perfectly serviceable , and sometimes a sniper rifle is the perfect tool for the job .
But the dodgy hit mechanics really are a killjoy sometimes .
It ’s like playing sports with a bad referee .
Depending on how you look at it :
Either the rocket launcher is lame or the shotgun is overpowered .
A standard - issue shotgun is going to have roughly the same damage output as a launcher of the same quality and level .
Except that rockets pass through standard guys , so you must aim at their feet to deal splash damage .
This means anyone behind a waist - high barrier or at the top of a small rise will be immune to rockets .
Launchers fire more slowly and have a smaller capacity than shotguns , and the rounds themselves are rarer and you can carry less of them .
Worst of all , rockets can’t ever score critical hits , which are a huge part of the game .
( And rockets also have the obvious disadvantage that you can hurt yourself with them . )
Wall - based splash damage is kind of dodgy and suspect , and a few times I had rockets go through a mook and strike the wall a meter behind him without dealing any damage whatsoever .
So rocket launchers deal the same damage as shotguns , aside from all of their various disadvantages that make them less reliable , efficient , and versatile .
I stacked all of my skill points into the rocket - launcher focused branch of Brick ’s skill tree , and it was never a contest :
The shotgun outperformed it every time , going all the way from level 20 to level 40 , through several generations of weapons .
There was never a time when a launcher was my weapon of choice , because I always had a shotgun that outperformed it .
Another thing confusing the discussion on weapon mechanics is the extreme randomness of the weapon stats .
The more you use a type of weapon , the more you ’ll gain skill - ups in that weapon class and thus the better you ’ll be at it .
But when it comes to choosing a good weapon , you ’re really at the mercy of the random number generator .
As you level , you ’re going to find truckloads of ordinary weapons , and a very small number of godlike foe - blasting treasures .
It ’s possible you ’ll want to focus on sniping , but find yourself with an SMG so exceptional that it ’s just not worth getting out your good - but - not - remarkable rifle .
This is particularly true in the early game , when you ’ll outgrow weapons rapidly and your arsenal will see a lot of turnover .
Example : Mordecai was my first character .
He was fun , but the game felt a little hard and even when the hit mechanics worked my rifles just did n’t have the oomph that would make them fun to use .
I found myself using a shotgun most of the time , even though I had all of these points in skills to boost my sniper rifle .
Then I started a new game as Lilith , and the first sniper rifle she encountered ( at level 7 or so ) had a damage output of 250 , which was about the same damage that my Mordecai had on his rifle at level 20 - ish .
250 damage at level 7 is huge , and I wish I ’d screenshotted it .
It was a one - shot killing machine for several levels after that , and Lilith used that sniper rifle for over ten levels .
She also had a really good shotgun and never found an exceptional SMG , despite the fact that her powers are built around crit- stacking the SMG and adding elemental effects to rapid - fire shots .
In Diablo 2 , you usually stuck to your class weapon .
It does n’t matter if you just found a super - extra - double rare two - handed sword , your sorceress probably was n’t going to use it .
In Borderlands we have the same looting & leveling pace , but the stats of the stuff you find will often overshadow your core skills and abilities .
It does n’t matter that you ’re a Mordecai focused on sniper rifles , because that combat rifle you just found is so good it will outperform your sniper rifle anyway .
Thankfully , re-arranging your skill points is very cheap , so you can experiment and move points around to match your weapon loadout .
There ’s nothing wrong with this approach , it just feels … strange .
In Borderlands , you are your guns , and everything else is secondary .
So when I see lots of comments from people saying “ the rocket launcher is AWESOME ” and others saying “ the rocket launcher is balls ” , it ’s obvious that at least one of these two people had their opinion shaped by an exceptional weapon , or lack thereof .
Now , all of this sounds really bad , but the truth is the game is a blast anyway .
There .
I spent one sentence telling you the game is awesome and 1,400 words telling you how broken it is .
Which of those is going to leave a bigger impression in your thoughts ?
Because the one - sentence thing is probably the most important , but I could n’t offer that without giving you the other stuff .
Who cares if the weapons are n’t balanced ?
Once in a while you ’ll find the Holy Grail of Rocket Launchers and you ’ll be blasting people to bits with it .
Other times you ’ll find that one shotgun that seems to be the Solution to All Problems , and you ’ll use that .
The latter is far , far more likely , but they ’re all fun to use .
A Japanese sports web site has reported the Red Sox may have interest in signing World Series MVP Hideki Matsui .
Nikkan Sports reported that the Red Sox are prepared to offer a multi- year deal to Matsui , who was the Yankees ’ designated hitter this season .
Matsui , 35 , has battled knee problems that have kept him from playing outfield , but his hitting has been solid and timely .
In Game 6 of the World Series , Matsui drove in six of the Yankees ’ seven runs as they closed out the Phillies .
Reports have indicated Matsui is looking for a contract with an annual salary of $ 8 million .
According to USA Today ’s player salary database , Matsui made $ 13 million each of the last four years with the Yankees .

UPDATE , 4:42 p.m. : Peter Abraham here from Chicago .
This story out of Japan is quite likely untrue .
Teams are not even allowed to make offers to free agents until Nov. 20 and Theo Epstein told us earlier today that he had only minimal talks involving free agents .
Beyond that , Matsui is a DH largely incapable of playing the outfield .
He last played the field on June 15 , 2008 and has since had two knee surgeries .
The only way the Red Sox would have interest in Matsui would be if they were able to first trade David Ortiz .
It reads :
BARBARA ( that 's me ! ) :
You are the reason that Christmas and all the seasons of my life ( helpfully crossed out and replaced with " INTERNETS " ) are so wonderful and happy .
MERRY CHRISTMAS

GOP Blocks Dodd Bill to Freeze Credit Card Rates
Created : November 18 , 2009 16:55 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Moments ago , Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic proposal to freeze credit card rates on existing balances through the holiday season .
The bill , sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) , would prevent credit card companies from hiking rates and fees on existing balances until the industry reforms passed by Congress earlier this year take effect .
Although a few provisions of that law took hold in August , most do n’t launch until February or August of 2010 .
In the meantime , many card companies are hiking rates and fees to beat the law .
“ The industry has tried to make one last grab at their customers ’ pocketbooks , ” Dodd said , just before asking for the consent of Republicans to pass the bill unanimously .
No dice .
Sen . Thad Cochran ( R - Miss . ) objected “ on behalf of several senators on this side of the aisle . ”
There ’s no word yet which other lawmakers he was referring to .
House Democratic leaders have already passed even stronger legislation that would expedite all the credit card reforms in the previously passed bill — not just the ban on hiking rates for existing balances .
Dodd has n’t signed on to the Senate version of the bill .
It ’s worth mentioning that the Democrats — folding to pressure from the banks — were themselves responsible for delaying those reforms , which were initially proposed to go into effect much earlier this year .
Vestiges of ' Genocidal System ' Poland to Ban Communist Symbols
Reforming Poland 's hate - crime legislation may mean criminalizing communism .
An amendment to the criminal code awaiting the president 's signature would ban a broad category of communist symbols .
Left - wing politicians say the law does more to violate human rights than protect them .

Jerusalem ( CNN ) -- Palestinian leaders angrily dismissed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's praise for Israel on Sunday , openly questioning her ability to jumpstart peace talks just hours after she left Israel .
Clinton had called Israel 's position on settlements " unprecedented " during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat rejected her comment Sunday in a strongly worded statement .
" What the Israelis are offering is not unprecedented , " he said .
" What would be unprecedented is a comprehensive settlement freeze by Israel ... and a halt to Israeli policies in occupied East Jerusalem such as home demolitions , evictions and rapid settlement expansion . "
The debate is over Israeli construction on occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank and predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem .
" Without a settlement freeze and the eventual dismantlement of settlements , there will be no Palestinian state to negotiate and no two - state solution left to speak of , " Erakat said .
Clinton on Saturday praised Israel for " restraint " in its settlement policy , but Erakat said that did not go far enough .
" If America can not get Israel to implement a settlement freeze , what chance do Palestinians have of reaching agreement with Israel on permanent status issues , " he asked .
He said Israel 's position on settlements was nothing " other than a failure of Israel to implement a comprehensive settlement freeze as it is required to do under the 2003 road map .
Since 2003 , the settler population in the West Bank has increased by 73,000 settlers or 17 percent . "
Netanyahu said Sunday he hoped peace talks would resume soon .
" We really hope that the Palestinians will come to their senses and enter the process , " he said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting .
" The peace process is important and is an Israeli and Palestinian interest .
We hope that , as we are ready to begin the talks without delay , we will find the Palestinians hold a parallel position . "
Clinton met Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Abu Dhabi before flying Saturday to Israel for meetings with Israeli officials , including Netanyahu .
" I want to see both sides begin [ negotiations ] as soon as possible , " Clinton said Saturday night at a news conference with Netanyahu .
" The important thing ... is to get into the negotiations , " she said .
" I gave the same message today when I met with President Abbas . "
Erakat told CNN Sunday he believed that Abbas was serious about not running for a new term when Palestinians next elect a leader .
" He feels betrayed by Arabs , Israelis , some Palestinians and to a certain extent by the Americans , " Erakat told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour .
Erakat said Saturday that Abbas wants negotiations to pick up where they left off with former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert who stepped down early this year , but that the Israelis do not .
That , Erakat said , is evidence that Netanyahu has " no interest " in continuing negotiations .
He characterized the process as " stuck " because of what he said was Netanyahu 's lack of desire to restart negotiations .
Earlier this year , the Obama administration called for the Israelis to halt building more housing on land the Palestinians regard as theirs .
However , after meeting last month in New York with Netanyahu and Abbas , President Obama softened his language on a settlement " freeze , " saying that Israel has had meaningful discussions about " restraining " settlement activity .
Erakat said Clinton had told Abbas that the settlements were not legitimate but said the United States was unable to persuade Netanyahu 's government to commit to a freeze .
Clinton flew Sunday from Israel to Morocco , where she will meet Arab leaders to try to push forward the Middle East peace process .
She is scheduled to meet with Morocco 's moderate King Mohammed VI , as well as foreign ministers from around the region .
She is also scheduled to deliver a speech on Tuesday .
CNN 's Kevin Flower and Shira Medding in Jerusalem and Jill Dougherty in Marrakech , Morocco , contributed to this report .

Dear creditors of Dubai World : do n't come begging for cash from Abu Dhabi .
At least , that seems to be the message .
Reuters : Abu Dhabi , wealthy capital of the United Arab Emirates , will " pick and choose " how to assist debt - laden neighbor Dubai , a senior official said on Saturday , after fears of a Dubai default sent global markets reeling .
" We will look at Dubai 's commitments and approach them on a case - by - case basis .
It does not mean that Abu Dhabi will underwrite all of their debts , " the official in the government of the emirate of Abu Dhabi told Reuters by phone .

Even before the unknown versifier of Isaiah , poets probably looked at a lush meadow and saw a graveyard .
Louise Glück ’s wary , pinch - mouthed poems have long represented the logical outcome of a certain strain of confessional verse — starved of adjectives , thinned to a nervous set of verbs , intense almost past bearing , her poems have been dark , damaged and difficult to avert your gaze from .
Poets , being creatures of routine , tend to settle into a style sometime in their 30s and plow those acres as if they ’d been cleared by their fathers ’ fathers ’ fathers .
Read a poet ’s second or third book and you will see the style of his dotage .
Poets restless in their forms , unwilling to take yesterday ’s truth as gospel , are as rare as a blue rose ; and rarer still are poets like Eliot , Lowell and Geoffrey Hill , who have convincingly changed their styles midcareer .
“ A Village Life ” is a subversive departure for a poet used to meaning more than she can say .
All these years that Glück has been writing her stark , emaciated verse , there has been an inner short - story writer itching to break out .
( The publicity optimistically refers to the new style as “ novel­istic ” ; but there is no novel here , only patches of long - windedness . )
The lines are long , the poems sputtering on , sometimes for pages , until they finally run out of gas , as if they were the first drafts of a torpid afternoon .
Even so , there ’s a faith in speech , as well as a generosity of instinct , apparent in these laggardly lines , though the reader may be forgiven for thinking that some charities are impositions .
As in Edgar Lee Masters ’s “ Spoon River Anthology , ” Glück uses the village as a convenient lens to examine the lives within , which counterpoint the memories of her life without .
Unlike Masters , she writes without moralizing , though with the same steady knowledge that our destination is the grave ( “ To get born , your body makes a pact with death , / and from that moment , all it tries to do is cheat ” ) .
Unfortunately , the quickest way to the mortuary is apparently marriage :
He has found someone else — not another person exactly ,
but a self who despises intimacy , as though the privacy of marriage
is a door that two people shut together
and no one can get out alone , not the wife , not the husband ,
so the heat gets trapped there until they suffocate ,
as though they were living in a phone booth .
Welcome to my third article from the series about my first year of blogging as business .
In today ’s post I ’ll talk about money .
How I made money , a little bit about how I intend to make money from now on and why .

The exact answer is : 3378.34 USD .
That comes down to around 280 USD month .
Technically , I only started to work on this from January , so that will make even more for the monthly income , but let ’s split by 12 months .
One thing I would like to tell you upfront is that I host on a dedicated server .
Not because of the needed resources , during the first year the blog really did n’t eat more than 5 - 10 % of the whole server , but because I was used to .
Having an online business for more than 10 years can leave some marks .
So , if you make a little bit of a calculus you ’ll realize that the income I had from the blog was just enough to afford a more than decent hosting .
I am totally happy with these numbers , although one may object that being happy with such low numbers is totally against “ make money online fast by blogging ” trend .
And he would be totally right .
I am against that trend .
I find it shallow and frustrating .
Shallow because any money made fast is a little bit tasteless , and frustrating because there really is n’t such a thing like making money fast .
I am happy first of all because I identified a working model .
A model that went really well in terms of stability and predictability .
Finding some working patterns is a really valuable thing when you enter a new business ..
I remember than back when I started my online business it took me several years until I found some stable revenue sources .
This time it took only one year .
The income is not big , but what ’s precious is the model .
I can apply this model from now on , pressing or releasing some buttons and I know what to expect .
Finding a working model is even more precious when I take into account that during this time I had to experiment several writing and promoting styles until I finally found , in the last few months , a strategy for a stable , ascending traffic .
Lesson : finding a working model for your blog monetization is more important than shooting chaotically to every new opportunity , hoping that sometime , with a little bit of luck , you ’ll shoot big .
I found it much better to follow the results of my monetizing activities over a period of at least six months and then draw some conclusions .
Benefits : having a constant flow of money is a key point in starting a new business .
Even if it ’s small , it adds up .
In the first year , I actually did n’t pay for my hosting and I also had the opportunity to spend some cash in order to test some new promoting techniques .
Blog Income Distribution
The main income sources were affiliate deals and selling my own content .
The last one accounts only for the last week of the whole year , when I launched my first paid ebook , so it ’s actually pretty new .
But from my initial results I think I know what to expect .
There were only 2 affiliate deals on the website , and I chose them to be pretty vague , not very niched .
One is a software selling deal with Mariner , a well known and respected Mac software producer , and the other one is with the very much hyped Thesis theme for WordPress .
No personal development product , no other complicated stuff .
The Mariner deal is going on with an exclusive promo code each month and as for Thesis I just have a vanilla , not customized , affiliate deal .
Picking those deals was not an easy task .
Took me a little while because I was on a pretty tight criteria set .
The products had to be good , appealing for my niche , respected and easy to manage .
I ended up with a software producer and with a premium blogging theme .
In the process , I had to discard several other products , because they were either too expensive for my audience ( yet ) , either too narrow ( like very specific software tools ) .
Having only 2 affiliate deals was pretty good for the content , I did n’t have to jam the post flow with unnecessary advertisement material , although , allegedly , this material could have been beneficial to my readers .
I preferred to have a clean flow of personal development posts and only one monthly post about the Mariner exclusive promo code .
Lesson : it ’s very important to correctly identify the right products for your niche and to have a well balanced portfolio of deals .
Benefits : learning how people react to different types of messages and products was no doubt the main benefit .
Some deals where better than others at certain time intervals , so keeping the eggs in different baskets helped me not to run on thin ice .
What I Did To Earn This Money
First of all , I had to identify the products .
But I already talked about it in the blog distribution part , so I ’ll skip it to the next step .
Which is negotiating your own terms .
Could n’t do that with Thesis , but did it Mariner products .
After a few emails I offered to do a 45 days long promotion on my blog , with their products , just to test the audience .
They agreed and the promotion went really well .
After that , I shoot for a year long promotion with a slightly better commission on my part .
They agreed also pretty fast , so that was it .
The next part was to actually create the supporting content .
I wrote a post for each month of the year , announcing each promo code for that month .
In the first several months I experimented a little with several writing styles and approaches , but I was able to find a clear and understandable message pretty fast .
The next months I actually used the same copy , knowing that almost my entire audience was already aware of the year long promotion .
After setting up the core foundation with those announcing monthly posts , I thought to share some of my experiences with the software I was promoting , especially MacJournal .
One of these posts was about my blogging setup , a custom implementation of a GTD flow for blogging .
The post , which was a complete description of what I actually use for my daily blogging activities was one of the most popular posts in my blog at that time .
There were also other two posts related to MacJournal , one about habit creation and the other one about how to write an ebook .
Both were pretty trafficked and this created a constant flow of new visitors to the Mariner promotion .
The next thing was to test some traffic generation with , of course , Twitter .
I tweeted some incentives for these promo codes and had pretty good results .
I also used a display advertising area on top of the two columns of my theme , with various banner ideas .
Almost all banners had a click - through rate more than 2.5 % .
This is pretty much everything I did for the Mariner promotion .
For Thesis , I did a little bit different .
First of all , I did a simple thesis hook tutorial , complete with freely downloadable source code and instructions .
The post got featured on several sites and on some high - profile Twitter users timeline , which bring in a little bit of traffic and also generated some conversions .
After that , I created a separate page in which I described why I paid for my theme and why any decent blogger who aims to create valuable content instead of spending time tweaking themes should pay too .
Every once in a while I see this page featured on some Thesis related community .
Which , of course , was good for traffic and conversions .
And one final touch was to integrate this deals with my publishing framework .
Thesis hooks to the rescue , again .
I created a small zone after each post , just before the similar posts block , in which I announced that the blog post was written on a MacJurnal setup and broadcast with Thesis ..
So every time somebody finished to read on of my articles , he was also exposed to my affiliate deals .
The insertion point was not intrusive and the message was not aggressive .
Blending in as much as possible with the overall blog content seemed to be the best affiliate deals strategy .
Lesson : creating an affiliate strategy is a matter of blending your general blog goals with your income generation strategy .
As for the ebook , I still learn how to promote it , but one thing is clear : selling your own products is much better than affiliate deals .
Benefits : I created solid partnerships without scaring away my audience and without sacrificing the main blog theme .
Also , I learned tremendously about how you could create useful content that pays .
Money , that is .
Blogging Money Goals
During the last few months my traffic doubled .
So , a decent goal would be to double my income too for the next year .
But , for some reason , I think this goal would be hugely underrated .
I know I can aim for much more .
I do n’t want to put any pressure on that by setting a fixed goal , but I will certainly aim for something in between 2000 and 4000 dollars per month .
From now on I intend to expand my affiliate deals , up to 5 - 6 in the next year .
So , if you ’re in the personal development niche , have some high quality products and you are interesting in using a new distribution channel , by all means , send me the products for reviewing .
I ’m not making any guarantee statement , so do n’t expect to sign in for just everything you send .
Some stuff will be more close to me , while some stuff will just be out of my vibe , without being necessarily low quality .
But you can be sure that once I ’m committed to work together you can expect full support from my part .
Another thing would be display advertising .
I chose to have a limited amount of banners and a somehow strict control over what passes on , so expect me to be fussy about it .
But there will be some display advertising on this site for sure .
Another thing I ’ll be doing is to put on the market another ebook .
I do n’t think this will happen in the next 3 - 4 months , as I will be quite busy promoting the first one .
I ’m still in the process of learning here so I ’m trying to give myself plenty of time .
***
So , that was pretty much all about my money experience during the first year of blogging as a business .
Not what you expected ?
Sorry to disappoint you .
No huge numbers here , nu “ fast cash ” , no get rich quick schemes .
I do like to live in a real world , where I can make real money , not in a fool ’s digital paradise which promises you millions of dollars in the first year of blogging .
I ’ll rather shoot for that in the second or third . 😉
Do you like your job ?
Do you enjoy the people you work with ?
Would you want to have lunch with them ?
Every day ?
Alex Papadimoulis thinks that Fog Creek ’s free lunches are “ cultish , ” but everyone at Fog Creek loves them .
Maybe it ’s the mandatory brain implant we install in each new worker , but I like to think that we just enjoy eating together because we genuinely like each other and like spending time together .
If you ca n’t imagine eating lunch every day with your coworkers , I hate to break it to you : you might not like them .
Is it OK to spend most of your waking hours with people you do n’t like ?
Do you actually enjoy doing your job ?
If you wake up an hour early in the morning , do you think , “ Yay !
I can go in early and get another hour of work in ! ”
Or does that sound ridiculous to you ?
Are you learning ?
When was the last time you had to learn a new skill ?
Is this year kind of like last year , or are you doing something new , stretching yourself , challenging yourself to be better ?
At one of the recent DevDays events , I asked the audience ( almost 100 % programmers ) how many of them were incredibly satisfied with their job , found it fulfilling , and were treated well by their employers .
Only about 25 % of the hands went up .
I asked how many people either hated their job and could n’t wait to find something better , or were actually actively on the job market .
Again , about 25 % .
The rest were somewhere in the middle : maybe they can tolerate their job , but they ’re keeping an eye open for something better .
Who is this DevDays audience ?
They ’re the elite of the elite of the best programmers out there .
They ’re the people who participate in Stack Overflow , the people who read , the people who are constantly trying to learn more about programming and software development .
More than half of them paid their own money to attend a one day conference .
They ’re the most desirable software developers on the planet .
And 75 % of them are not delighted with their job .
That ’s unacceptable .
I ’ve been saying for ten years that the top developers have a choice of where to work , and the top employers need to work harder to attract them , because the top developers get ten times as much work done as the average developers .
And yet , I still keep meeting ridiculously productive developers working in shitholes .
We ’re going to fix this , right now .
Thus , Stack Overflow Careers .
We ’re going to completely turn the job market upside down , for the best software developers and the best companies .
This is a talent market .
Developers are not even remotely interchangeable .
Therefore , recruiting should work like Hollywood , not like union hiring halls of the last century .
In a union hiring hall , downtrodden workers line up like cogs , hoping to make it to the front of the line in time to get a few bucks for dinner .
In Hollywood , studios who need talent browse through portfolios , find two or three possible candidates , and make them great offers .
And then they all try to outdo each other providing plush work environments and great benefits .
Here ’s how Stack Overflow Careers will work .
Instead of job seekers browsing through job listings , the employers will browse through the CVs of experienced developers .
Instead of deciding you hate your job and going out to find a better one , you ’ll just keep your CV on file at Stack Overflow and you ’ll get contacted by employers .
Instead of submitting a resume , you ’ll fill out a CV , which links back to your Stack Overflow account , so that you can demonstrate your reputation in the community and show us all how smart you really are .
To a hiring manager , the fact that you took the time to help a fellow programmer with a detailed answer in some obscure corner of programming knowledge , and demonstrated mastery , is a lot more relevant than the Latin Club you joined in school .
Employers can see how good you are at communicating , how well you explain things , how well you understand the tools that you ’re using , and generally , if you ’re a great developer or not .
And they can see your peer reputation , so all that hard work you ’ve been putting into helping people on Stack Overflow can karmically come back and help you upgrade your job to the latest , state - of - the - art , great place to work .
Stack Overflow has grown incredibly fast .
After a year in business , it gets over a million page views most weekdays and currently stands as the 817th largest site on the Internet , according to Quantcast .
It reaches 5.2 million people a month .
But Stack Overflow Careers does n’t have to be massive .
It ’s not for the 5.2 million people who visit Stack Overflow ; it ’s for the top 25,000 developers who participate actively .
It ’s not for every employer ; it ’s for the few that treat developers well and offer a place to work that ’s genuinely fulfilling .
Read the FAQ , then go file your CV now , and upgrade your career .
OTTAWA — U.S. authorities are urging Canadians to stop sending Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs to that country as gifts this holiday season because of a long - standing ban on the product south of the border .
A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection says officers noticed a spike in the lead up to Christmas this year , so are hoping the alert will reach Canadians who do n't know the ubiquitous product in Canada is actually banned in the U.S .
" It 's mostly personal amounts going down as a gift , " Chris Misson , a spokesman for U.S. Customs , said Thursday .
" This is an informational thing to make people are aware that they do n't lose the Kinder eggs at the border . "
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission determined years ago the product did not meet the small - parts requirement for toys for children under the age of three , creating a choking and aspiration hazard in young kids .
As a result , Kinder Surprise eggs are banned for sale and import into the U.S .
Health Canada has a different take on the product , available in Canada since 1975 and especially popular at Easter and Christmas , when the Ferrero Group manufactures themed treats .
The Kinder Surprise , deriving its name from the German word for children , has always been legal here because Health Canada has determined the tiny toy inside is not likely to be used by children under three years of age .
As a result , " the requirements for small components do not apply to the product , " Health Canada said in a statement .
Health Canada determined infants and toddlers do n't use the tiny trinket inside the Kinder egg based on a number of factors , including the manual dexterity required to open the plastic egg that holds the toy and the complexity of the toy design itself .
The toys , smaller than the size of an eraser , could be a 3 - D puzzle , have multiple small pieces or small stickers for application .
Meanwhile , the outer wrapping on the product carries the international choking hazard symbol for toys .
There 's also a warning in bold that reads : " Toy not suitable for children under three years .
Small parts might be swallowed or inhaled .
Adult supervision recommended . "
Mark Wakefield , vice - president of marketing at Ferrero Canada , said Kinder Surprise is a hit with consumers because it's a great product .
" Kinder is a well - loved brand .
The Kinder egg and its toy have been enjoyed by adults and children for more than 35 years in countries including Canada , Mexico , Italy , France , Germany , Australia and the United Kingdom , " he said in a statement Thursday .
The Kinder Surprise was first launched in Italy in 1972 , but Ferrero Group has never been able to sell the product in the United States .
In 1993 , the company asked U.S. authorities to permit its sale , but the government turned down the request , citing regulations that prohibit having an inedible product inside an edible object .
Ferrero Canada , which also distributes Ferrero Rocher , Nutella , Tic Tac and Kinder Surprise in Canada , also offers a special Kinder Surprise Maxi , available only at Easter , and the Kinder Christmas Ball .
The economy is struggling , the unemployment rate is high , and many Americans are struggling to pay the bills , but one class of Americans is doing quite well : government workers .
Their pay levels are soaring , they enjoy unmatched benefits , and they remain largely immune from layoffs , except for some overly publicized cutbacks around the margins .
To make matters worse , government employees — thanks largely to the power of their unions — have carved out special protections that exempt them from many of the rules that other working Americans must live by .
California has been on the cutting edge of this dangerous trend , which has essentially turned government employees into a special class of citizens .
When I recently appeared on Glenn Beck ’s TV show to discuss California ’s dreadful fiscal situation , I mentioned that in Orange County , where I had been a columnist for the Orange County Register , the average pay and benefits package for firefighters was $ 175,000 per year .
After the show , I heard from viewers who could n’t believe the figure , but it ’s true .
Firefighters , like all public - safety officials in California , also receive a gold - plated retirement plan : a defined - benefit annual pension that offers 90 percent or more of the worker ’s final year ’s pay , guaranteed for the rest of his life ( and the life of his spouse ) .
Government employees use various scams to boost their already generous benefits , which include fully paid health care and cost - of - living adjustments .
The Sacramento
Bee coined the term “ chief ’s disease , ” for example , to refer to the 82 percent ( in 2002 ) of chief ’s - level employees at the California Highway Patrol who discovered a disabling injury about one year before retiring .
That provides an extra year off work , with pay , and shields 50 percent of their final retirement pay from taxes .
Most of these disabilities stem from back pain , knee pain , irritable bowel syndrome , and the like — not from taking bullets from bad guys .
The disability numbers soared after CHP disbanded its fraud unit .
As I document in my new book , Plunder ! , government employees of all stripes have manipulated the system to spike their pensions .
Because California bases pensions for employees on their final year ’s salary , some workers move to other jurisdictions for just that final year to increase their pay and thus the pension .
Even government employees convicted of on - the - job crimes continue to collect benefits .
Municipalities have adopted Defined Retirement Option Plans , or DROPs , in which the employee earns his salary and his full defined - benefit retirement pay at the same time , with the retirement pay going into an account payable upon actual retirement .
And as average Americans work longer to sustain themselves , public employees can retire in their early fifties with their plush benefits .
The old deal seemed fair : public employees would earn lower salaries than Americans working in the private sector , but would receive a somewhat better retirement and more days off .
Now , public employees get higher average pay , far higher benefits , and many more days off and other fringe benefits .
They have also obtained greatly reduced work schedules , thus limiting public services even as pay and benefits shoot ever higher .
The new deal is starting to raise eyebrows , thanks to efforts by groups such as the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility , which publishes the $ 100,000 Club , a list of thousands of California government retirees with six - figure , taxpayer - guaranteed incomes .
But even in these tough times , public employees continue to press city councils for retroactive pension increases , which amount to gifts of public funds for past services .
Officials fear the clout that these unions , especially police and fire unions , wield on Election Day .
The story does n’t end with the imbalance in pay and benefits .
Government workers also enjoy absurd protections .
The Los Angeles Times did a recent series about the city ’s public school district , which does n’t even try to fire incompetent teachers and is seldom able to get rid of those credibly accused of misconduct or abuse .
Misbehaving teachers are sometimes kept from teaching , but they may spend years , even a decade , getting paid while they fight attempts to fire them .
A state law referred to as the Peace Officers Bill of Rights , along with excessive privacy restrictions , likewise makes it nearly impossible to fire police officers who abuse their authority .
The media have finally started to take notice , largely because of some impossible - to - ignore financial excesses , particularly the tens of billions of dollars in “ unfunded liabilities ” — that is , future debt — run up by politicians more interested in pleasing union officials than in looking after the public ’s finances .
News reports have also focused on scandals at CalPERS , the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , which has faced record losses after making risky leveraged investments in bizarre real - estate deals .
( The government pension system encourages such risky behavior : with defined - benefit systems , union members stand to gain if the investments go well , while taxpayers shoulder the burden if they do n’t . )
Meanwhile , the Los Angeles Times reported on a politically connected insider who received $ 53 million in finder ’s fees from CalPERS , raising questions of pay - to - play deals .
But the real scandal is a two - tier society where government workers enjoy benefits far in excess of those for whom they supposedly work .
It ’s past time to start cleaning up the mess by reforming retirement systems and limiting the public unions ’ power .
If we do n’t , California ’s financial problems will become insurmountable .
They are the pillars of the community , champions of the underdog , the scourge of corruption , defenders of free speech .
Their demise could deal a mortal blow to democracy .
Any guesses yet ?
How many of you thought of local newspapers ?
But this is the universal view of the national media : local papers – half of which , on current trends , are in danger of going down in the next five years – are all that stand between us and creeping dictatorship .
Like my colleagues , I mourn their death ; unlike them I believe it happened decades ago .
For many years the local press has been one of Britain 's most potent threats to democracy , championing the overdog , misrepresenting democratic choices , defending business , the police and local elites from those who seek to challenge them .
Media commentators lament the death of what might have been .
It bears no relationship to what is .
I 'm prompted to write this by a remarkable episode in my home town , Machynlleth , which illustrates the problem everywhere .
A battle has been raging here over Tesco 's attempt to build a superstore on the edge of town .
Its application received 685 letters of objection and five letters of support , but the town council , which appears to believe everything Tesco says , supports the scheme .
The local paper , the Cambrian News , appears in turn to believe everything the council tells it .
A couple of weeks ago consultants hired by Powys county council published a retail impact assessment which supports the arguments put forward by the objectors .
If the new store is built , the assessment says , it will cause trade in the centre to decline and generate longer and less sustainable shopping trips .
How did the Cambrian News respond to this devastating blow to Tesco 's application ?
By running a smear job on its front page .
According to the town clerk , the consultants had fabricated a complaint by the local butcher .
They had claimed to represent his views in their assessment , saying that he feared he would be forced out of business by Tesco – " but they have n't even spoken to him ! " .
The Cambrian News , ironically , ran this story without speaking to the butcher , the consultants , or , apparently , performing even the briefest check .
Its only informants were the town clerk and the councillors , who lined up to say that the behaviour of the consultants was " disgusting " , that they were " scaremongering " and that they should apologise to the butcher .
It took me 30 seconds to discover that the story was completely untrue : the assessment says nothing about the butcher or his shop .
I asked the editor of the Cambrian News to tell me whether her reporter had read the assessment before filing his story , or whether anyone at the paper had checked it .
Her response was priceless .
" Any information that we obtain , we keep exclusively for the Cambrian News and do not pass it on to rival newspapers . "
I pointed out that I was n't trying to steal her non-story , but asking her to defend her decision to publish it .
She has not replied .
This petty affair is a synecdoche for the state of local journalism .
Most local papers exist to amplify the voices of their proprietors and advertisers and other powerful people with whom they wish to stay on good terms .
In this respect they scarcely differ from most of the national media .
But they also contribute to what in Mexico is called caciquismo : the entrenched power of local elites .
This is the real threat to local democracy , not the crumpling of the media empires of arrogant millionaires .
Since May , Roy Greenslade , professor of journalism at City University , has been running a series on the Guardian 's website called " Why local papers count " .
It 's a brave effort , but it demonstrates the opposite of what he sets out to show .
In six months he has managed to provide just one instance of real journalism : a report by the Kentish Express on the inflated costs of upgrading a local road .
Otherwise he appears to have found no example of local papers holding power to account .
There 's one respect in which the local press is confronting power : by campaigning against the free papers published by local authorities .
These , the papers say , are propaganda sheets , which provide a biased view of council business .
Does that sound familiar ?
In his book Flat Earth News , Nick Davies cites a survey of press releases issued across two months by Northumberland county council .
Ninety - six percent of them were turned into stories by local papers .
In many cases the papers copied the releases verbatim ; in no case did they add any information .
They might as well have been published by the council .
The failures of the local press are often blamed on consolidation by the big media corporations , which have squeezed as much money out of their collapsing possessions as they can , leaving no funds for real journalism .
Davies , for example , asked a reporter on a regional paper to keep a diary for a week .
In just five days the reporter published 48 stories .
He came across one original story in that period , but he did n't have time to pursue it , so he let it drop .
Otherwise he just recycled old copy , lifted stories from other papers or simply concocted them .
But this is not the whole reason for the failure of the local press .
The Cambrian News , for instance , is owned by the man who is universally hailed as the only success story in local publishing : Sir Ray Tindle .
His company , which runs 230 papers , is independent , free from debt and booming , but it suffers from many of the diseases that afflict the rest of the press .
When the Iraq war began , Tindle ordered his editors " to ensure that nothing appears in your newspapers which attacks the decision to conduct the war " .
His letter was reproduced in the Totnes Times , with the following comments .
" In a brave move , which could easily be seen by some as censoring the news , Sir Ray ordered that once war in Iraq was declared his newspapers would not carry any more anti-war stories …
As editorial manager of eight of Sir Ray 's titles , I am proud to say I totally agree with his decision . "
It 's true that the vacuity and cowardice of the local papers has been exacerbated by consolidation , profit - seeking , the collapse of advertising revenues and a decline in readership .
But even if they were n't subject to these pressures , they would still do more harm than good .
Local papers defend the powerful because the powerful own and fund them .
I can think of only two local newspapers that consistently hold power to account : the West Highland Free Press and the Salford Star .
Are any others worth saving ?
If so , please let me know .
Yes , we need a press that speaks truth to power , that gives voice to the powerless and fights for local democracy .
But this ain't it .

As Members of Congress we believe that women should have access to a full range of reproductive health care .
Health care reform must not be misused as an opportunity to restrict women ’s access to reproductive health services .
The Stupak - Pitts amendment to H.R. 3962 , The Affordable Healthcare for America Act , represents an unprecedented and unacceptable restriction on women ’s ability to access the full range of reproductive health services to which they are lawfully entitled .
We will not vote for a conference report that contains language that restricts women ’s right to choose any further than current law .
The measure would put Christian Science prayer treatments -- which substitute for or supplement medical treatments -- on the same footing as clinical medicine .
While not mentioning the church by name , it would prohibit discrimination against " religious and spiritual healthcare . " ...
Phil Davis , a senior Christian Science Church official , said prayer treatment was an effective alternative to conventional healthcare .
" We are making the case for this , believing there is a connection between healthcare and spirituality , " said Davis , who distributed 11,000 letters last week to Senate officials urging support for the measure .
" We think this is an important aspect of the solution , when you are talking about not only keeping the cost down , but finding effective healthcare , " he said .
In the early 20th century , the church sought recognition from state regulators so the practitioners would not be prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license .
Criminal courts have convicted Christian Scientists in cases where children have died after visiting prayer healers instead of receiving conventional medical care .
The church says no such incidents have occurred for two decades .
About 90 years ago , private insurance companies began paying for Christian Science prayer treatments , but more recently , managed - care insurers declined reimbursements , insisting on paying for care that produced proven medical results .
The Internal Revenue Service allows the cost of the prayer sessions to be counted among itemized medical expenses for income tax purposes -- one of the only religious treatments explicitly identified as deductible by the IRS .
Some federal medical insurance programs , including those for military families , also reimburse for prayer treatment .
The spiritual healing provision was introduced in the House by Rep. John Shimkus ( R - Ill . ) , whose district includes a Christian Science school , Principia College .
Two committees in the House voted to include the measure in their versions of the overhaul , but Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) stripped it from the consolidated House bill last week after a few members argued it was unconstitutional .
Erwin Chemerinsky , dean of the UC Irvine School of Law , said the provision raised serious questions about government support of religion .
" I think when Congress mandates that health companies provide coverage for prayer , it has the effect of the government advancing religion , " he said .
The big health care reform talk since Saturday night 's passage of the House Bill has been about the attempt of the Republicans with the connivance of 64 anti-choice Democrats to severely restrict -- in fact , to take away -- women 's health options .
By Monday morning 41 progressives had signed a letter to Pelosi vowing to vote against a final bill if it includes the reprehensible Stupak - Pitts anti-choice amendment .
Senior pro-choice Democrats have assured them the anti-choice wording will not be in the final bill .
So with corporately - owned reactionaries like Orrin Hatch , Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham vowing to block the bill as beingprogressive ; with progressives enraged that the bill is n't nearly progressive enough ; and with the Senate 's ultimate weathervane of cluelessness and stupidity , chirping away that she 's pro-choice but notpro-choice , no one has picked up on the Republicans ' one big initiative to fashion the bill into something that would be acceptable to people still living in the 14th Century ... or in Afghanistan in case Obama decides to annex it .
A few days ago thereported on a provision slipped into the Senate bill that " would require insurers to consider covering Christian Science prayer treatments as medical expenses . "
Orrin Hatch is behind the provision , but he was aided by Kennedy and Kerry , the senators from Massachusetts , which is where Christian Science has its world headquarters .
I was diagnosed with cancer around 7 years ago and chose to eschew deadly chemotherapy and surgery and follow a holistic approach .
So far it 's worked really well .
Western medicine does n't recognize it -- at least not in the U.S. ; it 's pretty widely accepted din Europe -- and my insurance company wo n't cover it at all .
It 'll be amusing to watch voodoo treatments and other practices outside the realm of science being covered though .
Harry Reid , like Hatch , a Mormon , is still trying to decide whether or not to include this in the Senate bill .
The " church " has a big time K Street lobbying firm , Mayer Brown ( the 9th largest law firm in the U.S. ) , working on the Senate for them .
Mayer Brown lobbying clients include shady operators like Credit Suisse , J.P. Morgan Chase , AT&T , Chevron , Verizon , TPG Capital , Motorola , and , biggest of all their clients , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
This year Mayer Brown has given large donations to Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) , Peter Roskam ( R- IL ) , and Ethan Hastert ( R - IL ) .

Adam Lambert ’s music video for his single “ For Your Entertainment ” has been released .
The video is exactly what I mean when I say Adam is boring .
The video centers around an underground world of dark sexuality .
Of course what imagery do they use to symbolize dangerous sexuality – Eve .
How do I say this ?
Using
Eve is common , banal , cliche , humdrum , insipid , – or however you want to say it .
Not to mention here is Lambert on the cover of Rolling Stone from June 2009 – get a new snake gimmick .
Eve imagery is the most overused fallback in pop music .
Probably the most iconic Eve embodiment is Britney Spears at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards .
Aalyiah also works the snake in “ We Need a Resolution . ”
Destiny ’s Child wanders around the forest in skimpy outfits for “ Survivor . ”
Jennifer Lopez also evokes natural , animalistic sex appeal in “ Waiting for Tonight ” – which reminds me an awful lot like “ For Your Entertainment . ”
And if you want to talk about music videos about underground “ Dirrty ” sex , look no further than Christina Aguilera ,
or Lady Gaga ‘s “ Love Game . ”
Britney Spears ‘s “ If U Seek Amy ” is a personal favorite since it plays on the idea that a good woman should be a hyper - sexual in the home but wholesome out in the public sphere .
Because really the only thing better than Eve imagery is the use of the virgin / whore dichotomy – i.e. what made Britney a millionaire .
To a lesser degree there is also Janet Jackson ‘s “ All Nite , ”
Rihanna‘s “ Disturbia , ”
Justin Timberlake‘s Sexyback , ”
Enrique Iglesias ‘s “ Tired of Being Sorry , ”
Lindsay Lohan in a club , locked in a cage in her “ Rumors ” video ,
and the end of Madonna ‘s “ Hung Up ”
LASTLY – Adam ’s song sounds an awful lot like Sam Sparro ’s “ Black and Gold . ”
And Sparro works a cane much better than Adam in his video .
Watch Sam ’s video here .
Come on Adam – give me something new , give me something interesting .
I remember with great respect a television interview with her about her husband - he had forgotten his life with her and was smitten with another woman ( also suffering from Alzheimers ) at his care facility .
Justice O'Connor accepted it with grace and love , happy that he was finding comfort with someone , and accepting the cruel fate that denied her that role .
As many times as I 've regretted that Justice O'Connor is no longer on the Court , I 've always admired her willingness to reorganize her priorities to address what 's truly important .
My thoughts and prayers are with her and her family today .

Tuesday was a good day for social and religious conservatives , who have n’t had many of those in the year since Barack Obama was elected president .
But with Republican victories in the governor ’s races in Virginia and New Jersey , and the passing of Maine ’s ballot measure to ban same - sex marriage , they are feeling -- to paraphrase President George W. Bush after his 2004 reelection -- the wind of the American people at their back .
“ We are a nation moving in a conservative direction , ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the Susan B. Anthony List , which supports anti-abortion candidates .
“ Last November when Barack Obama won , there was a sense that there had been a dramatic shift to the left , ” said Gary Bauer , the Christian conservative who is president of the political action committee Campaign for Working Families .
“ I think we saw yesterday , it ’s not 2008 anymore .
There was n’t a big ideological shift ; this is still a center - right country . ”
Bauer and Dannenfelser were joined on a conference call by Brian Brown , director of the National Organization for Marriage , who was celebrating in Portland , Maine , after an effort to legalize same - sex marriage there went down to an unexpectedly lopsided defeat .
After California voters outlawed gay marriage last year , Maine was viewed as an important , and potentially game - changing , battleground for the same - sex marriage movement .
After all , Mainers are considered independent , tolerant of differences and eager to keep government out of their bedrooms .
A win there would have gone far to support the contention by gay rights advocates that it ’s just a matter of time before the country accepts the notion that gays should be allowed to marry .
But voters have now defeated gay marriage in 31 states -- gay activists ' only victories have been in the courts and legislatures -- and social conservatives believe they can snuff out what had started to become conventional wisdom about the inevitability of same - sex marriage .
“ It ’s a crushing blow to those who think same - sex marriage is inevitable , ” Brown said .
“ They were 100 % wrong …
In a deep blue state , when voters had the chance , they voted to protect marriage for a man and a woman . ”
The conservative leaders said from this point on , they are expecting the Republican Party establishment to shape up and get with their program .
They will not tolerate any more races like the closely watched contest in New York ’s 23rd Congressional District , where Republican Party officials chose a pro-gay - marriage , pro-abortion - rights candidate , Dede Scozzafava , to run against Democrat Bill Owens , who opposes gay marriage .
When it became clear that grass - roots Republicans who were turned off by their own candidate would support a third - party candidate -- Doug Hoffman of the Conservative Party -- Scozzafava dropped out and endorsed the Democrat , who won .
( If Tuesday ’s contests were a harbinger of bad things to come for Democrats in 2010 , then perhaps the New York race could be interpreted as a slap at former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who campaigned for Hoffman with the not - so - catchy slogan , “ Hoffman , baby , Hoffman . " )
“ If we had had a candidate who was principled in terms of embracing Republican platform , we would see a Republican being sworn in , ” Dannenfelser said .
“ The real power of the Republican Party is in a burgeoning , grass - roots movement that is very conservative , and the more out of touch they are with their natural base , the more they will lose .
If we have to have that conversation in a high - profile way , so be it . ”
Though the White House has downplayed the notions that Tuesday ’s races were any sort of referendum on the president ’s policies , Bauer is convinced that trouble looms :
“ I think the results yesterday are going to make it harder for all the initiatives that are unpassed -- whether healthcare or cap - and - trade and soon - to - come tax increases .
Those will be more dicey for the White House and congressional leadership .
If you are a red state senator or congressman , there is a lot of second - guessing going on about whether they want to go further out on the limb of voting for these incredible bills .
… That ’s why people who voted for Barack Obama last year voted Republican yesterday . ”

A leading Iranian cleric has warned against the enemy 's plots to damage the Islamic establishment and called for proper counter measures to be taken .
" " We must identify where the enemy seeks to penetrate the Islamic establishment and then counter it , " " said Tehran 's Interim Friday Prayers Leader Ayatollah Mohammad Imami-Kashani .
He touched upon Iran 's great achievements in different fields saying , " " We must realize that aside from enemy media outlets , the rest of the world supports the Islamic and scientific movements in Iran . " " " " When science is founded upon faith and Islam , no one will be able to stop it , " " added the cleric . "
" History has shown that the Islamic civilization , which incorporates science , faith and effort , was taking over the world , when certain parties stepped in and laid claim to the achievements of Muslims .
They proclaimed themselves as the owners of the world and enslaved Muslim countries , " " he said .
"
" The Islamic establishment and the Islamic Republic is an establishment built upon the foundation of Islam … and it has made achievements , " " he added .
Ayatollah Kashani , who serves as a member of the Assembly of Experts , went on ot say that " " it is a pity to see that the rapidly - developing Islamic civilization , which the world has its eyes on , questioned . " " " " Criticism that is intended to help make progress is good , but views that are expressed to belittle ( the ) others are not acceptable in any way . " " ( Source : Press TV )
As the health care debate rages in Washington , one of the fears is that the behemoth bills that are being passed around might contain hidden provisions that can cause great mischief .
While there is a sense of urgency about passing a bill ( any bill ) there is something to be said for taking the time to pick over the details of such important policy .
Case in point – Senator Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) has slipped in a provision to the bill that would require reimbursement for prayer services .
Although not mentioned by name , it is thought that the provision is aimed at Christian Science prayer .
Christian Scientists , based upon the teachings of Mary Baker Eddy , do not believe in medicine – because they do not believe in illness – because they do not believe in reality .
We are purely spiritual beings , they believe , and physical reality is all an illusion , and therefore all illness is as well and is really just a crisis of faith .
Therefore prayer and faith is all that is needed .
Seeking medical attention is actually a failure of faith and will lead to illness or death ( one wonders why any Christian Scientist needs to wear glasses , then ) .
This philosophy worked very well for Eddy , right up until the point where she died .
Christian Scientists have been tireless in promoting their spiritual prayer as legitimate medical interventions for years .
They have pressured some private insurance companies to reimburse for their prayers , although this trend has reversed recently with managed care .
They have also lobbied for state laws to protect their practitioners from being prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license .
Worst of all , they successfully lobbied the Federal government to cover Christian Science prayer for military personnel .
Now they are at work trying to exploit health care reform to further their agenda .
The LA Times reports :
The spiritual healing provision was introduced in the House by Rep. John Shimkus ( R - Ill . ) , whose district includes a Christian Science school , Principia College .
The measure is also supported by Senator John Kerry and the late Edward Kennedy – both senators from Massachusetts , home of the headquarters of the church .
This proposed measure raises several concerns .
First – prayer is not legitimate medicine , despite the church ’s insistence that it is .
People are free , of course , to prayer for whomever they wish .
But the publicly supported and paid for health care system must be based upon reliable evidence .
Otherwise there is no mechanism to ensure a standard of care or to limit costs .
Payments for Christian Science prayer specifically will not add much to overall health care costs directly , but any money wasted at this time should not be tolerated .
But of course there is nothing in the provision that limits reimbursement to Christian Science prayer – it simply says that reimbursement cannot discriminate against religious practices .
This would open the door for any individual or organization to charge the government for any religious practice that it claims is meant to treat illness .
This would be open - season for quackery .
This provision would also further legitimize a practice that is dangerous and potentially fatal .
There are numerous cases , for example , of children who were allowed to die horrible deaths at the hands of Christian Science practitioners ( and other faith healers ) .
There is also , of course , the issue of the separation of church and state .
Our constitution entreats the federal government ( and by extension the states ) that they “ shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . ”
Paying for religious prayer would certainly qualify .
The Center for Inquiry is pushing a campaign to write your congressmen and senators to oppose this provision .
Unfortunately , Christian Scientists already have a well - organized lobby , and they have written far more letters to Congress than those opposing the provision .
Letter writing is important , but it is unlikely we will win this battle with numbers .
I urge you to write your representative none - the - less , as well - reasoned opposition will likely carry some weight .
Already the provision is having some problems .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi stripped the provision from the House bill over fear that it was unconstitutional .
However , Hatch is a powerful Senator and such provisions have a tendency to sneak back into bills as they wander from committee to committee .
This means we need to remain vigilant , to keep the issue in the public eye , and make it clear that it is unacceptable for the government to pay for prayer as a substitute for legitimate health care .
In fact , we should use this opportunity to go on the offensive – to ask not only for this provision to stay out of any health care reform bill , but for an alternate provision to be put in place saying that the government will not reimburse for prayer .
Maybe we can reverse the military ’s reimbursement for prayer services , or the IRS deduction for prayer as a medical expense .
My colleagues and I are trying to keep an eye on this and similar measures as health care reform blazes forward , but it ’s not easy , and ultimately we will need the support of the “ reality - based community ” to protect health care from this kind of dangerous quackery .
Scientists prepare the Mini-Research Module 2 ( MRM 2 ) " Poisk " for flight at Kazakhstan 's Baikonur cosmodrome on November 3 .
A Soyuz rocket carrying the new Russian - made module for the International Space Station blasted off from the Baikonur space base in Kazakhstan .
A Soyuz rocket carrying a new Russian - made module for the International Space Station blasted off on Tuesday from the Baikonur space base in Kazakhstan , television pictures showed .
The Poisk ( Search ) module , also known as the Mini-Research Module 2 , will provide additional facilities for scientific experiments aboard the orbiting space station , Russia 's space agency said in a statement .
Russian news agencies quoted the space agency as saying that the launch had been successful , and state television images showed the rocket flying smoothly into the night sky .
The unmanned Progress spacecraft carrying the new module , along with food and water supplies , is due to dock with the ISS on Thursday at 1544 GMT .

UPDATE : In a strange twist , Climate Depot reports that Brochure reveals Gore accurately cited scientist ’s prediction of ice - free Arctic —
It is the Scientist who has the explaining to do — not Gore
Marc Morano writes via email –
This is turning into a war of phrases .
Maslowski tells the UK Telegraph : “ I was very explicit that we were talking about ‘ near - ice - free conditions ’ and not ‘ completely ice - free conditions ’ ( as Gore claimed ) in the northern ocean . ”
Read details here
From the “ Inconvenient Truths ” department , the Times is reporting that Gore got called out for saying older figures on Arctic sea ice as “ fresh ” when they were not , and misrepresenting what the scientist actually said .
This latest gaff makes three in a row for Mr. Gore , who recently made bizarre claims of the leaked CRU emails being “ 10 years old ” , when there were many , many in the last decade , some in the last month .
Gore also recently stated on national television recently that the Earth ’s mantle was “ several million degrees ” , making it likely hotter than our sun .
As indicated by the Times article , his latest gaffe has not gone unnoticed by the MSM .
Excerpts of the Times article :
There are many kinds of truth .
Al Gore was poleaxed by an inconvenient one yesterday .
The former US Vice - President , who became an unlikely figurehead for the green movement after narrating the Oscar - winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth , became entangled in a new climate change “ spin ” row .
Mr Gore , speaking at the Copenhagen climate change summit , stated the latest research showed that the Arctic could be completely ice - free in five years .
…
Mr Gore told the conference : “ These figures are fresh .
Some of the models suggest to Dr [ Wieslav ] Maslowski that there is a 75 per cent chance that the entire north polar ice cap , during the summer months , could be completely ice - free within five to seven years . ”
However , the climatologist whose work Mr Gore was relying upon dropped the former Vice - President in the water with an icy blast .
“ It ’s unclear to me how this figure was arrived at , ” Dr Maslowski said .
“ I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this . ”
Mr Gore ’s office later admitted that the 75 per cent figure was one used by Dr Maslowksi as a “ ballpark figure ” several years ago in a conversation with Mr Gore .
…
“ This is an exaggeration that opens the science up to criticism from sceptics , ” Professor Jim Overland , a leading oceanographer at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said .
“ You really do n’t need to exaggerate the changes in the Arctic . ”
…
[ Maslowksi said ] “ I was very explicit that we were talking about near - ice - free conditions and not completely ice - free conditions in the northern ocean .
I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this , ” he said .
“ It ’s unclear to me how this figure was arrived at , based on the information I provided to Al Gore ’s office . ”

Ruby ’s success in several domains is arguably due to domain - specific languages ( DSLs ) that generate code : we have tools that generate HTML , CSS , and Javascript , and so we get to write web applications in ruby ; ditto SQL and database applications .
There are some less well known examples in the simulation and embedded real - time domains , with native code generation .
Two other domains are ripe for the same treatment : animation and network programming .
My talk focuses on these four cases , two existing and two hypothetical .

Tenemos diputados obedientes , dependientes y flojos .
Nuestra clase política deja mucho qué desear .
Peña Nieto y dos o tres gobernadores más tienen controlada la Cámara Baja , los legisladores no leen las iniciativas , siguen órdenes , se perpetuan en el poder por arreglos con sus líderes bajo un sistema electoral deficiente … y mi querida y admirada Denise Maerker considera que todo esto se va a terminar ¡ofreciéndoles la reelección !
El planteamiento tiene lógica : al estar sujetos a la reelección empezarán a pensar más en los ciudadanos que los ( re ) eligen en las urnas que en los dirigentes que los hacen candidatos desde la cúpula .
Pero el ideal planteado por Denise de “ cambiar las reglas para que la iniciativa , el compromiso con causas , el voto consciente , la preocupación por el electorado , el cuidado de la imagen pública , el respeto por la legalidad y las instituciones sean factores que pesen en el comportamiento de los legisladores ” considero que es pulverizado ante las perversiones del juego electoral en México , donde la voluntad del ciudadano es apaleada por el dinero público que se gasta a favor del partido en el poder , el uso faccioso de medios de comunicación , las componendas con el narco y gracias a una autoridad electoral que lo permite todo .
En este contexto , la alternancia sería fruto de un milagro en un escenario de reelección : un candidato con excepcional carisma que pueda encontrar gran simpatía entre sus electores , pero que reciba patrocinios de la iniciativa privada y/o de gobiernos de su partido en otros niveles o entidades para hacer frente al cacicazgo local que domina el grueso de los comicios en México .
Orilla a que para vencer a los intereses insanos para la democracia , haya que atarse a otros intereses insanos de la democracia .
Denise repite que “ Carlos Loret de Mola y la gran mayoría de nuestros lectores prefieren básicamente no moverle para que no acabemos peor ” .
Y me obliga a repetir que nada más lejos del inmovilismo que plantear que la ruta de darle más poder al ciudadano — deseable a todas luces — primero debe hacer escala en cumplir a cabalidad las leyes vigentes : frenar los abusos del dinero público en las campañas , proteger la libertad de expresión y exigir al IFE y al TEPJF que sean árbitros más severos , factores que no se disiparán con la simple aprobación de la reelección , pero que sí podrían dar un primer peldaño de poder legítimo a la ciudadanía que , entonces sí , bien podría ser reforzado por la apertura a la reelección .
No antes , porque animaría la perversión .
SACIAMORBOS
En cualquier caso , la iniciativa de reelección de legisladores y presidentes municipales , el veto parcial para el Presidente e iniciativa preferente llega al Congreso antes del 15 de diciembre .
Hi. I'm David McCandless .
I 'm a visual and data journalist .
I run the blog InformationIsBeautiful .net .
There I take ideas , issues and data and try to make them into easy - to - digest and hopefully beautiful infographics and images .
I like to use information design to help me understand the world and help me sift through the huge amounts of data and statistics that seem to deluge me every day .
I hope they can help you too .
My book of information graphics , The Visual Miscellaneum , is out next week in the US , and in February in the UK .
Advert over .
I 'm going to be exploring some of the Guardian 's data visually every week .
Pushing facts , data , statistics into diagrams , charts and maps to see if there are any unexpected patterns , interesting stories or hidden connections .
If you have any ideas , or datasets , or thoughts for images , please email me at InformationIsBeautiful [ at ] gmail [ dot ] com .
BNP Profiling
A couple of weeks ago the BNP 's membership data was leaked .
This allowed the Datablog to create visual map of BNP members across the UK .
I was curious about the relationship between BNP membership and non-white populations .
Were the highest pockets in areas with large non-white populations ?
Could the data predict where the next pocket of racial tension might erupt ?
You can see for yourself in the visualisation above .
What I found interesting was that BNP membership in multi-cultural London was practically zero .
But in Essex there was a strong correlation between non-white population and BNP pockets .
Also , there 's significant BNP membership around areas of non-white communities : large swathes of Norfolk , West Wales , and the North East .
Is this evidence of ' white flight ' ?
Or just fear generated by seeing communities from afar ?
Deadly Drugs
Last week , the government has sacked its most senior drugs advisor , Dr Professor Nutt , after he claimed cannabis was no more harmful than alcohol .
And that horse - riding was riskier than taking ecstasy .
( Technically he 's right .
The lifetime odds of dying from ecstasy overdose is 1 in 17,803 .
The risk of dying from horse - riding is around double - 1 in 7,833 . )
Taking the science behind his statement and mashing it up with press coverage of drug risks creates an interesting picture .
Drug coverage compared Photograph : guardian.co.uk
The government 's own data backs up Nutt 's assertions .
Cannabis seems pretty risk - free , mortality - wise , and its dangers are over - reported in the popular media .
Meanwhile , fatalities from legal drugs like paracetamol and anti-depressants are higher than most illicit drugs combined .
And those fatalities mostly go unreported .
But this the whole picture ?
Using raw mortality figures is a bit coarse .
Obviously , far more people take paracetamol and alcohol than ecstasy and cannabis .
So logically you would expect more deaths for paracetamol and alcohol .
To give more accurate picture of risk , drug deaths should really be taken as a proportion of users .
If you factor in estimated users , a different picture emerges .
Drug deaths compared
The danger of cocaine and solvent use becomes clear .
Cannabis , however , still remains relatively risk free .
And paracetamol extremely safe .
Interestingly , the data reveals that anti-depressants , especially those from the SSRI ( Prozac - like ) family , have the same fatality rates as ecstasy .
Feeling happy obviously has its price ...
Here is the spreadsheet of data for you to explore .
Important notes on the data
• The cannabis death 's figure is a bit dubious in my opinion .
Firstly , how can you die from cannabis ?
It 's extremely non -toxic .
There has never been a single documented case of fatal cannabis overdose .
Also , the government 's own figures do n't tally .
While drug figures from the Office Of National Statistics register 19 cannabis related deaths , the mortality stats from the same office log only 1 death .
• The press reports figures are a bit coarse , but consistent .
I used the ' drug name ' + death as a search via Google News timeline .
Here 's an example .
Check out the spreadsheet of data to see the rest
• Paracetamol deaths may be squewed a bit by the fact that 's it a very common method of suicide .
• Number of users per drug are estimated , ballpark figures .
You can see my sources and workings - out on the spreadsheet .
Can you do something with this data ?

Mr. Wright detects an evolution toward an image of God as a more beneficient and universal deity , one whose moral compass favors compassion for humans of whatever race or tribe , one who is now firmly in the antigenocide camp .
Mr. Wright ’s focus is not on whether God exists , but he does suggest that changing perceptions of God reflect a moral direction to history  and that this in turn perhaps reflects some kind of spiritual force .
“ To the extent that ‘ god ’ grows , that is evidence  maybe not massive evidence , but some evidence  of higher purpose , ” Mr. Wright says .
Another best - seller this year , Karen Armstrong ’s “ The Case for God , ” likewise does n’t posit a Grand pa - in - the - Sky ; rather , she sees God in terms of an ineffable presence that can be neither proven nor disproven in any rational sense .
To Ms. Armstrong , faith belongs to the realm of life ’s mysteries , beyond the world of reason , and people on both sides of the “ God gap ” make the mistake of interpreting religious traditions too literally .
“ Over the centuries people in all cultures discovered that by pushing their reasoning powers to the limit , stretching language to the end of its tether , and living as selflessly and compassionately as possible , they experienced a transcendence that enabled them to affirm their suffering with serenity and courage , ” Ms. Armstrong writes .
Her book suggests that religion is not meant to regrow lost limbs , but that it may help some amputees come to terms with their losses .
Whatever one ’s take on God , there ’s no doubt that religion remains one of the most powerful forces in the world .
Today , millions of people will be giving thanks to Him  or Her or It .
Another new book , “ The Faith Instinct , ” by my Times colleague Nicholas Wade , suggests a reason for the durability of faith : humans may be programmed for religious belief , because faith conferred evolutionary advantages in primitive times .
That does n’t go to the question of whether God exists , but it suggests that religion in some form may be with us for eons to come .
I ’m hoping that the latest crop of books marks an armistice in the religious wars , a move away from both religious intolerance and irreligious intolerance .
That would be a sign that perhaps we , along with God , are evolving toward a higher moral order .
After seeing our rigging tutorial , a number of you asked me how we calculate our vertex weights .
However , many of you reading the blog are probably asking yourselves a more basic question :
What are vertex weights ?
When we first load the rabbit , it 's a static model : just a collection of triangles with an image wrapped around it .
Next , we create the skeleton , which is a set of line segments ( bones ) .
Finally , we get to the tricky part .
How do we attach the model to the skeleton so that they both move in the same way ?
For every vertex ( triangle point ) in the model , we have to figure out which bones it should be attached to , and how strong each attachment should be .
This information is stored in the vertex weighting .
Below you can see the static model , the model with a skeleton , and the area of influence for each bone .
Using the vertex weights , we can match the model 's pose to the skeleton's .
Whenever a bone moves , we can apply the bone 's movement to all vertices that are attached to it , modulated by the attachment strength .
The attachment strength is important for smooth deformation at joints , where vertices are attached to multiple bones .
Here is an example of pose matching using vertex weights :
Usually these weights are painstakingly applied by hand , using a virtual ' paintbrush ' or some kind of ' envelope ' system .
However , this is a long , tedious process , and I did n't want to force Aubrey ( and modders ) to go through it if it could be automated .
How do we calculate them automatically ?
The most obvious way to calculate vertex weights is to attach each vertex to the closest bones , weighted by distance .
At first glance the results look ok , but if you move the bones around , you start to see problems .
For example , the bones in one foot can affect vertices in the other because they 're in close proximity , even though they 're not connected .
Clearly we 're can't just use simple Cartesian distance -- we need the distance of the shortest path within the volume of the model .
For example , the distance from the right foot to the left foot should be about equal to the distance from the right foot to the right shoulder , because the path must go up one leg and down the other .
When working with volumetric calculations , it 's often helpful to voxellize the model .
Voxellization turns the model into a 3D cube structure that approximates the model 's shape .
I found that the easiest way to think about this was in terms of heat .
We can treat each bone as a heating filament , and then diffuse the heat through the voxel model .
Diffusion is pretty easy using a voxel model -- we can just set each voxel 's heat to a weighted average of its neighbors ' heat , and repeat as necessary until it diffuses completely .
The final heat distribution is proportional to the shortest path from the bone to any point in the model , so we can get the final vertex weights by just comparing the heat from each bone at each vertex .
Here is a picture of the foot bone 's ' filament ' , the foot 's heat distribution , and its final vertex weights :
I found this algorithm to be intuitive and easy to use , and it eliminates the most tedious part of character modeling .
I am very happy with this technique !
Confusingly , there 's an existing skinning algorithm called ' bone heat ' , but it has a very confusing implementation , and incorrectly uses surface diffusion instead of volumetric .
If I had to name my techique I would call it " volumetric heat diffusion " .
Here is the rabbit posed in various ways using automatic vertex weights :
There are a couple of ways I can think of to improve this technique , but have n't implemented them yet because they 're not urgent .
First , the heat diffusion is a massively parallel task , so it could be sped up by orders of magnitude using the GPU .
Second , it would be useful to have some interface to make the joint blending harder or softer in specific areas by using different power functions on the heat values .
Do you have any more questions about the vertex weights , or ideas to improve it ?

Centralized monetary authorities enjoy a privileged position in the current monetary system .
People tend to view the economists and politicians at these institutions as demigods , individuals who if given enough resources will ensure that the economy continues an ever - advancing and smooth trajectory .
However , unlike the Greek demigods of yore , today 's central bankers are mere mortals who must work within the confines and constraints of the institution that they head .
While they present an aura of invincibility , the truth is that the effectiveness of their policies faces severe limits .
Conventionally , a central bank pursues its goal of price stability by adjusting the money supply to alter the discount rate indirectly , thus making lending more or less attractive .
The recent crisis draws attention to a secondary function of these banks — namely , as a lender of last resort .
After the Lehman Brothers collapse of September 2008 , central banks of the world intervened in a united effort to swap bad , illiquid assets from the private banking sector for higher - quality government debt .
While this process proceeded unhindered in its early stages , central banks soon found themselves with declining balances of higher - quality debt to swap .
The lone tool remaining to combat the liquidity crisis was a quantitative expansion — increasing the money supply , and thus making fresh liquidity available to the banking system for retiring its liabilities .
Through this qualitative expansion , central banks were able to bailout domestic banking systems that were heavily indebted in domestic currencies , such as the American system .
However , other economies that relied on foreign funding were not quite as fortunate .
The insolvency of the Central Bank of Iceland late last year brought this issue to light ; several additional central banks are still at risk .
Central banks that are only able to inflate the money supply in their own domestic currency face significant challenges when faced with banking systems heavily indebted in foreign - denominated liabilities .
As the recent Icelandic example has demonstrated , the possibility of central bank insolvency creates the opportunity for real banking reform .
When Central Banks Go Broke
Murray Rothbard , in his book The Case Against the Fed , argues that a private , free - banking industry is disciplined by the threat of a bank run , which keeps it from overissuing its liabilities in excess of its assets .
A central - bank - led fractional - reserve system is , however , under no such constraint .
Fiat money grants the central monetary authority an advantage : its own liabilities — primarily the monetary base — will never be forced into redemption for anything other than the same nominal units they are denominated in .
Guido Hülsmann explains this peculiarity , using the British pound as an example :
Until 1914 , and then between 1925 and 1931 , the Bank of England redeemed its £ 20 notes into a quantity of gold that was called " the sum of £ 20 . "
Today it redeems these notes into other notes of the same kind .
The point is that in the old days the expression " the sum of £ 20 " had a different legal meaning than it has today .
At the time it designated some five ounces of gold .
Today it means something different .
The suspension of payments has turned the expression " the sum of £ 20 " into a self - referential tautology — it now designates £ 20 paper notes .
The notes that promise payment of " the sum of £ 20 " do no more than promise payment in like notes . [ 1 ]
The result is that liabilities may be retired by inflating the money supply and not through sacrificing any real savings , whether they be a commodity ( such as gold ) or a foreign currency .
This central bank 's ability to effortlessly inflate away domestic liabilities has given rise to its oft - cited function as a lender of last resort .
Hence , as banks find themselves facing illiquidity , entrepreneurs assume that the central bank is capable of moving in swiftly to expand the money supply and head off a crisis .
Today , as the global money markets have taken on a more reserved tone , economic turbulence has caused many financial institutions to experience a binding liquidity constraint .
Many central banks have thus taken on the role of market makers to ensure that liquidity remains high enough to keep the companies facing this constraint from becoming insolvent .
Ignore for the moment whether artificially propping up companies that have made an entrepreneurial error in the past and are now facing insolvency should be rescued .
The really interesting question becomes : is this possible in all cases , as entrepreneurs commonly assume ?
Recently , the Fed was nearing insolvency as it used its own assets to bail - out a faltering financial system .
As the Fed swapped high - quality government debt for subprime debt that was burdening the banking sector , the central bank exhausted a large amount of its assets and approached its own funding constraint .
At this point , the Fed adopted a simple solution : it expanded the supply of money available to the banking sector , thus allowing it to retire its dollar - denominated liabilities .
Since the liabilities that the central bank wanted to retire were denominated in that same domestic currency , it had the ability to retire them simply by expanding the money supply .
In this way , the Fed averted a liquidity crisis with no significant difficulty ( leaving aside the hidden damages associated with all money expansions ) .
A Global Problem
What if a banking system is not saddled with debt that is denominated in its domestic currency , but rather debt denominated in a foreign currency ?
In this case , the central monetary authority is limited in its role as a lender of last resort .
It can enact regulatory changes that affect reserve requirements , capital adequacy ratios , etc .
It can pursue open - market operations using its balance sheet assets to offset transactions .
Or , it can inflate its own money supply .
Its assets held in foreign liabilities become the lynchpin in maintaining the solvency of this type of banking system .
When global liquidity is seriously restrained , economies heavily denominated in foreign currencies quickly feel the strain .
The Icelandic banking system is the most recent example of this problem .
The Central Bank of Iceland lacked the ability to inflate in any currency other than the domestic króna ; as a result , Iceland 's banking sector — which was heavily indebted in foreign liabilities ( primarily Japanese yen and Swiss francs ) — succumbed to insolvency .
As liquidity evaporated in the fall of 2008 , global institutions accustomed to continually rolling over debts faced the challenge of having to pay off their liabilities .
However , they had to do so without simultaneously taking out offsetting debt positions ( that is , extending the maturity by rolling over existing debt ) .
These liabilities were due in foreign currencies , so Iceland 's domestic banking system was unable to fulfill its debt obligations .
The central bank tried to be the lender of last resort , but it was left with few options .
It lacked foreign - denominated assets with which to fund the struggling financial sector .
In the end , the system required currency swaps and lines of credit by friendly nations to stave off a devastating financial collapse .
As a result , the Central Bank of Iceland became the first central bank of a developed country in the twenty - first century to become insolvent . [ 2 ]
Iceland had a foreign - denominated debt - to - GDP ratio of between 60 and 70 percent during the height of its boom .
Several countries today are marked by no less extreme levels , including many eastern European countries — chiefly , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , and Serbia — which all face foreign - denominated debt - to - GDP ratios that are higher than 66 percent .
Most of these countries have already received IMF loans to ease the pressures caused by this imbalance .
A renewed bout of financial turmoil may aggravate the liquidity constraint caused by this foreign - denominated debt .
These countries may end up insolvent once again if these banking systems prove to be too over - leveraged in foreign - denominated debt to be sustainable .
Conclusion
Central banks enjoy a revered position in discussions on monetary matters .
At their disposal are a seemingly endless array of tools and weapons ready to correct any market " imbalance " that threatens economic stability .
However , these institutions are only as useful as the assets they represent .
Expansionary monetary policies cannot fix all problems that a central bank faces .
Countries faced with banking sectors heavily indebted in foreign - denominated liabilities will eventually find the central bank ( which lured them to these positions ) to be impotent .
Jésus Huerta de Soto demonstrates in his magisterial work Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles that the current banking system enjoys the privileged legal provision of being able to treat deposit accounts as though they were loans .
A central bank sustains this fractional - reserve system by ensuring that an illiquid banking industry will have adequate liquidity in times of banking crises .
The possibility of an insolvent central bank , however , bypasses the question of whether the central bank should be abolished and concludes that it will , in certain instances , abolish itself as insolvency renders it helpless .
Banking systems heavily indebted in foreign - denominated currencies are especially vulnerable to this possibility , simply because central banks are only able to bailout domestically denominated debt obligations .
A well - known adage states that " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . "
Economists have long claimed that central planners are necessary to ensure economic stability .
Their looming bankruptcies could end up exposing the sterility of this very function .
Let 's hope that once these monetary authorities are exposed as broken , they will be fixed in light of the true needs and demands of a prosperous economic order .
Free banking , operating under established legal principles coupled with the private production of money , will ensure that an oversized banking industry does not develop .
Neither will it rely on the fallacy that an omnipotent centralized monetary authority is always on guard , ready to save capitalism from its own excesses .

Now Colonel Gaddafi wants to ' abolish ' Switzerland : Dictator files bizarre motion with the U.N .
Bizarre request : Gaddafi , has filed a motion with the U.N. saying Switzerland should be wiped off the map and split among France , Italy and Germany
Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi is set to ask the United Nations to ' abolish ' Switzerland and share the land among its neighbouring countries .
The eccentric dictator has filed a motion with the U.N. saying the Alpine state should be wiped off the map and split among France , Italy and Germany .
Gaddafi is set to present his bizarre plan when Libya takes over the year - long presidency of the U.N. general Assembly on September 15 .
He first mentioned his idea at the G8 summit in Italy in July .
' Switzerland is a world mafia and not a state , ' he said .
' It is formed of an Italian community that should return to Italy , another German community that should return to Germany , and a third French community that should return to France . '
The Swiss Foreign Ministry described it as a single - minded campaign against Swiss interests .
Swiss MP Christa Markwalder , told the Swiss TV news programme 10 vor 10 this week : ' We are concerned that Libya will attempt to use its year - long presidency of the U.N. General Assembly to damage Switzerland 's reputation . '
Relations between Switzerland and Libya crumbled after Gaddafi's son Hannibal , 33 , and his pregnant wife were arrested in Geneva a year ago accused of assaulting a hotel chamber maid .
Two days after the arrest the couple were freed on bail after the complaint against them was dropped , but Gaddafi still hit back by withdrawing five billion dollars from Swiss banks , closing Swiss businesses and arresting Swiss nationals in Libya .
Gaddfi said in a statement : Switzerland 'is formed of an Italian community that should return to Italy , another German community that should return to Germany , and a third French community that should return to France '
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice yesterday challenged the Libyan leader to behave himself during his upcoming first - ever U.N. visit .
Gaddafi is among the world leaders expected to attend the 192 - nation U.N. General Assembly and possibly other high - level meetings in late September , including a U.S. - sponsored session on nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament to be held by the 15 - nation Security Council and chaired by President Barack Obama .
Warning : U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice challenged the Libyan leader to behave himself during his first - ever U.N. visit
Rice , speaking as the incoming president of the U.N. Security Council this month , cited broad U.S. anger over Libya 's enthusiastic homecoming for Abdelbaset Al Megrahi , the convicted Lockerbie bomber who was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds last month .
' It goes without saying that virtually every American has been offended by the reception accorded to Mr Megrahi in Libya upon his return from the U.K. , ' said Rice .
Gaddafi , elected to head the African Union this year , has been on a multi - year quest to repair his international image .
But United States Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice , said on Wednesday that the forthcoming UN meeting would be devoted solely to disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
She added : ' It would be irrelevant and misplaced for any head of state to talk about unrelated subjects . '
The Libyan strongman , who celebrated his 40th year as ruler of the oil - rich North African country on Monday , has denounced terrorism and weapons of mass destruction .
He is known for hours - long , rambling speeches , but Susan Rice said such rhetoric would n't be tolerated .
She said that most nations have assured her their leader 's remarks will be brief .
' We expect no less from President Gaddafi should he come , ' she added .
Fertility and living standards
Go forth and multiply a lot less
Oct 29th 2009
From The Economist print edition
Lower fertility is changing the world for the better
SOMETIME in the next few years ( if it has n’t happened already ) the world will reach a milestone : half of humanity will be having only enough children to replace itself .
That is , the fertility rate of half the world will be 2.1 or below .
This is the “ replacement level of fertility ” , the magic number that causes a country ’s population to slow down and eventually to stabilise .
According to the United Nations population division , 2.9 billion people out of a total of 6.5 billion were living in countries at or below this point in 2000 - 05 .
The number will rise to 3.4 billion out of 7 billion in the early 2010s and to over 50 % in the middle of the next decade .
The countries include not only Russia and Japan but Brazil , Indonesia , China and even south India .
The move to replacement - level fertility is one of the most dramatic social changes in history .
It manifested itself in the violent demonstrations by students against their clerical rulers in Iran this year .
It almost certainly contributed to the rising numbers of middle - class voters who backed the incumbent governments of Indonesia and India .
It shows up in rural Malaysia in richer , emptier villages surrounded by mechanised farms .
And everywhere , it is changing traditional family life by enabling women to work and children to be educated .
At a time when Malthusian alarms are ringing because of environmental pressures , falling fertility may even provide a measure of reassurance about global population trends .
The fertility rate is a hypothetical , almost conjectural number .
It is not the same as the birth rate , which is the number of children born in a year as a share of the total population .
Rather , it represents the number of children an average woman is likely to have during her childbearing years , conventionally taken to be 15 - 49 .
If there were no early deaths , the replacement rate would be 2.0 ( actually , fractionally higher because fewer girls are born than boys ) .
Two parents are replaced by two children .
But a daughter may die before her childbearing years , so the figure has to allow for early mortality .
Since child mortality is higher in poor countries , the replacement fertility rate is higher there , too .
In rich countries it is about 2.1 .
In poor ones it can go over 3.0 .
The global average is 2.33 .
By about 2020 , the global fertility rate will dip below the global replacement rate for the first time .
Modern Malthusians tend to discount the significance of falling fertility .
They believe there are too many people in the world , so for them , it is the absolute number that matters .
And that number is still rising , by a forecast 2.4 billion over the next 40 years .
Populations can rise while fertility declines because of inertia , which matters a lot in demography .
If , because of high fertility in earlier generations , there is a bulge of women of childbearing years , more children will be born , though each mother is having fewer children .
There will be more , smaller families .
Assuming fertility falls at current rates , says the UN , the world ’s population will rise from 6.8 billion to 9.2 billion in 2050 , at which point it will stabilise ( see chart 1 ) .
Behind this is a staggering fertility decline .
In the 1970s only 24 countries had fertility rates of 2.1 or less , all of them rich .
Now there are over 70 such countries , and in every continent , including Africa .
Between 1950 and 2000 the average fertility rate in developing countries fell by half from six to three — three fewer children in each family in just 50 years .
Over the same period , Europe went from the peak of the baby boom to the depth of the baby bust and its fertility also fell by almost half , from 2.65 to 1.42 — but that was a decline of only 1.23 children .
The fall in developing countries now is closer to what happened in Europe during 19th - and early 20th - century industrialisation .
But what took place in Britain over 130 years ( 1800 - 1930 ) took place in South Korea over just 20 ( 1965 -85 ) .
Things are moving even faster today .
Fertility has dropped further in every South - East Asian country ( except the Philippines ) than it did in Japan .
The rate in Bangladesh fell by half from six to three in only 20 years ( 1980 to 2000 ) .
The same decline took place in Mauritius in just ten ( 1963-73 ) .
Most sensational of all is the story from Iran .
When the clerical regime took over in 1979 , the mullahs , apparently believing their flock should go forth and multiply , abolished the country ’s family - planning system .
Fertility rose , reaching seven in 1984 .
Yet by the 2006 census the average fertility rate had fallen to a mere 1.9 , and just 1.5 in Tehran .
From fertility that is almost as high as one can get to below replacement level in 22 years : social change can hardly happen faster .
No wonder the explosion on the streets of Iran this year seemed like a clash between two worlds : 15 - 29 year - olds , one - third of the population , better educated and with different expectations , against the established regime and the traditionalists .
Why has fertility fallen so fast , so widely ?
Malthus himself thought richer people would have more children and , as any biologist will tell you , animal populations increase when there is more food around .
To understand why wealthy people differ from well - fed animals , imagine yourself a dirt - poor ( male ) peasant 50 years ago .
Your fields are in the middle of nowhere .
Your village has no school , hospital or government services , certainly no pensions .
Few goods come into it from outside , though disease is rampant and security fragile .
Ploughing and reaping are done by hand .
But if the harvest is normal , you usually have enough to go round .
In these circumstances , the benefit of an extra pair of hands to gather the harvest outweighs the cost of feeding an extra mouth ( which anyway falls on your wife more than you ) .
And when you can no longer work in the fields , your children will be the only ones to look after you .
In such a society , all the incentives point to having large families .
The abandoned hamlet
Now imagine you are a bit richer .
You may have moved to a town , or your village may have grown .
Schools , markets and factories are within reach .
And suddenly , the incentives change .
A tractor can gather the harvest better than children .
Your wife may get a factory job — and now her lost wages must be set against the benefits of another baby .
Education , thrift and a stake in the future become more important , and these middle - class virtues go hand in hand with smaller families .
Education costs money , so you may not be able to afford a large family .
Perhaps the state provides a pension and you no longer need children to look after you .
And perhaps your wife is no longer willing to bear endless offspring .
Higher living standards , better communications and more education enable you to rely on markets and public services , not just yourself and your family .
Macroeconomic research bears out this picture .
Fertility starts to drop at an annual income per person of $ 1,000 - 2,000 and falls until it hits the replacement level at an income per head of $ 4,000 - 10,000 a year ( see chart 2 ) .
This roughly tracks the passage from poverty to middle - income status and from an agrarian society to a modern one .
Thereafter fertility continues at or below replacement until , for some , it turns up again .
The link between living standards and fertility exists within countries , too .
India ’s poorest state , Bihar , has a fertility rate of 4 ; richer Tamil Nadu and Kerala have rates below 2 .
Shanghai has had a fertility rate of less than 1.7 since 1975 ; in Guizhou , China ’s poorest province , the rate is 2.2 .
So strong is the link between wealth and fertility that the few countries where fertility is not falling are those torn apart by war , such as Congo , Liberia and Sierra Leone , where living standards have not risen .
Family research adds detail to this sketch .
Indonesia ’s Family Life Survey showed that , on average , each birth reduced by a fifth the likelihood that a woman would have a job — lowering household income and pushing some families into poverty .
So smaller families made middle - class status more likely .
Between 1974 and 1996 , Bangladesh turned a district called Matlab into a giant demographic experiment : some villages and households got family planning , others did not .
According to one study of the results , fertility in the areas that received help declined by around 15 % more than in those that did not .
And over the two decades of the experiment , indicators of the well - being of women and their children — health , earnings , household assets and so on — were all higher in the villages that got the planning .
Does this suggest that lower fertility causes wealth , or that wealth lowers fertility ?
It would be better to say that the two things go together .
What parents want
The link between wealth and fertility does not explain everything .
In some countries , poor women have the same number of children as rich ones .
This suggests that other factors are at work .
The most obvious is that many people in poor countries want fewer children , and family planning helps them get their wish .
A surprising amount is known about how many children parents want , thanks to a series of surveys by the Demographic and Health Surveys programme .
The picture it paints is of huge numbers of unplanned pregnancies .
In Brazil , for example , the wanted fertility rate in 1996 ( the most recent year available ) was 1.8 ; the actual fertility rate then was 2.5 .
In India the wanted rate in 2006 was 1.9 , the actual one , 2.7 .
In Ghana the figures for 2003 were 3.7 and 4.4 .
The rule seems to be that women want one child fewer than they are having ( except in some rich countries , where they say they want more ) .
One study in 2002 estimated that as many as a quarter of all pregnancies in developing countries in the 1990s were unintended .
Yet another found that more African women say they want to use contraceptives but cannot get them ( 25 m ) than actually use them ( 18 m ) .
Unmet demand in turn implies that fertility in some countries could be even lower than it actually is if more family planning were available .
The proportion of women using contraception in Latin America and East Asia is four times the African rate .
That points to another big reason why fertility is falling : the spread of female education .
Go back to the countries where fertility has fallen fastest and you will find remarkable literacy programmes .
As early as 1962 , for example , 80 % of young women in Mauritius could read and write .
In Iran in 1976 , only 10 % of rural women aged 20 to 24 were literate .
Now that share is 91 % , and Iran not only has one of the best - educated populations in the Middle East but the one in which men and women have the most equal educational chances .
Iranian girls aged 15 - 19 have roughly the same number of years of schooling as boys do .
Educated women are more likely to go out to work , more likely to demand contraception and less likely to want large families .
Lastly , a special case : China ’s one - child policy , which began nationwide in the early 1970s .
China ’s population is probably 300 m - 400 m lower now than it would have been without it .
The policy ( which is one of population control , not birth control ) has had dreadful costs , including widespread female infanticide , a lopsided sex ratio and horrors such as mass sterilisation and forced abortions .
But in its own terms , it has worked — 20 m people enter the workforce each year , instead of 40 m — and , to the extent that China is polluting less than it would have done , it has benefited the rest of the world .
The Goldilocks moment
Higher standards of living , then , reduce fertility .
And lower fertility improves living standards .
This is what China ’s government says .
It is also the view that has emerged from demographic research over the past 20 years . *
In the 1980s , population was regarded as relatively unimportant to economic performance .
American delegates told a UN conference in 1984 that “ population growth is , in and of itself , neither good nor bad ; it is a neutral phenomenon . ”
Recent research suggests otherwise .
Cutting the fertility rate from six to two can help an economy in several ways .
First , as fertility falls it changes the structure of the population , increasing the size of the workforce relative to the numbers of children and old people .
When fertility is high and a country is young ( median age below 20 ) , there are huge numbers of children and the overall dependency ratio is high .
When a country is ageing ( median age above 40 ) , it again has a high dependency ratio , this time because of old people .

But the switch from one to the other produces a Goldilocks generation .
Because fertility is falling , there are relatively few children .
Because of high mortality earlier , there are relatively few grandparents .
Instead , countries have a bulge of working - age adults .
This happened to Europe after the baby boom of 1945 - 65 and produced les trente glorieuses ( 30 years of growth ) .
It is happening now in Asia and Latin America .
East Asia has done better than Latin America , showing that lower fertility alone does not determine economic success .
Eventually developing countries will face the same problems of ageing as Europe and Japan do .
But for the moment , Asians and Latinos are enjoying fertility that is neither too hot , nor too cold .
According to David Bloom of the Harvard School of Public Health , the “ demographic dividend ” ( his term ) accounted for a third of East Asian growth in 1965 - 90 .
Slowing fertility has other benefits .
By making it easier for women to work , it boosts the size of the labour force .
Because there are fewer dependent children and old people , households have more money left for savings , which can be ploughed into investment .
Chinese household savings ( obviously influenced by many things , not just demography ) reached almost 25 % of GDP in 2008 , helping to finance investment of an unprecedented 40 % of GDP .
This in turn accounted for practically all the increase in Chinese GDP in the first half of this year .
Lastly , low fertility makes possible a more rapid accumulation of capital per head .
To see how , think about what happens to a farm as it is handed down the generations in a country without primogeniture .
The more children there are , the more the farm is divided .
Eventually , these patches become so tiny they cease to be efficient .
This is occurring in Bangladesh .
The importance of tackling such problems , which go by the ugly name of “ capital shallowing ” , was discounted in the 1980s but has recently made a comeback .
Hu Angang of Tsinghua University estimates that half of Chinese growth per person in 1978 - 98 can be attributed to the increase in capital stock per head .
This link between growth and fertility raises awkward questions .
In the 1980s the link was downplayed in reaction to Malthusian alarms of the 1970s , when it was fashionable to argue that population growth had to be reined in because oil and natural resources were running short .
So if population does matter after all , does that mean the Malthusians were right ?
Not entirely .
Neo -Malthusians think the world has too many people .
But for most countries , the population questions that matter most are either : do we have enough people to support an ageing society ?
Or : how can we take advantage of having just the right number for economic growth ?
It is fair to say that these perceptions are not mutually exclusive .
The world might indeed have the right numbers to boost growth and still have too many for the environment .
The right response to that , though , would be to curb pollution and try to alter the pattern of growth to make it less resource - intensive , rather than to control population directly .
The reason is that widening replacement - level fertility means population growth is slowing down anyway .
A further reduction of fertility would be possible if family planning were spread to the parts of the world which do not yet have it ( notably Africa ) .
But that would only reduce the growth in the world ’s numbers from 9.2 billion in 2050 to , say , 8.5 billion .
To go further would probably require draconian measures , such as sterilisation or one - child policies .
The bad news is that the girls who will give birth to the coming , larger generations have already been born .
The good news is that they will want far fewer children than their mothers or grandmothers did .

Homeland Security Chairman Sen. Joe Lieberman told Fox News ' Chris Wallace that he wants the Department of Defense to launch an investigation into the shooting rampage at Ft. Hood .
Lieberman said evidence indicates that Major Nidal Malik Hasan was probably a " self - radicalized , homegrown terrorist . "
" If the reports that we 're receiving of various statements he made , acts he took , are valid , he had turned to Islamist extremism , and , therefore , if that is true , the murder of these 13 people was a terrorist act and , in fact , it was the most destructive terrorist act to be committed on american soil since 9/11 , " Lieberman said Sunday .
Lieberman wants the Department of Defense to conduct a special investigation to see if the shootings could have been predicted .
" While the Army and the FBI are conducting the criminal investigation about exactly what happened and what Dr. Hasan should be charged with , the U.S. Army , the Department of Defense has a real obligation to convene an independent investigation to go back and look at whether warning signs were missed , both the stress he was under , but also the statements that he was making which really could lead people to believe that Dr. Hasan had become an Islamist extremist , " said Lieberman .
" A couple of years ago , after a two - year investigation , my committee put out a report that said the new face of terrorism in America would not just be the attacks as 9/11 organized abroad and sending people in here , it would be people within this country , homegrown terrorists , self - radicalized , often over the internet , going to jihadist websites , and there 's concern from what we know now about Hasan that , in fact , that 's exactly what he was , a self - radicalized home grown terrorist , " Lieberman concluded .
Now that the long - speculated Epic Mickey has been officially unveiled , Junction Point Studios ' Warren Spector is speaking candidly about the project and his work with Disney -- which goes beyond the Mouse himself .
The veteran Spector revealed to Variety that he actually approached Disney not to tackle a Mickey Mouse project , but to find a publisher for a spiritual heir to his renowned Deus Ex -- for which he tried unsuccessfully to buy back the rights from Eidos .
" There were and still are Deus Ex stories I would like to tell .
That story is not done for me , " he says .
However , he says the project was n't a pure franchise sequel : " I sort of filed the serial numbers off , " he says of the concept .
" Deus Ex was very much a game of the millennium . "
As it acquired Junction Point in 2007 , Disney now owns the rights to the project , leaving the door open for Spector to realize his Deus Ex successor .
Along with that concept , he also brought with him to Disney a fantasy title that may also see development at some point .
He describes a " a big , BIG fantasy game that I had been wanting to do for about 15 years . "
Spector says he and his wife collaborated on a world and story arc for DC Comics , which DC declined to pick up .
" I loved this world and the characters we had created , " he laments .
The facts , at least , are simple : Joe Arpaio , the controversial sheriff of Maricopa County , Arizona , claimed that Federal law lets him arrest suspected illegal immigrants during street sweeps .
He provided a press handout that quotes extensively from “ 8 USC 1324 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( iv ) ( b ) ( iii ) ” .
He said that this text gives him authority to continue those arrests , despite the fact that Federal officials had explicitly rescinded an agreement that once allowed him to do so .
He claimed the LII as the source of that law .
There is no such sub-section in the US Code .
No such text appears on our web site , or ever has — a fact easily discovered by reporters who went to our site .
Instead , the text in Arpaio ’s presser was made up by an anti-immigration group in Connecticut .
It looks awfully official , though .
You can read this story in newspapers and blogs here , here , and here — and you probably should , because this is the Internet , and who ’s to say I ’m not making things up , too ?
I thought Stephen Lemons ’ story in the Phoenix New Times gave a good account of the legal - information side of the story .
I spent last Friday morning dealing with media reaction to all this .
I was delighted .
I was delighted that Sheriff Arpaio thinks that the public finds us so authoritative that he can use the LII ’s name as the shiny scaffolding for a Big Lie .
In fact , I wanted to call my mother and tell her that the LII had finally reached that pinnacle of American success , the name brand , just like the legal - information services that the big guys use .
It is often hard for me to avoid cracking wise .
Not so this time .
I am proud , seriously proud , that we have helped shed light on a blatant abuse of authority .
Sheriff
Joe has powerfully reminded us of why we do what we have done for the last 17 years .
We do it because we believe that everybody should be able to find out for themselves what the law is , without bias or interference .
That goes for the people of Maricopa County , for Joe Arpaio , and for journalists .
It goes for the Border Patrol officers at the Field Operations Training Center in Glynco , Georgia — where one of our donors tells us that LII resources are regularly used as part of the curriculum .
We ca n’t know how many of the 100,000 people who visit our web site each day come here because they are looking at an official statement and saying , “ Wait a minute — that ca n’t be right . ”
I think that ’s rare .
I hope that it ’s not often necessary .
But just as the power of the Internet is an accretion of small things , so too the power of a service like ours is described by a lot of little stories about people , and what they can do , and what they know that they can do .
That is not a noisy drama .
It should n’t be .
It is not as glamorous to publish the boring details of 17 USC 107 as it is to dress up in a mask , cape , and green tights , call yourself a “ copyfighter “ , and set off to save the world .
Instead , we strive to be accurate , timely , and boring .
The fairy tale of how Robin Hood Beats the Bad Sheriff and Saves the Little Guys is exciting .
Hundreds or thousands of ordinary stories about how reading and understanding a government regulation can help a family - owned business are not — unless , of course , it ’s your family , and your livelihood .
The five of us are in the quiet , mostly invisible business of putting the law where everyone can find and understand it , each for her own small purpose .
That runs both wide and deep .
Four centuries ago Sir Edward Coke took the radical step of translating law books and writing commentary on English law in English , rather than the “ law French ” that was the language of lawyers .
He did so in order that “ the nobility and gentry of the realm …may understand … seeing
that ignorance of the law is no excuse . ”
It was Coke ’s Institutes that formed the basis of John Adams ’ and Thomas Jefferson ’s legal training .
All of us have heard the phrase about ignorance of the law .
Few know the part of the quote that talks about understanding , or about a history in which law was something that most could not read .
We ’re with Coke .
People need to be able read and understand the law .
The issue of what Joe knows , and what Joe claims he knows , and what average Joes can know , is too important for things to be otherwise .
[ NB : I ’m compelled to tell you that the opinions expressed here are strictly my own and not those of the Legal Information Institute , the Cornell Law School , or Cornell University .
Or my mother , even if she was mentioned in this post ; she ’s a nice lady who mostly thinks well of authority .
They are most certainly not those of Sheriff Joe Arpaio . ]
In 1054 , humans recorded sightings of the mega - star explosion that created the Crab Nebula .
It was so bright it was visible to the naked eye .
Now three space telescopes have together created a more complete picture of the debris .

According to National Geographic :
This new picture of the Crab Nebula combines data from the Chandra X- ray Observatory , the Hubble Space Telescope , and the Spitzer Space Telescope . . .
Infrared light caught by Spitzer and visible light seen by Hubble paint the nebula 's expanding debris cloud in shades of purple and red .
Meanwhile , Chandra 's x-ray vision is helping astronomers understand the high - energy particles ( seen in blue ) coming from the dead star 's core , known as a [ sic ] white dwarf .

I just love that weird tendril of x-rays shooting out of the pulsar .
It seems to be emerging from a giant maw in space ( which - is n't there a Doctor Who story called Maw In Space ?
Maybe I 'm just on crack ) .

Google 's phone service prides itself on simplicity .
You get a Google phone number and then Google Voice forwards calls to your Google number to your home , office or mobile phone .
One number .
One business card .
Pretty simple .
But that approach creates another issue :
To use Google Voice , you had to change your number .
On Tuesday , Google announced on its blog that that 's not the case anymore .
You can sign up for Google Voice with most any number you choose .
One of the biggest advantages is that Google will - for free - transcribe your voicemail so you can read it online or in text messages .
That way you do n't have to listen to ramble - on info when all you want is the call - back number .
Here 's a video that explains how Google Voicemail works .
There are still a few catches , though .
The first is that you can't access all of Google Voice 's features when you 're using a non-Google number .
That means you can't have calls forwarded from that number to other phones .
And , for now , Google Voice is available by invitation only .
What do you think ?
Is Google Voice without the Google number useful ?
Do you think this will catch on in a big way ?
Let us know in the comments below .

The least corrupt nation in the world is New Zealand , according to Transparency International .
Transparency International 's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2009 shows that Denmark is the second least corrupt country while Singapore and Sweden come out equal third .
The three most corrupt according to the index of 180 nations are Somalia , Afghanistan and Myanmar .
Australia occupied eighth position .
The index ranks countries by their perceived levels of corruption , which is determined by expert assessments and surveys .

EVEN Nina Hartley , who became a pornographic actress in 1984 and continues to be one of its most sought - after performers at the age of 50 , is feeling the recession .
“ Last year I did a scene a week , this year I do a scene a month , ” she says .
As a sex celebrity , she has not dropped her fees , charging about $ 1,200 for a “ straight boy - girl ” scene .
But production has collapsed , and for younger performers so have prices .
The adult - film industry is concentrated in the San Fernando Valley — “ the Valley ” to Angelenos — on the northern edge of Los Angeles , so the slump in porn is yet another factor depressing the local economy .
Pornography had been immune to previous recessions , so the current downturn has come as a shock .
Most of the industry consists of small private production companies whose numbers are secret , but Mark Kernes , an editor at Adult Video News , a trade magazine , estimates that the American industry had some $ 6 billion in revenues in 2007 , before the recession , mostly in DVD sales and rentals and some in internet subscriptions .
Diane Duke , the director of the Free Speech Coalition , the adult industry 's trade group , thinks that revenues have fallen 30 - 50 % during the past year .
“ One producer told me his revenue was down 80 % , ” she says .
If the Valley used to make 5,000 - 6,000 films a year , says Mr Kernes , it now makes perhaps 3,000 - 4,000 .
Some firms have shut down , others are consolidating or scraping by .
For the 1,200 active performers in the Valley this means less action and more hardship .
A young woman without Ms Hartley 's name - recognition might have charged $ 1,000 for a straight scene before the crisis , but gets $ 800 or less now .
Men are worse hit .
If they averaged $ 500 for a straight scene in 2007 , they are now lucky to get $ 300 .
For every performer there are several people in support , from sound - tech to catering and ( yes ) wardrobe , says Ms Duke , so the overall effect on the Valley economy is large .
The recession , moreover , has exacerbated a previous crisis .
Piracy is the main problem .
And the internet , with its copious free clips , is an increasingly viable alternative to the paid stuff .
Pornography in general has become “ like potato chips , everywhere and cheap , to be consumed and tossed , ” says Ms Hartley .
It 's not the same as in the golden age when she joined .
“ The industry will shrink and stay shrunken , ” she reckons .
WASHINGTON -- Insurance company executives on Thursday , Sept. 17 , assured a skeptical congressional subcommittee chaired by Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich that their coverage decisions are motivated by patient care , not profits .
One after another , representatives of Aetna , United Healthcare , WellPoint Inc. , Humana , CIGNA , and Health Care Service Corp. denied their companies cut costs by routinely rejecting claims , or that they rescind insurance coverage for patients and employers who incur major medical expenses .
" Private health insurers are insuring fewer people and earning higher profits , by avoiding providing coverage to people who get very sick and who have very high medical bills -- that 's what Wall Street wants to see , " insisted Kucinich , whose Domestic Policy Subcommittee heard testimony Wednesday from former insurance company employees and relatives of patients who maintained that was the case .
Insurance company officials summoned for Day Two of Kucinich 's hearings explained it differently .
" Health care costs drive insurance premiums , not the other way around , " declared Aetna Inc. Senior Vice President Patricia Farrell .
" Over the last decade , health care costs have risen about 7.7 percent a year on average , and insurance premiums have risen that very same amount . "
Brian Sassi , who heads Wellpoint Inc.'s consumer business unit , cited an insurance industry study that said companies typically pay out 87 cents of every premium dollar to cover claims , while just three cents goes to profit .
He said 6 cents goes to taxes and administrative costs while 4 cents goes to services like disease prevention , provider support and marketing .
One percent of WellPoint 's members account for 25 percent of medical costs paid out by the company , he said , and 5 percent drive 50 percent of costs .
Most have severe chronic illnesses .
" Our goal is to help these members manage their conditions and prevent their illnesses from progressing to a more advanced stage , " Sassi said .
When Kucinich inquired about multimillion - dollar fines that WellPoint paid in California for rescinding coverage to patients who incurred significant medical bills , Sassi said the policies were actually canceled because those customers lied on their coverage applications .
" We never drop a member because of an increase in their medical costs , " said Aetna 's Farrell .
Insurance industry representatives said they oppose establishing a public health care option .
They said that because the current Medicare and Medicaid public insurance programs do n't reimburse health care providers sufficiently to cover expenses , extra costs amounting to $ 88 billion each year are passed along to the privately insured , which adds an extra $ 1,500 in yearly premium costs for a family of four .
More people enrolled in public insurance would force the privately insured to absorb more costs and make private insurance less competitive .
When Rep. John Conyers , Democrat of Michigan accused the insurers of not wanting competition from a public plan , Sassi replied that 1,300 insurers around the country compete for business with each other .
" Our concern is that when the government comes in and has ability to set reimbursement rates , it creates an unlevel playing field that can reduce choice for the American public , " Sassi said .
Madcow 5×5 is the training program which I recommend you to do once you ’re no longer making progress on your Squats with StrongLifts 5×5 .
It ’s aimed at intermediate lifters .
When to switch from StrongLifts 5×5 to Madcow 5×5 depends on your body - weight and age .
A 30y old guy weighing around 200 lb will usually have to switch after reaching the 300 lb Squat .
The lighter / heavier you are , the sooner / later the switch to Madcow .
Origins of Madcow .
Several years ago “ Madcow ” was a user at EliteFitness.com who spent many afternoons on the phone with Olympic coach Glenn Pendlay MS .
In 2005 he began publishing everything he learned on the defunct Geocities ( backup of the website here ) .
Nobody knows who he was , he seemed to have disappeared from all the forums he visited around mid 2007 .
The 2 most important works of Madcow were his Intermediate and Advanced training programs .
It ’s his intermediate training program that is now commonly known as Madcow 5×5 .
The program is similar to the Texas Method since Madcow spent a lot of time on the phone with the creator of the Texas Method – coach Glenn Pendlay MS himself .
Madcow vs. StrongLifts 5×5 . With Madcow you ’ll still do all exercises of StrongLifts 5×5 incl the 3x / week Squats .
But because you are now an intermediate lifter moving bigger weights , the program introduces 3 modifications to optimize recovery from the increasingly stressful workouts ( recovery is vital for strength gains ) …
No more 5 sets of 5 with the same weight .
Instead you ’ll do ramped up sets : increase your weight every set like when you warm - up and finish with a heavy set of 5 reps ( 1×5 ) .
Ramped up sets are easier than 5×5 across , especially since you should now be Squatting around 300 lb .
No more workout to workout increases .
You ’ll no longer add weight 3x / week because your body does n’t recover that fast anymore once at the intermediate level .
Instead you ’ll increase the weight on a weekly basis – every week you ’ll lift 5 lb more than the previous week .
No more heavy Squats 3x / week .
Wednesday is a light Squat day where you ’ll be Squatting less weight than on Monday and Friday .
This light day provides you extra physical and mental recovery for Friday ’s workout .
Realize that none of the above modifications will benefit you unless you are an intermediate lifter .
You ’ll always gain strength faster on StrongLifts 5× 5 because there the weight increases by 5 lb 3x / week .
Forget about boosting your Squat by 120 lb in only 8 weeks with Madcow .
10 lb per month on your Squat is more realistic .
If that does n’t sound much , realize that it ’s still 120 lb in 1 year .
How Madcow Works .
Remember 1×5 stand for ramped up sets – 4 sets of 5 reps with the weight increasing until you reach your last heavy set of 5 .
Here ’s the template that I recommend you to follow …
The 2×5 Squats on Wednesday is lighter than on Monday for recovery .
The 1×3 on Friday is also ramped up – 4 sets of 5 reps with the weight increasing , then a heavy triple .
This is followed by a light back - off set of 8 reps .
To choose your starting weight , just insert your numbers into the excel file , you ’ll automatically know how much to lift every workout , for each exercise , and on each set .

Remember starting too light is better than too heavy – let it be easy the first weeks , focus on technique and speed , and only aim to break PRs starting week 4 .

Madcow Success Stories .
First StrongLifts Member James G. ( 42y , USA ) who did Madcow for 5 months .
James Deadlifts 520 lb today .
Squat : 285lb to 350 lb ( +65lb )
Deadlift : 315lb to 455 lb ( + 140lb )
Bench Press : 225 lb to 315 lb ( +90 lb )
Next StrongLifts Member Vlad ( 39y , Denmark ) , one of my ex-private clients who did Madcow for 20 weeks after 6 months of SL5x5 .
Vlad Deadlifts 550 lb today .
Squat : 130 kg to 155kg ( +25kg )
Deadlift : 167kg to 193kg ( +26kg )
Bench Press : 89kg to 110kg ( +21kg )
Finally StrongLifts Member Lucas ( 24y , Netherlands ) who did Madcow 3 months .
This was his 2nd round , Lucas made the mistake of starting with Madcow the first time when he was only Squatting 50kg instead of beginning with StrongLifts 5× 5 .
Do n’t make the same mistake .
His gains the 2nd round …
Body - weight : 79kg to 84kg ( +5kg )
Squat : 130 kg to 150kg ( +20kg )
Deadlift : 150 kg to 160kg ( +10kg )
Bench Press : 90kg to 97,5kg ( + 7,5kg )
Obviously Madcow works or it would n’t be such a popular training program .
I highly recommend you to give i a try once you ’re no longer gaining strength with StrongLifts 5×5 .
Do n’t forget to send me your success story after at least 3 months ( ideally 5 ) .

A start - up company from the Seattle area won $ 900,000 on Friday in a NASA contest to build a miniature prototype of a machine that could one day climb from Earth to outer space .
The idea of a space elevator  passengers and cargo traveling up and down a 60,000 - mile cable  has long been a fixture of science fiction , notably in Arthur C. Clarke ’s novel “ The Fountains of Paradise . ”
A real space elevator is still decades in the future , but the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , along with the nonprofit organization Spaceward Foundation , sponsored the contest to encourage development of some of the needed technologies .
“ It ’s a way to get work done in an interesting area that probably would n’t be done otherwise , ” said Andrew Petro , manager of NASA ’s Centennial Challenges program .
Syngenta
When Michael Mack , the chief executive of Syngenta , a Swiss agribusiness giant that makes pesticides and seeds , hears people say that organic food is better for the planet , he has one response : “ Au contraire . ”
“ If the whole planet were to suddenly switch to organic farming tomorrow , it would be an ecological disaster . ” — Michael Mack
“ Organic food is not only not better for the planet , ” he said , in an interview at The New York Times building on Tuesday .
“ It is categorically worse . ”
The problem , Mr. Mack said , is that organic farming takes up about 30 percent more land , on average , than nonorganic farming for the same yield ( though this varies by crop , of course ) .
If the world wants to feed its fast - growing population on existing cropland — and Mr. Mack is clear that he does not want forests chopped down to clear more land for biofuel production , let alone food — then productivity becomes a key factor , he said .
“ If the whole planet were to suddenly switch to organic farming tomorrow , it would be an ecological disaster , ” he said .
In terms of yields , he continued , organic food is the “ productive equivalent of driving an S.U.V . ”
Mr. Mack also addressed what he called the “ mistaken belief that natural is always better . ”
Pesticides that help crops to grow more efficiently in this country , he argued , “ have been proven safe and effective and absolutely not harmful to the environment or to humans ” and have been certified as such by the Food and Drug Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency .
The implication of not believing that pesticides are safe , he said , is that you do n’t trust the government ’s findings .
“ Once you go down that path , I do n’t know where the guardrails are , ” he said .
Mr. Mack dismissed the notion that Syngenta , a company that sold nearly $ 12 billion of seeds and “ crop protection ” technologies last year , felt threatened by the organic movement .
His concern , he said , was to make people aware of the limitations of organic food .
“ It underplays the significance of agricultural productivity , ” he said .
On the day Norman Borlaug was awarded its Peace Prize for 1970 , the Nobel Committee observed of the Iowa - born plant scientist that " more than any other single person of this age , he has helped provide bread for a hungry world . "
The committee might have added that more than any other single person Borlaug showed that nature is no match for human ingenuity in setting the real limits to growth .
Borlaug , who died Saturday at 95 , came of age in the Great Depression , the last period of widespread hunger in U.S. history .

( CNN ) -- Authorities said Friday that an Iraqi man accused of running down his daughter in Arizona because she had become " too Westernized " has been taken into custody in Atlanta , Georgia .
U.S. Marshals arrested Faleh Hassan Almaleki , 48 , in Atlanta , according to spokesman James Ergas .
Police in Peoria , Arizona , say Almaleki struck his 20 - year - old daughter , Noor Faleh Almaleki , and her friend Amal Edan Khalaf with the Jeep Laredo he was driving in a parking lot in Peoria on October 20 .
After the incident , Almaleki drove to Mexico , abandoning his vehicle in Nogales , Peoria police said in a statement Friday .
He then made his way to Mexico City and boarded a plane to London , England .
British authorities denied him entry into the country , and he was put on a plane back to the United States , police said .
Authorities arrested him late Thursday afternoon when he arrived at Atlanta 's airport , police said , and he is awaiting extradition to Arizona .
He will face two counts of aggravated assault , police said .
Almaleki was angry with his daughter " as she had become too ' Westernized ' and was not living according to [ the family 's ] traditional Iraq [ i ] values , " Peoria police said in a statement last week .
The daughter was hospitalized with life - threatening injuries and remains " unresponsive , " Peoria police said Friday .
Khalaf , 43 , with injuries that are not life - threatening , is in serious but stable condition , police said .
Noor Faleh Almaleki lives with Khalaf , Peoria police said .
They did not elaborate on how the two women knew each other .
Peoria is about 13 miles northwest of Phoenix .

A leading anti-fascist activist has been shot and killed in Moscow , according to reports by Interfax on November 17 .
Ivan Khutorskoy , 26 , was found by neighbors in the entryway to his building on Khabarovskaya ulitsa on the evening of November 16 .
Law enforcement agencies say they are investigating several possible motives for the killing , including connections to the victim ’s anti-fascist activism .
According to the monitoring group Institute of Collective Action , Khutorskoy had been assaulted three times prior to his murder .
In 2005 his head was slashed with a razor , he received multiple wounds around the neck from a screwdriver and was beaten with a baseball bat during a second incident , and in 2009 he was stabbed with a knife in the stomach during a street fight .
According to the website , Khutorskoy had recently been working as security for concerts put on by anti-fascist groups .
Colleague Aleksei Grigoryev said in an interview on Svoboda radio that Khutorskoy had also frequently worked as security during the press conferences of the prominent human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov , who was murdered last January .
“ In general , he was a visible figure for opponents ; apparently this is why the fascists tried so persistently to liquidate him , ” Grigoryev said .
Speaking on condition of anonymity , another colleague told Reuters that Khutorskoy ’s murder was likely political .
“ Ivan [ Khutorskoy ] knew Markelov .
His murder was either revenge , or a challenge to the authorities following the arrests . ”
A rise in nationalist sentiments in Russia has contributed to growing clashes between anti-fascist activists , ultranationalist neo -Nazi groups , and authorities in recent years .
A coalition of ultranationalist groups distributed instructions on how to acquire firearms at a large rally held during Russia ’s November 4 Unity Day celebrations , while another group held a concert featuring neo -Nazi performers .
The rise in fascist and ultranationalist extremism has additionally resulted in increased violence against dark - skinned migrant workers , as well as a number of recent murders .
Stanislav Markelov , a high - profile lawyer known for his defense of anti-fascists and victims of human rights abuses , was shot dead in January in central Moscow .
One suspect , a member of neo -Nazi organizations , was detained in early November and has admitted to the killing .
In October 2008 , anti-fascist leader Fyodor Filatov was killed after a fight between anti-fascists and ultranationalists in central Moscow in which four people were injured .
England 2018 's handbags have become " a symbol of derision , betrayal and embarrassment for me and my family " , according to one of the men who will decide whether the World Cup finals return to these shores .
The row over the bid's £ 230 Mulberry freebies presented to the wives of Fifa executive - committee members last month has returned to haunt the Football Association after the organisation 's vice - president , Jack Warner , yesterday revealed he was sending back the promotional gift .
The made - in - England handbag was presented to Mrs Warner last month by the former FA chairman , Geoff Thompson , at a dinner event in London .
The couple were attending the Leaders in Football conference where Warner , president of Concacaf , was a guest speaker .
The goodwill gesture caused a furore at a time when England 's 2018 team had hoped attention would focus on the unveiling of their star - studded team of ambassadors .
Instead they found themselves defending the decision to dispatch 24 handbags .
In a furious letter to the bid chairman , David Triesman , Warner , one of Sepp Blatter 's right - hand men , says : " Had [ my wife ] or I known then that the acceptance of what we all felt was a kind gesture would have resulted in the tainting of her character and mine together with the untold embarrassment to which we are still being subjected , none of us would have attended the dinner , nor would she have accepted what we thought was a gift in honour of her birthday . "
He added : " I have faced and continue to face all kinds of indignities from all manner of persons , but when these insults touch my wife , it represents an all time low . "
Warner was incensed at media coverage of England 2018 's purchase of the bags , the value of which was comfortably within Fifa guidelines over what is an acceptable gift from bidding nations .
Embarrassingly for England 2018 the email was copied to the Fifa general secretary , Jérôme Valcke , and Concacaf 's other Fifa ex-co member , Chuck Blazer .
It is understood that this is not the first time Warner has written to Lord Triesman on the matter .
A previous letter requesting a statement from the FA chairman to counter coverage of Warner 's acceptance of the gift is said to have gone unacknowledged .
" Equally disappointing is the deafening silence from you and the FA and which seems to support these allegations , " Warner tells Triesman .
" No one has sought to correct this betrayal in a way that would unequivocally remove any doubt or question not only in the global village at large but among my few peers where honour is valued and character is cherished .
" This malaise of my wife and I has been allowed to fester for too long much to our embarrassment and the embarrassment of the institutions which I represent .
In this regard , therefore , there is only one recourse : a return of this gift , which has become a symbol of derision , betrayal and embarrassment for me and my family . "
Warner says he " will continue to be a friend " of the FA but insists " there is nothing that your FA can offer me to get my vote " .
Warner adds : " If England does get it , it is because Concacaf and I sincerely believe that England is deserving of the honour . "
There is no suggestion that England 2018 's gift was designed to be an inducement for Warner 's vote in the ballot next December , nor that it broke any rules .
" Fifa have a set of guidelines for all bidders which includes direction on what constitutes an acceptable campaign gift , " said England 2018 last month .
" All our gifts are carefully chosen so as to be within both the spirit and letter of that law . "
There is confidence at the Wembley bid headquarters that talks with Warner since the letter arrived have mollified the Fifa powerbroker and that an amiable meeting can be arranged with Triesman when the men are in South Africa for the Soccerex conference and World Cup draw in the coming weeks .
Three men and a dinner
With Lord Triesman , England 2018 's chairman , a divisive figure , it is encouraging that others on the board are taking matters into their own hands .
Lord Coe and Sir Keith Mills took Geoff Thompson out to dinner on Tuesday in a significant development for the bid .
Since his appointment as chairman of the FA , Triesman has never called Thompson , his predecessor , which is believed to have alienated England 's Fifa executive committee member .
But Mills and Lord Coe were the most senior figures in the London 2012 campaign four years ago and their experience of sports politics means they recognise the value of having an insider in the voting constituency .
Arsenal trades up
After Stan Kroenke , right , took his shareholding in Arsenal to 29.6 % on Tuesday , five more shares changed hands yesterday .
Significantly , each one had a £ 1,000 premium on Kroenke 's top price of £ 8,500 .
Who took them on is unknown , but at that money it suggests someone is hoping to get a better price if a takeover is launched .
It could reflect the continued presence in the market of Alisher Usmanov , whose Red & White Holdings is approaching 26 % .
But with other significant shareholders avowedly aligned to Kroenke , if the billionaire Russian is the buyer , his picking up of expensive scraps smacks of desperation .
Etihad elation grounded
After the success of the Abu Dhabi grand prix , the race 's title sponsor , Etihad Airways , yesterday suffered an embarrassing defeat in the high court over a previous Formula One sponsorship .
The United Arab Emirates ' airline pulled out of a five ‑month - old deal with Spyker after Vijay Mallya took over the team and renamed them Force India in October 2007 .
Mallya also owns the rival airline Kingfisher and challenged Etihad 's withdrawal through the courts .
Force India were awarded £ 4.7 m .
CBP Launches New Maritime Unmanned Aircraft System – CBP.gov —
This news broke on Wednesday and was under - reported by the media .
They keep saying it is unmanned , but never say anything about it being unarmed .
“ The Predator B Unmanned Aircraft System has proven its value to homeland security over the nation ’s land borders , the Great Lakes region , and in support of DHS hurricane and flood response operations , ” said Michael Kostelnik , assistant commissioner for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine .
“ With the introduction of the Guardian , maritime variant of the Predator B , DHS now has a powerful tool and force multiplier to increase maritime domain awareness and confront threats to our borders . ”
The Guardian has been modified from a standard Predator B with structural , avionics , and communications enhancements , as well as the addition of a Raytheon SeaVue Marine Search Radar and an Electro - optical / Infrared Sensor that is optimized for maritime operations .
The Guardian is expected to be ready for Operational Test and Evaluation in early 2010 .
This OT&E will be conducted jointly by CBP and USCG from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Fla .
After the Guardian completes operational testing this spring , it will be deployed to the drug source and transit zones to support joint counter - narcotics operations .

SUMMARY : “ Why is New York called the Big Apple ? ”
Above , the header from the 1924 newspaper column of John J. Fitz Gerald .
Click to see a portion of the column which includes his use of “ Big Apple . ”
Part of a 1926 column is also available .
“ The Big Apple ” was the catchphrase of New Yorktrack writer John J. Fitz Gerald in the 1920s .
He admitted this twice and it was the name of three of his columns .
He picked up the term from African - American ( " dusky " he called them ) stable hands at the Fair Grounds racetrack in New Orleans , probably on January 14 , 1920 .
Fitz Gerald ’s first New York “ Around the Big Apple ” column , on February 18 , 1924 , proudly declared : The “ Big Apple ” racing circuit had meant “ the big time , ” the place where the big money was to be won .
Horses love apples , and apples were widely regarded as the mythical king of fruit .
In contrast , the smaller , poorer tracks were called the “ leaky roof circuit ” or “ bull ring ” tracks .
“ The Big Apple ” became the name of a club in Harlem in 1934 , and Harlem itself was referred to as “ the Apple ” at this time .
A club in Columbia , South Carolina also took the “ Big Apple ” name , and it was here that 1937 ’s short - lived national “ Big Apple ” dance craze began .
“ The Big Apple ” was revived in the 1970s by Charles Gillett , president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau .
The origins of “ the Big Apple ” were solved in the 1990s by Gerald Cohen and Barry Popik .
A “ Big Apple Corner ” street sign was dedicated in 1997 at West 54th Street and Broadway , where Fitz Gerald last lived .
The African - American stablehand who first called New York City “ the Big Apple ” at the Fair Grounds Race Track in New Orleans has never been honored .
Not by New York City .

Barack Obama was elected on 4 November 2008 after a campaign that promised change .
One year on , Newsbeat 's travelled across the country to find out how people feel in Obama 's America .
In the first of five reports , Jonathan Blake travels to Tennessee where unemployment is highest among young people to see how he 's trying to fix the economy .
_________________________
In this small town in the state with the highest level of unemployment among young people in the US , Felicia Gaskins is one of the lucky ones .
The 17 - year - old from Murfreesboro , Tennessee got a job paid for by President Barack Obama 's stimulus plan .
She spent the summer working at the Discovery Centre , a hands on museum for children .
" I worked with the kids , interacted with the kids and just got a really good experience out of it , " she said .
She admits it would have been hard to find work without it .
" I would n't have been able to find a job .
Sitting at home watching TV , that 's probably it , " she said .
Few jobs
According to The White House 640,329 jobs have been created by $ 500 billion ( £ 305 billion ) worth of government grants and loans .
But the plan has been criticised by politicians and others for not getting results fast enough , with unemployment at 9.8 % .
Drop into the local career centre and there is plenty of evidence of just how bad the problem is .
The foyer is busy with people scanning the notice boards , flicking through lists of jobs and filling out forms .
Single mum Chrystal Gonzalez , 29 , told Newsbeat she was struggling to get by .
" I have no income right now whatsoever .
That 's why I 'm here , it 's the first time I 've been in this office , " she said .
She has 11 years experience in law enforcement but is looking for anything she can get to pay the bills .
She said : " There are some jobs but it 's barely enough to make it by .
I do n't know that I 'm going to be able to take care of things like I need to . "
Laid off
Government figures show 26 % of 16 to 19 - year - olds are unemployed in Tennessee , and nationally more teenagers are out of work than ever .
Many have been recently laid off as businesses like the Five Senses restaurant in Murfreesboro take drastic action to survive .
I have no income right now whatsoever .
I do n't know that I 'm going to be able to take care of things like I need to Chrystal Gonzalez , 29 , single mum
Restaurant Manager Jennifer
Nevin says they have already had to close one of their premises .
She said : " As our business dropped we'd look around and see everyone else 's business was dropping as well , so we just could n't get the people in to keep our heads above water . "
She explains they are trying new tactics to get customers through the door .
" We 're offering more coupons , discounts and specials throughout the week , " she added .
There are signs that the country is recovering , however slowly .
In October , official figures showed the US economy grew at an annual pace of 3.5 % between July and September .
That news was given a cautious welcome by the president who said the US was still " a long way " from recovering from the downturn .
But if the economy is recovering , it is hard to find any evidence of it in Murfreesboro , Tennessee .
Matt Miles , 22 , is hanging out with his friends at the Stones River Mall .
He spent four months looking for a job when he started college and is not convinced Barack Obama 's stimulus plan is working .
He said : " It sounds like a very good idea and it may well be working .
It 's just there 's nothing I 've noticed so far . "

Well , some of you might know these facts about the traditional American bird , but for those of you who do n’t , here are some tidbits :
The bird you ’re eating now did n’t exist until around the 1940s .
According to the USDA , most turkeys in the 1930s had dark plumage , narrower breasts , and weighed between 18 and 25 pounds .
But a survey was conducted showing that consumers wanted a turkey with more breast meat , as well as one that could more easily fit in the refrigerator .
So , the USDA began a breeding program and , by 1947 , introduced a new breed called the Beltsville Small White .
Consumers demanded still more breast meat , and so the Broad Breasted White was created .
By 1965 , it dominated the market .
Broad breasted whites are so broad breasted they can’t mate .
Producers have to artificially inseminate them .
More than 300 million turkeys are raised in the U.S. every year , most of them broad breasted whites .
The average size of a turkey has grown by more than 4 % every year ; today the average weight is more than 28 pounds .
Over the past few decades , the number of turkey producers has dropped more than 30 % as operations consolidate .
In the early 1970s , there were barely more than a million wild turkeys left in the U.S. Today , there are more than 7 million .
Bon appetit !
The final report of the AAA 's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities ( CEAUSSIC ) is now available here [ pdf ] .
Executive Summary
In December of 2008 , the Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association asked the Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the U.S. Security and Intelligence Communities ( CEAUSSIC ) to thoroughly review the Human Terrain System ( HTS ) program , so that the AAA might then formulate an official position on members ’ participation in HTS activities .
This report details CEAUSSIC ’s primary findings , which are summarized in the following key points :
HTS and similar programs are moving to become a greater fixture within the U.S. military .
Given still outstanding questions about HTS , such developments should be a source of concern for the AAA but also for any social science organization or federal agency that expects its members or its employees to adhere to established disciplinary and federal standards for the treatment of human subjects .
The current arrangement of HTS includes potentially irreconcilable goals which , in turn , lead to irreducible tensions with respect to the program ’s basic identity .
These include HTS at once : fulfilling a research function , as a data source , as a source of intelligence , and as performing a tactical function in counterinsurgency warfare .
Given this confusion , any anthropologist considering employment with HTS will have difficulty determining whether or not s/he will be able to follow the disciplinary Code of Ethics .
HTS managers insist the program is not an intelligence asset .
However , we note that the program is housed within a DoD intelligence asset , that it has reportedly been briefed as such an asset , and that a variety of circumstances of the work of Human Terrain Teams ( HTTs ) " on the ground " in Iraq and Afghanistan create a significant likelihood that HTS data will in some way be used as part of military intelligence , advertently or inadvertently .
HTTs collect sensitive socio-cultural data in a high - risk environment and while working for one combatant in ongoing conflicts .
Given the lack of a well - defined ethical framework of conduct for the program and inability of HTT researchers to maintain reliable control over data once collected , the program places researchers and their counterparts in the field in harm ’s way .
When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions , not subject to external review , where data collection occurs in the context of war , integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency , and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology .
In summary , while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible , CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of " anthropology " within DoD .
Media Coverage
' rich , complicated and often ridiculous back story is a large reason why the series is so enjoyable , to the extent that some otherwise lackluster episodes can succeed based solely on the merits of the juicy details they reveal about the series ' history .
" The Revenge Society " is definitely one of those episodes .
Although its main story does n't exactly spring to manic life in the way you 'd hope , both its minor and major revelations carry enough comedic weight to make the episode memorable .
The Revenge Society " sees The Phantom Limb return after his defeat in " Showdown at Cremation Creek " to gain control of The Guild of Calamitous Intent .
Having suffered from a serious psychotic breakdown after his fall from grace , his plan does n't make much practical sense , and involves kidnapping two of the Guild 's council members , having Billy Quizboy surgically sew the head of one council member to the body of the other , and then forcing them to reveal how the Phantom 's grandfather was the true founder of the Guild ( thus making Phantom Limb the rightful sovereign ) .
Because they rightly fear for their lives , the council members indulge their kidnapper , and Billy Quizboy reveals that the powerful Orb is located at the Venture Compound .
This sends both the Guild and Phantom Limb on a crash course towards the compound with the hapless Venture family unaware why so many villains have descended upon their lawn .
Normally this set - up would make for the sort of hilarious fireworks display that made " Showdown at Cremation Creek " and " The Family That Slays Together , Stays Together , " so phenomenal , but the action never quite lives up to the amusing revelations certain characters let slip over the course of the episode .
That 's not too much of a problem , though , considering just how hysterical some of those revelations are .
Learning that Dr. Venture frequently vomits on his speed suit out of fear made me howl , as did hearing that Hank once locked himself in the research lab after seeing Dog Day Afternoon for the first time .
And those are just a couple of the minor revelations .
The episode 's two major reveals also add lot of humor and depth to the series ' bigger picture .
The fact that Phantom Limb 's grandfather started the Guild partly as a way to form a background group for his terrible sousaphone playing made sense in a roundabout way , considering the organization has a long history of being run by musicians .
Also , I was glad to learn that Dr. Venture 's own grandfather was n't in fact killed by his bodyguard as suggested in " ORB " , and that Eugen Sandow actually just broke the doomsday device .
This revelation made for a nice punch line for the episode 's comedy of errors , and it also made me hopeful for Brock Samson 's eventual return .
The episode also had some other highlights , but they all seemed rather incidental to the actual plot .
I got a good laugh out of watching Sergeant Hatred try to explain pedophilia to Dean , and Hank continues to steal every scene he 's in .
Seeing Billy Quizboy do so much with his time in the spotlight was likewise a pleasant surprise .
Still , I can't help but feel like there was a lot of unrealized potential in this story .
I surely expected more from an episode that saw both Phantom Limb and David Bowie step back into the forefront .

Road Rage Trial : Thompson ’s rear window after the July 4 incident .
Photo : Chris Roberts
Prosecutors and defense attorneys made closing arguments Thursday in Los Angeles , in the trial of a former emergency room doctor accused of injuring two cyclists when he stopped his car suddenly in front of them .
Dr. Christopher Thomas Thompson ’s attorney said it was all an accident .
“ This was not an attempt to hurt anyone . ”
Deputy District Attorney Mary Stone said Thompson ’s actions “ crossed a line you cannot cross . ”
Thompson is accused of assault with a deadly weapon , reckless driving causing specified bodily injury , battery with serious bodily injury and mayhem .
The most serious charges stem from a July 4 , 2008 , incident on the road where Thompson lives .
Other charges relate to a similar incident on the same road that did not result in injuries .
Stone said that , in the earlier incident , Thompson had three options when he caught up to cyclists Patrick Watson and Josh Crosby as they descended Mandeville Canyon Road .
He could have driven behind the two cyclists at 30 mph ( the speed limit and the cyclists ’ speed according to GPS data ) or he could have passed them and kept driving .
Instead , he passed them and then stopped , later saying that he wanted to take a picture , a claim Stone called “ patently ridiculous . ”
In that incident , Watson and Crosby said they narrowly avoiding hitting the rear of Thompson ’s Infiniti sedan when he stopped .
Stone played Thompson ’s 911 call , from after the July 4 incident , once again for the jurors .
Jurors heard Thompson tell the operator , “ They said fuck you ; I slammed on my brakes . ”
On the tape the operator asked Thompson if the injuries were serious , and he said , “ They ’ll tell you they are , but they ’re not . ”
“ What a callous statement is that ? ” Stone asked .
“ He had no right to make that statement . ”
Stone reminded the jury how the first police officer to arrive testified that Thompson told him : “ I wanted to teach ( the cyclists ) a lesson , ” and “ I ’m tired of them . ”
Those words did not fit with the profile of a man who , as an MD , “ knows the fragility of the human body , ” Stone told the jury .
Defense closing
Defense attorney Peter Swarth began by putting a sheet of paper on an overhead projector .
It had a single word , “ accident . ”
“ This was an accident that could happen to anyone , ” he said .
Swarth portrayed the cyclists as at fault ; they “ endangered ( Thompson ) by not allowing him to pass , ” he said .
“ If you have even a feather of doubt , then you have reasonable doubt and you must acquit , ” Thompson said .
In regard to the Fourth of July incident , Swarth asked the jury , “ Where is the evidence of anger ?
The injury does n’t make this criminal . ”
He accused Ron Peterson and Christian Stoehr , the riders in the July 4 incident , of being dishonest and said of Stoehr , “ He looked back at his friend Ron Peterson ; he lost his balance and fell . ”
Of Peterson ( a cycling coach ) he said , “ This teacher , teaching his student about the dangers of the road , teaches him about anger . ”
He referenced Stone ’s statements about the permanence of Peterson and Stoehr ’s injuries and then asked the jury , “ Where does Dr. Thompson go to get his reputation back ?
Next , he asked , “ If you ’re in a rage why are you going to get out of your car and call 911 ? ”
Speaking of the 911 recording , Swarth said , “ Did he choose the best words ?
No .
This was not an attempt to hurt anyone .
He wanted to get a photo . ”
Swarth sought to convince the jury that Thompson was actively seeking to create a safer situation .
“ The universe is like that … the thing you seek to avoid becomes the thing you ca n’t avoid . ”
“ The facts in this case do n’t add up to a criminal act . ”
The final word
In Stone ’s rebuttal , she laid out an allegory of sorts , re-telling the three Mandeville Canyon incidents the prosecution presented during the trial .
First , she goes to a Trader Joe’s .
Goes to the aisle where they have granola she wants .
Someone is in the way , preventing her from getting her granola , so she swings a bat at the person , but does n’t hit him .
With that , Stone held up a baseball bat , swinging in an abrupt arc .
Weeks go by .
She returns to the Trader Joe ’s and again there ’s someone in the way , someone preventing her from getting her granola .
This time she swings the bat at them and they duck just out of the way .
A few more weeks go by and she ’s back at Trader Joe’s .
Someone , she said , “ is in my aisle , blocking me from my granola .
So I blast his nose with my bat . ”
“ But of course , I get arrested . ”
Then , donning a white doctor ’s coat , she said , “ But I shroud myself in this because I want to deflect what I did . ”
What ’s next ?
The court is closed Friday .
A jury verdict is expected early next week .
If convicted of all charges , Thompson could spend up to five years in prison .
Sunday evening , TNR's Jon Cohn reported on the backstory of the public option negotiations between the Senate and White House :
After a weekend of furious activity on Capitol Hill , Democratic leaders in the Senate think they are close to getting the votes they need in order to pass an " opt- out " version of the public option .
But they feel like President Obama could be doing more to help them , with one senior staffer telling TNR on Sunday that the leadership would like , but has yet to receive , a clear " signal " of support for their effort ....
The administration could send a signal , in some form or fashion , that they support the Democratic leadership 's proposal to include this public option with a state opt - out in the bill .
... a word of support from the president , from [ administration spokesman Robert ]
Gibbs at the podium , any number of ways ... any indication of support would be appreciated by the leadership .
This staffer added that administration officials " seem more interested in pursuing an Olympia Snowe strategy . "
The administration , meanwhile , continued to say what it was saying late last week :
That Obama wants the strongest possible public option that the Senate will approve -- and that it stands behind Reid 's effort to build that support ....
Again , the statements of the senior Senate staffer and senior administration official - - each one saying what several other similarly placed sources have said , on background -- are not as inconsistent as they might seem at first blush .
On the contrary , it seems pretty clear ( at least to me ) that Obama really would prefer a strong public option -- but that he , like his advisers , has serious concerns over whether such an option can pass .
In other words , he wants a good public plan but he wants a bill even more -- and he's not sure that the former is compatible with the latter .
So he 's being careful - - more careful , in fact , than some of his Senate allies would like .
Clearly Senate leadership is concerned with the President 's approach , as are other Senators , including Harkin and Brown .
They also believe they are very close to having 60 votes , according to Schumer and that they can do more in whipping their members , if the president or his team were to provide that word in support of Reid 's clear preference for the opt out public option .
This is n't the equivalent of the President or Robert Gibbs making a statement from the podium , but hopefully it 's the first that will be made , hopefully followed up by Obama or his official spokesman .
Late last night , Deputy Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer blogged this on the White House blog .
Senator Reid and his leadership team are now working to get the most effective bill possible approved by the Senate .
President Obama completely supports their efforts and has full confidence they will succeed and continue the unprecedented progress that is being made in both the House and Senate .
If Reid is as close to 60 as Schumer says , he should take Pfeiffer 's word as the President 's and move forward , smoking out whichever Senator it might be who would stand as the lone Democratic vote against healthcare reform .
We might find out if that 's what Reid is doing , today at 3:15 .
If he does announce that he 's moving forward with opt out , on the basis of Pfeiffer 's statement , we can assume that he will the full support of the President in doing that .
