OLPE , Germany ( AP )  A 44 - year - old woman was arrested on suspicion of killing her own babies after her grown children found the bodies of three infants stashed in the family 's freezer while looking for a frozen pizza , police said Monday .
Police confirmed the grisly find Sunday night in the town of Wenden , near Olpe , in the western state of North Rhine - Westphalia after the woman turned herself in , officials said .
The three infants are believed to have been born alive , but authorities were awaiting autopsy results to determine how they died , said Johannes Daheim , a spokesman for prosecutors investigating the case .
The woman , her 47 - year - old husband and three adult children — two sons , aged 18 and 22 , and a 24 - year - old daughter — have lived in the town in a single - family home since 1984 .
The children discovered the frozen babies on Saturday afternoon while their parents were away for the weekend , investigator Martin Feldmann said .
The 18 - year - old and his sister had been looking for a frozen pizza and came across a lot of expired food so decided to clean out the freezer .
The teenager then found three identical packets on the bottom of the freezer and opened one and saw the head and arm of an infant that was wrapped in a hand towel , police said .
The children confronted their parents when they returned home Sunday , and the couple and their daughter then went to police together to tell authorities , said Herbert Fingerhut , head of the police investigation , at a news conference .
The heavyset woman apparently concealed the three pregnancies — not only from neighbors but also her own family , Fingerhut said .
" It sounds unbelievable , but there are examples showing such things are possible , " he said .
The news of the discovery took other residents aback .
" I 've been mayor for 14 years , and this is definitely the worst day I 've seen , " Peter Brueser said .
" We will need a long time here to work through this . "
It was the latest in a string of similar cases in Germany .
In the worst case , a woman was convicted of manslaughter in 2006 and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison for killing eight of her newborn babies and burying them in flower pots and a fish tank in the garden of her parents ' home near the German - Polish border .
More recently , police in February were called to a home in northern Germany where a dead infant was discovered in the cellar .
In January , a 28 - year - old German woman was charged with manslaughter after the remains of three babies were discovered in her house and the home of a relative .
That woman has denied killing the babies .

I sleep on a bunk bed yeah , which is only accessbile by a ladder and last night I must 've been dreaming or something because I woke up screaming about my ladder being taken off my bed so I could n't get down

And I dreamt that there was a badger sleeping at the end of the bed

Pelosi : Bush 's war has ' taken us deeply into debt , and that debt is taking us into recession ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

In the Democratic Party response to President Bush 's speech on Iraq Thursday , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) emphasized the staggering costs of the war , its growing strain on the US military , and its failure to make Americans any safer .
" The president has taken us into a failed war , " Pelosi stated .
" He 's taken us deeply into debt , and that debt is taking us into recession .
We need some answers . "
Bush 's speech followed Congressional testimony earlier in the week by Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
Bush painted a rosy picture of conditions in Iraq , saying that " fifteen months ago , America and the Iraqi government were on the defensive .
Today , we have the initiative . "
Reid , however , dismissed Bush 's talk of progress resulting from the surge .
He noted instead that " two very important questions " were raised at the hearings --
" Has the was made us any safer ?
Are our troops any closer to coming home ? "
-- and that " on both counts , after the hearings , the answer is no . "
" Our military is badly strained , " Reid insisted .
" We 're unable to respond to threats around the world .
...
American taxpayers are paying $ 5000 a second for this war . "
Reid also focused on Bush 's promise that " I have directed the secretary of defense to reduce deployment lengths from 15 months to 12 months for all active Army soldiers deploying to the Central Command area of operations " after next August 1 .
" Today 's announcement by the president can only be described as one step forward and two back , " Reid commented .
" If our president is genuine about providing our troops with the rest , recuperation , and training they need , then I call upon him and his allies in Congress to allow us to codify this , make it the law of this country .
...
If you 're in Iraq or Afghanistan for 12 months , then you have to be home at least 12 months . "
" The president still does n't understand that America 's limited resources cannot support this endless war that he 's gotten us involved in , " Reid continued , noting that even though Gen .
Petraeus has recommended a withdrawal of all five surge brigades by the end of July , this will still leave more US troops in Iraq than before the surge .
" The president signaled to the American people that he has no intention of bringing home any more troops , " Reid stated .
" Instead , he 's leaving all the tough decisions to ... the next president of the United States . "
Nancy Pelosi reaffirmed all of Reid 's points .
" We need better answers from the president , " she concluded .
" We need real answers . "

Carbon nanotubes ’ potential as a super material is blighted by the fact that when first made they often take the form of an unprepossessing pile of sooty black mess in the bottom of a test tube .
Now researchers in the University of Warwick ’s Department of Chemistry have found a way of producing carbon nanotubes in which they instantly form a highly sensitive ready made electric circuit .
The research has just been published in a paper entitled " Single - Walled Carbon Nanotube Network Ultramicroelectrodes " by University of Warwick researchers Ioana Dumitrescu , Professor Julie Macpherson , Professor Patrick Unwin , and Neil Wilson in Analytical Chemistry , 2008 , 10.1021/ ac702518g
The researchers used a form of chemical vapour deposition and lithography to create the ready made disc shaped single walled carbon nanotube based ultramicroelectrodes .
The nanotubes deposit themselves flat on a surface in a random but relatively even manner .
They also all overlap sufficiently to create a single complete metallic micro-circuit right across the final disc .
What is even more impressive is that they take up less than one per cent of the surface area of the disc .
This final property makes these instant ultramicroelecrodes particular useful for the creation of ultra sensitive sensors .
The low surface area of the conducting part of the disc means that they can be used to screen out background " noise " and cope with low signal to noise ratios making them up to 1000 times more sensitive than conventional ultramicroelecrodes sensors .
This property also produces very fast response times allowing them to respond ten times faster than conventional ultramicroelecrodes .
As these ready made ultramicroelecrodes are carbon based they also open up a range of new possibilities for use in living systems .
The biocompatibility of carbon is in stark contrast with the obvious problems that platinum and other metal based probes can pose for living tissue .
The Warwick research team are already beginning to explore how their single walled carbon nanotube based ultramicroelecrodes can be used to measure levels of neurotransmitters .
The new ultramicroelecrodes also open up interesting possibilities for catalysis in fuel cells .
Up till now researchers had been aware that this form of carbon nanotubes appeared to be particularly useful in the area of catalysis but there was uncertainty as to whether it was the properties of the carbon nanotubes per se that provide this benefit or whether it was due to impurities in their production .
The researchers have been able to use this new method of single walled carbon nanotube assembly to prove that it is actually the properties of the carbon nanotubes themselves that are useful for catalysis .
The new carbon nanotube assembly technique brings a further benefit to catalysis applications as the Warwick researchers have been able to use electrodepoistion to quickly and easily apply specific metal coatings to the ready formed single walled carbon nanotube microelectrode networks .
This will be of significant benefit to anyone wanting to use single walled carbon nanotube for catalysis in fuel cell technology .

PR35 6th May 2008
Here 's the scenario : you return from an overseas trip and find yourself facing US Customs officers in an airport .
They see your laptop , demand that you turn it on , then take it from you and start rifling through its contents .
They have no reason for the search , and they can and do look for anything they like .
Is this legal ?
In a new decision , the Ninth Circuit says yes .
In a Monday ruling , the judges considered an appeal from one Michael Arnold .
Arnold was 43 when he returned to the US from the Philippines in July 2005 , and he showed up at LAX with a laptop , separate hard drive , flash drive , and six compact discs .
A Customs and Border Patrol agent asked Arnold to fire up the machine , then decided to take a look through two folders on the machine 's desktop , labeled " Kodak Pictures " and " Kodak Memories . "
Why the officer did this is not clear , but he found a picture " that depicted two nude women . "
Further searching turned up images that appeared to be child pornography , and Arnold 's computer was seized .
A court case followed in which Arnold argued that the results of this search should not be allowed , as they were unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment .
A district court bought Arnold 's argument that a laptop was different from normal closed containers like luggage , which are routinely examined by border agents without particular cause .
Arnold claimed that a laptop was more like " home " and " the human mind " than a typical closed container and that searching it required a reason .
The district court agreed .
But the Ninth Circuit took the district court 's logic out behind the woodshed and thrashed it with a willow switch .
The judges noted that precedent already allows searches of 1 ) briefcases and luggage , 2 ) a purse , wallet , or pocket , 3 ) papers found in pockets , and 4 ) pictures , films , and other graphic material .
In fact , the Supreme Court allows border agents wide latitude , only drawing the line at searching the " alimentary canal " of a suspect without reasonable suspicion ( seriously ) .
Given that latitude and the basic legal principle that a nation has the sovereign right to " protect its territorial integrity , " the Ninth Circuit concluded that Arnold 's case could go forward with the evidence gleaned from his laptop .
Considering the various sorts of highly personal information toted about on most laptops , the decision might be correct but still feels a bit unsettling ; News.com 's Declan McCullagh put together a helpful guide to laptop border security last month that might reassure travelers who are n't thrilled about the idea of some official scanning tax returns , business secrets , and e-mail without a reason .
We 've already taken a thorough look at how devices like iPhones and laptops can suddenly deliver an entire life 's worth of data into the hands of the feds in a way that was never possible twenty years ago .
While the implications of such searches are wide - ranging , the authority is n't actually new ; the Ninth Circuit already ruled the same way back in 2006 in another case involving laptop child porn and border agents .

As much as that sounds like a euphemism , it is n’t .
Remember the crazy guy who claims he has specially bred giant Japanese crab lice that do n’t bite ?
And that they make great pets ?
( “ Like Sea Monkeys in Your Pants ! ” )
So , when I wrote about that –and how utterly full of shit that website is –I got an email from a reporter .
The LoveBugz .net website offers to send you your very own “ pets ” if you send them your address and a buck .
The reporter wanted to buy some lice and have me look at them .
I thought the site was just a creative ad - farm scheme , so said “ Sure !
Send ’em to me ! ”
Because , seriously .
It had to be a a scam .
Who is going to go to the Better Business Bureau and complain that they did n’t get the pubic lice they paid for ?
Just in case , though , I gave him my home address , rather than my work address , since I have only been in my new job 7 months and was n’t sure what might show up in the mailroom .
And then :
An envelope DID show up .
( Sealed with duct tape , too ! )
It appears to have a postal mark from Teterboro , NJ .
And scrawled across the front : “ Live Insects !
Handle with Care ! ”
Inside was a folded letter , and inside the letter was this :
I think most of you are having the same reaction I did : EW .
The letter that came with it had instructions :
I think I can safely speak for the vast majority of the readers of this blog when I say “ Oh , HELL no ! ”
I ’ll wait while the mass collective shuddering dies down .
So–I put the “ specimen ” in a sealed tupperware container with a moist towel , set it on my plant warming pad ( since lice are triggered to emerge by moisture and heat ) , and took them to work with me the next day .
Where 2 graduate students were fascinated , and 1 was pretty much traumatized by the whole concept and probably tried to autoclave herself after I left the lab .
[ Also , a tip : if you walk into your new workplace brandishing a container of putative pubic lice and sand , you may want to provide a more detailed back story than “ I bought them on the internet . ”
Just some advice . ]
Anyway , we looked carefully under the scope , and aside from documenting that Mr. LoveBugz is ( a ) brunette ; and ( b ) has pubic hair that is very smooth and well conditioned ; we found no nits or lice .
There was sand ; and there was some stuff that looked like seed capsules ; but unless lice have developed egg capsules that look remarkably like they have cell walls , there were no nits , dead or alive .
Here ’s the closest thing to a nit I found ( additional photos here and here . )
Nothing that I have read in any taxonomic descriptions so far mentions this kind of pattern .
While plant cells have cell walls , no animal cells do .
Ergo :
This ai n’t an animal .
Everything I picked out of that sample turned out to look very similar–plant material , not animal .
There are regrettably few photos of crab lice nits available online , although plenty exist for head lice .
You can see some sculpturing of the outer egg case in this photo , but nothing like …well , cell walls .
You do n’t see it in this electron micrograph , either .
There was a hole in the envelope , so it is entirely possible that the nits that were promised fell out of the envelope in transit .
However , why in the world would you not send them in a sealed container of some kind ?
Even a paper towel in an unsealed Baggie™ would have worked .
And why mail them in sand ?
Sand is abrasive , and likely to crush anything else during transit in surface mail .
Sending the lice packed in sand , and telling the recipient to put sand in their undies and not wash for a week ?
Yeah , that ’ll happen .
Conclusion : The Site is Still Bullshit .
But they are willing to go a long way to keep up their hoax and / or delusion .
EDITED TO ADD : Some folks are arguing that I have n’t “ proven ” that the site is BS .
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .
They claim to have lice that do n’t drink blood and are n’t irritating –which contradicts what we know about all 3 types of human body lice for recorded history , as well as physical evidence for an even long period of time .
They have provided no additional evidence for me to evaluate that claim , and in fact set things up so it would fail .
I stick with my conclusion .
Additional things to read about pubic lice :
It 's reprehensible enough when an American president puts soldiers in harm 's way to make a political point .
But the GOP has placed American soldiers at the whim of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , turning our forces into pawns between political rivals .
Analysts say Maliki 's decision to launch the Basra crackdown , instead of carrying through with a promised offensive against Sunni Islamist militants in the northern city of Mosul , lends weight to the Sadrist accusations of a political agenda .
The attacks have targeted the Mehdi Army while leaving two other powers in Basra , the Fadhila party and the militant Badr Organisation of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) -- which supports Maliki's Dawa Party -- largely untouched .
Our soldiers may never surrender , but the Bush administration , John McCain , and blind supporters of this war have been more than willing to surrender our forces to outside control .
Coming right on the heels of Iraq visits from both McCain and Cheney , it 's clear that Maliki knows the real situation .
He knows that he can strike openly at his enemies , and the US military will be forced to expend blood and dollars to back up his threats .
But there is little prospect of a swift victory .
The fighting has spread through southern regions , drew the U.S. forces and led to protests in Baghdad by followers of Sadr , who say Maliki is using force to weaken his political rivals .
As the US is increasingly forced to bear the cost of Maliki 's political decisions , and Bush , Cheney , and McCain continue to sing of " progress , " you have to wonder if any of these men has learned what Maliki clearly knows .
When the puppetmaster tries to control the puppet , the strings go both ways .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans are worried about the economy , and inflation tops their list of concerns .
Ninety - one percent of respondents to a recent poll said they are somewhat or very concerned about the rising rate of inflation , according to a national CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday .
And 86 % said they are worried about jobs .
The results frame the issue facing the Federal Reserve , which is balancing the threat of recession against rising inflation and is widely expected to lower its key interest rate Tuesday .
" The Fed is definitely concerned , because these issues impact consumers , " said Wachovia economist Sam Bullard .
Of the over 1,000 American adults surveyed in the poll conducted March 14 - 16 , 65 % said they are " very concerned " about inflation , and 26 % said they are " somewhat concerned . "
Although the latest Department of Labor survey showed that consumer prices did n't rise as much as investors feared in February , March 's inflation figures are expected to be ugly .
Gold and oil continue to hit record highs , as do gasoline prices , and the dollar has seen record lows against both the euro and 13 - year lows against the yen .
But the poll also showed that unemployment concerns loom large , with 59 % saying they are " very concerned " and 27 % saying they are " somewhat concerned . "
According to the Department of Labor , the United States has already lost 85,000 jobs so far in 2008 , with February 's net job report showing the worst loss in nearly five years .
But with the Fed expected to cut its key interest rate later Tuesday , consumer price concerns could be inflated .
The Fed began a series of cuts to its key interest rate in September , taking the rate to 3 % from 5.25 % .
The central bank cuts rates in order to boost the economy and , in this round , to stave off a recession .
But lower interest rates can also weaken the dollar , sending inflation higher .
Through a series of recent speeches , Fed officials have made it clear that their primary concern is unemployment .
Though they have stated that rising inflation is a worry , the central bankers have pledged to continue to cut rates in an attempt to prevent the economy from entering a recession and losing even more jobs .
" The Fed 's biggest concern right now is supporting the financial system by trying to stimulate growth , " said Bullard .
" The Fed is counting on the fundamentals - rising inflation should dissipate as the economy slows . "
But Americans ' concerns do not end with jobs and inflation .
According to the poll , 76 % of Americans are concerned about the recent drop in the stock market , and 77 % are worried about the drop in the amount off money homeowners get when they sell their houses .
The S&P 500 has fallen 11.5 % so far in 2008 .
And the continuing housing crisis has sent new home sales plummeting over 15 % since a year ago .
The median price of a single - family home is at its lowest point since February 2005 .
" The economy is lucky that consumer spending has n't fallen off the cliff , " said Bullard , who believes that sustained spending has prevented the U.S. economy from entering a recession .
" The Fed is definitely concerned , because housing and the stock market affect net worth and impact consumer spending . "
Crazy about Barack Obamamania Infects Germany
Berlin political circles -- both liberal and conservative -- are fawning over US presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Many in Germany see him as a cross between John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King , Jr. , but expectations may be exaggerated .
TEHRAN  Tehran ’s police chief , who was responsible for a crackdown on immodestly dressed women for the past year , has been arrested , a spokesman for the judiciary confirmed Tuesday .
At a news conference , the spokesman , Alireza Jamshidi , would not give the reason for the arrest , the semiofficial Fars news agency reported .
Web sites and local newspapers reported last month that the chief , Gen. Reza Zarei , had been arrested after being caught in a police raid at an underground brothel with six naked prostitutes .
The announcement on Tuesday was the first official confirmation of the arrest .
The chief led a crackdown that started a year ago to increase enforcement of Islamic regulations .
Thousands of young women were detained for violating the Islamic dress code , usually for wearing head scarves that showed too much hair , coats that were tight enough to reveal the figure or pants that were too short .
Prostitution is illegal in Iran and can be punished severely .
Steven Spielberg knows a thing or two about action games .
He advised on the development of the Medal of Honor series , based on his film Saving Private Ryan , and he claims to be on his second play - through of the processor - punishing PC title Crysis .
So it 's a bit surprising to learn that for his first venture as a videogame creative director , the man behind Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park is making not a photorealistic shooter but a cross between Tetris and Jenga .

It all goes back to when he was a kid , Spielberg says .
He 'd spend hours setting up his electric trains so that the locomotives would crash into one another .
Now , with the help of a design team at Electronic Arts , Spielberg hopes to recapture that spirit of creative destruction in Boom Blox , out in May .
Inspired by a Wii tennis session , the auteur got the idea of combining Nintendo 's innovative Wiimote motion - sensing controller with his youthful delight in mayhem .
In the first few levels , you hurl balls at a pile of blocks .
The aim ?
To knock it down .
But it 's not just mindless destruction — you have to think strategically about which blocks to take out in order to bring the whole stack down quickly .
" When you pick up that Wiimote and start bashing stuff , it satisfies something primal , " says Amir Rahimi , the game 's senior producer .
For more , visit wired.com / video Game | Life : Episode Twelve :
In this week 's episode , Steven Spielberg makes a foray into the game business with Boom Blox , and Chris Kohler reviews Mario Kart Wii .
Spielberg did n't just hand off a high concept and then disengage .
" He weighed in on everything from the look of the characters and environments to the way the balls move through the air to the different game modes , " Rahimi says .
One of those modes challenges players to extract blocks from a complex tower without the whole thing collapsing .
Basically , it 's Jenga — except that in this digitized version , the buildings are inhabited by cute little creatures .
That detail was 100 percent Spielberg .
" We were on the path of creating a very generic puzzle game , " Rahimi says .
" He brought in the idea of having characters you interact with to give it an emotional wrapper . "
If the game is as fun as it looks , it may go some way toward erasing those unpleasant memories of the 1983 E.T. game for Atari 2600 .

On a cloudless day near the top of the world , Swiss tourist Claude Balsiger had just finished a late - morning cup of tea and stepped out onto the streets of Tibet ’s capital .
Buddhist monks had been marching against Chinese rule all week , but today seemed calmer .
Suddenly , Tibetan youths started hurling paving stones at police , who tried to protect themselves with their riot shields .
Over the next few hours , the odor of tear gas and fires replaced the scent of incense wafting from backpacker cafes .
The intense Himalayan light was blacked out by smoke .
And in the days that followed , violence would spread beyond Lhasa to ethnic Tibetan villages deep inside China and to Chinese embassies worldwide .
China has barred Western journalists from entering Tibet and ethnic Tibetan areas .
But interviews with foreign witnesses and Chinese residents , as well as blog postings by Tibetans too frightened to be interviewed , show that during three crucial hours on March 14 , woefully unprepared police fled , allowing rioters to burn and smash much of Lhasa ’s commercial center .

Tibetans randomly beat and killed Chinese solely on the basis of their ethnicity : a young motorcyclist bludgeoned in the head with paving stones and probably killed ; a teenage boy in school uniform being dragged by a mob .
When authorities did regroup , paramilitary troops fired live ammunition into the crowds .
Witnesses did not see protesters armed with anything other than stones , bottles of gasoline or a few traditional Tibetan knives .
Despite a massive deployment of Chinese forces , the protests show no signs of abating .
In New Delhi on Friday , Tibetan exiles stormed the Chinese Embassy .
And China posted a “ most wanted ” list of 21 alleged rioters , featuring grainy photographs taken from video shot by a hidden camera .
The death toll of Tibetans had risen to 99 as of Friday , with a 16 - year - old girl being shot by police in China ’s Sichuan County , the Tibetan government in exile said .
Chinese authorities say 19 Chinese have been killed in Lhasa : one police officer and the rest civilians .

Since their homeland was invaded by Chinese communists in 1951 , Tibetans have risen up periodically against Beijing ’s rule .
Led by the Dalai Lama , a Buddhist monk and Nobel Peace Prize laureate , their movement has been largely nonviolent .
There had n’t been a substantial uprising in Lhasa since the late 1980s , giving the city a reputation as a laid - back Shangri - La .
“ Tibetans usually are so calm and friendly , but suddenly they were insane , ” said Balsiger , 25 , a teacher .
“ They were howling like wolves .
. . .
It was so brutal , so violent . ”
March 10 , Monday
Everybody is girded for demonstrations today .
It is the 49th anniversary of the failed Tibetan revolt in which their leader , the Dalai Lama , fled into exile in India .
This year the protests are expected to be bigger because activists hope to use the upcoming Summer Olympics in Beijing to press their case .

Tibetan demonstrations are well - choreographed : Monks , who ran Tibet in pre-communist times , usually take the lead while laypeople try to protect them .
At 6 p.m. , a parade of about 300 red-robed monks leaves the 15th century Drepung Monastery , five miles west of downtown Lhasa .
Blocked by police from reaching the city , the monks sit for several hours at a checkpoint before dispersing .
At dusk , students and monks stage a second demonstration in the center of Lhasa , making a circle around Barkhor Square and joining hands .
The square is filled with uniformed and plainclothes security officials .
A young Dutch couple watch police take away six or seven demonstrators .
“ Everybody is afraid to speak , ” the Dutch tourists , Steve Dubois and Ulrike Lakiere , write later on a blog .
“ Even us , free - born people , not for our sake , but for that of the Tibetans who can get in trouble just by speaking with us . ”

Balsiger recalls meeting a young Tibetan brother and sister at a cafe .
Although he and they have no common language , he understands that they live in fear of Chinese undercover police .
They nervously show him that they wear images of the Dalai Lama , which are banned , on strings around their necks , hidden under their clothes .
March 11 , Tuesday
Nine monks emerge from the Sera Monastery north of Lhasa carrying a banned Tibetan flag and are almost immediately dragged away by police .
Several hundred more monks come out to demand their release .
The paramilitary Chinese People ’s Liberation Army police disperses the crowd with tear gas .

March 12 , Wednesday
Many stores in Lhasa are closed .
Tsering Woeser , a Tibetan poet who writes a blog , says two monks at Drepung Monastery slit their wrists in suicide attempts , and monks at Sera Monastery start a hunger strike .
Water supplies are cut to many of the monasteries .
A foreign tourist wanders into Sera Monastery at 3 p.m. , just as hundreds of monks are rushing out , their hands in the air and in obvious distress .
Police surround them .
“ They were grabbing monks , kicking and beating them .
One monk was kicked in the stomach right in front of us and then beaten on the ground , ” the tourist later tells BBC .

Stores reopen .
The trouble appears to have passed .
But about 11:30 a.m. , as the morning prayer finishes at Ramoche Temple , a small Buddhist shrine up a pedestrian street from the main square , police block monks from marching .
This time , onlookers start throwing stones at police .
Trucks carrying reinforcements speed down Beijing East Street , the main drag .
As soon as police climb out , the stones start flying again .
About 20 protesters in their teens and 20s are cheered on by several hundred older Tibetans .
Rioters use their bare hands to pry paving stones loose and hurl them with such ferocity that they crack police shields .
The police officers , some of them teenagers themselves , hurry into an alley for cover .
The enraged crowd begins to vent its anger on ethnic Chinese passersby .
“ At first it was sort of a game .
You throw the rocks and you run away , ” Susan Witmore , a Canadian business consultant who had given herself a trip to Tibet as a 60th birthday present , later recalls .
“ But then the scene turned incredibly ugly . ”

A young Chinese motorcyclist is struck by stones .
Witmore utters a silent scream to the man , “ Keep moving ! ” but the motorcyclist stops , as if to reason with the mob .
Soon his flashy gold helmet is off and the mob is pounding his head with stones and pipes .
Witmore , who was watching from the lobby of her hotel , retreats into the courtyard in horror .
Other tourists say later that they believe the man was killed .
Balsiger sees the crowd pull a Chinese - looking man off a bicycle .
A teenage boy is bludgeoned on the head , but as he staggers , bleeding on the pavement , barely conscious , a tall foreign man steps in and pulls him to safety .
Police flee , and by early afternoon the mobs have the run of the city .
They go after Chinese shopkeepers , who these days dominate the commercial life of Lhasa .
“ They thought we Han Chinese people were coming to steal from their rice bowls , ” says the manager of Top of the World Hotel on Ramoche Street , near the temple .
She cowers in her courtyard as the crowd sets fire to many of her neighbors ’ businesses .

The mob is more interested in destroying than looting .
Witnesses see cellphones , bicycles , clothing , food and furniture smashed along Beijing East Street .
Cars are overturned and set on fire , often topped with burning Chinese flags .
Riots spread to the Muslim quarter , targeting the Hui , Chinese Muslims who have been opening businesses in Tibet .
Rioters smash holes through metal shop gates and pour in gasoline .
A Muslim family later describes to Chinese journalists how they hid in a bathroom as flames spread around them .
The main gate of the mosque is set on fire , but the mob does n’t get inside .
It is not until 4 p.m. that Chinese authorities venture back into the center of Lhasa .
What happens next is unclear , because by this time the city is under a strict curfew .
According to Tibetan sources , the Public Security Bureau lifts an order restricting the use of live ammunition by the paramilitary forces .
Tibetans say many people are killed in front of the main temple , the Jokhang , and that families come to collect the bodies late at night , offering prayers and strewing traditional white prayer scarves .

“ Many of those killed were young Tibetans , both boys and girls , ” a rioter tells Radio Free Asia .
“ Those who are dead sacrificed their lives for 6 million Tibetans .
My disappointment is that we were not armed . ”
Amid the raging violence , some Tibetans do step in to help the beleaguered ethnic Chinese .
A 24 - year - old Chinese assistant at an optometry shop recalls how a teenage neighbor escorted her home , only to be chastised by a Tibetan security guard who asked , “ How can you come back with a Han Chinese ? ”
The Tibetan girl “ was horrified , ” recalled her Chinese friend .
“ In her eyes were confusion , perplexion , sorrow and mostly astonishment . ”

Overnight , soldiers move into the center of Lhasa .
By the end of the day , they have the city under control .
But protests break out elsewhere .
At Labrang Monastery in Xiahe , 750 miles to the northeast , more than 1,000 Tibetans march against the Chinese .
March 16 , Sunday
Protesters carrying photos of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan flag stage protests in Sichuan , Gansu and Qinghai provinces .
In remote Aba County in Sichuan , Tibetans attack a police station and set fire to a market , firetrucks and police cars .
Police reportedly fire into the crowd , killing at least eight .

March 17 , Monday
Protesters try to storm Chinese embassies and consulates around the world .
“ Chinese people have to realize we can’t bear any more , ” says Tenzin Lama , 25 , a Tibetan student demonstrating in London .
“ We will give up our lives to fight for our beliefs .
Tibetans wo n’t stop . ”

Weapons of war rife on city streets in America Powerful AK - 47 - type rifles are more common now that a ban on those guns is over
The cake had been served and the children were jumping up and down in a big , inflatable castle when the birthday party turned to bedlam .
Clarence McGraw 's jaw dropped as he saw the visitors coming , guns drawn .
The screaming began .
Children ran everywhere in the courtyard of the low - income apartment complex ; adults fell to the ground .
Bullets flew .
The killers wounded three youngsters , but for reasons police can't explain , it was 19 - year - old McGraw they were after .
As McGraw lay in the center of the green square , the gunmen stood over him and fired again .
He was shot 15 to 20 times in all .
The Sept. 15 killing was remarkable in that it took place in the most innocent of settings - the fifth birthday of twin boys .
But it was unremarkable in that one of the guns brandished was an AK - 47 - type rifle - a powerful , rapid - fire weapon that has long been used in Third World conflicts but is increasingly being used in American street fights .
Figures from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , obtained by the Associated Press through public records requests , show a marked increase in the number of AK - type weapons traced and entered into the agency 's computer database because they had been seized or connected to a crime .
The number of such tracings rose even while the federal assault weapons ban was in effect and has continued to climb since its expiration .
Since 1993 , the year before the ban took effect , ATF has recorded a more than sevenfold increase in 7.62x39 mm guns - which includes the original Russian - made AK - 47 and a variety of copycats from around the world .
The number of AK - type guns rose from 1,140 in 1993 to 8,547 last year .
Since 2005 , the first full year after the ban 's expiration , ATF has recorded an 11 percent increase in such tracings .
ATF says the increases in the first half of the 1990s are partly the result of wider usage of its weapons database by local law enforcement agencies .
But after that point , the numbers reflect a real increase in tracings of AK - type guns , the agency acknowledged .
The numbers corroborate what police chiefs around the country have been saying : AKs and other so - called assault weapons are terrorizing their communities and endangering their officers .
The numbers are reflected in some of the most horrifying violence of the past year , including a deadly shooting rampage at a department store in Omaha , Neb .
They 're reflected in the growing number of police forces equipping their officers with higher - powered guns to match the criminals ' firepower .
And they 're reflected in a single 72 - hour period in September that started with the shooting of four Miami - area officers and ended in Kenner , La. , in a drab apartment complex just outside New Orleans .
-- On Thursday , Sept. 13 , Jose Somohano , a 37 - year - old officer with the Miami - Dade police , was cut down during a traffic stop in suburban Miami by a man with an AK - type weapon .
Three other officers - armed , like Somohano , with just handguns - were wounded , one of them suffering a bullet wound the size of a grapefruit in her leg .
By midnight , the gunman , Shawn LaBeet , had been shot to death by police after a huge manhunt .
Police have refused to say how many times Somohano was hit or how many shell casings were found .
The officer 's wife , Elizabeth Somohano , had gone off to her job at an insurance company earlier that day , and just before noon , Jose 's sister reached her at the office .
" Have you heard ? " she asked .
Something was going on in the area Jose patrolled .
Elizabeth called his cell .
She text - messaged him , over and over .
She called her kids to see if they had heard from him .
She checked the Internet to find out what was happening , and learned that officers had been shot and a gunman was on the loose .
A colleague of Jose 's - one of his closest friends - called Elizabeth and told her to stay put .
He showed up at her office , and when their eyes met , he broke into tears .
" He did n't make it , " he told her .
She screamed .
Later , she took some comfort in knowing that her husband had eaten lunch that day , which meant he must have seen the hot - pink note she had slipped into his lunch bag along with his chicken salad - on - pita sandwich : " I love you , macho man . "
Days before the ambush , Miami Police Chief John Timoney agreed to let patrol officers carry assault rifles to help counter the use of such weapons by criminals .
John Rivera , president of the Dade County Police Benevolent Association , pleaded for the same for officers in the Miami - Dade department , which protects more than 1.4 million people around the city .
" It 's almost like we have water pistols , " he said .
For years , only SWAT teams and the like carried AR - 15s or similarly powerful weapons .
But police forces nationwide have increased their firepower to match the criminals ' arsenal - not only in urban areas such as Miami and Los Angeles , but in Waterloo , Iowa , Stillwater , Okla . , Danbury , Conn. , and Merced .
" We 're in an arms race , " said Police Chief Scott Knight of Chaska , Minn. , chairman of the firearms committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police .
-- On Friday , Sept. 14 , along the Tigris River outside Baghdad , an alleged Shiite extremist linked to roadside bombings was taken into custody with his AK - 47s and grenades .
In Afghanistan , in villages south of Kabul , troops arrested three suspected Taliban militants and confiscated their weapons , including AKs .
And in Australia , a former soldier pleaded guilty to gunning down a photographer with an AK in a Sydney contract killing .
With AK - 47 - type guns used in wars and insurrections all over the world , some 250,000 people are said to be killed by such weapons each year , and more than 75 million are believed to be in existence .
In Iraq alone , congressional investigators estimate 110,000 AKs bought by the U.S. for security forces there cannot be accounted for .
The AK was designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov and went into production in 1947 , with its name standing for Avtomat Kalashnikova and the year .
" Once the Wall fell , these guns were everywhere , " said Carlos Baixauli , an agent with ATF .
Kalashnikov , who is now 88 and still lives in Russia , has said he is proud of his invention but saddened it 's been used by terrorists .
He said he wishes he had invented something like a lawnmower .
Bullets fired by AK - 47s travel at a higher velocity than those from many other weapons , and can do grievous damage to the body .
Often they have enough energy to pass clear through .
Knockoffs of the AK can be bought from legitimate gun dealers for as little as $ 300 and are also available on the street .
Original Russian - made models are more expensive .
Normal ammo clips hold 30 rounds , but higher - capacity ones are also available .
Most of the AKs on American streets are semiautomatic , meaning they fire as fast as the gunman can squeeze the trigger .
Fully automatic ones , common on the battlefield , require just one pull of the trigger to release a burst of fire .
A 2004 study by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence concluded that the U.S. ban on AKs and other guns was successful , saying in the five years before its passage , assault weapons made up 4.82 percent of ATF crime gun traces , compared with 1.61 percent between 1995 and 2003 .
Many politicians , police chiefs and gun-control advocates point to the expiration of the assault weapons ban as a reason for the spread of the guns .
But many others argue that the law was so riddled with loopholes that it had little effect .
The National Rifle Association says the focus must be getting criminals off the streets , not more legislation .
" The basic reason why gun-control laws fail is that they require the cooperation of a very unlikely source , and that is criminals , " said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam .
" Each time you pass a gun-control law , the only people that are going to be affected by that law , the only people that are going to follow that law are law - abiding Americans . "
-- On Saturday , Sept. 15 , at the Glenwood Apartments in Kenner , Trinioucka Martin rose early and cooked all morning for her twin boys ' birthday party - meatballs , fried chicken , baked macaroni , sandwiches .
She had already ordered a cake with the youngsters ' picture on it , hired a disc jockey and rented the inflatable castle and house .
McGraw woke up at his aunt 's house across a highway from the apartment complex and had a hankering for something sweet .
He wanted some cake .
At the party , after the crowd had dispersed and the officers arrived , McGraw lay dead on the ground near a sewer grate , his torso and lower body riddled with bullet wounds .
Balloons still floated from ribbon ; the " Happy Birthday " banner still hung .
No arrests have been made .
McGraw was buried in a $ 450 grave against a chain - link fence in a crumbling New Orleans cemetery .
The mound of dirt above his casket is littered with rocks and debris .
There was no money for a marker .
Oh boy , here we go again .
I must have heard this 10 times at least , every time from a reliable source or something …
This album is getting more and more like UFOs and the moon landing in 1969 – every time you hear about it it sounds less and less true .
Especially since their guitarist left to rejoin NIN ( no , not Slash … ) , and the rumors that this album is actually going to be bluegrass .
Actually , there is only one reason I ’m even the slightest bit interested in this … but it ’s just a hunch .
My guess is that if Guns ’n ’ Roses is ever going to release new music again , it ’s going to be with Duff McKagan , Matt Sorum and Slash , or at least 2 of them .
Hey , guess what !
Velvet Revolver is probably splitting so that means that … this could actually work .
It ’s a long show I know but hey … a dream is a dream .
So , the rumor was started by the band ’s official website ; it said that Axl Rose and company are “ in negotiations ” to finally release “ Chinese Democracy . ”
The posting claims that new management is now in place , but did not give further details a possible release date .

As the designated political heir of a deeply unpopular president  according to Gallup , President Bush has the highest disapproval rating recorded in 70 years of polling  John McCain should have little hope of winning in November .
In fact , however , current polls show him roughly tied with either Democrat .
In part this may reflect the Democrats ’ problems .
For the most part , however , it probably reflects the perception , eagerly propagated by Mr. McCain ’s many admirers in the news media , that he ’s very different from Mr. Bush  a responsible guy , a straight talker .
But is this perception at all true ?
During the 2000 campaign people said much the same thing about Mr. Bush ; those of us who looked hard at his policy proposals , especially on taxes , saw the shape of things to come .
And a look at what Mr. McCain says about taxes shows the same combination of irresponsibility and double - talk that , back in 2000 , foreshadowed the character of the Bush administration .
This post seeks to address an interesting conundrum .
The conundrum ?

Texas employers get access to some workers ' health info Access to health records bolstered for employers
Medical privacy has been protected for years by the most unlikely guardians : insurance companies .
Now , the Texas Legislature has become the first in the nation to force insurance companies to pass along sensitive employee health records to their companies , a practice permitted under federal law .
Starting Jan. 1 , companies became entitled to receive a list of their employees and family members — identified by number or some other code , but not by name — whose health bills exceeded $ 15,000 during the previous year .
Employers also can obtain the diagnoses , dates of service , amounts paid , prognoses , future costs and treatment plans for each .
The law 's supporters say they need the information to get a clear snapshot of health expenses , while critics fear it 's an erosion of patient privacy .
Companies can also obtain the detailed health information on those who have been precertified for hospital stays of five or more days , according to the bill that sailed through the Texas House and Senate and was signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry last summer .
Mixed reactions
The law reinforces the new requirements with fines of up to $ 25,000 against insurers who do n't comply , aiming to make costs more competitive .
For an employer facing skyrocketing premiums and the inability to get another bid , " it could end up that the only alternative is to stop the health insurance , " said Sam Francis , a board member of the Texas Association of Benefit Administrators , whose members handle self - funded insurance plans .
Some privacy advocates , however , fear the new law will undermine decades of strict protections in Texas and open the door to discrimination .
" It appears to give employers the power to find out who is expensive and fire them , " said Dr. Deborah Peel , a psychiatrist and founder and chairwoman of Patient Privacy Rights , an Austin - based consumer group .
Peel also said that even though the law keeps workers ' names off the records , they can be deciphered easily by comparing payroll records with dates of medical care .
If insurers use an employee 's regular policy number , the match is even easier .
And because it's not difficult to rack up a $ 15,000 bill these days , employers will gain access to many records , Peel said .
Under the new statute , employers must pledge they wo n't use the protected information for anything except plan administration .
Francis said he trusts employers to do the right thing .
Besides , said Francis , companies often know when employees are sick because of the time they take off .
Federal privacy laws already allowed companies to access their employees ' protected medical information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act .
However , many insurance carriers — including those acting as third - party administrators for self - insured plans — have been loath to disclose it .
" It 's driving everyone crazy , " said Jesse Gelsomini , an employment lawyer with Haynes and Boone in Houston , referring to his corporate clients who have tried unsuccessfully to obtain the data .
Without it , he said , companies could n't shop for better rates .
The Texas Association of Benefit Administrators , which has been working on the legislation for several years , credited state Sen.
Robert Duncan , R - Lubbock , and state Rep. John Smithee , R - Amarillo , for shepherding the bill .
Like many states , Texas had a hodgepodge of laws that dealt with the release of protected medical information .
The three statutes and conflicting rules were n't practical , said Francis , who is also executive vice president and general counsel of JI Specialty Services in Austin .
By the time information was provided , it was too old to be useful , said Francis , who added he has had several inquiries from counterparts in other states about following Texas ' nationwide lead .
Under the new law , employees would have no way of knowing — or objecting — if their bosses sought their medical records , Peel said .
However , employers still cannot obtain health information protected by other state or federal laws , such as HIV status , genetic test results or mental illness .
Need questioned
Houston lawyer Richard Mithoff said he does n't understand why employers or insurance brokers need such detailed medical information .
" I'm an employer , and I review new medical plans periodically , " said Mithoff , who represents individuals in cases where medical privacy has been an issue .
" If there is a legitimate need , it can be satisfied with data in the aggregate .
But not individual data — what would be the purpose in that ?
" I just see a lot of room for abuse , " he said .
Further , fearful employees might delay or avoid treatment if they think it could hurt their standing at work , said Kim Ross , a health care policy consultant in Austin who represents medical industry firms .
That could cost companies and insurers more in the long run , said Ross , the former chief lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association .
If some diseases are n't managed early , the cost of acute care later can increase dramatically .
Houston employment lawyer Margie Harris , who represents workers who believe they were terminated because of a major health problem , said a company could have good reasons to fire an employee but still be accused of wrongdoing because it knew too much .
" If I were an employer , I would n't want that list , " Harris said .

Let 's get one thing straight :
The protesters who gather outside the El Sol Day Labor Center in Jupiter every Saturday morning do n't hate immigrants .
They hate illegal immigration .
" America was built by immigrants , " concedes a man who gives his name only as Bob .
He is a former Marine , a self - described patriot , and a commercial diver .
" We 're opposed to illegals getting paid but then not contributing to Social Security , not paying taxes .
They 're taking benefits but not contributing to society .
It 's important to get that fact out . "
That 's the main gripe .
There are others , though .
It 's a given that these protesters resent having to press " 1 " for English .
" The Roman Empire fell [ in part because ] it would n't insist that people speak their language , " Bob says .
Then there are the health issues .
" Did you know that leprosy is making a comeback in this country ? " asks John Barber , an unsmiling , mustached man in jean shorts .
If that does n't get you aboard , how about this ?
" Thirteen Americans a day are killed by illegal immigrant drivers , " Barber says .
Of course , it all plays out in the panorama of global politics .
The government 's " lax " stance toward illegal immigrants , one protester says , is part of a secret plan to combine the United States , Canada , and Mexico into one country .
Every weekend since December , 20 to 100 like - minded individuals have gathered with picket signs in the hot sun on the corner of Military Trail and Indiantown Road .
Just behind the protesters stands the source of their discontent : a sizable two - story white building on town property .
This is El Sol .
Every morning around 6:30 , scores of young to middle - aged men , mostly of Hispanic descent , begin the trek over here in hopes of being chosen for a day labor assignment — usually light construction or landscaping .
It 's a veritable invasion .
An army of short , dark people on bicycles .
The protesters allege that most of the day laborers are illegal immigrants .
They argue that by leasing the building to El Sol for just $ 1 a year , the Town of Jupiter is violating state and federal laws .
Florida Statutes — specifically Title XXXI , Chapter 448.09 — states that " it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to employ , hire , recruit , or refer ... an alien who is not duly authorized to work " in the United States .
U.S. Code —
Title 8 , Chapter 12 , Subchapter II , Part VIII — says it 's against the law " to hire , or to recruit , or refer for a fee ... an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien . "
It 's plain as day .
Liberals can yap all they want about human rights or cultural sensitivity but , as one of the protesters ' signs says , " Illegal Means Illegal . "
The city 's position is that it is doing nothing more than leasing space to a nonprofit organization .
Staff at the nonprofit say they are performing a community service by providing a safe , centralized locale for matching workers with jobs .
They do n't even check workers ' immigration status .
The federal government , for the most part , stays out of it , and local police simply keep the peace .
To the protesters , it 's as though all the authorities are sticking their fingers in their ears , saying , " Na Na Na Na I can't hear you ! "
Not sure who to complain to anymore , the protesters take to the street corner , where they are bombarded with supportive honks and angry shouts .
Tensions run high enough that four police officers keep watch nearby .
In the national discourse , immigration reform has become a political buzz point , especially during this presidential election season .
Republican candidate Tom Tancredo made the matter central to his run for office , and television commentators like Lou Dobbs keep the issue in play by ranting about the deleterious effects of illegals on American life .
In Jupiter , away from rehearsed campaign speeches or insulated sound stages , the drama plays out in real time , at street level .
Two of the protest 's organizers — 78 - year - old Charlie Elliott and 64 - year - old John Parsons — recall how they met on a senior softball team and decided to organize rather than simply kvetch .
They spread the word about protests through conservative radio talk shows and the nonprofit group Floridians for Immigration Enforcement ( FLIMEN ) .
Parsons ran for Town Council touting his anti-illegal - immigration stance but lost the election in March .
A curly haired man of about 30 drives up in a maroon Jeep Cherokee .
He rolls down his window .
" I think it 's disgusting what you guys are doing out here , " he tells the group of protesters , itching for an argument .
His name is Eric , he says , and he hires day laborers regularly .
Elliott , clad in Bermuda shorts and white socks that cover his calves , marches over to the vehicle .
He tugs his baseball cap and wipes his brow .
This type of person confounds him .
" Do n't you care that laws are being broken ? " he asks .
" If Americans would actually show up on time and do n't steal — " Eric begins , leaning out the window of the Jeep .
Elliott groans in frustration .
" An American could make $ 20 an hour , " he cries , " except the illegals come in and you pay him ten ! "
" If Americans want their jobs back , " the contractor says , " they need to be more reliable , more efficient , trained better — "
" You 're hiring the wrong person ! " Parsons pipes in .
" These are the most productive workers in the country ! "
" They 've probably got the worst employer ! " Elliott spits back .
" You want to pay $ 25 , $ 30 to get your car washed ?
$ 250 to get your lawn done , when now you 're getting it for $ 90 ? "
" Yeah !
If you 'd pay the proper benefits ! " Elliott argues .
" Everyone here protesting is enjoying the benefits of them being in the country , " the contractor argues back , his voice rising .
" It 's not right !
You should not be intimidating them .
They can't even ride down the street without being harassed .
Get on the Americans for being lazy and worthless . "
Those words are blasphemous .
The crowd of protesters gathers around the truck .
Three or four of them run to the back of it to jot down the license plate so they can report Eric — to somebody !
— for hiring illegals .
" He has no license plate ! " one of them cries .
" I knew you 'd try something like that ! " the contractor taunts , waving the plate from inside the cab but showing only its back side .
Charlie Elliott runs over to the policemen , pointing furiously .
Eric jumps out of his truck , its engine running , to show the cops that he indeed has a plate .
Shaking his head , he jumps back in his vehicle and speeds off .
" He 's getting rich off the illegals , " Elliott mumbles breathlessly .
" Yeah , " scoffs Parsons , pushing his glasses up on his nose as he eyeballs the truck peeling out of the parking lot .
" The illegals bought him that SUV . "
The inside of El Sol looks like a school cafeteria .
Men — and four or five women — sit at tables and chat .
Or they read newspapers .
Some form a snaking line at a food window , where they are served free hot meals and coffee in Starbucks cups .
Another line forms for a computer lab , where workers check email or take online English tutorials .
Above the computers are signs in Spanish : " Do n't use the computers for betting or pornography . "
Occasionally , a number is called over a loudspeaker and a worker is selected through a raffle system to go off for work .
By 2 p.m. , though , most of the men are still sitting around .
Chairs go up .
Mops come out .
An institutional smell , like Pine Sol , wafts through the air .
Before this center opened in 2006 , workers would loiter on the side of the road , mostly on Center Street , in hopes they'd get picked up to do some yard work or construction .
If a truck pulled over , 20 men might run up to it and jockey for the job .
Scuffles occasionally broke out .
It was an untidy sight in this palmy bedroom community , where the median family income , according to Money magazine , is $ 74,756 a year , the big tourist attraction is a historical lighthouse , and many celebrities — like singer Celine Dion and race - car champ Jeff Gordon — have lived quietly .
So the town opted to lease space in its municipal complex to Catholic Charities for $ 1 a year so the charity organization could open El Sol .
Recently , the Catholics turned over management of the center to an independent nonprofit entity created to run it .
It is funded entirely by private donations and has only three workers on staff .
Director Mike Richmond , a retired journalist , does not speak Spanish and says he does n't know details about the laws that regulate immigrant workers .
The arcane technicalities are irrelevant to the day - to - day task of running an outpost like El Sol , Richmond says .
You want legal information ?
" You 'd have to ask an immigration expert , " he says .
In fact , state and federal laws make it criminal for an employer to hire illegal workers , but he'd have to have " actual knowledge " that the individuals are aliens or do it " knowingly . "
The state statute similarly applies only to employers who " knowingly " hire illegal workers .
( The state statute is said by people on both sides of the protest to be largely unenforceable , because federal law preempts it .
But it remains on the books . )
Hence , El Sol 's do n't - ask policy .
To register at the center , a day laborer needs only to show proof that he or she lives in Jupiter ( most live in neighborhoods on the east side of town ) .
The service is open to anyone who meets that requirement , regardless of their race or heritage , so anyone — black , white , Haitian , male or female , citizen or noncitizen — is welcome .
Still , most workers hail from Guatemala .
The center also offers language classes , job skills , legal assistance , and even a psychologist 's help .
It is headquarters for a marimba band and two soccer teams .
Richmond eagerly displays a report showing the value of services it provides estimated at $ 64,789 per month .
Labor coordinator Dora Valdivia , who immigrated legally from Peru , speaks passionately .
" We took a problem and turned it into a good thing , " she says .
" We are doing the best we can do .
That 's not to say we have fixed everything — that 's not our responsibility .
We are a resource center for the neighborhood , for everybody .
That 's the spirit of the center . "
On an average day , Valdivia estimates , about 15 to 20 percent of the workers who show up get hired .
That 's about 30 out of 150 applicants .
In its year and a half of operation , the center has registered about 860 workers and 1,600 employers .
Jeronimo Camposeco is vice president of El Sol and leader of a nonprofit Guatemalan support group called Corn Maya .
He came to America in 1980 , fleeing Guatemala 's 36 - year civil war .
In 1982 , the Catholic Church asked him to move from Pennsylvania to Indiantown to assist the immigrant population .
Many of the immigrants come from isolated regions in the mountains of Guatemala , where they are considered indigenous .
Their main language is not Spanish but either Kanjobal or one of 22 other dialects used by Guatemala 's Indians .
Camposeco was one of a handful of American residents in a position to understand them .
He has been a U.S. citizen since 1999 .
Camposeco is a big man with thick , black - rimmed glasses whose deep but quiet voice conveys a sense of gravitas , like a gentle giant .
" Even after the war ended , " he explains , " the situation in Guatemala continued .
There are guerrilla fights .
The paramilitary is still there , even with a peace treaty . "
Decades of corruption have kept the country in poverty , he says .
" We are called the corn people , " Camposeco says .
" It 's the basis of our diet .
Now , there is not enough land to feed our own people .
Yes , they work in sugar cane , bananas , coffee .
It 's harvested by Indians , but it 's not their bananas . "
Most farmland , he says , is controlled by large multinational corporations .
Anti-immigration groups pressure American politicians , Camposeco says , " which makes it hard for us [ Guatemalans ] to get any kind of legal status .
Except a tourist visa — and those are only available to the very rich .
As soon as they see us at the embassy , they say , ' No way . ' "
It 's not as though immigrants would n't prefer to live in the lush valleys of their home countries , Camposeco says .
" Most people are feeling very bad that they have to be here .
They are human beings who want to live decently and work decently . "
He sighs sadly .
" Everybody loves animals .
I guess not everybody loves humans . "
Edmundo Rodriguez , 27 , is vice president of the workers ' group at El Sol .
He has been in Jupiter for two years and three months now .
It cost him $ 5,000 to get here from Guatemala , he says .
Although it would be almost impossible to verify his story , similar tales of " coyotes " smuggling humans across the border have been so thoroughly reported that they seem almost cliché .
According to Rodriguez , the practice continues , with as much grasping profiteering as ever .
Rodriguez , a happy - looking fellow who wears broken - in jeans and a T - shirt from Zion National Park , describes how he came to Jupiter in 2006 : a saga involving several trucks , one boat , two near - captures , and a network of safehouses .
He began by paying a coyote $ 2,000 up - front .
He was packed into a semi truck , with nonperishables in the main container as decoys and a secret compartment underneath where he lay with dozens of people , packed in like slaves during the Middle Passage .
Along the way , they would stop at safehouses , where they would sometimes wait days .
Coyotes communicated through a phone and radio network , warning one another when police were around , urging one another forward when they were n't .
One day , Rodriguez and his companions were ushered by boat .
Another , they had to jump off a moving train .
At one point , the group was divvied up into smaller trucks .
During a 24 - hour leg of the trip , they were given only two apples to eat — " and not the nice ones from Publix . "
In Mexico , Rodriguez 's truck was stopped by a guard .
Each of the eight immigrants had to pony up 2,000 pesos ( about $ 200 ) in bribes .
With just his backpack , one change of clothes , and a gallon of water , Rodriguez says , he marched through the desert for five days and nights , seeing little more than sand and tumbleweed .
" It 's not like Tijuana , " he says .
No bridge .
No big welcome sign .
No donkeys painted like zebras .
Guards crisscross the vast border area in SUVs .
At what Rodriguez suspects is the technical border , he says , is a fence — the kind used to corral cows , with posts and two lines of barbed wire .
" All you can see is lights " in the distance , he recalls .
Once the group made it to a hotel room in Arizona , Rodriguez paid the coyote the outstanding $ 3,000 .
The immigrants organized by destination — some were going to Florida , others to New Jersey .
They waited for more Jupiter - bound arrivals and then set off for the Sunshine State in one nonstop drive .
When he first landed in Jupiter , Rodriguez lived with seven other people .
Then he helped his aunt come over , and now he lives with her and another woman in an apartment where they get a good deal on rent .
Police give him no trouble , and " the neighbors do n't even talk to us , " he says , except maybe to wave hello .
He attributes the lack of communication to the language barrier .
Will he stay ?
" If I can find a wife , " he laughs .
That can be a problem : not too many eligible women around .
But leisure is n't high on his list of priorities .
" The United States is a good country .
It 's beautiful , " Rodriguez says .
But most of all , " It opens doors . "
His future children would be able to go to school .
" Here , an 8 - year - old knows computers better than me .
" I feel fortunate , " Rodriguez says .
" I came to look for opportunities my country does n't have .
There , there are not so many resources . "
Although he 's the son of farm workers , Rodriguez says he'd been a teacher in Guatemala , where he made less than $ 200 a month .
Now , if hired regularly for day jobs , he can make up to ten times that .
But he has launched other ventures just in case his number does n't come up often enough in the raffle .
In his spare time , he teaches his peers how to read and write .
He has also started a little business where people can buy things from a catalog .
It 's a pyramid scheme , kind of like Amway , in which he 's rewarded by getting more people to join .
He does n't let the protesters bother him too much , he says .
" This is the country of opportunity .
I am fighting for my future . "
With that , he hands out his business card .
Charlie Elliott is disturbed by what he sees in the neighborhood of Pine Gardens South .
He says he 's aware of 18 robberies this year that were never reported in the paper .
His immigrant neighbors host drug parties — he knows they are drug parties because he sees 15 to 20 cars come and go in an hour .
His neighbor is a coyote who runs an illegal daycare .
And immigrants are getting free prescriptions from the county , then turning around to sell them for profit , he alleges .
There are Hispanic gangs in the streets , Elliott says .
Houses with seven cars in the driveway violate code , he says , as do apartments that can be rented by the bed .
Go to the hospital , he says , and there 's a four - hour wait because of sick immigrants crowding the place .
He is particularly offended that one girl arrived in town on a Thursday and had a job at Burger King on Friday .
Elliott believes that charities that supply immigrants with free food are being duped .
Multiple charities service the exact same house , he says , causing overflow and waste .
" They 're throwing food away !
Ask our garbageman ! "
He suggests doing a ride - along on a garbage route to find evidence .
Sgt. Scott Pascarella of the Jupiter Police Department , asked about this barrage of allegations , says there is no increase in robberies and " no influx of drug activity among the Hispanic community . "
He says he does n't have any knowledge of immigrant gangs , and if there 's an illegal coyote - run daycare , Elliott is welcome to report it .
A ride - along with Elliott through the neighborhood does reveal sights that might be normal and even comforting in Guatemala but are new to Pine Gardens South : groups of Hispanic men in cowboy hats , women carrying babies in slings , a man napping on a front lawn at 1 p.m. , grown men riding bicycles .
For speaking out about his concerns , Elliott says , he has been rewarded with a broken window on his truck .
Another day , he came out to find a dent in his hood .
Elliott 's son - in - law David Perry lives down the street .
Outside his house stands a flagpole with an American flag and another flag flying the number 88 — for race - car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr .
" Twenty years ago , this was all blue - collar families and dirt roads , " Perry says .
He began noticing the influx of foreigners around 2005 .
" You can tell by the bicycles , these guys do n't have licenses .
At night , it 's worse — they go around with no reflectors . "
" They rock ' n ' roll pretty good too , " Perry adds .
He hears music , traffic , and breaking beer bottles at 2 and 3 a.m .
He has lodged at least 15 complaints , he says .
" They wo n't stop drinking .
They party till dawn . "
( Sgt. Pascarella says the town recently passed an ordinance to help curb noise disturbances and open consumption of alcohol . )
Perry reports that he once saw a drunken guy go flying over his handlebars .
Another time , there was a stabbing .
" They parade down the street with the Mexican flag . "
Perry has even witnessed a man selling ice cream from a three - wheeled bicycle .
" That should be illegal , should n't it ? "
Pascarella laughs at this suggestion , saying that he has never encountered such a rogue ice cream salesman .
" If I do confront one , I 'll give you a call ! "
Once , when he heard cops investigating a home invasion , Perry says , " I had my gun out . "
Perry points across the street .
" You know Corn Maya ? " he asks ominously .
" That 's the head guy 's house . "
Is n't Corn Maya , like , a charity ?
Perry chuckles , as though the suggestion is naive .
" That 's a front . "
What about the old saying , " If you ca n't beat 'em , join 'em ? "
How about heading over to meet the neighbors with a six - pack of Corona ?
Perry scoffs .
He 'd rather beat 'em .
Elliott 's across - the - street neighbor , Diane Mondun , 59 , has lived in the neighborhood since 1973 .
She says the man next door is a slumlord who crams in too many tenants .
The house , she says , has rats and plumbing problems .
Another neighbor — an immigrant — is always working on cars .
Oil could contaminate the ground .
Mondun says Jupiter is such a magnet for immigrants that strange men have showed up on her doorstep asking , " Friend ?
You speaka English ? "
When she looks puzzled , they go to the next house .
She says that , since people need proof of residence to register at El Sol , they have stolen her water bill to get her address .
( Pascarella says he has never heard of a stolen - water - bill racket . )
In spite of the center , contractors pick up workers in the neighborhood , honking at 6:30 a.m .
" To be honest , the families are fine , " Mondun says .
" It 's the young single guys I 'm worried about — drinking , fighting , doing whatever they want to do . "
Mondun fears potential sexual assaults .
" Three girls live down the street .
You see the guys check them out . "
She has encountered drunken men in the alley .
" One of them asked me if I wanted a cigarette and a beer . "
She decidedly did not appreciate the gesture .
" We do n't want them out ; we just want everybody to abide by the laws , " she says , frustrated .
" People say it 's cultural .
Do n't we have laws here ?
" Jupiter was never like this , " she laments .
" It started out as a nice , quiet , peaceful place . "
Well , a nice quiet place for " rednecks , " she adds .
Those guys all moved to Jupiter Farms , though .
" But you felt safe around them . "
She sighs .
" Some people have guns .
I do n't want to see guys shot . "
Jupiter 's town spokesperson Kate Moretto says that the whole conflict began when " there was slowing traffic because of the hiring practices going on .
It was a large quality - of - life issue . "
The town passed an anti-solicitation ordinance that prevents people from soliciting jobs on the street .
It effectively drives the day labor hiring process to El Sol .
" As you imagine , we can't single people out " to check their background , Moretto says .
But " it is our policy to I.D. anyone who is arrested for a felony who they believe may not have documented status . "
The jails , she says , " have a procedure once that person is booked .
Our police department does n't necessarily get involved in that . "
Charlie Elliott says policemen give him thumbs up but wo n't go on record against El Sol for fear of losing their jobs .
El Sol Director Mike Richmond says the opposite : Just the other day , he had a retired cop stop in and write a check for $ 1,000 .
Although it 's not an official designation , the town is sometimes denigratingly called a " sanctuary city " — a place where illegal immigrants will not be rounded up by municipal officials .
Local police have reached out to workers at El Sol by lecturing on topics like bicycle safety and how to avoid being victimized .
One former Jupiter policeman , John Banister , took illegal immigration enforcement into his own hands .
" There is no official word on what to do with illegals , " Banister says .
During the years he was with the department — 2002 to 2007 — he might arrest suspects for theft or assault , but " we were told specifically we were n't allowed to pick them up just for being illegal . "
He suggests that the town was afraid of accusations of racial profiling or discrimination lawsuits .
" So you would play in the gray . "
Banister says that he found himself arresting the same guys five , seven , eight times .
" Nine out of ten never had I.D.
They gave us the wrong name .
It would not be uncommon for a guy to have ten aliases . "
When he encountered a chronic troublemaker , he would go to a private phone and contact Immigration and Customs Enforcement , the federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws .
He would fax his arrest reports or probable - cause affidavits .
In many cases , he says , an ICE agent would show up to take custody of the offender and take him to Krome Detention Center in Miami for a deportation hearing .
Eventually , Banister says , he was ordered to stop the practice .
He later left the department over a separate internal dispute and is now suing it .
Sgt. Pascarella disputes Banister 's tale about turning in illegals and being reprimanded .
He adds that if ICE asked for assistance , Jupiter police would offer " whatever we need to do to be in full compliance . "
Simply having crossed the border illegally wo n't usually get an immigrant in trouble .
Workers here illegally are generally not prosecuted unless they commit additional crimes .
Barbara Gonzalez , a spokesperson for the ICE bureau in Miami , says federal agents do n't barge in on suspected illegal alien gathering places and round people up without concrete evidence of wrongdoing .
" We conduct target investigations based on intelligence and investigative leads , " she says .
In the first week of April , the agency conducted a tricounty sweep that netted 332 suspects — 81 of those in Palm Beach County .
Of the 332 , 300 had already had due process and been ordered deported or placed under supervision .
But they then flaunted the law and tried to hide .
The other 32 had been arrested for criminal violations .
Jill Hanson , an attorney who volunteers at El Sol ( the center was named partly in honor of her late husband , Sol Silverman , a champion of workers ' rights ) says that ICE officers " were pounding on doors at 4:30 a.m. " and that they did n't have warrants .
Hanson believes groups like FLIMEN operate on " complete xenophobia " and disseminate a lot of dangerous misinformation .
She notes that the leprosy fear was based on a debunked quote by television commentator Lou Dobbs .
Statistics like the number of illegal alien drivers who kill people daily would be impossible to determine , since municipalities do n't generally make that a category in their record - keeping .
Hanson points to a website called wecanstopthehate.org as a good source for separating myth from fact .
According to the National Immigration Law Center , " For over a century , the U.S. Supreme Court consistently has ruled that the federal government has broad and exclusive power to regulate immigration . "
But that has n't stopped local governments from trying .
State Rep. Gayle Harrell ( R - Stuart ) , who speaks Spanish and holds a master 's degree in Latin American studies , has sponsored and promoted bills that would require the state to enforce immigration laws .
One measure would require employers to use an " e- verify " system to prove that their workers are legal .
Another would explicitly prohibit municipalities from opening centers like El Sol .
( A similar center , called Buena Fe , opened in Loxahatchee Groves this spring based on the El Sol model , and another is planned for Lake Worth . )
At presstime , it appeared that both bills would die before the end of the legislative session .
Other states are grappling with similar legislation .
Some are placing the burden on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants .
Oklahoma has made it a felony to shelter or transport illegal workers , and it allows citizens to sue employers if they believe they were let go in favor of an illegal immigrant .
Arizona punishes businesses that hire illegal workers by revoking and suspending their business licenses .
The governor of Maine recently signed an executive order requiring state police to enforce immigration laws .
In some places , like Collier County , Florida , ICE has implemented a 287 ( g ) program , which trains and authorizes local sheriff 's deputies to enforce federal law .
Under that program , local officers can check a worker 's immigration status and initiate the deportation process .
Some cities — like San Francisco — have done the opposite , declaring themselves havens for illegal immigrants , going out of their way to welcome them in various languages and offer freedom from prosecution at schools and hospitals .
Critics say that despite those cities ' intentions , federal agents would still have the power to enforce the law wherever they choose .
At this point , protesters are ready to go beyond the sidewalk .
John Parsons and Charlie Elliott traveled to Tallahassee on April 8 to speak during a hearing about the proposed legislation backed by Harrell .
Parsons recently mulled over the situation at El Sol .
" I imagine there will be a lawsuit coming down the pike , " he said , although FLIMEN currently has no intention of litigating .
" Somebody 's gotta challenge it . "
Self - deport . "
That 's the way protesters would like to see all the immigrants say adios .
" It 's called attrition through enforcement , " says diver and former Marine Bob .
You can forget about having to use taxpayer money to pay for buses , trains , and planes , he says .
Once immigrants can't make any moolah here , they 'll go back to where they came from .
It 's a strategy that , in fact , may be working .
The Inter - American Development Bank reported just last week that there has been a marked drop in the amount of money being sent by Latino immigrants back to their home countries in recent years as the economy and tough anti-immigration policies are taking hold .
Still , exhausting arguments about the financial costs or benefits of illegal workers continue .
Anti-illegal - immigrant groups argue that the workers cost taxpayers billions of dollars , while proponents of easing immigration laws — notable among them former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan — say that immigrant workers build U.S. infrastructure and boost the economy .
An independent contractor named Russ Smozanek says that a legitimate employer would have to pay worker 's compensation , liability insurance , and taxes to cover Social Security and Medicare .
In addition , one would need to have paid for a business license and articles of incorporation .
This could cost thousands of dollars , he says .
Compare that with someone operating under the table , hiring an illegal worker for $ 7 or $ 10 an hour .
( One counterargument is that legitimate employers often do pay taxes and Social Security for workers — but undocumented ones can't collect the benefits because they are not eligible for Social Security cards . )
Robert Mergupis is a 48 - year - old metal - stud framer who says he 's been out of work for two years because he cannot compete with the low cost of illegal immigrant labor .
" If my wife had n't had a house deeded to her , we'd be homeless .
People label me a bum , but I built all those single - family homes in the Bluffs .
I 'm protecting my life out here .
I 'm protecting you guys ' families . "
Mergupis attends a Catholic church .
Of the Catholics ' support of the day labor center , he says , " I feel they put a dagger in my heart . "
One protester says : " I work at a grocery store .
The immigrants get free milk — gallons and gallons .
A lady has two kids and is pregnant and you see 'em put it in the back of their brand - new truck . "
" Tuberculosis was just about cured 70 years ago ; now it 's coming back , " says Jupiter resident Marianne Bonsignor .
She explains that the immigration system was better a hundred years ago .
" At Ellis Island , immigrants from Italy and Hungary would be shipped back if they had bad eyes .
Only a certain quota was allowed . "
Criminal screening was better there too .
" If they had a record back in Italy , they could check that . "
How ?
" You could go to any church .
They 've got it all written down in Latin .
You could go see the priest and ask . "
Sixty - year - old Leonor Mason chimes in : " My grandsons and their friends come home for summer vacation and there are no jobs for them .
At night , you walk in the neighborhood — it 's frightening .
[ The immigrants ] urinate by the clock tower !
At CVS , my God , they just loiter — it 's hurting their business .
They 're shoplifting .
Go in TJ Maxx , Ross — you do n't have room to walk anymore . "
Joseph Henry Timlin Jr. , a master tile setter — " 28 years in the trade , baby " — says he went to El Sol to find day work .
" I thought I had a good chance . "
He says he took a number but did n't get hired .
Like most of the protesters , he is white .
He wishes more African - Americans would join the protesters ' cause .
If a white woman wanted to try going through the raffle process at El Sol , Timlin says , " Come armed , and bring your boyfriend .
Illegal aliens commit a lot of rapes . "
Marine Bob gets a kick out of the time he called the cops on a Mexican restaurant that was flying the Mexican flag withoutflying an American one in a position of superior prominence — a violation of U.S. Code , Title 4 , Chapter 1 , Section 7 , Paragraph C , he recites .
The cops , he said , made the restaurant fold up its flag .
Almost every time the light turns red and cars back up at the intersection , the protesters get at least one honk of support .
Sometimes people chime , " Get 'em out of here ! " or " Better days are coming ! "
Less frequently , people argue : " Racist !
I respect hard - working people better than you ! "
One passerby shouts out the window : " Oh yeah — you guys were all on the Mayflower !
You 're all fuckin ' idiots . "
It 's about 11:30 a.m. when four giggling teenagers suddenly jump through the bushes carrying signs that say " I [ Heart ] Immigrants , " " Buck Fush , " and " Deport Yourself — You 're an Immigrant Too . "
" We are brothers ! " shouts the only boy , 17 - year - old Eric Lankford .
He runs through the crowd of protesters and leans toward the windows of passing cars .
" The melting pot is boiling over ! " he wails , then bursts into laughter .
His three female friends giggle and raise their signs high in the air .
This is something the protesters did n't count on : counterprotesters .
Teenaged nihilists .
Provocateurs who question everything .
" Shut up , you piece of junk , piece of trash , " mutters John Barber , in his jean shorts .
" You hate your own family ! " cries Lankford , jumping up and down .
" Speak for yourself , idiot , " Barber says .
" I think that guy 's got a problem , " Marianne Bonsignor says worriedly .
" Everyone here is for Satan ! " Lankford yells at cars , laughing .
" You 're jumping around like a nut , " Bonsignor says .
" They 're radicals , " John Parsons mumbles dismissively , trying not to take the bait .
" Hooray for communism ! " Lankford shouts .
" If I had a son like that ... , " Bonsignor gasps .
" He 's got a brown sock and a black sock — is that weird or what ? "
The protesters leapfrog the counterprotesters to get the more visible spot on the sidewalk .
The counterprotesters leapfrog them .
And so it goes , until the cops walk over .
Barber and another protester grill two of the girls about their beliefs .
They admit that they do n't know that much about illegal immigration and that they tagged along because they were bored .
" You are talking like a little girl , " Barber says condescendingly .
" Educate yourself . "
She folds an arm across her chest as though embarrassed .
Lankford continues to jump and shout , waving a sign that says , " You ca n't be a pimp and a prostitute too ! "
" It 's better illegals get hired than idiots like you , " Barber grumbles .
Eighteen - year - old Sarah O'Connor stands her ground as the protesters try to convince her that they are saving the jobs of her family and her generation .
She knows better ; she 's president of Amnesty International at her high school .
" The pilgrims were n't legal , " she says .
She believes the protesters ' claims are bunk .
Kids her age work at movie theaters , not at jobs based on physical labor , and she 's never seen gang violence at her school .
Most of her peers have gotten along fine with incoming immigrant students .
" We 're all cool with it , " she says .
Bonsignor approaches the cops .
" I do n't think they should be permitted to use those signs , " she states .
" Freedom of speech , ma'am , " the officer replies .
" Yeah , but it 's nasty speech . "
She herself has been holding a sign that says " Secure the Border " all day , but any irony is lost on her .
As the two groups — all white — crowd the sidewalk , a Hispanic male comes cruising down the lane on his bicycle .
He looks oblivious to the fracas around him — and quite possibly about him .
He pedals by unfazed , headphones from his iPod tucked into his ears .
Zanu - PF said anomalies had been detected in a number of constituencies President Robert Mugabe 's party has asked Zimbabwe 's electoral officials to delay presidential poll results to check " errors and miscalculations " .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change said the move was illegal - a recount is possible only after the result has been published .
They have asked the High Court to publish the outcome immediately .
The MDC believes its leader Morgan Tsvangirai won outright in the vote held eight days ago .
The opposition party has also denied it had proposed a unity government .
A minister had earlier said Zanu - PF had rejected an opposition call for a coalition .
On Saturday , the opposition accused President Mugabe of " preparing a war " .
And the farmers ' union said a number of white - owned farms had been briefly invaded by war veterans ' groups loyal to Mr Mugabe in southern Masvingo .
A spokesman said the situation was under control after police intervened to disperse them .
' Anomalies ' Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party has cited what it claims are anomalies in the presidential vote despite the fact the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC ) has still to release the result .
Information Minister Bright Matonga told the BBC the anomalies were with the collation of the results - there was a discrepancy between the voting results put outside polling stations and the form sent to the central election commission .
It 's madness literally and metaphorically
Tendai Biti
MDC Secretary - General
Speculation grips Harare Brown and Mbeki in Zimbabwe talks
Send us your comments
It was not clear if this meant the whole vote had to be counted again .
The minister insisted the request did not amount to a recount - which has been dismissed as illegal by MDC Secretary - General Tendai Biti .
" The [ Electoral ]
Act says that you ask for a recount within 48 hours of the counting , " he said .
" Counting takes place at polling stations so it 's within 48 hours of that .
" It 's madness literally and metaphorically " .
According to papers submitted to the ZEC by Zanu - PF , the number of votes for Mr Mugabe recorded at a number of polling stations were reduced before being sent on to electoral officials .
Some ZEC officials working in the Midlands constituencies of Mberengwa East , West , North and South had since been arrested , the state - run Sunday Mail newspaper said .
" As will soon become apparent , the constituency elections officer and his team committed errors of miscounting that are so glaring as to prejudice not just our clients ' candidate but also his co-contestants , " Zanu - PF 's letter said , according to the Sunday Mail .
In a separate article , the Sunday Mail quoted Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa as saying the Zanu - PF had rejected an offer from Mr Tsvangirai to form a national unity government , but Mr Biti denied that an offer had been made .
Court challenge Before the High Court judge on Sunday , MDC lawyer Alec Muchadehama said the results " must be announced forthwith " , as they had been available since 30 March .
But ZEC lawyer George Chikumbirike said the court 's remit did not include ruling on the case - only ZEC could adjudicate .
The court is to rule on Monday on whether it has jurisdiction over the case .
The Zanu - PF complaint came hours after the ZEC declared the final results of last week 's Senate election .
It said Mr Mugabe 's party had won 30 seats , with the combined opposition taking the same number .
The MDC says Mr Tsvangirai took 50.3 % of the presidential vote
In the lower house , opposition parties took 109 seats , while Zanu - PF won just 97 - the first time it has failed to win a majority since independence from the UK in 1980 .
On Saturday Mr Tsvangirai claimed victory for the first time since the vote , saying figures posted outside polling stations confirmed he had reached the required threshold of more than 50 % of the vote to win outright - making a run-off unnecessary .
He also claimed that the country 's central bank was printing money " for the finance of violence " , and called for dialogue on a peaceful transition .
Mr Mugabe , 84 , came to power 28 years ago at independence on a wave of optimism .
But in recent years Zimbabwe has been plagued by the world 's highest inflation , as well as acute food and fuel shortages , which correspondents say have driven many voters to back the opposition .

情けないことに、本件でまともに取り上げている主要紙がほとんどないので、あえてスポーツ紙社会面記事から。
今日（１１日）の日刊スポーツ紙面記事から。
訪米途中にわずか１０時間ほど日本に立ち寄ったチベット仏教の最高指導者ダライ・ラマ１４世なのですが、安倍晋三前首相の昭恵夫人が成田空港近くのホテルで面会したことが、ダライ・ラマを繰り返し批判する中国政府に配慮し、日本政府が接触を避ける中、波紋を広げているのだそうです。
ダライ・ラマの来日は、日本政府にとって「最悪なタイミング」（政府幹部）なのだそうです。
馬鹿か・・ ・
聖火リレーの妨害行為が話題となっている今、世界の多くの政治指導者が中国政府にダライ・ラマとの話し合いを行うべきと強く促しているこのときに、まさに今回の来日は、日本政府にとって「最高なタイミング」ではなかったのか。
昭恵夫人以外で、国会議員の面会は、自民党人権問題等調査会の太田誠一会長だけだったそうですが、どうした福田首相はなぜダライラマと面会しないのでしょう。
「 ５月６日にも来日が予想される胡錦涛・中国国家主席との首脳会談を控え、波風を立てたくないため」だかなんだか知りませんが、情けないことこの上ないではありませんか。
なんというチキン（臆病）ぶりなのでしょう。
・・・
中国べったりの外務省や福田政権にダライラマとの接触を期待するのははなからばかげていたとしても、福田さん以外の自民党の有力政治家たちよ、民主党小沢党首よ、社民党福島党首よ、共産党志位委員長よ、あなた方はなぜ、来日したダライラマと面会しないのか。
この最高の機会を生かさず、日本の政党の代表がだれも面会しないとは、これはいったいどういうことなのでしょう。
日本の政治家は、与党も野党もそんなに中国様の顔色ばかり気にしているということなのか？
だれ一人来日したダライ・ラマ14世と面会しない日本の政党党首の体たらく・・・
一民間人である昭恵夫人の面会が波紋を広げていること自体、この国の政治の情けないふがいなさを晒しているのであります。
世界中で中国批判が強まる中、与党も野党もダライ・ラマ14世来日を無視・沈黙するチキンぶりなのであります。
情けないです 。

The Shoes toolkit has a nice rich text format support .
At first sight it might seem that Shoes text support borrows a lot from HTML , for example the most commonly used text block is para .
In addition to the paragraph text block , you can use banner , title , subtitle , tagline , caption , and inscription .
[ source:ruby ]
Shoes.app dostack dobanner “ banner ” title “ title ” subtitle “ subtitle ” tagline “ tagline ” caption “ caption ” para “ paragraph ” inscription “ inscritpion ” endend [ / source ]
As you can see banner is the largest text block , followed by tittle , etc .
The default size for banner , title , subtitle , tagline , caption , para , and inscription is 48 , 34 , 26 , 18 , 14 , 12 , 10 pixels respectively .
You can also change the default size of a text block by using the optional size parameter .
[ source:ruby ]
Shoes.app dostack dobanner “ banner ” , : size => 20endend [ / source ]
Most often you will use the paragraph text block .
If you have to display a great amount of text on a paragraph you pass in variable number of strings parameters .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
Further evidence that times are tough :
It now costs more than a penny to make a penny .
And the cost of a nickel is more than 7 ½ cents .
Surging prices for copper , zinc and nickel have some in Congress trying to bring back the steel - made pennies of World War II and maybe using steel for nickels , as well .
Copper and nickel prices have tripled since 2003 and the price of zinc has quadrupled , said Rep. Luis Gutierrez , D - Illinois , whose subcommittee oversees the U.S. Mint .
Keeping the coin content means “ contributing to our national debt by almost as much as the coin is worth , ” Gutierrez said .

Is mathematics a science ?

Abstract : Mathematics is not a science , but there are grey areas at the fringes .
1991 Mathematics Subject Classification . 01
Key words and phrases .
mathematics , science
Thanks to the members of the Champlain College Senior Common Room for the conversations which provoked this essay .
This essay is also available in LaTeX and PostScript formats .
Mathematics is certainly a science in the broad sense of " systematic and formulated knowledge " , but most people use " science " to refer only to the natural sciences .
Since mathematics provides the language in which the natural sciences aspire to describe and analyse the universe , there is a natural link between mathematics and the natural sciences .
Indeed schools , universities , and government agencies usually lump them together .
( 1 ) On the other hand , most mathematicians do not consider themselves to be scientists and vice versa .
So is mathematics a natural science ?
( 2 ) The natural sciences investigate the physical universe but mathematics does not , so mathematics is not really a natural science .
This leaves open the subtler question of whether mathematics is essentially similar in method to the natural sciences in spite of the difference in subject matter .
I do not think it is .
A disclaimer is in order .
This essay is a " native informant 's " opinion : I am a practicing ( if mediocre ) mathematician , but not a philosopher or student of the practice of science or mathematics .
I have a relevant philosophical bias , in that I am a Platonist where mathematical reality is concerned . ( 3 )
The object of the natural sciences is to devise and refine approximate descriptions or models of aspects of the physical universe .
The feature distinguishing science from other means of doing so is its characteristic method .
Crudely , this consists of asking a question , formulating a hypothesis , testing it , and then , on the basis of the results , rejecting or provisionally accepting the hypothesis .
One usually repeats the process after refining the question , the hypothesis , or one 's ability to test it .
The ultimate arbiter of correctness is the available empirical evidence : a hypothesis which is falsified -- i.e. inconsistent with good data -- is not acceptable .
( A hypothesis which could not be falsified by any empirical data is not scientific . )
Note that a scientific theory or hypothesis is ( at best ) only provisionally acceptable at any given time , because a new piece of evidence may force it to be modified or rejected outright .
In mathematics , however , the ultimate arbiter of correctness is proof rather than empirical evidence .
This reflects a fundamental diffence in what one is trying to achieve : mathematics is concerned with finding certain kinds of necessary truths .
For a mathematical statement to be accepted as a theorem , its conclusion must be known to always be true whenever its hypotheses are satisfied .
We accept it only when we have a proof : a chain of reasoning demonstrating that the conclusion must follow from the hypotheses .
( 4 ) Empirical evidence does , to be sure , play an important part in doing mathematics .
Conjectures are usually formed by observing a common pattern in a number of examples , and are often tested on other examples before a proof is attempted .
However , such evidence is not sufficient by itself : consider the assertion that every even integer greater than 4 is the sum of two ( not necessarily different ) odd prime numbers .
( 5 ) We have lots of empirical evidence supporting this assertion : 6 = 3+3 , 8 = 5+3 , 10 = 7+3 and 10 = 5+5 , 12 = 7+5 , and so on .
However , we can not be sure it is true unless someone finds a proof .
Until then , it is conceivable that someone might find a very big even number which is not the sum of two odd prime numbers . ( 6 )
The essential difference in method between mathematics and science , and the weakness of each , is neatly exploited in the following joke :
Some academics relaxing in a common room are asked whether all odd numbers greater than one are prime .
The physicist proceeds to experiment -- 3 is prime , 5 is prime , 7 is prime , 9 does n't seem to be prime , but that might be an experimental error , 11 is prime , 13 is prime -- and concludes that the experimental evidence tends to support the hypothesis that all odd numbers are prime .
The engineer , not to be outdone by a physicist , also proceeds by experiment -- 3 is prime , 5 is prime , 7 is prime , 9 is prime , 11 is prime , 13 is prime , 15 is prime -- and concludes that all odd numbers must be prime .
The statistician checks a randomly chosen sample of odd numbers -- 17 is prime , 29 is prime , 41 is prime , 101 is prime , 269 is prime -- and concludes that it is probably true that all odd numbers are prime .
The physicist observes that other experiments have confirmed his conclusion , but the mathematician sneers at " mere examples " and posts the following : 3 is prime .
By an easy argument which is left to the reader , it follows that all odd numbers greater than one are prime . ( 7 )
It must be admitted that the difference noted above between science and mathematics is not completely sharp , even aside from the fact that the practice of mathematics does have empirical content .
Some of the areas in which mathematics is applied to modelling aspects of the physical universe are very grey indeed .
The basic problem is that one can be confident of a fact derived by mathematical methods only to the extent that the mathematical object being considered is an accurate model of the relevant parts of the universe .
One can be completely confident this is so in mathematics ( where the mathematical object in question is the relevant part of the universe ) and quite confident in , for example , computer science ( where the physical objects being analysed are made to conform to a mathematically precise pattern ) and parts of theoretical physics ( where some theories have survived very extensive testing ) .
However , one cannot usually be very confident in , say , long - term economic projections .
The moral is that in applying mathematics to problems from the " real " world , one must judiciously temper the use of mathematical knowledge and techniques with empirical knowledge and testing .
With increasing interaction between mathematics and the natural sciences , plus the practical problems involved in finding and checking really long proofs , it is arguable that the grey areas are expanding .
It has even been argued that proof and certainty in mathematics are nearly obsolete [ 4 ] , though most of those who agree that " empirical " mathematics has a place still believe that proofs have an important role ( e.g . [ 2 ] and [ 7 ] ) .
It is my belief that proofs will remain central for a good while yet .
(1) Which is convenient for mathematicians when grant money is distributed , so do n't show this essay to any funding agency !
( 2 ) The problem of showing that mathematics is not a social science is left as an exercise for the reader .
One could argue that mathematics ought to be classified with the arts and humanities [ 3 ] , but it does n't function like one [ 6 ] .
There is also the argument that mathematics is " not really accessible enough to be an art and not immediately useful enough to be a science " [ 1 ] , but this assumes that art is accessible and science is useful .
( 3 ) As for non-mathematical reality , who cares ?
( 4 ) Of course , this begs the question of just what constitutes such a chain of reasoning .
Philosophers really worry about this , but most mathematicians settle for giving arguments acceptable to most other mathematicians .
History suggests that it is a mistake to be too rigid about correctness in mathematics : it took over two centuries , for example , to work out rigorous foundations for calculus .
( 5 ) This assertion is called Goldbach 's Conjecture .
A prime number is an integer greater than one which is not a product of two smaller positive integers .
( 6 ) If you do either , please publish ! ( 7 ) What of the others present in the common room ?
The chemist [ 5 ] observes that the periodic table gives the answer : 3 is lithium , 5 is boron , 7 is nitrogen , 9 is fluorine , 11 is sodium , ...
Since elements are indivisible -- nuclear fission being uncommon in chemistry labs --- these are all prime .
( The same is true for even numbers ! ) .
The economist notes that 3 is prime , 5 is prime , 7 is prime , but 9 is n't prime , and exclaims , " Look !
The prime rate is dropping ! "
The computer scientist goes off to write a program to check all the odd numbers .
Its output reads : 3 is prime .
3 is prime .
3 is prime .
...
The sociologist argues that one should n't refer to numbers as odd because they might be offended or as prime because the term implies favouritism , and the theologian concurs since all numbers must be equal before God . ( 8 ) If you 're still wondering whether it 's true , you have n't paid careful attention .
( 7 ) ( 9 ) Until subsequent investigation confirms that 9 = 3 * 3 , anyway .

Five years after the start of the war in Iraq , Vice President Dick Cheney offered a positive assessment of the war today and called last year 's troop surge a " major success . "
" On the security front , I think there 's a general consensus that we 've made major progress , that the surge has worked .
That 's been a major success , " Cheney told ABC News ' Martha Raddatz .
When asked about how that jibes with recent polls that show about two - thirds of Americans say the fight in Iraq is not worth it , Cheney replied , " So ? "
" You do n't care what the American people think ? " Raddatz asked the vice president .
" You ca n't be blown off course by polls , " said Cheney , who is currently on a tour of the Middle East .
" This president is very courageous and determined to go the course .
There has been a huge fundamental change and transformation for the better .
That 's a huge accomplishment . "
Since the war began , nearly 4,000 U.S. troops have been killed and more than 29,000 have been injured in the war , which has so far cost the United States roughly $ 600 billion , according to the Pentagon .
By some estimates , the war will end up costing Americans anywhere between $ 2 trillion and $ 4 trillion .
' Rough Patch ' in Economy
Cheney also touched on the current state of the economy , admitting , " we 're clearly going through a rough patch . "
But the Bush administration has not said the United States is experiencing a recession .
Cheney said that the downturn can , in part , be blamed on natural economic cycles .
" We 've had , prior to that , 52 months of uninterrupted economic growth , " he said .
" Now , of course , we 've got problems in the housing industry , mortgage - backed securities and so forth that have created problems that we 're having to deal with . "

WASHINGTON / September 28 , 2020 – Activists continue to advance the theory that coronavirus stay - at - home policies have caused a “ spike ” in domestic violence cases , despite the fact that police reports fail to confirm these claims .
In April , 41 senators signed a letter that warned of a domestic violence “ surge ” that they described as “ particularly dangerous ” and “ horrifying . ”
The letter highlighted activists ’ concerns , but did not cite any police reports to corroborate the “ surge .
” The drive to issue alarming , but unsupported claims of female victimization continued through September .
A classified memo written by a top military official stationed in Western Iraq reveals that a prison in downtown Fallujah is so overcrowded and dirty that it does not even meet basic “ minimal levels of hygiene for human beings . ”
“ The conditions in these jails are so bad that I think we need to do the right thing in terms of caring for the prisoners even with our own dollars , or release them , ” says the memo , written late last month by Maj .
Gen. John Kelly , commander of U.S forces in western Iraq .
The classified document , leaked to the website Wikileaks , a website where whistleblowers can “ reveal unethical behavior in their governments and corporations , ” was authenticated by the organization .
The memo contains other shocking revelations about conditions at the jail , including a massive shortage of food and water .
The prison is said to be run by Iraqi officials .
US Marines oversee operation of the facility .
“ I found the conditions there to be exactly ( unbelivable [ sic ] over crowding , total lack of anything approaching even minimal levels of hygiene for human beings , no food , little water , no ventilation ) to those described in the recent ( 18 February ) FOX news artickle [ sic ] by Michael Totten entitled the “ Dungeon of Fallujah . , ” says Kelly ’s memo click here “ We need to go to general quarters on this issue right now …
To state that the current system is broken would erroneously imply that there is a system in place to be broken . ”
Totten , an independent journalist , said the prison can house a maximum of 110 prisoners but he discovered that there were more then 900 cramped into the facility .
US contractors built the prison in 2005 which is located next to the US Joint Communications Center is
It is unknown who Kelly , the military commander in Iraq , sent the memo to .
A Pentagon spokesman did not return calls for comment late Wednesday .
Kelly wrote that when he inspected the prison “ iraqis [ sic ] and marines present throughout my inspection as to why these conditions existed , three conditions were universaly [ sic ] cited as problems in Fallujah as well as the rest of Anbar , ” the commander ’s memo says .
“ First , there is zero support from the government for any of the jails in Anbar .
No funds , food or medical support has been provided from any ministry , ” Kelly added .
“ Second , the police that run Anbar ’s jails are the same personnel responsable [ sic ] for investigating crimes .
These jailer / investigators are undermanned and more often than not spend most of their time out begging and scavenging for food than investigating crimes .
( It is unlikely the prisoners will eat today ) … I believe the Iraqi police are doing the best they can , and they literally begged me on humanitarian , moral and religious grounds to help them help the prisoners by somehow moving the government to action . ”
In a report published earlier Wednesday , Lt. Col.
Michael Callanan told United Press International that following an inspection of the prison by Kelly , US forces decided to “ advise and assist ” Iraqis managing the jail and are providing food to the prisoners .
“ They are being fed now , ” Callanan told UPI .
The US military turned over control of Fallujah to the 1st Iraqi Army Division in December 2006 .
Since then .
the US military and top White House officials have cited Fallujah as a city where efforts to install democratic values and the rule of law have paid off .
Hundreds of millions of dollars has been spent in that city alone to train Iraqi police and security forces .
But Kelly ’s memo contradicts the Bush administration ’s claims .
He describes how the US military , after five years since the US invaded the country and more than half - a- billion dollars spent by US taxpayers , still cannot seem to find success training Iraq security forces .
“ The Iraqi police will ultimately be the ones whose shoulders the burden of winning or losing the fight will be carried , ” the classified memo says .
“ To date , little attention has been paid to the Iraqi corrections system in Anbar and its current discrepancies will prevent the [ Iraqi police ] from becoming a professional law enforcement force unless immediate and significant support is provided . ”
LOS ANGELES 
In a twist on the recent string of sex tapes of Hollywood ’s young stars , Vivid Entertainment plans to release what it says is a film from the vaults of classic rock : a sex film supposedly of Jimi Hendrix .
The film shows a naked man who resembles Hendrix , the guitar legend who died in 1970 , wearing a bandanna in his Afro , having sex with two brunettes in a dimly lighted bedroom .
His full face appears on screen for only a few seconds , with his eyes closed .
In other portions there are flashes of his profile .
But his hands , bedecked with rings , roam large on the screen at times .
The film has no audio .
Vivid , a large maker of pornographic movies that is releasing the film this week , has created a 45 - minute DVD , called “ Jimi Hendrix the Sex Tape , ” that combines 11 minutes of sex footage with a retrospective of Hendrix ’s career in the 1960s ( but with none of his music included ) .
The company , which has also released tapes of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee , Kim Kardashian and others , will sell it for $ 39.95 in stores and over the Internet , and will also offer the film for downloading .
But the identity of the man in the film , which has circulated among Hendrix aficionados for years , is fiercely disputed by experts and former associates .
And the DVD arrives on the heels of a string of hoaxes involving star look - alikes and one other dead superstar .
Internet news reports recently cast doubt on the claims of a New York collectibles dealer who said he brokered the sale of an explicit Marilyn Monroe film .

Is war with Iran inevitable , even imminent ?
Or is peace at hand ?
From the public diplomacy of the administration , either conclusion may be reached .
Consider .
“ West Offers Iran ‘ Refreshed ’ Deal , ” ran the headline in the May 3 Washington Times .
The story described an offer to Iran , agreed to by all five members of the Security Council — the United States , Britain , France , Russia and China — of a sweetened grand bargain , if Tehran will suspend its enrichment of uranium .
Blessing the offering in London was Condi Rice .
Details will not be made public , but the offer is said to include Western aid to Iran for a civilian nuclear program , a light water reactor and a five - year stock of enriched uranium held for Iran by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
America ’s contribution would be support for Iran ’s admission to the World Trade Organization , a conference to discuss regional security in the Gulf , a U.S. offer to sell Iran spare parts for its U.S. - built civilian aircraft and a beginning of the lifting of three decades of U.S. sanctions .
News of this offer , plus the relaxed mood in Washington , which is utterly unlike the tense atmosphere prior to March 2003 , suggests that war with Iran is far from the mind of this city .
But to take the warnings and threats of the civilian and military leaders of this administration at face value would lead one to conclude the opposite — that war with Iran is indeed inevitable , and probably soon .
Consider .
Last month , Gen. David Petraeus was asked by Joe Lieberman , “ Is it fair to say that the Iranian - backed special groups in Iraq are responsible for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians ? ”
“ It certainly is . …
That is correct , ” answered the general .
The next day , Petraeus testified , “ Unchecked , the ‘ special groups ’ pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq . ”
Petraeus has since been promoted to command of all U.S. forces in the region .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , known as an opponent of war on Iran , followed Petraeus , accusing Tehran of being “ hell - bent on acquiring nuclear weapons . ”
Last week , Gates was out front again .
“ What the Iranians are doing is killing American servicemen and - women inside Iraq . ”
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , is now also pounding the war drum .
Iran ’s “ irresponsible influence , ” its support of terror and its pursuit of atomic weapons , he said last week , is creating a “ perfect nightmare ” for the region .
The Pentagon , said the chairman , is planning for “ potential military … action ” because of Iran ’s “ increasingly lethal and malign influence . ”
“ It would be a mistake to think that we are out of combat capacity , ” Mullen declared .
A second U.S. carrier just entered the Persian Gulf .
CBS reports that a target list of U.S. military planners includes the headquarters of the Quds Force and plants where Iran produces enhanced IEDs and the rockets used against the Green Zone .
The network also reports that the State Department has begun drafting an ultimatum .
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmal Khalilzad has chimed in : “ Iran and Syria must stop the flow of weapons and foreign fighters into Iraq , and their malign interference in Iraq . ”
Iraqi Maj. Gen. Qasim Atta says 700 rockets and mortars have been fired at Coalition forces and the Green Zone , and most of the “ Katyusha and Grad rockets and smart roadside bombs ” were Iranian - made .
The U.S. military is preparing a dossier on Iran ’s role in the Iraq war .
In the Landon Lecture at Kansas State , CIA Director Michael Hayden declared , “ It … is the policy of the Iranian government , approved to the highest level … to facilitate the killing of Americans in Iraq . ”
That day , State designated Iran the “ most significant ” and “ most active ” state sponsor of terror on earth .
From the White House to State to the Pentagon to CIA , the Bush administration is now singing from the same song sheet : Iran ’s Quds Force , with the knowledge of President Ahmadinejad , is arming and directing “ special groups ” to kill U.S. soldiers and prevent a U.S. victory .
Is the White House rattling sabers to prod Iran into talks ?
Perhaps .
But the administration has also painted itself , and us , into a corner with the war talk .
And there are only three ways out .
The first is that Iran halts the attacks , ends its intervention and negotiates on the six - nation offer .
The second is that Iran rejects the deal , refuses to stop the attacks and U.S. air strikes begin .
The third is that Bush is bluffing and goes home railing against an axis - of - evil nation killing American soldiers , having done nothing .
With Israel , the Israeli lobby , the neocons and Dick Cheney insisting on air strikes , and even Hillary Clinton talking about Iran being “ obliterated , ” the last course would seem the least probable .
We are likely headed either for negotiations with Iran or war , after Bush returns from the 60th anniversary celebration of Israel ’s birth .

" In Pennsylvania , we realize that top party officials are not with us as it relates to Senator Obama 's candidacy , " Jones said , " but there are three words that were born in Philadelphia and still resonate across the Commonwealth today , and they are ' We the People . ' "
The United States is n’t a “ democracy . ”
Though every American should have learned this fact in high school civics class , the smart - set still like to ridicule people who point it out–such a cliché , and all .
Today , we see why the Left worked to convince Americans that majoritarianism was a profound moral good .
And it ’s not just that America is going through another silly debate about the suddenly inconvenient Electoral College ; it ’s that Democrats are increasingly comfortable attacking foundational ideas of American governance .

So much for the safety of shadows .
A Manhattan hooker interviewed by Diane Sawyer for an ABC special on prostitution was busted by her mom – who recognized her daughter , despite the network ’s efforts to disguise her .
“ I ’m mentioning the interview now because last night , I learned that my parents tuned in to ABC that fateful day and promptly recognized me , in spite of the silhouette , the altered voice , the distorted profile , the vague and thoroughly dated details , ” wrote the hooker , who blogs on wordpress.com under the name “ debauchette . ”
“ I received an e-mail from my mother saying that she knows .
She saw the interview and decided to sit on this knowledge until she could see it again , and then she decided to contact me . ”
The blogger refused an interview with The Post .
“ Unfortunately , while my mother knows about my other life , I still worry about being outed altogether and I do n’t think I have the strength for that risk right now , ” she wrote .
“ It ’s been a rough few days . ”
Debauchette signed her polite refusal “ Jane . ”
The unapologetic hooker quotes her mom ’s distressed e-mail response – “ I have to say that it was n’t a complete surprise . . .
But I was in a state of denial . ” – and wrote that she was relieved that at least her mother was n’t angry or disgusted .
The unfortunate revelation did n’t quell her passion for the job , however .
“ Later in the day , I saw Gabriel . . .
He told me to take my clothes off , and this made me smile . . .
While we undressed , I thought about how good this is , ” she blogged .
Although ABC
News caught some flak for its interview techniques during last week ’s debate between Democrats Sens.
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , there was no hint of anger in debauchette ’s blog about Sawyer ’s grilling .
Not that she felt she won over the anchorwoman .
“ Sawyer asked me about preserving the ‘ sanctity ’ of my body , as though sex without the imprimatur of love were inherently degrading , ” the blogger chides .
“ I feel like I can only sigh , because I doubt I can begin to penetrate the many layers of misunderstandings and preconceptions , let alone that relentless working assumption that a woman ’s value as a human being decreases as she gains sexual experience . ”
A spokeswoman for Sawyer said she could “ neither confirm nor deny ” the identity of the blogger as the sex worker interviewed for the special , which aired in the wake of the prostitution scandal that forced former Gov. Eliot Spitzer out of office .
Seven Ways That Choice Makes Your Life Hell , Part 2
Very few things in this world are one - sided , all good or all bad .
In Part 1 of this series I introduced the idea that the extraordinary human power of choice can lead us into our own personal hell .
Barry Schwartz has written an insightful book on the dark side of choice , called The Paradox of Choice .
I ’ve extracted and combined the many ideas that Schwartz discusses into 7 key pathways or gateways into a personal hell .
In part one , I covered the first four gateways .
In this article , we ’ll discuss the remaining three gateways .
The Fifth Gate : Missed Opportunities and Regret
Every choice that you make leaves some possibility behind .
You ’re always making trade - offs : price or safety , space or style .
Any trade - off you make is unsettling .
The truth is that you and I do n’t want to settle for one option , while giving up the others .
We want it all .
When you plan your future choices , studies show that you find it easy to imagine choosing one option at the expense of another ( for example trading safety for cost ) .
But when you get to the moment of choice , you find it much harder to actually give up one possibility for another .
In this world of endless choice , you are confronted with a mountain of alternatives , each with strengths and weaknesses .
There are few simple decisions .
Instead your decisions are full of a long list of trade - offs .
Studies show that we mentally exaggerate the loss associated with making a trade - off and missing an opportunity .
It ’s as if you imagine yourself already possessing all the options .
Then , in your moment of choice , you feel yourself losing all the options but one .
When many options must be left behind for a choice to be made , you have a huge collection of perceived loss .
These decisions can become painful enough to leave you paralyzed .
Result ?
You do nothing at all .
And if you do take action and choose , you ’re weighed down by the missed opportunities , and little satisfied with the choice you ’ve made , and any benefits that it brings .
Regret
Do you ever feel regret ?
It ’s such a haunting feeling .
It gnaws and pulls at you , and whispers that you ’ve missed out on great opportunities , by making the wrong choice or doing nothing at all .
If I asked you what you regret most in the last six months , you ’d probably mention actions that did n’t turn out well .
If I asked you what you regret most in your life as a whole , you ’d probably identify your failures to take action , and pursue things that you ’re passionate about .
When you face so many alternatives , it ’s easy to imagine that you ’ve made the wrong choice , and that another path would have been better .
And you get buried in regret for not taking action , because you ’re afraid to make a choice , and give up all the other possibilities .
When we think about the options for a choice we ’re making , we imagine the regret we will feel for making a bad choice , and this drives us to delay or avoid making any choice at all .
In today ’s world of endless choices , and hesitant decisions , regret follows us everywhere , and grows stronger with every decision we make , and fail to make .
The Sixth Gate : The Curse of Comparison
Whenever you say that something is good or bad , there is an implicit or explicit comparison to something else .
Social scientist Alex Michalos writes that people measure their satisfaction based on thinking about three gaps :
The gap between what you have and what you want
The gap between what you have and what you think others like you have
The gap between what you have and the best you have had in the past
When you encounter more and more options , you are driven to want more and more .
Why ?
You can see others enjoying those possibilities , whether in real life , or the media , and imagine yourself in their place .
You can see yourself possessing those things , or enjoying those experiences , or being that person .
Comparisons between what we have and what we might have can be a powerful driving force to motivate us to take action .
That sounds like a good thing , and it often is .
Comparisons can enhance or diminish your experience of what you have .
But typically , our comparisons make what we have seem dull and empty .
What if those comparisons are not used to motivate us ?
What if comparison is used in the absence of action ?
In a world of options , and possibilities , comparison can readily convince us to be unhappy or unsatisfied with what we have .
How can any one option compare with a whole world of alternatives ?
The potential excitement and mystery of the new and unknown dulls the familiar beauty that we already know .
And if we are not ready or willing to take action to change our situation , we are setting ourselves up to be miserable .
The Seventh Gate : Control and Blame
Do you need to feel in control of your life to be happy ?
Studies were done where animals were put in unpleasant situations ( mild shocks ) that they could do nothing to stop .
These animals were later put in situations where the animals could act to positively affect their environment .
But the animals sat passively and did nothing .
They had learned to be helpless .
There are many parallels between helpless animals and clinically depressed people .
They both feel that they have no control over their situations , and are passive and miserable .
It ’s not as simple , though , as feeling you have no control over a single situation .
There are always things that you and I have no control over .
Dr. Martin Seligman suggests that helplessness induced by failure or lack of control leads to depression if a person explains to herself that the causes of failure are far - reaching , recurring , and personal .
Do you tell yourself that your successes are a result of your own actions , in a way that ’s readily repeatable , and relevant to large portions of your life ?
And , do you tell yourself that any failures are due to temporary , narrowly relevant causes outside of yourself ?
That ’s what optimists do , according to Dr. Seligman .
Optimists see success under their own control , with endless possibilities to repeat success throughout their life .
Failures are little bumps in the road that will go away .
Pessimists , on the other hand , see failure everywhere , and blame themselves for it .
They are prime candidates for serious depression .
Our world seems full of unlimited choices and possibility , but we can only get a tiny bit of it , while the rest seems forever denied to us .
We ’re often disappointed with the results of our choices , and easily label our choices as failures , just because we can imagine some better alternative .
In this world of great choice , and great dissatisfaction , we see explosive growth in depression .
What ’s Next ?
We ’ve discussed seven ways that choice can darken your life .
These are real dangers .
But the burdens that come with endless alternatives are not inevitable .
In Part 3 of this series , we ’ll look at some changes in mindset that help us take advantage of choice and possibility , while avoiding the seven gates .

The Paradox of Choice Online
MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Indian consumer electronics maker Videocon Industries Ltd VEDI .BO will bid for the handset unit of Motorola Inc MOT.N if the U.S. firm decides to sell the business , the chairman of Videocon said on Tuesday .
“ We learnt from a reliable source that they will be selling it and when they do we are sending an expression of interest , ” Venugopal Dhoot told Reuters .
Motorola declined to comment on Dhoot ’s remarks .
Motorola said last week it plans to split into two publicly traded entities in 2009 , separating its mobile phone unit from the rest of the business that makes television set - top boxes and network equipment .
Motorola shares rose 2.6 percent to $ 9.54 in midday trade amid similar gains in the telecommunications and technology sector , with the Nasdaq .IXIC and Dow Jones industrial average .DJI both up more than 2 percent .
Analysts see the split helping Motorola negotiate a joint venture or a sale for the cellphone business .
“ It may be a very serious business for us because we have got mobile phone licenses for 22 circles in India .
Apart from that , we have our own retail network with about 1,000 shops where we sell mobile phones , ” Dhoot said .
He said Videocon was well positioned for a bid , which could be financed from internal accruals and debt .
India is the world ’s fastest growing market for wireless subscribers , adding more than eight million users a month .
Total wireless users in India stood at nearly 251 million at the end of February , and are expected to surpass the United States as the world ’s second - biggest market by mid-April after China .
HAVANA , Cuba ( CNN ) -- Cuba will allow its citizens to stay in hotels previously reserved for foreigners , the latest in a series of decisions to lift bans on goods and services that the average Cuban can't afford .
The prohibition on staying in foreigners - only hotels unnerved many Cubans , who complained that foreigners were being afforded rights that were denied to ordinary citizens .
Cubans will be allowed to stay in the hotels beginning at midnight Monday , said employees at several Havana hotels .
Word of the change came from Tourism Ministry officials , the employees said .
For most Cubans , the measure is largely symbolic , as hotel rates are unaffordable .
Tourist hotels in Cuba can cost anywhere from $ 60 to more than $ 200 a night -- well out of reach for most Cubans , who earn fewer than $ 20 a month on average .
The hotel announcement comes after the government lifted a ban last week on Cubans owning cell phones .
That privilege , too , will be too costly for most Cubans .
Watch Cubans ' reactions to cell phone privileges »
The Cuban government did not say how much cell phones will cost , but it currently costs more than $ 120 to activate a line .
" It 's light years from what I can buy , " one Cuban said of the cell phone cost .
The relaxed rules represent the first nuts - and - bolts changes since February when Raúl Castro succeeded his brother Fidel as president .
When he took the helm , Raúl Castro said reforms would be on the way .
" I have referred to an excess of prohibitions and regulations , and in the next few weeks we 'll start lifting the most simple of them , " he said .
The Cuban government also recently approved the sale of computers , microwaves and DVD players to Cubans -- items previously sold only to foreigners and companies .
Before the ban on staying in hotels was lifted , Cuban critics called the restrictions " tourist apartheid . "
In a video that made the rounds on the Internet in February , a student asked the president of Cuba 's National Assembly why Cubans could not travel freely to such resorts .
Though such public displays of discontent are rare , the video echoed sentiments voiced in private for years , particularly since the fall of the Soviet empire in 1991 .
Cuba lost billions of dollars in subsidies when its ally fell .
Cuba depends on tourism as its major source of revenue .
On average , more than 2 million tourists visit Cuba annually .
The country 's Tourism Ministry recently announced that at least 10 hotels will be built in the capital , Havana , between 2008 and 2010 .
The United States has long sought to isolate Cuba 's communist government and restricts American travel to the island nation .

The stories of twitter going down frequently do n’t need repeating here .
Instead , I want to ask the community if there is any interest in addressing the problem .
As many are aware , Twitter ’s problem with scaling is not RoR , it ’s not Joyent NTT , or … Twitter ’s scaling problem is exactly the same thing that makes it valuable : their database of users .
And getting a traditional SQL / Relational DB to scale horizontally is pretty tough .
Sharding works for some apps but not others .
It so happens that our new distributed database technology is rather well suited for twitter - style high - volume reliable messaging .
If there is sufficient community interest we could help solve downtime by putting together a “ twitter - proxy ” that keeps twitter users on twitter , but provides an additional layer of data accessibility in the ecosystem .
Not compete , just help keep users happy .
Consider the messaging problem :
Nothing is as easy as it looks .
When Robert Scoble writes a simple “ I ’m hanging out with … ” message , Twitter has about two choices of how they can dispatch that message :
PUSH the message to the queue ’s of each of his 6,864 followers , or Wait for the 6,864 followers to log in , then PULL the message .
The trouble with # 2 is that people like Robert also follow 6,800 people .
And it ’s unacceptable for him to login and then have to wait for the system to open records on 6,800 people ( across multiple db shards ) , then sort the records by date and finally render the data .
Users would be hating on the HUGE latency .
So , the twitter model is almost certainly # 1 .
Robert ’s message is copied ( or pre-fetched ) to 6,864 users , so when those users open their page / client , Scoble ’s message is right there , waiting for them .
The users are loving the speed , but Twitter is hating on the writes .
All of the writes .
How many writes ?
A 6000X multiplication factor :
Do you see a scaling problem with this scenario ?
Scoble writes something –boom – 6,800 writes are kicked off .
1 for each follower .
Michael Arrington replies –boom–another 6,600 writes .
Jason Calacanis jumps in –boom–another 6,500 writes .
Beyond the 19,900 writes , there ’s a lot of additional overhead too .
You have to hit a DB to figure out who the 19,900 followers are .
Read , read , read .
Then possibly hit another DB to find out which shard they live on .
Read , read , read .
Then you make a connection and write to that DB host , and on success , go back and mark the update as successful .
Depending on the details of their messaging system , all the overhead of lookup and accounting could be an even bigger task than the 19,900 reads + 19,900 writes .
Do you even want to think about the replication issues ( multiply by 2 or 3 ) ?
Watch out for locking , too .
And here ’s the kicker : that giant processing & delivery effort–possibly a combined 100 K disk IOs — was caused by 3 users , each just sending one , tiny , 140 char message .
How innocent it all seemed .
Now , are there any questions why twitter goes down when there ’s any kind of event ?
This is where we ( potentially ) come into the picture : we ’ve spent the last 2 years developing a web architecture built on our horizontally scalable distributed database , and this kind of [ lookup | message passing | writing ] is what it eats for breakfast .
We have n’t had any twitter - sized days , but we are seeing the architecture scale as designed .
You know how Yahoo News or Google News or NYTime or CNN shows everybody the same stories , and after you read them , the front page is boring ?
It ’s a big database problem –you have to keep track of what every user has read , and SQL falls short .
Our system is designed to scale horizontally so it can keep track of what hundreds of millions of individuals have read , and then show users the [ highest rated | most viewed | etc. ] stories that are new to them .
But since we do n’t have a deal with any news guys yet , we ’re building out the most database intensive feed reader on the planet .
It has plenty of nifty features not found in Google Reader , Bloglines , etc .
But that ’s an aside .
The Idea : twitter - proxy for the people
Addressing Twitter ’s downtime could be pretty straightforward .
It could work much like a ( psudo - reverse ) proxy :
You enter your twitter credentials on the proxy site
You can post your tweets to the proxy .
If twitter is up , we ’ll post there , too .
We ’ll get your friend list and GET and store their tweets in our db .
When twitter is up and fully functional , twitter proxy contains a mirror of all the tweets from each to the twitter - proxy registered members , and the people they follow .
When twitter is down , you can still post a tweet to twitter - proxy .
That message will immediately be available to anyone who is in our system .
( How are they in the proxy system ?
Either they registered directly , or they are being followed BY someone who registered , so we automatically grabbed their status updates . )
Ground rules :
You should be able to access this system with nothing more than your existing twitter credentials .
No separate login .
We would expose a twitter - compatible API so outside clients would “ just work ” .
( e.g. change the /etc / hosts file to resolve twitter.com to another IP )
Twitter is the new mail
Because twitter has done such a great job with their API , the net effect of a twitter - proxy is that you could could still send and receive your twitter messages , directly from twitter , or via twitter - proxy .
If your friends are sending SMS messages to twitter , they would still end up at twitter - proxy .
The win is that when twitter goes down , there is another component of the ecosystem that can be alive and healthy .
Messages sent via the twitter - proxy system would get to every user on the proxy system .
( again , either registered directly , or was followed by someone who did register . )
And twitter users stay twitter users .
No one is split off to different , competing platforms .
We do n’t have any experience with a SMS -> HTTP gateway , so if twitter is down , the only way to get messages to and from your friends via the proxy is HTTP .
That means a web page or web client .
But hey , use your iphone if you ’re out and about .
Moreover , we should be able to support fast Search , and the RSS / Atom feeds of people ’s tweets would be available in real time , too .
Built into the system could be other nice - itys such as “ how many people viewed this tweet ” and top - read tweets (+ that are new to you . )
It ’s up to your imagination .
Caveats
First of all , we wo n’t embark on any twitter - proxy system if the twitter folks are n’t cool with it .
We would need their OK , first .
Second , enough of you–twitter diehards–need to tell us you want such a system .
From where we ’re at , it should n’t take long to build it , if there ’s enough demand .
If you want it –let us know , loudly .
Thanks for reading .

" Many of the classics do n't hold up all that well , now that we have become more aware of some of the problematic attitudes they presented .
Is it still possible to still appreciate these classics from a modern viewpoint ? "
Writers Workshop : 9 AM- noon Sunday , November 13 IFIC Suite ( private ) Gateway on the Way to Television
In a column marked EXCLUSIVE in Deadline Hollywood for Monday , 10 March 2014 , Nellie Andreeva broke the story that the rights to Frederik Pohl 's Gateway had been obtained by Entertainment One Television , in conjunction with the De Laurentiis Company .
" The project will be executive produced by De Laurentiis Co. ’s Martha De Laurentiis and Lorenzo De Maio along with eOne ’s John Morayniss , CEO eOne TV ; Michael Rosenberg , EVP U.S. Scripted TV ; and Benedict Carver , SVP Filmed Entertainment . "
For fuller coverage , go to the links below , and for developing details , watch this space .
Andreeva on GATEWAY Denise Petski , " Alien Drama ‘ Gateway ’ In Works At Syfy " Frederik Pohl Biography Frederik Pohl has been about everything that it is possible to be in the field of science fiction , from consecrated fan and struggling poet to critic , literary agent , teacher , book and magazine editor and , above all , writer .
Called by Kingsley Amis ( in Amis 's critical study of science fiction , New Maps of Hell ) " the most consistently able writer science fiction , in its modern form , has yet produced , " Frederik Pohl is clearly in the very first rank of writers in the field .
He has won most of the awards the science - fiction field has to offer , including the Edward E. Smith and Donald A. Wollheim memorial awards , the International John W. Campbell award ( twice ) , the French Prix Apollo , the Yugoslavian Vizija , the Nebula ( three times , including the " Grand Master " Nebula for lifetime contributions to the field ) and the Hugo ( six times , he is the only person ever to have won the Hugo both as writer and as editor ) , as well as such awards from sources outside the science - fiction community as the American Book Award , the annual award of the Popular Culture Association , and the United Nations Society of Writers Award .
Other honors include election as a Fellow to both the British Interplanetary Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Apart from the field of science fiction , he is a noted lecturer and teacher in the area of future studies , and is the author of , among other non-fiction works , Practical Politics , a how - to - do - it manual of the American political process ; Our Angry Earth , on the world 's environmental problems , written in collaboration with the late Isaac Asimov , which Sir Arthur C. Clarke calls " perhaps the most important book either of its authors has produced " ; and , most recently , Chasing Science , on the uses of science as a spectator sport .
He is also the Encyclopedia Britannica 's authority on the First Century A.D. Roman emperor , Tiberius .
Many of Frederik Pohl 's works have been adapted for radio , television , or film , beginning with the two - part Columbia Workshop of the Air version of the classic The Space Merchants in 1953 .
In Europe , a number of his stories have been televised by the BBC and his famous novella , " The Midas Plague , " became a three - hour special on German television .
The 1981 NBC two - hour television film , The Clonemaster , was based on an original concept of his ; his award - winning novel , Gateway , has been dramatized for live theatrical production ; his novelette , " The Tunnel under the World , " became a feature film in Italy ; and his novels , Man Plus and Gateway , are currently in development in America as feature films .
( Gateway was also made into a computer game under the title of " Frederik Pohl 's Gateway " by Legend Entertainment ; a second game , " Gateway II : The Home World , " was released a year later . )
Among his most recent novels are The World at the End of Time , Outnumbering the Dead , Stopping at Slowyear , The Voices of Heaven , O Pioneer , and The Siege of Eternity .
He has traveled widely , sometimes to lecture on behalf of the United States State Department ( in places as widely separated as Singapore , New Zealand and most of the countries of both Eastern and Western Europe ) or to attend international conferences on science or science fiction in places like the Republic of South Korea , Canada , the People 's Republic of China , Australia , Brazil , the former Soviet Union , the former Yugoslavia , and most of Western Europe .
He is a past president of both World SF and the Science Fiction Writers of America and is currently Midwest Area Representative to the Authors Guild , having served for nine years as a member of the Guild Council before moving to the midwest .
He currently makes his home in Palatine , Illinois , with his wife , Dr. Elizabeth Anne Hull , who is a past president of the Science Fiction Research Association and a noted scholar in the field .

Human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have slammed the European Union 's stance over Tibet , calling the reaction " tepid " and demanding much more robust pressure on China from the 27 - nation European bloc .
" Once again , this is a test for the European Union , which needs to decide whether it 's going to be a serious player or just sit on the sidelines , " Human Rights Watch 's Asia director , Brad Adams , told the EUobserver .
" The EU 's reaction has been tepid and needs to be much stronger , " he said , criticising the statements from both the European Council and European Commission calling for restraint from both protesters and the Chinese authorities .
" While there has been violence on both sides , the ultimate responsibility lies with China .
They 've created the conditions for the unrest . "
" You can see the difference between how they are dealing with China and how they dealt with Burma , when there was a similar crackdown , " he said , referring to the autumn 2007 assault by the Burmese military junta on high - profile dissidents and Buddhist monks in which thousands of protesters were rounded up and unknown numbers killed .
At the time , the EU banned imports of gemstones , timber and metal from the country .
" The EU should n't just take strong action in response to human rights violations of small states , but also strong states , like China , " said Mr Adams .
Meanwhile , Amnesty International echoed their fellow human rights campaigners .
" We 've seen a very weak statement from the council , " said Susi Dennison , the group 's external relations officer at its Brussels office , in an interview with the EUobserver .
" And the EU presidency statement called on China to respect international democratic principles , but China actually needs to go further and adhere to its international legal obligations , such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture . "
" The EU needs to be pushing for the Chinese government to account for detained citizens in particular , and in the run-up to the Olympics , while the world is watching , they need at a minimum to press China to live up to the human rights commitments that it made ahead of winning the games . "
" Specifically , Amnesty is calling on the EU to push for China to allow an independent investigation , letting in international observers . "
Mirroring Amnesty 's demands , the Human Rights Watch official said : " We 've called for China to let in the UN to conduct an independent probe into alleged abuses , and we'd like the EU to echo that call . "
European Parliament president opens door to boycott
There have been stronger statements coming out of some member states , such as France and Italy , said Ms Dennison .
Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said that the EU should put forward a common denunciation of the events in Tibet .
" What is happening is deeply worrying , and there are no doubts that what we have said so far will be reiterated more vigorously . "
Meanwhile , the country 's foreign ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador to Rome for talks on the unrest .
French Socialist leader Francois Hollande said Monday ( 17 March ) that his country should consider boycotting the games , while France 's foreign minister said he was considering boycotting the opening ceremonies .
But the EU collectively has been ineffective , said Ms Dennison , while other member states have hidden behind the EU statements .
" When the EU speaks with one voice , it is at its most powerful .
Unfortunately , this is similar to our criticisms we had of the EU over Darfur .
" The EU has the ability to speak with one voice , but too often , it does n't use it . "
Hans -Gert Poettering , the centre - right president of the European Parliament , who , speaking on German public radio on Tuesday ( 18 March ) , said that politicians should reconsider attending the opening of the Beijing Olympic games if the attacks from Chinese authorities continue .
" One has to say to the Chinese : if the repression continues like this , it will cause political leaders who plan to attend the opening of the Olympic Games , as I plan to , to consider whether such a trip is a responsible move , " President Poettering told Deutschlandfunk radio .
He also said he did not rule out a wider boycott of the games .
" We must send a signal to Beijing , " he added .
Mr Poettering 's words are a departure from the president 's initial comments on the topic , who the day before had repeated the other European institutions ' call for both sides to show restraint , adding that he hoped that the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing would be a success .
Christina Gallach , spokesperson for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana , responding to the complaints from human rights groups about double standards regarding Burma and China , said : " The relations between the EU and China are totally different from those between the EU and Burma . "
" The EU has bilateral agreements with China and various human rights dialogues with the country .
Our relationship with China goes back 30 years . "
" Whereas we have expanded sanctions on the Burmese junta .
There is no comparison with Burma . "
She also said that it is not foreseen that the EU will have a special envoy for Tibet , as they do with Burma , a key demand of Tibetan protesters .
' Classic Chinese lock - down on information '
Meanwhile , European and International journalists ' associations are calling on the EU to beef up its language around freedom of the media in Tibet .
International and Hong Kong journalists have been banned from the region , while foreign television news reports have been blacked out in China , along with access to stories and video about Tibet on the internet .
" The EU should immediately press the Chinese authorities to open the door to scrutiny by the international media , " said Aidan White , general - secretary of the International Federation of Journalists .
" What we 're witnessing is a classic Chinese lock - down on information , a cordon sanitaire to stop journalists reporting and the world from knowing what 's going on . "
France - based Reporters Sans Frontieres on Tuesday urged political officials to boycott the 8 August Olympic opening ceremony .
" China has not kept any of the promises it made in 2001 when it was chosen to host these Olympics , " the press freedom organisation said .
" Instead , the government is crushing the Tibetan protests and is imposing a news blackout . "
The Peoples ' Republic of China say that demonstrators have killed 13 civilians in protests in recent days , while exiled Tibetan leaders in India say some 100 people may have been killed by the Chinese authorities .
In - vitro fertilization may soon become much more effective , if a new device dubbed the " silicone womb " comes out of testing successfully .
Currently test - tube embryos are developed in an incubator , but the .2 - inch long silicone womb , produced by Anecova , allows them to be implanted inside the mother for up to four days , during which time they 're exposed to the uterus through 360 40 - micron holes .
The goal is to develop stronger , more resilient embryos for eventual pregnancy , but a small test in Belgium has so far proven inconclusive as to the device 's effectiveness -- and some researchers doubt it 'll work at all , since the embryos will be located in the uterus rather than the fallopian tubes where they would naturally develop .
Still , there 's hope that the environment inside the uterus will be an effective substitute -- to quote one researcher , " it 's a lot closer to a fallopian tube than a plastic tray . " 40 women are signed up for testing starting today , but results are n't expected for some time .

Chinese troops and police have been deployed at important monasteries in Tibet to quell the biggest protests by Tibetan Buddhist monks in the Himalayan region for nearly 20 years .
Witnesses have reported trucks full of troops surrounding Drepung monastery in Lhasa , while Sera monastery was ringed by hundreds of police .
These two sites have strong symbolic significance , as they were the training grounds for the monks who led Tibet before the People 's Liberation Army came in 1950 and ousted the Dalai Lama .

Protests began on Monday as monks marked the 49th anniversary of the failed uprising against Chinese rule that culminated in the Dalai Lama 's exile .
The protests are the biggest since the late 1980s , when riots led to martial law .
Back then , China 's current President , Hu Jintao , was the Communist Party chief in Tibet .
Signs of defiance in Tibet come just five months before the Olympic Games in Beijing , when the eyes of the world will be on China .
Tibetan activists are expected to use the extra attention to highlight their cause .
Chinese officials in Beijing confirmed protests had taken place , but said the situation had stabilised .
They accused the Dalai Lama of provoking separatist activities .
" In recent days , a few monks in Lhasa city have made some disturbances .
This is a political scheme by the Dalai group , attempting to separate China and try to make some unrest in the normal harmonious , peaceful life of Tibetan people , " a Foreign Ministry spokesman , Qin Gang , told a briefing , adding that further protests would " not take place " because of China 's determination to safeguard its national interest .
So far as Beijing is concerned , Tibet is part of its inviolable territory and always has been .
Beijing stresses the role it has played in bringing economic well - being .
This week , protests have rippled across the mountainous enclave .
More than 300 monks from Drepung marched on Monday , while a smaller group from Sera also protested .
A number of arrests were made .
Radio Free Asia reported that police used tear gas to disperse 500 to 600 monks from Sera monastery who were marching to demand the release of imprisoned fellow monks .
The Free Tibet Campaign also said its contacts had spoken to Tibetans who reported demonstrations by 400 monks in Lutsang monastery in Qinghai province , an area Tibetans call Amdo , as well as at the Myera monastery in Gansu .
" The reports of protests outside Lhasa show Tibetans know the eyes of the world are upon them and are determined not to let the momentum drop .
Tibetans inside Tibet are aware that Tibetans in India are marching towards the Tibet border and have been emboldened by the support they are receiving from across the world , " said Matt Whitticase of the Free Tibet Campaign .
More than 100 Tibetan exiles were dragged away by police in northern India yesterday , and promptly began a hunger strike after being charged with threatening the " peace and tranquillity " of the region .
Clutching Tibetan flags and pictures of Gandhi and the Dalai Lama , they had planned to march from India to Tibet to coincide with the start of the Olympics .
Their first setback came at the beginning of the week , when Indian officials barred them from leaving the outskirts of Dharmasala , the headquarters of the Tibetan government - in - exile .
Yesterday they had marched about 12 miles beyond the boundary when Indian police stopped them in their tracks .
Bomb threat , ballot troubles as Ohio votes
An elections official in Ohio predicted the state would " shine " in tabulating results for Tuesday 's primary elections , despite the state 's history of voting problems .
However , there had been scattered reports of confusion and delay by early afternoon .
One of the most dramatic problems Tuesday had nothing to do with ballot designs or electronic voting machines .
A polling place at a northeast Ohio school closed for 90 minutes because of a bomb threat .
The threat was called in around 9:30 a.m. , and about 14 voters were turned away while a bomb - sniffing dog searched the school , according to the Associated Press .
All 14 voters said they would return to the polling place later Tuesday .
No bomb was found and the school re-opened around 11 a.m .
Cleveland - area voters were told Tuesday morning to remove a tab on their ballots that specifically says " Do not remove at some polling locations .
Cuyahoga County elections chief Jane Platten said there was no reason for concern , reports the Cleveland Plain Dealer 's John Caniglia :
Platten said a tab on ballots that 's used for accounting purposes became a minor issue .
She said some of the tabs were removed by accident .
Voters who lost the tabs should not worry .
Their votes will count .
At least one voter was confused by the ballot design Tuesday and says he accidentally voted Dennis Kucinich for President .
Romano asked how to correct his ballot and he was told to drop it into the box , which he did before requesting a new ballot .
" They told me I could n't get another ballot because I had already put one in the box , " he told the PD's Donna J. Miller .
" I 've voted for 50 years .
This was the worst ballot I 've seen . "
In southwest Ohio , the Dayton Daily News was collecting voters ' tales from the voting booths on Tuesday .
Most voters reported a pleasant experience , although some trouble persisted .
" About 40 - 50 people in line and 1 of the voting machine were down , " one commenter wrote .
" Waited to 7:00 AM and the line didnt move 3 more machine went down , now 4 0 f the 8 machine not working .
The poll worker didnt offer paper ballot and seemed overhelmed by the process .
Let get rid of these Diebold machines and get something that works !
I will be back tonite to vote , hope the machines are working by then . "
" The district I am in had a line the full length of the gymnasium and there were 4 voting machines down that had been report[ed ] 1 1/2 before but no one had been there to look at [ them ] , " said a commenter from Beavercreek , Ohio .
" I talked to several people in line , and everyone seemed to be enthusiastic . "
Our house was built in the deer 's natural habitat in a remote rural area .
Well worn deer trails cut through the property 's abundant pine and sage .
The oldest deer we 've met ( we call her Mama Rose ) walked right up to us when we first arrived , sniffing and looking us over .
Rose smelled some almonds in my pocket so I gave her a few .
We gave some almonds to her family a few other times but stopped the practice when advised that feeding deer is illegal .
Even so , that did n't stop them from regular visits .
Rose and her kin obviously think the yard belongs to them as much as anyone else , and they are just taking advantage of the wealth of natural foods growing everywhere .
They especially like clover flowers , but it 's amazing to see the variety of tasty flowers , leaves , twigs , nuts and berries they 'll eat .
They stay away from herbs and herbal flowers , but on occasion we 've seen young deer eating the sweet medicinal berries of the Juniper tree .

Food is of course a major concern , but we also think they visit because they like our company .
Often we see deer we do n't know nibbling in the yard , but nearly everyday some or many of Rose 's extended family come by .
All of the deer are likely to lay down on the grass and hang out , whether we know them well or not .
Many of them know us personally , and while often running into the yard to greet us with their quiet enthusiasm , they will also swiftly shy away from strangers .
Although notoriously skittish , able to leap meters in the air in an instant when startled , a few deer we know , most notably Eva and her kids , will let us touch them as if we were family , letting us scratch them or pick something out of their fur .
Eva even enjoys a hearty backrub !
We 've certainly learned a lot about how to act around them so as not to disturb them .
We think they appreciate our efforts in fitting into their neighborhood .

Please read the text at the top of this page as well as on the " commentary and e-mails " page for discussions of this and other related topics .
An Advisory : Our situation with the deer in our yard appears to be somewhat unusual .
We take extreme care in how we interact with an extended deer family we 've known for many years .
Please be warned !
Deer are majestic and large wild animals that appear docile but can instantly summon tremendous reflexes of strength when they sense a threat .
Please use all caution and respect .
Also , deer are known to host blacklegged ticks which in some parts of North America carry the bacterium that produces lyme disease .

A worker at GreenTeam 's recycling center on Charles Street found an entirely different type of green while sorting through refuse Friday , police said - a garbage bag with 5 pounds of marijuana .
状態遷移マシンは、計算機構のモデルとして有名なものだし重要ですよね。僕が「ホッピングボール・マシン」と名付けた（適切な名前が見あたらなかったので）モデルは、とても単純な状態遷移マシンです。これ以上の単純化は難しいというくらい単純です。
この単純なモデルであるホッピングボール・マシンは、プログラム意味論はもとより、圏論、論理、グラフ理論などの立場からも興味深い素材で、この素材を使って次のようなことを説明できます。

僕が 「面白いなー」と思っていることはだいたい、ホッピングボール・マシンを例題として解説できそうです。以前から、ホッピングボール・マシンとその周辺について書きたいとは思っていたのです。でも、なかなか書き出せないでいました。
ホッピングボール・マシン自体は単純なんですが、背後に非常に豊かな構造があるので、関連する分野は多岐に渡ります。長い解説を書く気力はないし、ブログ記事の続き物にするにしても息切れしそう。
でもまー、息切れするのはいつものことだし、思い出してまた続きを書いたりすることもあるので、あまり気張らないで書き始めることにします。続き物のスタイルにはしませんが、エントリータイトルに「ホッピングボール：」を含めたら、この話題の記事です。

ホッピングボール・マシンとは何か ホッピングボール・マシンの内部構造 ホッピングボール・マシンの例 ゆるゆると続く
ホッピングボール・マシ ン （hopping ball machine ）とは、下の図のような箱です。
手前にいくつかの（例では3つの）穴が空いてます。ここからボールを入れます。入れたボールは何秒後かに向こうにある穴（例では2つ）のどれかから出てきます。入り口となる穴にも出口となる穴にも、それぞれ「1 , 2 , ...」と番号が振ってあります。また、ボールを入れてから出てくるまでの時間はキッチリ秒単位で計れるものとします。したがって、次のような言明は（正しいか間違っているかはともかくも）意味を持ちます。
1番の入り口穴から入れたボールは、4秒後に1番の出口穴から出てきた。
2番の入り口穴から入れたボールは、5秒後に2番の出口穴から出てきた。
3番の入り口穴から入れたボールは、1秒後に1番の出口穴から出てきた。
このような言明は今後頻繁に出てくるので、次のような略記をします。
1 -( 4秒 ) → 1
2 -( 5 秒 ) → 2
3 -( 1秒 ) → 1
特別なケースとして、入れたボールがすぐさま出口の穴から飛び出すことがあります。このときは次のように書きます。
1 -(0秒 ) → 2
0秒後に出てくるとはつまり、「入れたらすぐに出てくる」ということです。今まで例に挙げた「1 - ( 4秒 ) → 1 」 、「 2 - ( 5 秒 ) → 2 」 、「 3 - ( 1 秒 ) → 1 」 、「 1 - (0 秒 ) → 2」などを、ホッピングボール・マシンに関する観測命題と呼びます。
とある入り口穴にボールを入れて、それがどの出口穴から何秒後に出てくるかを観測することを試行と呼びましょう。1回の試行の結果は、1つの観測命題で述べられます。ただし、有限時間でボールが出てくることは保証していません。いつまでたっても出てこないことがあります。
ホッピングボール・マシンの動作は非決定的です。つまり、同じ入り口穴にボールをいれても試行のたびに結果が違うかもしれません。例えば、最初の試行で「 2 -( 6 秒 ) → 2」だったのに、2回目の試行では「 2 -( 2秒 ) → 1 」、3回目の試行で は 「 2 -( 3 秒 ) → 2」となるかもしれません。
ホッピングボール・マシンを外から見れば、完全なブラックボックスです。ホッピングボール・マシンに対して出来る操作は、入り口の穴にボールを入れることだけです。そして、出口の穴から出てくるボールを確認して「 2 -( 4秒 ) → 1」のような観測命題を述べるのです。
でも、いざとなったらホッピングボール・マシンの箱を開けて中を覗いてもかまいません。ホッピングボール・マシンの動作は非決定的でも、中の仕掛けは決まっています。ノードと呼ばれる場所と、ノードとノードを結ぶ辺と呼ばれる矢印から構成されています。これを図示すると有向グラフとしてよく知られた図形になります。下の図は、ホッピングボール・マシンの構造を図示した例です。黒丸が内部のノード、実線の矢印は辺、白丸は穴で、点線により穴とノードの結びつきを示しています。
入り口の穴からホッピングボール・マシンの内部に入ったボールは、まずどれかのノードに落ちます。ボールは辺をたどって、1秒後には別なノードに移動します。この動作を何度か繰り返すことになります。ノードのうちのいくつかは出口の穴とつながっていて、そのようなノードに到着したら、ボールはジャンプして出口から出てもかまいません。次の点に注意してください。
ボールが入り口からノードに落ちるときと、ノードから出口にジャンプするときには時間がかからない。
辺でつながれていないノード間では、ボールは移動できない。
とあるノードから同じノードに戻る辺（ループ）があってもよい。
ノード間のボールの移動には常にキッカリ1秒かかる。これは、図に描いた辺の長さとは無関係、ループを回るときも1秒。
ノードが出口の穴とつながっていても、ボールが他のノード（または、ループ経由で同じノード）に移動できるなら出なくてもよい。
移動または出口へのジャンプのどちらかができるなら、必ずしなくてはならない。
移動も出口へのジャンプもできないなら、そのボールは永久に同じノードに留まる。
出入り口の穴とノードとの結びつき（点線で表示）は1対1である必要はない。
ノードから出る辺は1本とは限らないので、ボールの移動に非決定性が現れます。同じ入り口からボールを入れても、どのような経路を通ったかによって、出口と所要時間に差が出るのです。
入り口も出口も1つの例です。
このホッピングボール・マシンでは、1番入り口から入れたボールは瞬時に1番出口に出ます。観測命題「1 - ( 0 秒 ) → 1」がいつでも成立します。「 1 -( 0 ) → 1 」以外は起きません。
次も、入り口／出口 が1つずつ。
内部にループを持っているので、ループを回る回数により、出てくるまでの所要時間が変わります。「1 - ( 0 秒 ) → 1 」 、「 1 - ( 1 秒 ) → 1 」 、「 1 - ( 2 秒 ) → 1 」 、「 1 -( 3 秒 ) → 1」など、すべての可能性があります。
入り口 が1つ、出口が2つです。
「 1 - (0 秒 ) → 1 」 また は 「 1 -(0秒 ) →2」のどちらかが必ず起きます。それ以外の可能性はありません。
入り口が2つ、出口も2つです。
このホッピングボール・マシンでは、 「 1 - ( 0 秒 ) → 2 」 と「 2 -(0秒 ) →1」が必ず起きます。入り口が1番なら、必ず2番出口からボールが出てきて、入り口が2番なら、必ず1番出口からボールが出てきます。
これも、入り口が2つ、出口も2つ。
任意のn（n = 0 , 1 , 2 , ...）に対し て 「 1 -( n秒 ) → 1 」 と「 1 -( n秒 ) → 2」が起こりえます。しかし、2番入り口から入れたボールは永久に出てきません。
●ゆるゆると続 く
これで、主題であるホッピングボール・マシンがどんなものかは説明しました。細部まで完全には記述してないのですが、だいたいのイメージを作るには十分でしょう。たったこれだけの仕掛けなのに、ほんとに驚くくらいに豊富な構造を持ち、多様な現象を生成します。
まー、ぼちぼち、ゆるゆると説明していきます。
Then the Americans arrived .
We had already glimpsed them in imported sitcoms : vast , cavernous hangars of fridges with wide - spaced , well - lit shelves , groaning with Budweiser , leftover Chinese food in bucket - shaped boxes and orange juice that was drunk as profligately as squash .
Over - stuffed and then , all at once , over here .
Demand rose and manufacturers such as Samsung and Maytag lunged at the opportunity , introducing new " American - style " fridges .
That word " style " is important .
Consumer research showed we wanted fridges that were taller than us - but our kitchens , units and even doors could n't cope with the size of imported models so slightly smaller versions were made for the UK market .
According to market research group , Mintel , sales of " larder " fridges - tall , with no icebox - or the even more bloated " side - by - side " type with adjacent freezer wing , have entirely outstripped sales of under - the - counter models .
A fact borne out by the presence of an entire section dedicated to " American - style " fridges on the John Lewis website .
Researchers attribute this trend to both fashion - fitted kitchens are no longer in vogue - and the amount of cumbersomely boxed chilled meals we consume .
And now the government waste reduction body , the Waste & Resources Action Programme ( Wrap ) , is recommending we store all fresh produce in the fridge so it keeps longer , because UK consumers throw away a staggering 4.4 m apples a day , and fruit and veg accounts for 40 % of all food waste .
But is the recommended fridge temperature of below 5C necessarily best for keeping all food appetisingly fresh ?
Do we really need to store enough perishable goods to fill an American - style fridge at such a low temperature ?
A domestic fridge dries food out , hermetically seals smells and flavours together and - even though today 's fridge is , on average , twice as fuel efficient as one bought 10 years ago - consumes significant amounts of energy .
I talked to a wide range of culinary and food hygiene experts to find out what we should and should n't be keeping in our fridges .
Cheese : According to conventional culinary wisdom , good cheese is a living thing that needs to breathe good air , maybe sweat a little .
People have been hanged , drawn and quartered at north London dinner parties for serving cheeses that have been cruelly incarcerated in the fridge .
In fact , according to cheese guru Patricia Michelson , owner of north London 's La Fromagerie , although cheese should be served at room temperature , it can be refrigerated if allowed to breathe under cover of a damp cloth .
But be careful : its flavour can be tainted by that of other foods and , of course , some of the stronger cheeses will return the favour - camembert trifle anyone ?
Butter : The Brits favour uncultured butter , which becomes rancid very quickly if not refrigerated .
Unfortunately , refrigeration also gives butter the spreading qualities of a housebrick .
Domestic arguments over keeping butter either fresh or soft are certainly to blame for the popularity of " spreadable " butters - made tractable with vegetable oil or air bubbles .
More civilised nations prefer cultured butters made from soured milk , which have a delicious , rich flavour , often with elements of fresh grass or caramel .
They also keep well at low room temperatures .
Sadly , this is impossible to get in the UK , though a good , salted , raw milk butter will last longer than most .
Eggs :
One of the triumphs of supermarket logistics is that most eggs now take around two days to get from the chicken to your basket , which means that we get fresher eggs than ever before .
A fresh , free - range egg should last beautifully at room temperature for at least a week but , with the ever - present risk of salmonella , all authorities now recommend keeping them refrigerated .
Those racks in the fridge door are the worst place to store eggs - the constant shaking thins the whites , and the smells and flavours of other foods can penetrate the shell .
Make sure you buy fresh eggs as you need them , keep them in an airtight container on a shelf in the fridge and eat within a week .
Refrigeration can make eggs last for ages without " going off " so many people buy them in bulk and end up eating perfectly safe but horribly stale eggs weeks later .
Meat :
Although meat needs to be at room temperature before cooking , it should always be refrigerated if it is not going to be cooked as soon as you get it home .
And store it on the bottom shelf so no juices can drip on to other food .
Fruit : Fruit from temperate climates , apples for example , can be refrigerated but fruit from warmer countries can only be stored successfully at around 10C , so a domestic fridge can wreak all sorts of havoc .
Bananas go black ( though they remain edible ) ; avocados go dark but stop softening and end up being the colour and texture of a hand grenade .
Melons develop black spots .
Tomatoes will respond to the fridge with an exhausted sigh and almost immediately become mealy and unappetising .
All fruit can be stored in a fruit bowl or basket on the counter - but be sure to store the bananas away from other produce .
They release ethylene , which can cause other fruit around them to overripe .
Vegetables : Like fruit , veg from warm climates gain nothing from chilling .
Marrows , courgettes , peppers , cucumbers and beans all become mushy or blackened much faster in a domestic fridge and all should be kept out in the bowl with the fruit .
If , for some reason , your home lacks a root cellar ( which most households relied upon for cool storage in the pre-fridge era ) , mushrooms and root veg - potatoes , parsnips and carrots etc - should be kept at room temperature and protected from light in a paper or cloth sack .
Putting potatoes in the fridge can increase the amount of sugar they contain , which could lead to higher levels of a carcinogenic chemical called acrylamide when the potatoes are baked , fried or roasted at high temperatures .
Leftovers : Leftover tinned food can be kept in the fridge for a short while but must be transferred to a clean , airtight container .
Exposure to the air means that the food can become contaminated through contact with the material in the can 's lining if it is not removed .
This applies just as much to the cat 's lunch as to your baked beans .
Miscellaneous :
Honey , cooking oils , peanut butter and tahini will congeal in the fridge .
Bread , cake and other baked products will lose moisture and take on a rubbery texture rather than going hard and stale .
Chocolate develops an unsightly sugar bloom - that white film is a result of condensation , which makes the sugar dissolve and recrystalise .
Ultimately , bear in mind that a fridge inhibits the action of enzymes and bacteria that make food go bad .
Unfortunately , some of the most luxurious foods rely for flavour on the very enzymatic and bacterial processes that the chilling prevents .
One person's " going off " is another 's " ripening " .
The fridge enables us to keep food longer but should n't stop us buying fresh , rotating stock and using things while they are still at their best .
One of the few advantages of supermarkets is that they can get food to us quickly - if we then stick it in a home morgue and wait days to eat it we lose even that benefit .

The liberal blogs and MoveOn.org are apoplectic that Barack Obama went on Fox News this weekend .
Obama had refused for 771 days to go on the right - wing news outlet after they lied about his past , so to his crowd of supporters his recent agreement to go on “ Fox News Sunday ” spelled betrayal .
But with the Democratic nomination effectively over , Obama needs to start courting general election voters – many of whom , like it or not , rely on Fox for their political news .
It would have been hypocritical for a candidate who wants to unite “ red and blue states ” to continue boycotting how red - state voters get their news .
And appearing on Fox News to court general election voters was far less offensive than changing how you vote in the Senate – which is what Hillary Clinton did to pick up “ swing voters . ”
Going on Fox News is like walking into a lion ’s den – and allowing them to set the terms of debate is a recipe for disaster .
But before we point out how uninformed Fox News viewers are about whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , bear in mind that only 52 % call themselves “ conservative . ”
And while 88 % of them supported George Bush in 2004 , when you consider that it ’s the number - one rated news cable station – even twelve percent translates into a lot of people .
While most
Fox viewers would never vote for a Democrat , a sizable chunk would and could – and that ’s an audience that the presidential nominee can’t afford to ignore .
Yesterday , blogger Chris Bowers wondered why Obama would agree to go on Fox News rather than return to the liberal blog Daily Kos – because “ there are far more Democratic primary voters to be found on Daily Kos than on Fox News . ”
Which is a fair question to ask when Obama still had to compete with Hillary Clinton to win the party ’s nomination .
But Daily Kos readers already support him over Clinton .
And because he has taken an insurmountable delegate lead that will hold up to the Convention , Obama can now afford to take on his real foe : Republican John McCain .
When Obama first refused to go on Fox News , I commended him for taking a stance that most Democrats are afraid to take .
And it certainly made sense for MoveOn and the liberal blogs to pressure the Nevada Democratic Party to drop Fox News from co-sponsoring a debate , because we knew that it would be a sham .
But that was when the target audience was Democratic primary voters .
Now the target audience has to be voters who are trying to decide between McCain and Obama .
Back in September , when Hillary Clinton was well ahead in the polls , she voted for the Kyl - Lieberman Resolution – the first step towards a preemptive War with Iran .
At the time , some supporters told the New York Times that “ she has already shifted from primary mode , when she needs to guard against critics from the left , to general election mode , when she must guard against critics from the right . ”
Because Clinton calculated that she could take the Democratic base for granted , she had already moved beyond them and started courting independent voters .
Liberals have always struggled with the dilemma of how to win elections while sticking to your principles .
The Clinton approach involves betraying your base – through a policy of triangulation – in order to “ inoculate ” from right - wing attacks .
It leaves supporters in a perpetually depressed state , but they do n’t dare vote for a Green Party candidate – for fear of being a “ spoiler ” to an eventual Republican victory .
All in all , it ’s not exactly a very empowering experience for those who fight for progressive change .
But that ’s not what Obama did by going on Fox News .
There ’s a world of a difference between changing how you vote on a substantive issue ( and thus losing your political spine ) to attract more conservative voters – versus stepping into unfriendly territory to engage those who are not naturally inclined to support you .
Obama is trying to do the reverse of what Ronald Reagan did in the 1980 ’s by securing “ Reagan Democrats . ”
By going on Fox News , he was working to secure and recruit “ Obama Republicans . ”
As Randy Shaw explained back in January , the Left does n’t appreciate Obama because they mistrust anyone who tries to build a base of support among people who do n’t think like them .
But electoral math dictates that a presidential candidate needs to win more than like - minded liberals .
There are ways to pick up conservative votes without compromising your basic principles .
Does this mean that Obama should go on Fox News regularly ?
Of course not .
It is well - documented that the TV station is a right - wing propaganda outlet that seeks to attack and delegitimize progressives – and to treat it as “ news ” is like fighting a losing battle .
But Obama had already boycotted the station for 771 days , and to keep doing so would have accomplished little .
By agreeing to go on for one interview – which I believe that he handled pretty well – Obama can put to rest the notion that he has something to hide .
If the bloggers think that Obama is “ selling out , ” focus on where he stands on substantive issues .
Because that – rather than what TV station he goes on – will matter in building a more progressive future .
EDITOR ’S NOTE :
In his spare time and outside of regular work hours , Paul Hogarth volunteered on Obama ’s field operation in San Francisco .
He also ran to be an Obama delegate to the Democratic National Convention .

Ludwig von Mises once wrote that an economist " must be conversant with mathematics , physics , biology , history , and jurisprudence , lest he confuse the tasks and the methods of the theory of human action with the tasks and the methods of any of these other branches of knowledge . "
In modern times , with the increasing popularity of computer - based interactive virtual worlds , it may soon be necessary for economists to familiarize themselves with the intricacies of virtual reality , lest they confuse the tasks and the methods of real - world economics with those that apply to virtual reality .
Some economists might dismiss virtual worlds as an application for economics , given that they do not contain any resources that are traditionally considered scarce ( lumber , steel , oil , etc. ) , but a closer inspection reveals that some virtual worlds contain real market economies complete with scarce resources , property rights , entrepreneurship , and exchange .
Furthermore , real people underlie the inhabitants of virtual worlds , so we can therefore analyze their economies using Austrian economics and the science of human action .
One virtual world that is currently popular is called Second Life .
Second Life was created by the San Francisco - based company Linden Research , Inc. and opened in 2003 .
It is an Internet - based three - dimensional virtual world where its 8 million unique residents can interact with one another .
[ 1 ]
Residents can create virtual clothing , hairdos , houses , airplanes , concert halls , video games , and endless other items by using an infinite supply of " primitives , " which are atomistic objects that can be shaped , colored , combined , and programmed to behave in a particular way .
Residents can then replicate their creations and sell the copies to one another at whatever price they set .
Second Life has attracted attention from Wired Magazine , The Economist , and other media with stories of a burgeoning economy and entrepreneurs earning their sole incomes by selling virtual goods and services .
Accordingly , real - world economists and Second Life 's residents alike could benefit from a closer look into the actual workings of its economy , and the effects of economic intervention .
Second Life 's economy could reasonably be compared to that of a small foreign country dependent on tourism .
Consumers are inhabitants of the real world who take what are essentially pleasure trips to Second Life , perhaps to meet new people at a dance club , shop for virtual clothing , attend a conference , or gamble at a casino .
Like real tourists , consumers exchange their real US dollars for Second Life 's currency , the Linden Dollar ( L$ ) , typically on a currency exchange run by Linden , called the LindeX .
They then use their L$ to purchase goods and services created by other Second Life residents , and if they have extra L$ when they 're done , they can sell their L$ for US $ on the LindeX .
Linden , essentially representing the state in Second Life 's economy , does not generally interfere with economic activity .
The Economist reports on Linden founder Philip Rosedale 's attitude toward intervention ,
" Mr. Rosedale prefers to rule Second Life with Adam Smith 's ' invisible hand ' only .
To him that means treating every resident the same , whether it happens to be Toyota or ' an 80 - year - old woman from India . '
Both will pay the same price for their [ virtual land ] ; what they do with it is up to them . "
Proponents of private property and non-intervention would certainly laud such a hands - off policy .
If Linden 's goal is to create a setting for a stable , growing economy that will provide the most satisfaction to the most residents , it must avoid the pitfalls of interventionism that plague real - world economies .
As Ludwig von Mises and others have shown , one interventionist policy creates distortions that must be fixed by other interventionist policies , which lead to problems that require further intervention , and so on , until the state controls every aspect of the economy .
Unfortunately , despite Mr. Rosedale 's free - market rhetoric , a look at Linden 's actual practices reveals that it has already started down the path of intervening in the economy .
One critical example of Linden 's intervention is that it has granted itself the ability to manipulate the single - most important commodity in any economy : money .
In the Terms of Service , the L$ is defined as " a limited license right available for purchase or free distribution at Linden Lab 's discretion , and is not redeemable for monetary value from Linden Lab . "
By defining the L$ in such a way , Linden has granted itself the power of a central bank in managing Second Life 's equivalent of a fiat currency .
Linden can create as many new L$ as it wants , whenever it wants , and spend them or give them away at its own discretion .
Also , because Linden maintains a peg of about L$ 270 =US $ 1 on the LindeX , it gives the appearance that the L$ is as good as real - world money .
Fiat currencies are subject to much criticism , particularly by Austrians .
However , they are not criticized because they cause undesirable economic distortions in and of themselves .
Rather , they are criticized because , unlike commodity monies such as gold , they can be created from nothing , so are highly susceptible to artificial expansion and manipulation .
This expansion , as the Austrian theory of the business cycle shows us , is the source of economic distortions that lead to unsustainable booms , followed by inevitable busts .
To establish whether Linden has in fact been manipulating the L$ supply and determine if Second Life is susceptible to bust , we can examine historical economic statistics published by Linden for signs of artificial growth in the L$ supply .
The graph below shows Second Life 's L$ supply since September of 2005 , as well as the two consolidated sources of month - to - month changes in the money supply .
Your eye might be drawn to the sudden acceleration in L$ growth at the end of 2006 coincident with a significant increase in LindeX sales ( where Linden is creating new L$ and selling them for US$ ) , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
Ignoring the problems with the US$ , LindeX sales represent inflows of real wealth into Second Life .
When residents purchase L$ on the LindeX using US $ that they have earned in the real world , they are foregoing consumption in the real world in order to spend or invest their newly purchased L$ in Second Life .
It is actually the small , perpetual budget deficit that reveals something quite sinister .
Unlike L$ sales on the LindeX , they do not reflect a flow of real wealth into Second Life .
Instead , they are created by Linden to represent wealth , but no economic production was involved in creating them .
These deficits occur when the weekly L$ stipends Linden pays to premium residents exceed its revenues from land rentals and other administrative services it provides to residents .
In order to fund the deficits , Linden creates new L$ and injects them into Second Life .
In the United States , the Federal Reserve 's primary mechanism for increasing the US $ supply involves purchasing debt securities issued by the US Treasury .
Linden 's process slightly differs in that it creates exactly as many L$ as are needed to make up for its budgetary shortfalls without ever issuing any debt .
Every time Linden runs a deficit , the L$ supply instantly increases by an equivalent amount .
Linden 's monthly budget deficit might appear insignificant in the graph , but in fact Linden has been increasing the money supply by an average of 6 % per month this way .
Annualized , it is more than doubling it each year .
During the past year and a half , Linden created L$ 876 million through its deficits , which makes up over 33 % of today 's L$ supply .
These figures certainly suggest that Linden has been artificially expanding the L$ supply , but there is one possible argument that would indicate otherwise .
Premium members who receive weekly L$ stipends pay Linden US$ 9.95 per month for that privilege .
One could argue that this US$ 9.95 represents an inflow of real wealth into Second Life to make up for the L$ created through deficits , but this argument is tenuous .
These US $ revenues are presumably used by Linden to pay its employees , maintain its servers , and pay other operating and financing costs , with the remaining profit or loss passed on to its shareholders .
Unfortunately , as the graph below shows , there have been months when Linden 's US $ revenues would not have been enough to cover the new L$ creations .
In September of 2005 , Linden collected as much as US $ 98,000 [ 2 ] from premium members , which is equivalent to about L$ 26 million at the L$ 's current exchange rate .
But during that month , it created L$ 36 million in order to fund its fiscal deficit .
That means that even if Linden had not allocated a single US $ to its employees or incurred any real - world costs whatsoever , it still would not have collected enough US $ to match its newly created L$ .
Given the strong evidence that Linden has unnaturally inflated the L$ supply , Austrian economics tells us that there are a couple of potential outcomes that are likely to occur .
In the first , Linden will stop running significant deficits at some point .
With less L$ available to spend , residents will demand fewer goods and services , leading to lower prices and reduced profits .
Previously profitable enterprises will go out of business and the wealth of many residents will decrease , slowing overall economic activity .
The other possibility is that Linden will continue running deficits to the point that a sufficient number of residents and speculators will recognize the L $ 's frailty .
In what Ludwig von Mises referred to as a " crack - up boom , " everyone will scramble to redeem his L$ for " real goods , " which , in the case of Second Life , is probably the US $ .
As more and more people sell their L$ on the LindeX , Linden might choose to maintain its L$ 270=US $ 1 peg for some amount of time , but operating under the assumption that it has not maintained 100 % US $ reserves , it will eventually run out of US $ or decide to stop selling them , and the L$ will depreciate rapidly .
In either outcome , residents will discover that they possess less wealth than they perceived they had during the time leading up to the crash .
To summarize , it appears very likely that Second Life will experience at least some form of economic recession .
Depending on its severity , it might result in Linden 's losing many of its customers .
If Linden wants to prevent this from happening and foster a stable , growing economy within Second Life , it should apply the lessons of Austrian economics to its policies : abolish restrictions on content , strengthen the ability of residents to enforce their property rights , and , most important , tie the L$ to a real - world commodity money backed by 100 % reserves .

Assuming that all 9,826 premium members paid US $ 9.95 per month , Linden would have collected US $ 98,000 .
Premium members who pay quarterly or annually have a cost of US $ 7.50 or US$ 6.00 per month , which would result in lower US $ revenues to Linden .

Welcome !
There is probably nothing more satisfying than being able to think about life 's great questions without the restrictions created by religion and other superstitions .
If someone inquires about your views , you have an answer .
If you do n't have an answer and are at fault , you can easily adjust your personal philosophy to better fit with reality .
There are no imaginary chains .
Religiously minded people will often ask how someone can be happy without a belief in a god .
Any atheist reading this can relate to how confusing that question can be .
In our minds not believing in a god is like not believing in Santa .
Thoughts of Santa filled many of our childhood minds with joy but we were only sad for few moments when we realized or found out Santa is not real .
Religious views of god is just Santa for adults .
Thoughts of god make many people happy , but that does n't mean they would be forever sad if they found out god is imaginary .
We also find the question confusing because belief in god does n't make everyone happy .
It seems that for quite a few that belief just gives them a reason to carry on a life they do n't like in hopes that when it is all over they 'll be rewarded in another life .
That 's actually a very sad existence if you think about it ... this life is not about this life but is about the next .
" But the happiness of an atheist is neither the vacuous enjoyment of a fool , nor the short - lived pleasure of a rogue .
It is rather the expression of a disposition that has ceased to torture itself with foolish fancies , or perplex itself with useless beliefs . "
- Chapman Cohen
" When I finally came out of the closet and allowed myself the freedom of being an atheist , it was like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis .
I could read anything I wanted .
Ask any questions I wanted .
Challenge anything that did n't make sense to me .
And after being the equivalent of a worker ant for so long , this was heady stuff indeed !
I am still exhilarated by it .
A chained intellect , as demanded by religion , is a pitiful thing .
A free intellect is a thing to be treasured . "
- Judith Hayes
While many things cause joy for individuals , if there is anything specific to free thought that makes people happy it is what was described in the above quotes .
The complete freedom to simply be the person you want to be without worrying about conforming to pre-packaged views is a lasting happiness .

CAYMAN ISLANDS - Kellogg Brown & Root , the nation 's top Iraq war contractor and until last year a subsidiary of Halliburton Corp. , has avoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring workers through shell companies based in this tropical tax haven .
More than 21,000 people working for KBR in Iraq - including about 10,500 Americans - are listed as employees of two companies that exist in a computer file on the fourth floor of a building on a palm - studded boulevard here in the Caribbean .
Neither company has an office or phone number in the Cayman Islands .
The Defense Department has known since at least 2004 that KBR was avoiding taxes by declaring its American workers as employees of Cayman Islands shell companies , and officials said the move allowed KBR to perform the work more cheaply , saving Defense dollars .
But the use of the loophole results in a significantly greater loss of revenue to the government as a whole , particularly to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds .
And the creation of shell companies in places such as the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes has long been attacked by members of Congress .
A Globe survey found that the practice is unusual enough that only one other ma jor contractor in Iraq said it does something similar .
" Failing to contribute to Social Security and Medicare thousands of times over is n't shielding the taxpayers they claim to protect , it 's costing our citizens in the name of short - term corporate greed , " said Senator John F. Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee who has introduced legislation to close loopholes for companies registering overseas .
With an estimated $ 16 billion in contracts , KBR is by far the largest contractor in Iraq , with eight times the work of its nearest competitor .
The no-bid contract it received in 2002 to rebuild Iraq 's oil infrastructure and a multibillion - dollar contract to provide support services to troops have long drawn scrutiny because Vice President Dick Cheney was Halliburton 's chief executive from 1995 until he joined the Republican ticket with President Bush in 2000 .
The largest of the Cayman Islands shell companies - called Service Employees International Inc. , which is now listed as having more than 20,000 workers in Iraq , according to KBR - was created two years before Cheney became Halliburton 's chief executive .
But a second Cayman Islands company called Overseas Administrative Services , which now is listed as the employer of 1,020 mostly managerial workers in Iraq , was established two months after Cheney 's appointment .
Cheney 's office at the White House referred questions to his personal lawyer , who did not return phone calls .
Heather Browne , a spokeswoman for KBR , acknowledged via e-mail that the two Cayman Islands companies were set up " in order to allow us to reduce certain tax obligations of the company and its employees . "
Social Security and Medicare taxes amount to 15.3 percent of each employees ' salary , split evenly between the worker and the employer .
While KBR 's use of the shell companies saves workers their half of the taxes , it deprives them of future retirement benefits .
In addition , the practice enables KBR to avoid paying unemployment taxes in Texas , where the company is registered , amounting to between $ 20 and $ 559 per American employee per year , depending on the company 's rate of turnover .
As a result , workers hired through the Cayman Island companies cannot receive unemployment assistance should they lose their jobs .
In interviews with more than a dozen KBR workers registered through the Cayman Islands companies , most said they did not realize that they had been employed by a foreign firm until they arrived in Iraq and were told by their foremen , or until they returned home and applied for unemployment benefits .
" They never explained it to us , " said Arthur Faust , 57 , who got a job loading convoys in Iraq in 2004 after putting his resume on KBRcareers.com and going to orientation with KBR officials in Houston .
But there is one circumstance in which KBR does claim the workers as its own : when it comes to receiving the legal immunity extended to employers working in Iraq .
In one previously unreported case , a group of Service Employees International workers accused KBR of knowingly exposing them to cancer - causing chemicals at an Iraqi water treatment plant .
Under the Defense Base Act of 1941 , a federal workers compensation law , employers working with the military have immunity in most cases from such employee lawsuits .
So when KBR lawyers argued that the workers were KBR employees , lawyers for the men objected ; the case remains in arbitration .
" When it benefits them , KBR takes the position that these men really are employees , " said Michael Doyle , the lawyer for nine American men who were allegedly exposed to the dangerous chemicals .
" You do n't get to take both positions . "
Founded by two brothers in Texas in 1919 , the construction firm of Brown & Root quickly became associated with some of the largest public - works projects of the early 20th century , from oil platforms to warships to dams that provided electricity to rural areas .
Its political clout , particularly with fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson , was legendary , and it became a major overseas contractor , building roads and ports during the Vietnam war .
Halliburton , a Houston - based oil conglomerate , acquired Brown & Root in 1962 .
And after the Vietnam cease - fire agreement in 1973 , it all but stopped doing overseas military work for two decades .
But in 1991 , during the Gulf War , Halliburton decided to try to revive its military business .
The next year , Brown & Root won a $ 3.9 million contract from the Defense Department under Secretary Dick Cheney to develop contingency plans to support , feed , house , and maintain the US military in 13 hot spots around the world .
That small contract soon grew into a massive logistical - support contract under which the company did everything from building military camps to cooking meals and providing transportation for troops .
Under the contract , the military agreed to reimburse Brown & Root for all expenses , and to pay a profit of between 1 and 9 percent , depending on performance .
In Somalia , starting in December 1992 , Brown & Root employees helped US soldiers and UN workers dig wells and collect garbage , among many other tasks .
The company quickly became the largest civilian employer in the country , with about 2,500 people on its payroll .
Its headquarters in Texas had a " war room , " where executives would get daily updates about events in Mogadishu .
Later the company would play similar roles supporting US troops in Haiti , Rwanda , Bosnia , Uzbekistan , and Afghanistan .
As its military work increased , Brown & Root sent more American workers overseas .
Americans working and living abroad receive significant breaks on their income tax , but still must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes if they work for an American company .
The reasoning is that such workers are likely to return to the United States and collect benefits , so they and their employers ought to help pay for them .
But the taxes drive up costs .
A former Halliburton executive who was in a senior position at the company in the early 1990s said construction companies that avoid taxes by setting up foreign subsidiaries have obvious advantages in bidding for military contracts .
Payroll taxes can be a significant cost , he said , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
" If you are bidding against [ rival construction firms ] Fluor and Bechtel , it might give you a competitive advantage . "
Service Employees International was set up in 1993 , as Brown & Root was ramping up its roster of overseas workers .
Two years later , the company set up Overseas Administrative Services , which serves more senior workers and provides a pension plan .
The parent company became Kellogg Brown & Root in 1998 , when it joined with the oil - pipe manufacturer , M. W. Kellogg .
Around that time , KBR lost its exclusive contract to provide logistical support to the US military .
But in 2001 it outbid DynCorp to win it back , by agreeing to a maximum profit of 3 percent of costs .
Then , in 2002 , the firm received a secret contract to draw up plans to restore Iraq 's oil production after the US - led invasion of Iraq .
The Defense Department has said the firm was chosen mainly for its assets and expertise , not its ability to control costs .
Nonetheless , KBR 's top competitors in Iraq do not appear to have gone to the same lengths to avoid taxes .
Other top Iraq war contractors - including Bechtel , Parsons , Washington Group International , L - 3 Communications , Perini , and Fluor - told the Globe that they pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for their American workers .
" It has been Fluor Corporation 's policy to compensate our employees who are US citizens the same as if they worked in the geographic United States , " said Keith Stephens , Fluor 's director of global media relations .
" With the exception of hardship and danger pay additives for work performed in Iraq , they receive the same benefits as their US - based colleagues , and Fluor pays or remits all required US taxes and payroll burdens , including FICA payments and unemployment insurance . "
Only one other top contractor , the construction and logistics firm IAP Worldwide Services Inc. , said it employs a " limited number " of Americans through an offshore subsidiary .
Officials at DynCorp , the company that KBR outbid for the logistics contract , did not return numerous calls .
KBR is now widely believed to be the largest private employer of foreigners in Iraq , and it hires twice as many workers through its Cayman Island subsidiaries as it does by direct hires .
Service Employees International alone employs more than 20,000 truck drivers , electricians , accountants , and engineers , roughly half of whom are American , according to Browne , the KBR spokeswoman .
KBR declined to release salary information .
But workers interviewed by the Globe who served in a range of jobs said they earned between $ 48,000 and $ 85,000 per year .
If KBR 's American workers averaged even as much as $ 63,000 per year , they and KBR would have owed more than $ 100 million per year in Social Security and Medicare taxes , split evenly between them .
Over the course of the five - year war , their tax bill would have been more than $ 500 million .
In 2004 , auditors with the Pentagon 's Defense Contract Audit Agency questioned KBR about the two Cayman Island companies but ultimately made no complaint .
The auditors told the Globe in an email exchange facilitated by Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Brian Maka that any tax savings resulting from the offshore subsidiaries " are passed on " to the US military .
Browne , the KBR spokeswoman , said the loss to Social Security could eventually be offset by the fact that the workers will receive less money when they retire , since benefits are generally based on how much workers and their companies have paid into the system .
Medicare , however , does not reduce benefits for workers who do n't contribute , and Browne acknowledged that KBR has not calculated the impact of its tax practices on the government as a whole .
She said KBR does not save money from the practice , since its contracts allow for its labor expenses to be reimbursed by the US military .
But the practice gives KBR a competitive advantage over other contractors who pay their share of employment taxes .
And critics of tax loopholes note that the use of offshore shell companies to avoid payroll taxes places a greater burden on other taxpayers .
" The argument that by not paying taxes they are saving the government money is just absurd , " said Robert McIntyre , director of Citizens for Tax Justice , a Washington advocacy group .
To the people listed as its workers , Service Employees International Inc. - known to them as SEII - remains something of a mystery .
" Does anybody know what or where in the Grand Cayman Islands SEII is located ? " a recently returned worker wrote in a complaint about the company on JobVent.com , an employment website .
He speculated that the office in the Cayman Islands must be " the size of a jail cell . . . with only a desk and chair . "
In fact , the address on file at the Registry of Companies in the Cayman Islands leads to a nondescript building in the Grand Cayman business district that houses Trident Trust , one of the Caymans ' largest offshore registered agents .
Trident Trust collects $ 1,000 a year to forward mail and serve as KBR 's representative on the island .
The real managers of Service Employees International work out of KBR 's office in Dubai .
KBR and Halliburton , which also moved to Dubai , severed ties last year .
Both KBR and the US military appear to regard Service Employees International and KBR interchangeably , except for tax purposes .
According to the Defense Contract Auditing Agency , KBR bills the Service Employees workers as " direct labor costs , " and charges almost the same amount for them as for direct hires .
The contract that workers sign in Houston before traveling to Iraq commits workers to abide by KBR 's code of ethics and dispute - resolution mechanisms but states that the agreement is with Service Employees International .
Some workers said they were told that Service Employees International was just KBR 's payroll company .
Others mistook the name as a reference to the well - known , large union , Service Employees International .
Henry Bunting , a Houston man who served as a procurement officer for a KBR project in Iraq in 2003 , said he first found out that he was working for a foreign subsidiary when he looked closely at his paycheck .
" Their whole mindset was deceit , " Bunting said .
He said that he wrote to KBR several times asking for a W - 2 form so he could file his taxes , but that KBR never responded .
David Boiles , a truck driver in Iraq from 2004 to 2006 , said that he realized he was working for Service Employees International when he arrived in Iraq and his foreman told him he was not a KBR employee , despite the fact that his military - issued identification card said " KBR . "
" At first , I did n't believe him , " Boiles said .
Danny Langford , a Texas pipe - fitter who was sent to work in a water treatment plant in southern Iraq in July 2003 , said he , too , initially believed that he was an employee of KBR .
McCain is refusing to renounce this influential evangelist ’s support .
From Media Matters :
HAGEE : All hurricanes are acts of God , because God controls the heavens .
I believe that New Orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to God , and they are — were recipients of the judgment of God for that .
The newspaper carried the story in our local area that was not carried nationally that there was to be a homosexual parade there on the Monday that the Katrina came .
And the promise of that parade was that it was going to reach a level of sexuality never demonstrated before in any of the other Gay Pride parades .
So I believe that the judgment of God is a very real thing .
I know that there are people who demur from that , but I believe that the Bible teaches that when you violate the law of God , that God brings punishment sometimes before the day of judgment .
And I believe that the Hurricane Katrina was , in fact , the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans .
An even more useful feature would be turning this off .
If you have n't tried Duplicate Tab ( http://twanno.mozdev.org/ — aka , the first extension I install , every time , without question ) , I 'd highly recommend it .
It clones a tab either to a new tab or a new window ( history included ) .
This is the same behavior you see in IE , where a new Window is a duplicate of the current window .
It 's got a merge window feature , as well , where tabs from multiple windows can be combined in a single window and retain their history , but I rarely use that .
The sad bit is that the keyboard shortcut to duplicate a tab has always been Ctrl - Shift - T. Now , I can probably go through the Duplicate Tab code and change that , but it 's since been ingrained .
I 'm going to give the keyconfig extension a shot at altering the restore keys ( http://mozilla.dorando.at/readme.html ) , as I saw nothing in about : config to even disable this restore feature , let alone alter it .
This is , indeed , a handy feature , but it should be more visible ( like bookmarking a group of tabs , but setting it up so that when you open that group again , it 'll come with history ) and configurable .

10 Bloodworld Laurence M. Janifer
Original title : You Sane Men , easier to find as Bloodworld .
The problem with Janifer is that he was , well , a hack .
He wrote professionally for fifty years .
Pick up any given Janifer book and you will probably be disappointed .
Although , he did garner a Hugo nomination in 1960 as the co-author ( under the pseudonym Mark Phillips ) with Randall Garrett for Brain Twister , a novel that thankfully did not win .
However , in the blind - pig - finds - an - acorn model , Janifer knocked the ball out of the park with Bloodworld ( to mix a couple of metaphors ) .
Essentially , the fine ruling menfolk on a colonized planet remain “ sane ” and capable of fulfilling their social obligations by torturing underclass women as a recreational activity .
For its time , it was definitely provocative and probably an intentional attempt to write a “ shocking ” novel .
Still , the torture scenes are painted with a nicely consistent “ this - is - normal - and - right ” tone … until the protagonist develops feelings for one of his whipping - lasses , and the morality play starts .
Gene Wolfe fans are especially encouraged to check this one out .

9 Skinner Richard S. McEnroe
While I admit to a personal preference for so - called “ Golden Age ” science fiction , works ca n’t be “ lost ” to the back shelves of used bookstores and the ferret - warrens of Internet traders while they ’re available on the shelves of Borders or Barnes & Noble .
Skinner , as a 1985 title , might be cutting it a little close , but that ’s still almost a quarter - century .
And with no reviews or descriptions found on Amazon , it ’s at least overlooked somewhat .
Anyway , our down - and - out anti-hero protagonist finds himself shipped off to a desert world and deeply in debt .
The planet is owned and managed by a “ family company ” for the production of their one great monopoly … dragonhides .
The critters , not real dragons but might as well be , are big nasty reptiles living in the desert sands , and their skins are nearly indestructible .
A skinner goes out ( with his gear and supplies brought from the company store and increasing his debt , of course ) and does his best to kill these beasties without getting killed himself so he can haul the skins back .
The company even has a nursery where they hatch and raise baby dragons , and that work is deadly , too .
Throw in rival factions within the family controlling the company , and you have a fairly - straightforward adventure that could well have been set in a 1890s coal town .
But it is n’t , and the dragon - work is interesting to read .
It ’ll never be a classic , but Skinner is satisfying genre - stuff .

8 The Greks Bring Gifts Murray Leinster
Another hack , but a true pulp - fiction hack .
Will Jenkins wrote thousands of short pieces under a variety of pseudonyms for such genres as westerns , romances , jungle adventure , horror , radio scripts , etc plus what he is best - known for — science fiction under the nom Murray Leinster .
His short story “ First Contact ” is in the Hall of Fame anthology , as it should be .
If it is remembered long enough , it may well be exactly how our ships and those of the aliens manage not to fight when first encountering one another in the depths of interstellar space .
But the vast majority of Leinster stuff is uninspired , and that is being kind .
The Greks Bring Gifts is an exception .
The title ( sic ; one e not two in Greks ) is a play on the Trojan Horse myth .
What we have is this large spaceship with aloof , somewhat creepy Greks in it coming to earth .
They are a schoolship for spaceworkers , and they have a class of likable , furry Aldarians aboard .
Might be a good learning experience for them to make contact with a new race , the humans .
Oh yes , the Greks will give us what technology they can that might help us , free of charge .
Just the neighborly thing to do .
And almost unlimited broadcast energy is the biggie to us humans .
Why build more internal combustion cars when pretty soon everyone will have a broadcast - powered car ?
So sorry , the Greks must be on their way now , but things will work out , you ’ll see , all of these current economic difficulties notwithstanding .
And about the Aldarians ….

7 House Of Stairs William Sleator
William Sleator is a name unfamiliar to many adult science fiction fans , yet he has made a living for 30 + years writing fiction that is mostly of a sci- fi nature .
However , it is young adult science fiction .
Not Spaceship Under The Apple Tree style “ kiddie sf ” — more along the lines of Heinlein juveniles , though with far less science .
Podkayne of Mars rather than Rocketship Gallileo .
But stylistically completely different , as Sleator specializes in weird moods and bizarre situations .
House of Stairs , written in 1974 , is truly weird and definitely a bizarre situation .
While I have n’t read the entirety of Sleator ’s science fiction output , this novel is — pardon me — light years beyond the other works of his I have read .
It ’s really hard to provide a synopsis that is n’t a spoiler for the new reader ’s freakazoid reaction to what transpires , but I ’ll try .
Understand that the following is as bare - bones as possible , on purpose .
A group of adolescents who do n’t know one another awake to find themselves in a strange place .
Stairways and landings ramble everywhere in three dimensions , and that is all they see .
It ’s chilly , and there is no food or water .
Then , on occassion , they get fed some nutrient bars by machinery .
That ’s all I ’m saying about the plot .
The book really makes you realize that you ’re pretty normal , because you would have to consider whether this book is appropriate for other people ’s precious little snowflakes to read and because of a concept I can’t mention without spoiling .
But apparently no one has a problem with this book .

6 Iceworld Hal Clement
Hal Clement was the quintessential old - school “ hard ” science fiction author .
In fact , most of his novels are probably unreadable to the majority of today ’s science fiction readers because of voluminous passages coming across as graduate - level lectures in physics and exobiology .
Even fans of the new revival of science in science fiction , as typified by the justly popular works of Robert J. Sawyer , may find Clement books to be a perfect cure for insomnia .
But , as befitting a longtime professor of chemistry and astonomy , the science is as genuine as possible for its time periods , meticulously worked out , and free from errors .
Clement garnered fame and critical acclaim for 1954 ’s Mission of Gravity , a novel about humans directing intelligent centipede explorers on a high - grav world ( where a fall from three feet near the poles is certain death ) to retrieve readings from a crashed probe near the equator where the gravity is much less extreme .
So much for the classics … .
Iceworld features far less science than his other works — though there is no escaping science in a Clement book .
We see the alien viewpoint even more than the human one in this tale of intergalactic drug smuggling .
The drug is tobacco , the only drug the aliens have ever found which results in full - blown do - anything addiction from a single dose .
The “ Iceworld ” is Earth — to the aliens , anywhere water can be a liquid is unbelievably cold .
Excellent character portayals of both humans and aliens , and altogether an absorbing read .
Note : none of the above is much of a spoiler — it ’s the set - up .

5 Ballroom Of The Skies John D. McDonald
Creator of the famed Travis McGee series , McDonald is considered by the world to be a mystery writer .
As a Grand Master award winner , he certainly is that .
But McDonald was a first - rate science fiction author as well .
His numerous SF short stories , sold to magazines , consistently show fine craftsmanship and an understanding of the genre… they never disappoint .
One could do worse than to pick up his seminal collection , Other Times , Other Worlds .
Of his three longer science fiction works , Ballroom Of The Skies is probably the best .
Heavy on sometimes stilted dialogue in the beginning , and using more exposition in the latter stages as the characters become involved with greater events , the novel essentially explores the fundamental question of why humans seem driven towards war and self - imposed disaster , even as their other activities strive towards bettering living standards and the human condition .
Of course , there is a sinister explanation ….

4 Midworld Alan Dean Foster
I hesitated to place this book on the list , because Foster fans are legion .
Thus , lots of people have probably at least heard of this book , even if they have n’t read it .
It garners its place largely because many other works by Foster are so well - known it seems that this one has been largely ignored except for a minority of people like me who have accorded it cult status .
It might well be the best alien biosphere ever described .
The planet is all jungle , towering to dizzying heights of chlorophyll fecundity with a hellish swampy twilight at the surface .
Human descendents of a long - ago spaceship crash live in the “ mid ” levels of the world , hence the title .
At first glance they are primitive savages , but their ability to survive in a truly inimical environment has made them far more intimately familar with their surroundings than any Native American culture ever was .
Then , a corporation illegally arrives on the planet to exploit its lush plant life for medicinal purposes .
Our hero ( considered rash and a weird - thinker by his tribe ) along with his furcot — a native companion who can speak and has a much closer relationship to man than our dogs — agrees to guide two stranded scientists back to their treetop base .
Spectacular depictions of alien lifeforms .

3 Agent Of Chaos Norman Spinrad
Spinrad is quite well - known , especially for his 1969 novel Bug Jack Barron , which was a precursor to cyberpunk .
Agent Of Chaos ( 1967 ) is his second novel .
I hope too many eyes do n’t roll to the back of too many heads when it is stated that this can only be described as political science fiction .
Those who detest politics can still enjoy it , as the backdrop is Heinleinien space opera at its finest .
But politics do take center stage , and one could even say that meta-politics is the theme here .
So we have a totalitarian government ( the Hegemony ) and an underground rebel conspiracy ( the Democratic Movement ) .
The latter professes to work for individual liberty .
But as these factions struggle , the Agents of Chaos — known to the public as the Brotherhood of Assassins — often intervene with random acts of violence that could favor the Hegemony on Tuesday and the Movement on Thursday .
Just what is their agenda ?
The reader learns early on that their agenda truly is Chaos , but for definable political reasons which are slowly revealed .
Central to the book is the concept of entropy , even in political systems .
The Hegemony strives for Order and elimination of randomness , so of course a reaction occurs ( the Movement ) to challenge that move towards order .
But the Agents have other ideas .
Wait till you learn what the Agents consider to be the Ultimate Chaotic Act !

2 Of Men And Monsters William Tenn
William Tenn was the pseudonym of Penn State professor Philip Klass .
In the 50s and 60s , he wrote tons of science fiction short stories for Galaxy and Astounding .
Almost universally , those stories were humorous and / or satirical , written in a breezy , fast - reading style .
The majority have been reprinted countless times in various collections over the years .
Yet , he wrote only one true science fiction novel : Of Men And Monsters .
And even that one is somewhat short and easily read in a single sitting .
But it is excellent and quite original , even though its premise sounds like standard fare .
Gigantic mantis - like aliens have conquered earth and set up living quarters in equally gigantic houses .
But scattered remnants of humanity survive , literally living like mice in the walls of the alien homes .
And like mice , they must brave death in order to steal food .
The true grace of the book is its development of the tribal culture (s ) mankind adopts under these trying conditions .
And of course , there is a rebellious spirit in our protagonist … leading him to upset the human social order .

1 Wasp Eric Frank Russell
Russell himself is under - appreciated by today ’s science fiction community .
But he was , in fact , the favorite writer of both legendary editor John W. Campbell and author Alan Dean Foster ( source : conversation between the two , as described by Foster in his introduction to The Best of Eric Frank Russell ) .
Some of Russell ’s short stories are held in high regard — “ Allamagoosa ” and others have been reprinted over and over , and in hall of fame or other “ greatest of all time ” anthologies .
His novels … not so much .
Wikipedia reports that a recent blip in interest has been seen over Wasp as a result of a reprinting in 2000 , and the subsequent events of September 11 , 2001 .
Because , you see , our protagonist employs effective terrorist tactics … which are depicted in the book with dark humor combined with more than tacit approval .
Government approval , in fact .
Spoiler alert :
Wiki ’s plot synopsis is essentially a complete outline of the book in paragraph form !
Anyway , Wasp , written in 1957 , is short and just outright fun to read .
The title refers to the fact that the seemingly inconsequential can have disproportionate results — an example is given of a wasp which distracts a driver to cause a multi-car crash , thus tying up lots of manpower and money to deal with the aftermath .
James
Mowry becomes a government - trained wasp , dropped alone in disguise on an enemy planet during a fierce war with earth .
Actually , this is somewhat similar to the Allies dropping solo paratroopers behind German lines in WWII , with instructions to sever communications , work with the underground , and generally make pesky nuisances of themselves .
Which in the book Mowry does with derring - do , close calls , a contempt for authority , and witty if dark humor .
The tricks and tactics he employs really make the book sing ( a few simple stickers are amazing in their effect ) .
Combine that with a character who detests the authority of his own government but figures that of the totalitarian enemy to be worse , and it should be a classic rather than a barely - known .

( Two women walk up with their little babies , still young enough to be carried around wrapped in blankets . )
Lady 1 : “ How much is face painting for the kids ? ”
Me : “ Three dollars , ma’am . ”
Lady # 1 : “ Could you charge us less ‘ cuz our kids are small ? ”
Me : * looking for her kids , thinking she can’t possibly be referring to the babies *
“ How small are they ? ”
Lady # 1 : “ They ’re babies ! ”
Me : * eyes popping out * “ Excuse me ? ”
Lady # 2 : “ We ’re HOLDIN ’ ‘ EM !
They ’re babies ! ”
Me : “ Um , ma’am , I do n’t think I can paint on your infants . ”
Lady # 2 : “ Well why NOT ? ”
Me : “ Because this is heavy professional paint .
It says right on the label , ‘ Not for use for children under three years . ’
It ’ll irritate their skin . ”
Lady # 1 : “ So you wo n’t paint our babies ? ”
Me : “ No , ma’am .
I ca n’t do that .
It ’s not safe . ”
Lady # 1 : “ There ai n’t no sign that says you wo n’t ! ”
Me : “ I should think that kinda goes without saying … ”
Lady # 1 : “ So this means we waited in that line for NOTHING ? ”
Lady # 2 : “ Y’all should put up a sign or something that says you wo n’t face paint on babies , ‘ cuz I thought that was y’alls job . ”
Me : “ I ’m sorry ma’am .
I ’ve been doing this for years and nobody ’s ever tried to have an infant painted before so I never thought I ’d have to mention it .
It ’s dangerous . ”
Lady # 1 : “ Well that just ai n’t fair !
Damn , if I knew you would n’t do it , I would n’t ’ve waited in that line ! ”
Lady # 2 : “ Y’all need to put up a sign or something !
I thought this was for the KIDS–are n’t babies kids ? ”
Me : “ I ’ve already explained –it ’s dangerous .
I wo n’t do it , and neither will any of my coworkers . ”
Lady # 2 : * as they ’re both walking away *
“ That just ai n’t fair .
They should have a sign . ”
Me : “ Have a nice afternoon , ladies ! ”
( I found out later that , after I left , the women came back twice to different painters trying to get someone to face - paint on their infants .
Both times , they were told the same thing . )
Last week was one of the strangest I 've seen in electoral politics .
It began with Barack Obama in danger of falling completely off a cliff , a danger that has only partially subsided .
And yet it concluded with hints and suggestions by prominent Democrats and journalists that Hillary Clinton should just drop out of the race .
I 'm trying to think of things to compare this to .
Maybe the drawn - out and painful break - up of a relationship .
You argue about this and that , the small things ; she does n't like that you watch too much football , you do n't like the way she squeezes the toothpaste tube from the middle instead of the bottom , which any guy will tell you is the only logical way to do it .
But eventually , the unavoidable must be discussed .
All artifice falls away and you get to the point where one party or the other says , " Look , the bottom line here is ... "
We 're reaching the bottom - line point .
And the bottom line for what seems to be a majority of Democratic insiders is fear of a drawn - out and divisive nomination process .
That argues for getting things settled sooner rather than later , and it means settling them in Obama 's direction , since he 's won more votes and delegates .
Democrats are highly jittery about the impact on the contest of Jeremiah Wright , the radical pastor whose anti-American rhetoric has taken parishioner Obama to that cliff 's edge .
The pre-Wright Obama was awfully close to being the perfect vote - for - him - and - feel - good - about - yourself candidate for white voters .
The post - Wright Obama is a very different figure .
As a friend of mine put it , it 's as if white America suddenly discovered that Tiger Woods 's best friend all these years was Malcolm X .
Numerous polls will arrive this week that show the impact of the Wright story .
But , as of late last week , it appeared that Obama had stopped some of the bleeding with his big speech on race last Tuesday .
If the coming polls suggest that that remains the case , then Democrats will be willing to take their chances with him , so to speak , Wright or wrong .
Prominent Democrats are saying so .
Bill Richardson , an erstwhile presidential aspirant himself , endorsed Obama last Friday - a shattering blow to Clinton since Richardson had been a cabinet secretary in her husband 's administration .
The House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , without endorsing , has continued to indicate , even after Wright , that Obama is her preferred candidate .
And prominent pundits are saying so .
Last Friday , just about an hour after the Richardson endorsement event , two top writers for the Politico , an influential website , posted a news article - cum - editorial arguing , accurately , that Clinton has almost no numerical case to make .
Another uber - pundit and conventional - wisdom shaper , this one at Time , posted 14 reasons why Clinton should consider withdrawing .
And so it was that the week that began with Obama on the ropes ended with Clinton being urged out of the ring .
I think it 's too early for that , but only a little too early .
Mark down May 7 .
That 's the date by which Clinton should be one of two things : a , the possible nominee after all ; or , b , out of the race .
Three important primaries will be held between now and then - Pennsylvania on April 22 , and Indiana and North Carolina on May 6 .
The first of these is a state considered vital to the Democrats ' chances in November .
As for the other two , while no one really thinks John McCain will lose them in the fall , their Democratic electorates are so diverse that neither candidate can win them by simply appealing to his or her base voters .
Clinton 's only remaining argument is to win all three of these states - and to win them big .
If she can rack up three impressive victories in a row - and , crucially , if evidence from exit polls suggests that the Wright story cost Obama hefty percentages of white voters - then and only then can she go to her fellow Democrats and say : Look , he 's tanking .
We just can't send this guy out to represent us in the fall .
Any outcome short of that makes Obama the nominee , I would think .
It does n't really matter what it is .
She wins Pennsylvania by 10 points , and they split the other two in fairly close votes , for example ; for Clinton , not enough .
In any case like that , it will be apparent that Clinton cannot catch Obama either in the total popular vote ( which Obama leads by 700,000 right now ) or the pledged delegate count ( which he leads by around 140 ) .
So if we wake up on May 7 and Clinton does n't have clear momentum , and the evidence that the Wright association will badly damage Obama in November is anything less than manifest , I 'd expect that the calls will mount for her to come to terms with the numerical reality and end her campaign .
Whether she 'll respond to them is another question .
Her campaign has given every indication that it will stay active throughout the primary season , which ends on June 3 .
She 'll hope that she 's close enough to muddy things up .
But what happened last week is that Democrats began to signal that what they want is clarity .
After 16 rollicking years , they 're breaking up with the Clintons .
Like I said , the unavoidable must eventually be discussed .

Dispute charges at your peril
If you 've ever reversed the charge for a dubious credit card transaction or online purchase , your name could be on a secretive overseas database that consumer advocates say may violate protections guaranteed under U.S. law .
The database is maintained by a Panama company named Goldwell Corp. , which runs an online service called ChargeBack Bureau ( chargebackbureau.org ) .
Chargebacks are a right provided to U.S. consumers under the Fair Credit Billing Act .
The system allows people to reverse credit card payments for goods or services that were unauthorized or end up being different than advertised .
Most chargebacks involve a consumer bringing a disputed transaction to his or her credit card issuer .
The issuer , in turn , takes up the matter with the merchant , often requiring repayment of any funds involved .
" You order a red couch , you get a blue couch ; you order a working dishwasher , you get a broken dishwasher , " said Gail Hillebrand , staff attorney at Consumers Union in San Francisco .
" Those are common reasons for chargebacks . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" The chargeback is a very important consumer right , " she said .
" It makes the Internet safer .
If you do n't get what you ordered , you can undo it . "
ChargeBack Bureau takes a different approach in its marketing pitch to online retailers .
" As an internet business owner , you know that the customer is not always right , " the site says .
" They have learned that they are n't responsible for reversed charges .
Unfortunately as an online merchant you do n't have enough proof to stop the chargebacks against your merchant account . "
The service claims to have more than 7,500 online merchants enrolled as members and more than 40,000 listings in its database .
Whenever a customer 's charges are reversed , ChargeBack Bureau members submit details of the transaction to the database , which can be subsequently accessed by other members .
The idea is that participating merchants will be able to spot risky customers before completing a transaction .
Data submitted -- without the consumer 's prior knowledge or consent -- include your name , address , phone number , e-mail address , transaction details and a summary of the dispute ( from the merchant 's perspective only , of course ) .
The database is also for " sales that ended up in a refund due to disagreement with the customer . "
This would normally suggest , because a refund has been granted , that the customer was in the right .
ChargeBack Bureau describes such people as " bad customers . "
" Thousands of other businesses like yours share their bad customers ' data in our database , " the site says .
" When our members receive a chargeback , they enter the customer 's information into our database along with a short description of the chargeback case .
The database is searchable by all our members . "
Moreover , ChargeBack Bureau says it sends an e-mail to any consumer whose info has been listed on the database .
The e-mail warns that the consumer is " going to have trouble purchasing goods or services on the Internet in the future . "
According to the site , only the merchant who lists a particular consumer has the ability to remove that person from the ChargeBack Bureau database .
" In most cases , " the site assures merchants , " you will get your money back . "
Travis Plunkett , legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America , said ChargeBack Bureau 's e-mails to consumers seem like a deliberate attempt to deter people from exercising their legal rights .
" They are threatening and penalizing people who are using their rights under federal law to challenge improper credit card purchases , " he said .
" Blacklisting consumers with no due process is completely illegitimate .
It 's outrageous . "
ChargeBack Bureau did not respond to e-mails sent to the address provided on its site or to an address on the company 's press releases .
The site 's terms of service identify ChargeBack Bureau as being owned by Goldwell , which gives its mailing address as a post office box in Panama City .
Panama prides itself on strict corporate secrecy laws that prevent outsiders from gaining access to a company 's records .
The country also offers a variety of tax benefits to U.S. companies doing business there .
A press release issued by ChargeBack Bureau in July 2005 named Adam Balogh as the service 's contact person at Goldwell and included a toll - free number where he could be reached .
Since January , that number has connected callers with a company named Jackson Fencing in Houston .
An employee of Jackson Fencing said she 'd never heard of Adam Balogh or Goldwell Corp .
Adam Balogh is listed as administrator of ChargeBack Bureau 's Web site , but the registrant for the site 's domain name is listed as Istvan Balogh .
The listings were last updated in May , according to Internet registry records .
Goldwell 's Panama post office box is given as the address for both names .
Press releases issued shortly after ChargeBack Bureau began operating in 2002 named Adam Balogh as ChargeBack Bureau 's chief executive and provided a Seattle - area contact number .
Calls to that number are now automatically disconnected .
The Washington secretary of state 's office said a Goldwell Corp. had registered to do business in the state in 1995 , but its registration was ended in 1998 .
Hillebrand at Consumers Union concluded that ChargeBack Bureau 's shadowy nature should be a red flag for consumers as well as for merchants who enroll in the service .
" It signals an entity that wo n't even come through for its customers , " she said .
ChargeBack Bureau costs merchants $ 29.99 per quarter or $ 99.99 per year for full access to its database .
Hillebrand said any California merchant who signs up for ChargeBack Bureau could be engaging in an unfair business practice under state law .
" The purpose of this looks to be to prevent people from using their legal rights , " she said .
Hillebrand encouraged anyone who receives a threatening e-mail from ChargeBack Bureau about being listed on the company 's database to contact the California attorney general 's office .
Lately I have been thinking of another thought experiment .
What would I , personally , do if gasoline was $ 100 a gallon ?
Now that may seem silly .
Nobody thinks we are going to have to deal with gasoline at $ 100 a gallon .
But that misses the point of the thought experiment .
When I ask people at what price point gasoline is going to have a major impact on their lifestyle , that seems to be a moving target .
When gas was $ 2 , they said $ 4 .
Now that gas is $ 4 , many have realized they wo n't make big changes at $ 10 .
Oh , they might buy a smaller car , but they are n't going to start walking 3 miles to the store .
A friend who drives a Suburban recently told me that he does n't care about gas prices ; that he is going to keep driving at the same rate regardless .
I bet he would have a change of heart if gasoline was $ 100 a gallon .
I am very fond of thought experiments .
I like to ask " What If ? "
This can help me wrap my head around a problem .
For instance , if I wonder how much land it would take for solar panels to produce enough electricity to supply the U.S. , that 's a thought experiment .
It is n't that I think we are going to build a solar grid that is 50 by 50 miles of nothing but solar panels , nor that I am oblivious to energy storage issues .
Rather , it can help frame for me whether the idea is daft from conception , or whether there is a nugget of potential embedded within .
So the point is to jump so far out there - $ 100 / gal - that there is no question that 99 % of us would have to make some serious changes .
The thought experiment is mainly designed to flesh out how people might cope as gasoline becomes more expensive and as we go down the depletion curve .
This is already reality for some , as your $ 100 / gal dilemma is someone else 's dilemma at $ 4/gal .
What I would like is to hear how you would cope with $ 100 a gallon gasoline .
Let 's presume that gasoline prices increase to $ 100 at a steady rate over the next 5 years .
Because many of our energy sources are interchangeable , let 's assume that other fossil fuel sources ( coal , gas , etc. ) follow suit .
Alternative ( non-fossil fuel ) energy sources , such as solar and nuclear , would also follow this trend , but not at the same rate since they are less dependent on fossil fuel inputs .
So the idea is really , with respect to fossil fuels , " How low can you realistically go ? "
I do n't want to make any assumptions on what would be happening in the economy as a whole , because in reality the economy would have collapsed under those prices .
So my assumption is to simply determine what is within my power to change as fuel prices climb - and I am forced to make difficult choices .
Here is how I think it would affect me .
Looking at my own situation , I just bought a house 23.5 miles from my office .
However , I did this with my eyes wide open .
The fact is , I do n't spend much time in the office .
Since I started with my new company on March 1st , I have spent just 4 days in the office .
So , a long daily commute is not something I have to deal with .
In fact , I have never actually made the commute , as the 4 days I spent in the office preceded the purchase of my house .
( Presently I am on site at our factory in the Netherlands , and I ride a bike to work ) .
But , even when I do have to travel to the office , at $ 100 a gallon , that 47 mile round trip will add up .
Even the most fuel efficient cars in the U.S. are going to cost me around $ 100 for the trip .
If I have to make that trip twice a month - and so far I am averaging less than that - it 's going to cost me $ 2400 a year - and that 's presuming I have a car that can get 47 miles a gallon .
Clearly , something like an SUV is out of the question .
This could cost me $ 400 every time I had to go to the office .
So SUVs , even now in their initial death throes , will be transportation only for the truly rich .
What I really want - unless the cost is prohibitive - is the most fuel efficient car I can find .
Today , I think that 's a Toyota Prius , but I am really hoping that an electric car rides to the rescue .
( I would definitely choose the public transportation option if available , but right now it is n't available from my home location to my office ) .
Even then , $ 100 to drive in to the office is pretty steep .
I want to find a way around that .
I am going to lobby my employer for permission to telecommute .
At those prices , he is going to get a lot of those requests .
When I think about what I do during a typical day , almost everything could be done via telephone , teleconference , webconference , or webcam .
And when I do have to go to work , I am going to search for a car pool .
At those fuel prices , a lot of people are going to be willing to share rides .
I would imagine that new , creative ways of organizing car pools will pop up .
I would completely stop using an auto for short trips , and likely buy a small motorcycle for quick trips within 5 miles .
If time is not a factor , I will ride a bike for those short trips .
We would have to do a much better job of planning out our groceries , as it wo n't be economical to run to the store to pick up a few items .
Entertainment options like Netflix will start to look a lot more attractive .
In my home , I would also need to make changes .
My wife and I currently fight over the thermostat .
When I am alone , I will set the thermostat as high as 85 in the summer .
With the family at home , I will drop it to 78 .
The wife and kids like it at 75 .
( It 's just the opposite in winter , with me wearing a jacket around the house ) .
With gas at $ 100 a gallon and electricity sharply higher , we are going to have to get used to being less comfortable .
82 degrees inside is a lot better than 105 degrees outside .
But even so , I would probably face $ 1,500 a month electric bills .
I am going to install as many solar panels as I can afford , because at these prices the payback period should be very short .
Ditto for a solar hot water heater , which keeps beckoning to me , but remains just out of reach .
( I have a brand new hot water heater in my new house , and I can't justify replacing it already ) .
Ground source heat pumps are going to look much more attractive .
I will need to identify and track the transient electricity drains in the house by installing something like the Kill - A - Watt electricity usage monitors .
My business travel would not be sustainable at those rates .
For the next 12 months , I am probably looking at 12 trips just to the Netherlands , and additional trips to China .
If those trips are 20 times as expensive , I am going to have to get webcams for everyone on the team , and our " face to face " meetings will happen that way .
To me , being on site right now is important , because I get to know people , and they get to know me .
I can understand who does what .
But after that , I can conduct business remotely .
Ultra -expensive fossil fuel prices will force me to see just how effective I can be at doing that .
Other things would obviously be impacted , such as where we decide to vacation , or where to invest any money that might be left over ( which lately has been in Brazil ) .
But I think that covers the major items .
What have I overlooked ?
I am greatly interested in your thoughts .
It helps me understand just how we are likely to respond as the going gets tough .
The Rothschild Bloodline
Financial Wizzards & Wealthy Cults
( The numbers behind some sentences and words (...)
are references to the bibliography list at the end of the article of course )
Two neighbor horse farmers came together one day to talk business .
The first farmer sold his horse to the second for a quarter million dollars , and then bought it back for about $ 20 more .
He could now advertise his horse ( actually worth $ 20 ) , as a horse he that he had paid over a quarter of a million dollars for .
We can laugh over such schemes .
And perhaps we should laugh at ourselves for having been fooled , for if there is one area in life that exceeds the religious in deception , and touches all of us it is the financial .
What else can we do about it except laugh ?

ROTHSCHILD TALKS ABOUT THEIR DYNASTY
Lord Rothschild in his book The Shadow of a Great Man quotes a letter sent from Davidson on June 24 , 1814 to Nathan Rothschild , , , As long as a house is like yours , and as long as you work together with your brothers , not a house in the world will be able to compete with you , to cause you harm or to take advantage of you , for together you can undertake and perform more than any house in the world .
"
(1) The closeness of the Rothschild brothers is seen in a letter from Saloman ( Salmon ) Rothschild to his brother Nathan on Feb. 28 , 1815 , " We are like the mechanism of a watch : each part is essential .
( 2 ) This closeness is further seen in that of the 18 marriages made by Mayer Amschel Rothschild ’s grandchildren 16 were contracted between first cousins .
VISITING THE NATION THE ROTHSCHILDS BUILT
In 1974 , in the summer after the Yom Kippur War this Author toured Israel , and got the chance to personally visit many of the buildings like the Knesset that the Rothschild ’s money has built .
The Knesset is the Israeli equivalent to our Congress ’s Capitol building .
One of the Rothschilds in his will left money for ongoing building projects in Israel , and the Rothschilds are honored with a Street named after them in Jerusalem .
The people of Germany and Turkey have been very close .
I can recall meeting Turkish " Gastarbeiter " ( guestworkers ) in Germany .
The reader will remember that Turkey fought on Germany ’s side in W.W. I . A few powerful Jews , including the Rothschilds were responsible for the wording of the Treaty imposed on Germany that ended W.W. I ( 3 ) The treaty gave the Rothschilds the German owned railway rights in Palestine ( which had been part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire ) , thus paving the way for the Rothschilds to have a sure leverage to dictate policy concerning Palestine .
The Rothschilds had made loans to Turkey which amounted to almost one hundred million pounds .
When the Turkish government collapsed after W.W. I because they were on the losing side , the Rothschilds had a claim on Palestine because of those unpaid Turkish loans .
4
The British government followed the dictates of the Rothschilds .
The British were given a mandate over Palestine , and the Rothschilds were able to through their proxies in the British government , to create the steps that led to the nation of Israel .

THE ROTHSCHILDS AS " PROPHETS "
One item stands out as a person listens to the International Bankers and reads their books .
They believe money is what makes the world go round .
If you have money , you can do anything .
Money is " God " , and it is worshipped and served .
Even after these families accumulate more than can be spent , these devotees continue selling their souls for this false but powerful god .
The great poet - philosopher Heinrich Heine ( a Banker ’s son ) said , " Money is the god of our time , and Rothschild is his prophet . " 6
Following the cue of the Rothschilds , Heinrich Heme , a Jew , signed his name by drawing a Seal of Solomon .
7 Amsel Rothschild is reported to have said , " Give me control of the economics of a country ; and I care not who makes her laws .
( 8 ) Today his descendents meet twice daily in London to dictate to the world what the world price of gold will be .
They also dictate what the " Federal Reserve System " will do with America ’s finances .
ANOTHER GOD TOO
According to eye - witnesses , who were prominent enough to visit one of the British Rothschild homes , the Rothschilds worship yet another god too , Satan .
They set a place for him at their table .
( 8a ) The Rothschilds have been Satanists for many generations .
The Rothschilds are an important part of the history of the Seal of Solomon ( also known as hexagram , Magen David , six - pointed star , Star of David . )
The Seal of Solomon , the hexagram , was not considered a Jewish symbol before the Rothschilds began using it .9 Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal of Solomon had been used by Arab Magicians , Cabalist Magicians , Druid witches and Satanists .
One of the few ancient uses of the symbol was on the floor of a 1,200 year old Moslem Mosque found where Tel Aviv is today .
10
In the twelve century an Ashkenazic Jew Menahem ben Duji , who thought he was the Messiah , used the magical symbol .11 Because the Rothschilds were Satanists they adopted this powerful magic symbol in 1822 for their coat- of - arms .
The name they adopted for their family actually comes from the fact that in the 17th century Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of their house to identify it .
Mayer Amschel then decided to take the name red-schield ( Rothschild in German ) after the red Seal of Solomon that they used .
Alice Bailey in A Treatise On White Magic , p. 412 , claims that the Hierarchy has a special group which she calls " the financial group " , , controlling all that can be converted into energy , and constituting a dictatorship over all modes of intercourse , commerce and exchange . "
According the Luciferian Alice Bailey , the " financial group " is the latest group directed by the Hierarchy .
In 1836 Zevi Hirsch Kalischer approached Rothschild and proposed Rothschild buy all of Erez Israel .
It took many years for the Rothschilds to finally create Israel .
The Rothschilds have been a primary force behind the creation of Israel , and so it is appropriate that the nation carries their magical Seal of Solomon as the state logo .
The Ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel will not serve in the Israeli army because they know that Almighty God was not behind the creation of modern Israel , but rather the rich ungodly apostate Jews .
They refuse to serve the ungodly .
They are more wiser than men like Jerry Falwell who run around proclaiming Israel is God ’s nation .
Men like Falwell are the type that this Author finds reference to repeatedly in Jewish documents that speak of their power within the Fundamentalists .
God is ultimately in charge , he has allowed Hitler to come to power , Stalin to come to power , and the Rothschilds to come to power .
In the same sense that God rules over and blessed Stalin ’s Russia , he rules over America and Israel .
To twist scriptures about God seating the rulers and then to apply them to bless one Satanic secular communist nation and not another is inconsistent and not correctly using the Word of Truth .
Some people object that the conspiracy of Power is labelled Jewish rather than Satanic by certain concerned citizens .
This objection is valid -- however , will these objectors then take the obvious next step and admit the nation of Israel which the Rothschild ’s created is Satanic and not Jewish ?
But then who knows precisely why people do what they do ?
If you ask someone why he does something , he will give you one answer today , another tomorrow , and another the next day .
Does he do what he does for a real reason , or a single motive ?
Perhaps to label the Power as only Satanic or only Jewish or only Masonic is to neglect the personal human dimension .
This personal human dimension is godless .
Being godless it fills that void , by pretending its men are gods .
This brings us right back to the Gnostic religions and Satan .
Most Jewish people do not concern themselves with learning the occultic significance to their treasured Magen David ( Star of David ) .
King David did not have anything to do with the hexagram , although his son Solomon did when he began worshipping Ashtoreth ( star , also known as Astarte , Chiun , Kaiwan , Remphan , and Saturn ) .
12 Solomon built altars to Star ( Astarte , aka Ashtoreth ) .
The god Saturn is associated with the Star but both Saturn and Astarte also been identified with a number of other names .
Saturn is an important key to understanding the long heritage this conspiracy has back to antiquity .
The city of Rome was originally known as Saturnia or City of Saturn .
The Roman Catholic church retains much of the Saturn worship in its ritual .
Saturn also relates to Lucifer . ’13
In various occult dictionaries Saturn is associated with evil .
Saturn was important to the religion of Mithra , and also the Druids .
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD -- connections to JWs , Mormons , and Judaism
It has been said all roads lead to Rome .
For this book , it could be said all paths of investigation lead to the Rothschilds .
Charles T. Russell , in a 1891 letter to Baron ( Lord ) Rothschild , mailed from Palestine , outlined possible courses of action that could be taken to establish the Jews in Palestine .
Russell ’s letters praised the Rothschild ’s money which established Jewish colonies in Palestine .
Russell writes Rothschild , , , What is needed here , therefore , next to water and cleanliness , is a good government which will protect the poor from the ravenous and the wealthy .
Banking institutions on sound bases , and doing business honorably , are also greatly needed " Russell continues , " May the God of Jacob direct you , my dear Sir , and all interested with you in the deliverance and prosperity of Israel , and blessed will they be who , to any extent , yield themselves as his servants in fulfilling his will as predicted . " ( 14 ) When the Mormon Church needed financing in the late 19th century , they went to Kuhn , Loeb Co.15
To explain the Rothschild ’s control of Kuhn , Loeb Co. here is some background information .
The method that the House of Rothschild used to gain influence , was the same that Royalty had used for centuries , marriage .
The Rothschild children , girls and boys , have had their spouses chosen on the basis of alliances that would benefit the House of Rothschild , but since consolidating world power they generally have married cousins these last two centuries .
’16 Jacob Schiff grew up in the house that the Rothschild ’s had at 148 Judengasse , Frankfurt .
Jacob Schiff came to the United States with Rothschild capital and took over control of a small jewish banking concern founded by two Cincinnati dry goods merchants Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb .
He even married Soloman ’s daughter .
In 1885 , Loeb retired , and Schiff ran the Kuhn , Loeb Co. for the Rothschilds until 1920 when he died .
17 During Russell ’s and Brigham Young ’s day , Lord Rothschild was considered the " lay leader of world Jewry .
" 18 Edmund Rothschild was President of the Jewish Colonization Assoc,19 which was a major Zionist group .
Amselm Rothschild indicated that his grandfather Amschel Mayer Rothschild had insisted in Clause 15 of his will to his children , " may they and their descendants remain constantly true to their ancestral Jewish faith . " ( 20 ) However , the will has been secret and there is no way of knowing what it says .
The Rothschilds have not remained true to the Orthodox faith .
If this was actually what Clause 15 said then something is amiss .
The Jewish world has showered the Rothschilds with praises , " The Rothschilds govern a Christian world .
Not a cabinet moves without their advice .
They stretch their hand , with equal ease , from Petersburg to Vienna , from Vienna to Paris , from Paris to London , from London to Washington .
Baron Rothschild , the head of the house , is the true king of Judah , the prince of the captivity , the Messiah so long looked for by this extraordinary people ... . The lion of the tribe of Judah , Baron Rothschild , possesses more real force than David - - more wisdom than Solomon . "
( 21 ) The Prieure de Sion - the Elders of Sion22 also relates to the Rothschilds who are reported to serve on a Jewish council of Elders of Sion .
23 The Rothschilds have " helped " the Jewish people the Rothschild ’s own way .
For those who admire stinginess , the Rothschilds will be greatly looked up to .
For instance , the extent of James Rothschild ’s charity in France to poor Jews was 5 francs ( the equivalent of $ 1 ) .
Their dynasty has destroyed honest Jews along with Christians .
Today , few dare criticize the Rothschilds .
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD -- connections to secret societies
The Rothschilds had played a major role in the Bavarian Illuminati , ( 25 ) and it is known that a least one of the sons of Amsel was a member .
As the reader remembers , Amsel placed his sons in the major European capitals , where they each set up the principal banking houses .
By their own secret intelligence service and their own news network they could outmanouver any European government .
( 26 ) The large amounts of voluminous correspondence by Rothschild couriers attracted attention , ( 27 ) but no one ever stopped their personal intelligence and mail services .
After the Bavarian illuminati were exposed , the central occult power over the European secret societies shifted to Carbonarism a.k.a. the Alta Vendita , ( 28 ) led by another powerful Rothschild , Karl Rothschild , 29 son of Amschel .
In 1818 , Karl participated in a secret document that was sent out to the head - quarters of Masonry from the Alta Vendita .
The Masons were quite distressed when a copy of this was lost , and offered rewards to anyone who could return the lost copy .
It was originally written in Italian .
Its title translates " Permanent Instructions , or Practical Code of Rules ; Guide for the Heads of the Highest Grades of Masonry . " ( 30 )
The Masonic reference book 10,000 Famous Freemasons , Vol. 4 , p.74 , indicates two other sons of Amschel were Masons , James Meyer Rothschild , and his brother Nathan Meyer Rothschild .
James Rothschild in Paris was a 33 degree Scottish Rite Mason , and his brother Nathan in London was a member of the Lodge of Emulation .
And Jewish Freemason Katz indicates Solomon Meir Rothschild , a third member of the five brothers , was initiated into Freemasonry on June 14 , 1809 .
( 31 ) The Rothschilds became powerful within Freemasonry .
We find the Saint - Simonians , the occult religious millenialist forerunners of communism , praising Baron de Rothschild in their magazine Le Globe , " There is no one today who better represents the triumph of equality and work in the nineteenth century than M. le Baron de Rothschild ... . Was this Jew born a millionaire ?
No , he was born poor , and if only you knew what genius , patience , and hard work were required to construct that European edifice called the House of Rothschild , you would admire rather than insult it . "
Lionel de Rothschild ( the de was added by the French Rothschilds ) was involved with the first communist Internationale .
The Mason Mazzini who helped start communism praised Rothschild , " Rothschild could be King of France if he so desired . "
32
Adoiphe Cremieux , was a French Jewish Mason ( see chap . 1.4 for his credentials ) .
The Rothschilds gave at least £ i ,000 to Cremieux to go to Damascus with Salomon Munk , and Sir Moses Montefiore to win the release of Jews imprisoned there , and to convince the Turkish Sultan to declare the charges of ritual murder false .33 According to the three Jewish authors of Dope , Inc. the B’nai B’rith was a spin-off of the Order of Zion and was organized as a , , covert intelligence front " for the House of Rothschild .
It is highly probable that the B’nai B’rith was used as a Rothschild intelligence cover .
The Rothschilds are prominent in the Bilderbergers too .
The Rothschilds were closely related to the Council of Foreign Relations ( CFR ) .
Although many people today would not view the CFR as a secret society it was originally set up as part of a secret society and it was kept secret for many years , in spite of its awesome power .
Carroll Quigley , professor of International Relations at the Jesuit Georgetown University , exposed the Round Table Group with his book Tragedy and Hope . ( 34 ) The Rothschilds supported Rhodes to form De Beers . ( 35 )
Later , Rhodes made seven wills which established a secret society modelled after the Jesuits and Masons to help bring in a One - World - Government centered upon Britain , and the Rhodes Scholarships .
36
The inner group was established in Mar. 1891 and consisted of Rhodes , Stead , Lord Esher ( Brett ) , and 33 * Mason Alfred Milner . ( 33 bb )
A secondary circle of " potential members of the Circle of Initiates " consisted of the Jew Lord Balfour , Sir Harry Johnson , Lord Rothschild , Lord Grey and others .
Initially , Lord Rothschild was part of the inner group of Rhode ’s secret society , but was replaced by his son - in - law Lord Rosebury who was n’t as conspicuous .
37 The Fabian Socialists dominated the staff at Oxford when the Rhodes Scholars began arriving .
These scholars then received indoctrination and preparation to become part of an international socialist New World Order . ( 38 )
The Round Table Group developed from the inner executive circle of Rhode ’s secret society .
The outer circle was established after the start of the 20th century .
The Round Table Group was extended after W.W. I by organizing a front organization the Royal Institute of International Affairs .
The Council of Foreign Relations was the American part of this front .
The inner circle continues to direct the outer circle and its two front organizations RIIA and CFR .
The CER in turn set up a number of fronts including the Institute of Pacific Relations ( IPR ) .
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD -- management of the Catholic and Czars ’ wealth and the capture of the Orthodox Church 's wealth .
Early in the 19th century the Pope came to the Rothschilds to borrow money .
The Rothschilds were very friendly with the Pope , causing one journalist to sarcasticly say " Rothschild has kissed the hand of the Pope ... Order has at last been re-established .
" 39 The Rothschilds in fact over time were entrusted with the bulk of the Vatican ’s wealth .
The Jewish Ency. , Vol. 2 , p.497 states , , , It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time ( 1905 ) the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure . "
Researcher Eustice Mullins writes that the Rothschilds took over all the financial operations of the worldwide Catholic Church in 1823 .
( 40 ) Today the large banking and financial business of the Catholic Church is an extensive system interlocked with the Rothschilds and the rest of the International Banking system .
The great wealth of the Russian Czars was entrusted to the Rothschilds , $ 35 million with the Rothschild ’s Bank of England , and $ 80 million in the Rothschild ’s Paris bank .
The Rothschilds financed the Russian Revolution which confiscated vast portions of the Orthodox Church ’s wealth .
They have been able to prevent ( due to their power ) the legitimate heirs of the Czars fortune to withdraw a penny of the millions deposited in a variety of their banks .
The Mountbattans , who are related to the Rothschilds , led the court battles to prevent the claimants from withdrawing any of the fortune .
In other words , the money they invested in the Russian Revolution , was not only paid back directly by the Bolshevists in millions of dollar of gold , but by grabbing the hugh deposits of the Czars ’ wealth , the Rothschilds gained what is now worth over $ 50 Billions . ( 41 )
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD -- CONTROL OVER SATANISM & WITCHCRAFT
Chapter 2.11 gives the names of a Witchcraft Council of 13 which is under Rothschild control and in turn issue orders to various groups .
One of the purest form of Satanism can be traced to the Jewish Sabbatain sect and its Frankist spin - off .
The leaders of this up to the Rothschilds were :
Sabbatai Zevi ( 1626 -1676 )
Nathan of Gaza ( 16 ??-?)
Jacob Frank ( 1726-1791 )
Rothschilds
Three connections between Satanism , evil , and money
Money naturally attracts itself to evil .
For instance , if a woman prostitutes herself she may receive a great sum of money , but who will pay her for keeping her virginity or her dignity ?
If you are a hit man a large amount of money is yours if you kill your target , who will pay you if you would miss your target ?
Second , evil men believe in where there is a will there is a way , and they are willing to sell their souls for their God money .
They will employ evil to gain money .
While most people are quite aware of these last two connections , a third may likely have escaped their attention .
Thirdly , the principle group of men who cranked up International Banking were Satanists from the beginning .
These Satanists now are the ones who run the Federal Reserve and are responsible for the creation of U.S. Federal Reserve notes .
Just having total control over the supply of U.S. paper money almost gives them leverage over the world ’s finances , without mentioning they control the world bank .
It is no accident then , that once they established world financial control , they would do all in their power to divide and conquer and destroy both the Christian and the Moslem faith in God .
These powerful Bankers relate to faith in God as Cain related to his brother Abel .
That they may be related to the Jewish people , does not mean they have the Jewish people ’s best interest at heart .
Initially Sabbatai Zevi was rejected by many Jews .
His sect gained momentum in second half of the seventeenth century in southeastern Poland .
( 42 ) In 1759 - 60 , 500 Jewish Sabbateans , , converted " to Christianity .43
In 1715 , 109 of the 415 Jewish families in Frankfurt were engaged in money lending .
The rest were merchants of various kinds .
The concepts that Satanism holds to were a natural shoe in to justify for many of these Jewish bankers the type of behavior they were engaged in . " ( 44 )
LONG - STORY SHORT
Many divisions and battles between religious elements in the world have been encouraged and supported by the Power ’s wealth .
Unfortunately , many have been fooled into thinking that being devout and faithful to God is the source of religious fighting .
In some areas of the world , Moslems , Christians , and others have gotten along fine for centuries .
Religious tensions do spring to some degree from within the religions themselves , but the fuel to keep those fires burning and to light up conflicts often come from the Power ’s wealth .
An obvious example is the Iran - Iraq war .
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD -- CONTROL OVER W.W. I TREATY
When Germany fell , not only did Rothschild agents draft the treaty , prepare the idea of the League of Nations , but Max Rothschild was one of 11 men who took control over Bavaria .
Max Rothschild was a Freemason in Lodge No. 11 , Munich , Germany .
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD -- connections to MI5 , Rockefellers , J.P. Morgan , CFR , et. al .
Victor Rothschild , who worked for J.P. Morgan & Co. , and was an important part of MI5 ( British Intelligence ) .
Victor Rothschild was also a communist and member of the Apostles Club at Cambridge .45 Lord Rothschild was one of the original members of Rhode ’s Round Table group which developed into the CFR .
It was the Rothschilds who had financed Cecil Rhodes , beginning in Africa .
The Rothschilds ’ have several agents which their money got started and who still serve them well , the Morgans and the Rockefellers .
The Rockefellers were Marrano Jews .
The original Rockefeller made his money selling narcotics , ( they were n’t illegal then ) .
After acquiring a little capital he branched out in oil .
But it was the Rothschild capital that made the Rockefeller ’s so powerful .
" They also financed the activities of Edward Harriman ( railroads ) and Andrew Carnegie Steel . " ( 46 )
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD -- Power within Christendom
The Rothschilds also wielded much influence and power not only in Secret Societies , but also in Christendom ’s churches .
The Salvation Army under the suggestion of the Rothschilds adopted the Red Shield ( Roth - red Schild - shield ) for their logo .
One history of the Rothschilds remarks , " The Rothschilds had rapidly propelled themselves into a position of immense financial power and political influence .
They were an independent force in the life of Europe , accountable to no one and , to a large extent , reliant on no one .
Popular lampoons depicted them as the real rulers of Christendom ... " ( 47 )
Some of the Rothschilds have been involved in the campaign to loosen public morals .
The first executive Secretary of the National Student Forum was John Rothschild .
This National Student Forum changed its name like articles of clothing .
Speaking about clothing , one of the aims of this Socialist group was to promote public nudity , and free love .
This organization had the following constituent groups Radcliffe Liberal Club , Union Theological Seminary Contemporary Club , Yale Liberal Club " ( 48 ) to name just a few .
A further development of this was the Youth Peace Federation which consisted of the League of Youth of Community Church , Methodist Epworth League , NY District , Young Judea , and Young People ’s Fellowship of St. Phillip ’s Parish49 to name a few .
American religious men have ties to the Rothschilds especially through their various agents .
Harry Emerson Fosdick , who was Pastor of Rockefeller ’s church was also among the Presidents of the Rockefeller Foundation .
John Foster Dulles , CFR , was chairman of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation , and married a Rockefeller , Janet Pomeroy Avery .
Remember John Foster Dulles was an important Federal Council of Churches of Christ official .
( See chap . 2.9 ) Every road leads back to the Rothschilds .
There are more items than what have been mentioned above linking the Rothschilds to the various tenticles .
Each of the various tenticles that conspiracy theorists have put forth , -- the Jews , the Masons , the Intelligence Communities , the International Bankers , the Prieure de Sion , the Catholics , the Trilateral commission , the CFR , the New Age , the Cults -- each ties back to the Rothschild ’s power .
EXTENT OF ROTHSCHILD POWER
According to one source " it was estimated that they controlled half the wealth of the world . " ( 50 ) The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was controlled by five banks which owned 53 % of its stock .
These five banks were controlled by Nathan M. Rothschild & Sons of London .
Control over the U.S.
Fed is basically control over the world ’s money .
That fact alone shows how immense the Rothschild Power is .
If one examines who has been appointed to head the Fed , and to run it , the connections of the " Federal " Reserve System to the Rothschilds can further be seen .
Another private enterprise using the name Federal that the Rothschilds also direct is Federal Express .
Any one else might be taken to court for making their businesses sound like their are government , not the Rothschilds .
It is appropriate for them to appropriate the name of Federal , because by way of MI6 via the CIA they instruct the U.S. government .
Senators are bought and paid off by their system , as investigators of the BCCI are discovering .
The Rothschilds have been intimately involved in witchcraft and the Illuminati since its early known history .
The Kaiser of Germany seems to refer to them when he said , " the magic powers of money as wielded by the Lord of Lucre are powers of Black Magic at its blackest .
"
51
If only half of the wealth is controlled by the Rothschilds , it indicates that if they are to be part of the world ’s rulership , they must have allies .
ALLIES
The Rothschilds and Rockefellers are only two of thirteen controlling families of the Illuminati .
( 52 ) Two Jewish families that appear to be prominent are the Oppenheims and the Oppenheimers .
A. Oppenheim was situated in Cologne .
The Oppenheimers were early members of the Bavarian Illuminati .
The Bund der Gerechten ( League of the Just ) was an illuminati front run mainly by Jews who were Satanists .
This Bund financed in part by the Rothschilds paid the Satanist and Mason Karl Marx to write the Communist Manefesto .
The Jew Gumpel Oppenheim was in the inner circle of the Bund .
His relative Heinrich Oppenheim masterminded the communist revolution of 1848 in Germany .
The Communist Party ’s official histories even accept the Bund as the predecessor of Communism .
The Oppenheimers apparently are close to the Rothschilds .
J. Robert Oppenheimer of the CFR was exposed as a communist .
Harry Oppenheimer , an international banker , is chairman of the Jewish De Beers world - wide diamond monopoly , and chairman of the Anglo - American Corp .
Oppenheimers can be found in important financial positions in the U.S.
They help run around 10 large foundations , including the Oppenheimer Haas Trust of NY for the care of needy Jewish children .
The Jewish Ency .
Vol. 2 , p. 496 indicates other Jewish families " adopted the Rothschild plan . "
These were the Lazards , Sterns , Speyers , and Seligmans .
The Rothschild plan was to place family members in the 5 largest European capitals to coordinate their activities .
One of Germany ’s largest magazines is the Stern , and Ernst Stern is second - in - command of the World Bank . " ( 53 ) The Jewish families that established the Frankfurt Judenloge ( this was the Masonic lodge the Rothschilds belonged to in Frankfurt ) included the Adlers , Speyers , Reisses , Sichels , Ellisons , Hanaus , Geisenheimers , and Goldschmidts .
Isaac Hildesheim , a Jew who changed his name to Justus Hiller is credited as being the founder of this Frankfurt lodge .
Michael Hess , principal of the Reformed Jewish school Philanthropin was an important figure in the lodge too , as was Dr. Ludwig Baruch ( later Borne ) who joined in 1808 .
Most of these Frankfurt Jewish Freemasons engaged in commerce .
( 54 ) Those Freemasons from 1817 - 1842 were the leaders of the Frankfurt Jewish community .55 A gentile Mason in Frankfurt Johann Christian Ehrmann began warning the German people that the Frankfurt Jewish Masons wanted a world republic based on humanism .
In 1816 he came out with a warning pamphlet Das Judenthum in der M[ aurere ]y ( The Jews in Masonry ) .
A powerful ally of the world ’s jewry can be seen beginning with men like Oliver Cromwell , who was considered a Mason .
Cromwell was financed by Jews , and helped the Jews gain power in England .
Cromwell was willing to go along with the Jews , because he became convinced of British Israelism .
Since the core of the conspiracy of power is Jewish , the attitude of those allied with it hinges on their attitude toward the Jewish people .
The religious idea that the British people are descended from the tribes of Israel does n’t automatically place people into the camp of the conspiracy .
Some of the British - Israelites realize that the so called Jewish people in general have no claim over the promises of God .
For that reason , they realize that it is not the Christian duty to bow and scrape at their every move .
When Christians can be arrested in Israel and abused , and Christians will not even stand up for their own kind , we can see how much hold the idea of the " Chosen Race " theory has over Christendom .
Some of the British Israelites such as the Mormons , the old New England wealthy families such as make up the Order , some Masons and New Agers , and the non-Jewish members of the Priuere de Sion are collaborating with the One - World - Power .
The anglican church which is run by the Freemasons is strongly British Israelistic .
SORTING OUT THE VARIOUS IDENTITY GROUPS
In contrast , a hodge - podge of groups which are opposed to the conspiracy like some Neo - Nazi groups , and various Churches unrelated with them are also believers in British Israelism .
These various groups are sometimes all lumped together as the " Identity " movement , which is misleading because of their vast differences .
It is important to differentiate between those groups that are trying to approach things from a Christian perspective and place themselves under the authority of God , and those who are setting themselves up under the New Order ’s authority , or under their own authority .
CO - MASTERS OF THE WORLD - The Media
Eustice Mullins has published his research in his book Who Owns the TV Networks showing that the Rothschilds have control of all three U.S. Networks , plus other aspects of the recording and mass media industry .
It can be added that they control Reuters too .
From other sources it appears CNN , which began as an independent challenge to the Jewish Network monopoly , ran into repeated trickery , and ended up part of the system .
Money from B.C.C.I. , ( B.C.C.I. has been one of the New World Orders financial systems for doing its dirty business such as controlling Congressmen , and is involved with INSLA , the Iran - Contra Scandal ,
Centrust , and other recent scandals ) which has tainted so many aspects of public power in the U.S. has also been behind CNN .
Perhaps nothing dominates the life of some Americans as does the television .
Americans sit themselves before the television set and simply absorb what it projects to them .
On a day to day basis the biggest way the Rothschilds touch the lives of Americans are the three major networks which are under Rothschild direction .
To illustrate this we will examine who run the networks .
This list is not current , and no attempt was to provide that .
The length of writing a book insures that some material will be dated anyway .

THE ROTHSCHILD’S HISTORY BY A JEWISH WRITER RELATED TO THE ROTHSCHILDS
Jewish writer Anka Muhlstcin wrote a book Baron James The Rise of the French Rothschilds .
I prefer paraphrase and make short quotes from her book , because I am trying to document for the reader the mindset and history of thc Rothschilds .
Anka Muhlstein has nothing against the Rothschilds , so it will be easier for the reader to accept what shc says about them than from me .
I ca n’t require the reader to read her book , but I can try to summarize some of the appropriate thoughts .
Other books also relate many of the things Anka does , but again if I write a footnoted article , it will not carry the weight as my paraphrase will .
The reader is recommended to read the book first hand if he has the time and is interested in the details of James ’ life .
The Jews in the 18th century were restricted to living in Ghettos .
Mayer Amschel Rothschild lived in the Frankfurt ghetto . ( p.22 )
The Jews were repressed by outsiders .
( p.23 ) They lived in geographically isolated and self - contained communities ( p. 24 ) .
The Jewish communities in Europe used a secret relay system between all the Ghettoes .
Hebrew characters were one effective code .
( p.24 ) Because of the persecution and repression , the Jewish communities were very tight - knit and highly organized .
( p.23 ) They were deeply hostile to the Christian people .
Christians had restricted their own people from money - lending with interest , so lending money on interest had become a Jewish enterprise .
The German princes of Thurn and Taxis in the 16th century initiated a postal service .
Mayer Amschel loaned them money .
( p.21 ) " Certainly they [ the Rothschilds ] discovered the latitude that the Thurn and Taxis allowed themselves in unsealing letters , possibly divulging their contents , and according to their own interests , delaying or accelerating delivery . " ( p.22 ) When it profited Mayer Amschel , he would hire Christians , but in general his business and banking were conducted by his close knit family .
For instance Mayer Amschel hired a young Christian woman to write his letters for him .
( p. 25 ) Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his family were wholeheartedly Jewish . ( p.27 )
Mayer Amschel Rothschild picked his sons ’ wife 's for the business gains the wives would bring the family .
The oldest son was not happy with this ( actually he was bitter because he was denied marriage to the woman he loved ) , but he complied with his father ’s choice .
( p.26 ) Amschel ’s daughters all married bankers -- in Worms , Sichel , and Beyfus . ( p.26 ) Mayer had ten children and they were all employed in the family business .
( p.25 ) The Jews were taught from childhood up , that the Christians were to blame for all their woes , and that the Christians were to be feared and detested .
( p.24 ) Mayer Amschel had secret , underground passages .
( p.22 ) His carriage was honey - combed with secret drawers .
( p.27 ) The Napoleonic War greatly helped the Rothschild business .
( p. 27 ) Rothschild even outsmarted Napoleon - - because the Rothschilds had such good connections .
( p.38 ) The Rothschilds smuggled during the English blocade of Napoleon ’s Europe , and made millions . ( p.33 )
" The Rothschilds changed course constantly during this period , always maneuvering to avoid any kind of political commitment . " ( p.34 )
One of the things Mayer Amschel set up , was to disperse his 5 sons to the major capitals of Europe .
Anka attributes the respectability of Jewish money lending to the help it gave merchants and entrepreneurs .
[ See chap .
3.2 - this Author ’s view is that merchants had been borrowing for centuries prior to interest taking becoming acceptable by society in the 19th century .
It was greatly in part due to who owned and controlled the major newspapers in the 19th century -- Jews and Masons - - that led the public to change . ]
" The obligation to reimburse a loan and to pay interest became less onerous to men whose affairs had flourished as a result of the borrowed money .
The Jewish lender ceased to be a bloodsucker ; often , indeed , he became an associate of the borrower . " ( p.31 ) [ The Bible says a borrower is a slave to the lender , hardly an association to be desired . ]
The business of financing Monarchs was lucrative .
The Rothschilds had developed several traits in the ghetto that made their family hard to stop .
" The great gift the Frankfurt ghetto bestowed upon him [ James Rothschild ] was adaptibility , a quality matched by the driving force of his ambition , his prodigious energy , tremendous powers of concentration , and determination to get even [ with Christians ] .
James set out to make his place in the world . " ( p.40 ) The five Rothschild brothers , each in the five major European capitals set up their own private courier system which was faster than the regular mail .
( p.47 ) The Rothschilds had news whether political or economic faster than anyone else including the monarchs .
" Thus the Rothschilds had news before anyone else , including ministers [ govt . ] ; they also understood how to make use of it . " ( p.47 ) [ Somewhat akin to how money could be made off of knowing the future . ]
The Rothschilds nomal correspondence to each other was in code .( p.46 )
Their world was one of finance , politics and secrecy .
In the anti-Napoleonic time period , the Rothschilds increased their wealth ten - fold . ( p.47 ) " ... James .
He enjoyed , moreover , a rock - solid strength and stability , built up by his family , that family simultaneously closed tight like a fist , united by mutual confidence and an invisible wall of secrecy , yet wide open to the outside world .
Such was the cohesion of the Rothschilds that the removal of one or more of them left no gap in their common defenses . "
The Rothschilds carried out espionage with their own intelligence service , and other questionable subversive activities but none of these could be tracked .
" Whenever Mayer Amschel and his sons were on the verge of being caught out , some highly placed person stepped in and stopped the investigation . " ( p.36 )
The made their money doing technically illegal activity .
The original large sum of money made was to take the Elector of Hesse ’s large sum and instead of investing it into government bonds as directed -- to put it to use at investments of higher returns , and giving the elector the return from the government bonds .
Anka writes , " The Elector was never the wiser , but even if he had been , he could hardly have complained of disobedience . " ( p.34 ) In summary , the Mafia - like closeness of the Rothschild family , along with their tactic to situate themselves in all the major capitals , along with their own quick secret personal news / intelligence / mail service gave them the contacts and the power to manipulate all kinds of business opportunities .

WHERE DOES NAZISM FIT INTO SATAN’S PLANS ?
Let me briefly recap what some of the plan was .
And while you read these plans that I am relaying to you from my intensive research on high level Satanism , see if you do n’t see the irony in the Satanic plans .
How very ironic it is that in all the twisted thinking and reasoning of the leading Satanists for why they must do things , it is surprising they do not catch on that this plan of Satan ’s is going to achieve God ’s revealed plan .
How pride does blind us !
( For the sake of brevity I will dispense with my normal method of documenting everything ; I suggest that my book Be Wise As Serpents be read for documentation , and further questions be written to me .
Otherwise this article would be way to bulky for the newsletter . )
The " brilliant " plan given in detail to the Illuminati was to create a thesis and its opposite called the antithesis .
The process would repeat itself until the desired outcome .
Out of the battle between the two would emerge the synthesis .
Out of the battle of chaos would come a new order reminding us of the Masonic slogan " Order out of Chaos . "
If the thesis were like a hammer and the antithesis like an anvil , what was caught in between would be broken or reshaped .
Three world wars would enable the plan to work .
The hammer would be constructed and then given a homeland , a secure base in Russia .
It is what we call communism .
The first anvil would be created out of economic chaos in Germany .
It would be called National Socialism .
That anvil would be destroyed in a Second World War , but another anvil would replace it called democracy .
The first two world wars accomplished exactly what they were intended to accomplish .
Out of the first world war came :
(1) A secure Satanic dictatorship in Russia , a secure base to carry out further world subversion .
( 2 ) The Satanic family of Rothschilds gained partial control over Palestine , preparing the way for Satan to rule from Jerusalem some day ( 3 ) Weapons of mass destruction and terror .
( 4 ) The League of Nations .
Out of the second world war came
(1) The enlargement of their secure base in Russia into a world power .
( 2 ) complete control over Palestine by the Rothschilds .
( 3 ) airpower , including long range missiles , jets , secret flying saucers , and powerful submarines , all items that individuals could not produce .
Those in control of production would therefore control all air and sea ways of the earth .
( 4 ) The cold war and an era of terror to convince the people of the need for Satan ’s One World Order .
( 5 ) the United Nations .
Out of the third world war would emerge a new religious system .
The third world war would have to be tailored to be like the Bible ’s Armageddon , Satan told his highest slaves , because - if it resembled Armageddon , then the people would believe he was the Messiah when he came after its end .
It would have to be terrible , so that he could step in and bring miraculous order out of a world beaten into chaos by the worst war in history .
Again it would be " Order out of chaos " , as the Masonic documents repeatedly proclaim .
The third world war would come during a period of seven years of tribulation starting in 1992 and running until 1999 .
Just like the Second World War emerged out of the great world - wide depression .
Satan told his followers this 1992 - 99 tribulation would repeat on a larger scale the plagues of Egypt , for he would wreck revenge for what was done to Egypt by God ( and Moses ) by giving back in a bigger way to the world what happened to ancient Egypt .
To a demonic controlled mind it makes sense to wreck such revenge , especially when the end result is held out to be the salvation of the world by the Lightbearer , the Morning Star , also known as Lucifer .
For most of us , the idea of such pain and destruction seems like demonic madness - - which it is .
At the core of the One - World - System is Satanism .
It hides itself behind fronts such as Jewish Finance , Socialism , Aryanism , British Israelism , Zionism , and Freemasonry which are tools to get the broad masses to serve the Plan .
The " conspiracy " to create the One - World - System has enlisted the help of almost everyone .
That is because most of the religious systems at the top are controlled by Satanists who know what they are doing and direct the people ’s religious efforts .
( Read the research in Be Wise As Serpents for the documentation on this . )
Nazism was a Pagan Gnostic religious system whose High Priest Hitler knew what he was doing in relation to Satan ’s mission .
( More about this further down . )
The Jewish people ( 1 use the term in its broadest sense ) are being used .
Actually the allegiance of the Satanic hierarchy is not in the least concerned with Judaism , although it appears that at first the plans are to create a religious leader that will have the apparent credentials of the Jewish messiah .
How sad , because the actions of the Rothschilds and other Satanic " Jewish " bloodlines during W.W. II show that their first allegiance is not to the Old Testament and not to even Orthodox Judaism , but is purely to Satan .
At some point in the future the Orthodox Jews and the Conservative Jews will find that this Messiah , who is already alive waiting to play his role , will only give them temporary relief .
They are being taken for a ride and then they will be dumped by the New World Order ’s dictatorship .
Constance Cumbey correctly notices that the New Age movement resembles Nazism exactly to a T .
For those students wanting to get a detail by detail parallel go to pages 114 to 120 in The Hidden Dangers Of The Rainbow .
In 1952 , James Larratt Battersby in England published The Holy Book of Adolf Hitler for the German World Church in Europe .
Except for some of his pro-German ideas , obviously thrown in to make the book enlist the intended audience ’s favor , the book is an exact description of what would happen in the next 50 years to bring in the New World Order .
The reason some of the prognostications of pro-German ideas are not valid is that the Satanic hierarchy is not really concerned for the German people either , except to harness their help in their plans .
Batterby ’s Holy Book of Adolf Hitler was given to him " in the spirit " .
According to Battersby the book was written in order that " May God open the eyes of the Gentiles to Truth , and carry his Holy Gospel to the ends of the earth " .
The book is an excellent synopsis of what Satan had planned in 1952 and has carried out since to a large degree .
The Rothschilds ( and other top Satanic families in a lesser way ) financed a jewish Mason and devote Satanist named Karl Marx to write his Das Kapital .
The Satanists controlling key Masonic groups ( along with some other groups they controlled ) got Communism started .
The original idea came from Satan , and was given at a Feast of the Beast in meticulous detail to those highest in the Satanic Hierarchy .
Albert Pike , and Guiseppe Mazzini were two men in strategic positions of control that were let in on the plans .
After creating International Socialism ( communism ) a temporary antithesis was created called National Socialism ( Nazism ) .
The process to create National Socialism was to turn again to the Masonic Lodges and other esoteric secret Societies to get it done .
Therefore , the secret esoteric gnostic and satanic societies along with the Illuminati helped create " the Thule Gesellshaft " ( in English the Thule Society ) .
Adolf Hitler was some type of member of this occult Thule Society , along with many other men who later began leading Nazi leaders such as Rudolf Hess .
The Thule Society used the Masonic / Hindu symbol the Swastika , which the Nazi party then also used as its symbol .
In other words the grandmother of the Nazi Party was the Masonic Lodges in Germany .
The Vril was another secret occult group that many of the Nazi leadership belonged to .
Hitler also was a member of the Theosophical Society , which has strong Satanic and Masonic ties .
Both Bailey and Hitler studied from Tibetians , Hindus , occultists , and black magicians .
They also both studied the Gnostics , and every major Pagan / Occult religious system .
A example of how valued the Swastika was for Freemasons before Hitler ruined its image , is a quote from Joseph Fort Newton , a Baptist Minister and high ranking Mason , " The second of these volumes also contains an essay .
. . by Thomas Carr , with a list of Lodges , and a study of their history , customs , and emblems - -especially the Swastika .
Speculative Masons are now said to be joining .. , seeking more light on what are called the Lost Symbols of Masonry . "
After promoting and using the Swastika for years the Freemasons quit using it after Hitler .
The Holy Book of Hitler provides the answer as to why the Theosophical Society worked so hard to destroy the British Empire .
It had always at first mystified me why the Theosophical Society Presidents who connected to the Satanic hierarchy would want to ruin the British Empire .
The reason it seemed strange is that the mother country of Satanism and Witchcraft is Great Britain .
The center of secret political power is geographically in England .
And further , one of the largest and most powerful secret fronts for Satanism is Britism - Israelism .
The reason why the British Empire was destroyed was that Satan had already determined even before 1870 that the steps to world government would include setting up around 9 or 10 Continental blocs .
The Union of Europe into one country ( or bloc ) could not be accomplished while Great Britain had most of her focus on her empire .
Great Britain as long as she had an empire would never want to join up with Europe .
In fact all the European nations would have to be convinced to give up their colonies , that is why the World Power got everyone they could get to help fight Portugal in Angola in recent history , everyone including the large masonic - controlled Christian denominations who donated millions of dollars to the NCC and WCC which moneys were then passed on to the guerillas to buy weapons and ammo .
The Theosophical Society is mostly to blame for India ’s independence from Britain .
First , the Theosophical Society managed to change British policy so that the British became unpopular .
Then Theosophical President Besant , who published the largest English paper strongly criticized British rule in her newspapers and eventually was arrested .
Gandhi and other Indian leaders were involved in Besant being made the President of the Indian Congress Party .
And that political party still rules Indian politics .
The Theosophist Mahatma Gandhi , following in the steps of Theosophical President Annie Besant , led the Indian people against British rule .
But the final blow to the British Empire was done by another Theosophist -- Adolf Hitler .
It is common knowledge that the powerful blows of Axis attacks in W.W. II struck the death blow to the British Empire , or so we are told .
The truth is that the elite wanted the Empire to die , and pulled every string to convince the British public and indigenous natives that the Empire was too weak after W .
W .
II to save the empire and prevent her colonies from independence .
It is hard for people to grasp that the Illuminati controlled Russia , Great Britain , Germany and France during World War II , but they did .
Churchill , Roosevelt , and Stalin were all Masons .
DeGaulle of France was closely linked with several esoteric groups , and the Priere de Sion and Grand Orient Masons helped him to power in the 50s .
Churchill was a Zionist and pro-Fabian Socialist .
Stalin was a closet Satanist .
Roosevelt was a Zionist , pro-communist and socialist .
Both Churchill and Roosevelt came from important elite blood lines .
Apparently , Stalin was somewhat independent , but basically did what was expected of him .
As the previous paragraph indicates the people of the world were n’t ready for a world government , and most not even a united Europe .
W.W. II was carried out to adjust people ’s thinking toward wanting European unity .
Satan already ruled the world through his secret chain of command , but he wanted to openly rule the world ’s hearts and to be publicly hailed as ruler and savior .
Who was Hitler ?
Hitler ’s father was the offspring of the Rothschild ’s secret breeding program which impregnated his grandmother .
It appears from the details available , Hitler was groomed for his role , without realizing his heritage at first .
It appears that Hitler learned of his " Jewish bloodline " after taking over Germany .
Hitler had romances with many beautiful women .
Although Hitler was very strict with his New Age religious practices such as being a vegetarian , that did not include being celebrate .
He did have sex contrary to the deceptions of the Establishment .
Hitler ’s seed ( the Rothschild ’s powerful generational occult bloodline ) was hidden in an Askenazim bloodline , at least part of which has come to the U.S.
In fact , Hitler ’s generational occult power was passed on too .
This was most likely done by thrusting a knife into his heart , and the person who received his occult power then gulped his last breath with the kiss of death to receive his occult power .
What I am telling you is that Hitler ’s offspring are alive and well and that his terrifying Anti-Christ spirit was passed to someone and is not dead .
Let me remind you of some of Hitler ’s own prophecies about himself and his goals .
" At the time of supreme peril I must die a martyr ’s death for the people .
But after my death will come something really great , an overwhelming revelation to the world of my mission . "
The world was to witness his divinity .
Further , " My spirit will rise from the grave , and the world will see that I was right . "
Von Ribbentrop on Apr. 30 , 1945 was told this same thing , " You will see that my spirit will rise from the grave .
" National Socialism " is even more than a religion ; it is the will to make mankind anew . "
" All creative energy will pass to the new man . "
Hitler claimed to be the real fulfillment of Marx ’s socialism .
" I am not only the conqueror , but also the executor of Marxism , of that part of it which is essential and justified , stripped of its Jewish - Talmudic dogma . "
In essence , he is saying whatever veneer of Jewishness that Marx ’s satanic plan had , he disagreed with it and would destroy that veneer .
These type of statements reveal that the essence of the message of various elite men like Hitler is the same Satanic plan if stripped of their variously decorated veneers .
Hitler is viewed as the Messiah , the Holy Spirit , the martyred Savior of his people by his followers today .
The blasphemous Holy Book of Adolf Hitler states , " All hail to God ’s Christ and Chosen , Adolf Hitler ... Lord of Lords , and King of Kings , the Eternal Adolf Hitler . "
Such blasphemy .
Father forgive them for they know not what they do .
Hitler ’s Demonic Spirit and Hitler ’s descendents both live on today .
( By the way , some Rothschild descendents such as Hitler ’s have come to Christ as their Lord and Savior ! )
Will this powerful occult branch of the Rothschild ’s be used again by the New World Order ?
Whatever the case it is clear that Hitler ’s Anti-Christ spirit will get plenty of demonic help .
The demonic forces that have manifested themselves in National Socialism and International Socialism ( aka Communism ) demonized much of Europe .
So much so that Europe officially portrays itself as a beast with Venus on it on a stamp commemorating the Second election of the European Parliament , and also as the same forces that tried to build the Tower of Babel on an official poster .
Not only are the same demons that led communist leaders and Nazi leaders operating in Europe ’s leaders , but there are armies of demons trampling over anything of moral value in Europe .
It can be said without a doubt that the , , man " who rules the One - World - Government will derive his power from a demonic supernatural source .
According to Revelations ,
God is going to have an angel open up a key to the abyss and teeming hordes of demonic spirits shall be descending upon the earth .
My conclusion is that Satan has so many Anti-Christs available that Hitler ’s personal occult power is not necessary for the New World Order ’s success .
I rarely like to comment on the end times from Scriptures because I feel like most people are thoroughly confused about the clear teachings that the Scriptures give .
2 Thes . 2:3 and other Scriptures make it clear that the Christians must witness a great apostasy and the Anti-Christ being revealed before Christ returns .
We can live everyday as if it may be our last , but Scriptures are clear that the Apostles did not live each day as if Jesus could return that day .
They knew that certain things had to happen first .
The church has been going through tribulations since Pentecost .
The church will go through the " great tribulation " according to the Word of God .
We will if we are that faithful remnant we will be spared from the Wrath of God , but we will not be spared from the tribulation of Satan which shall include martyrdom .
The New Age leaders are fully ready to cooperate with this " cleansing " from the earth of us bothersome disciples of Truth .
In this respect , their thinking will resemble the Nazi ’s rationalizations that people must pay their Karmic debt , and shall benefit from being killed .
How truth can be stood on its head !
The Plans are already drawn up how to use rail lines to move large groups of civilians to labor camps .
When we compare Nazi Germany with today ’s New World Order plans , Nazi Germany can be seen to be the basic model of what Satan ’s timetable includes for us these next few years .
To illustrate that the Pagan religion of Nazism is an example to the Satanists and New Agers , let us ponder Anton LaVey ’s ( head of a visible Church of Satan ) trip to the sacred initiation castle of Hitler ’s Black Order the SS .
The SS apparently brought the Holy Grail to Germany , and hid it before the end of the war .
On May 2 , 1945 , a select group of SS officers , those initiated into the higher mysteries of the Nazi Pagan religion , hid the Grail in the Schleigeiss glacier at the foot of 3,000 meter high Hochfeiler mountain .
Seekers in the area have been found decapitated , and mutilated .
The area is still guarded by the Black Order in anticipation of the day that the Grail can be revealed to the world .
It has been speculated 1995 might be the date , but this is pure speculation .
The important thing for us is to begin to experience the Kingdom of God right now .
Let us prepare ourselves for Almighty God ’s New World Order as the Satanists launch their counterfeit New World Order .
THE ROTHSCHILDS
A CONTINUATION OF ARTICLES ON THE TOP 13 ILLUMINATI FAMILIES
INTRODUCTION
by Fritz Springmeier
The Rothschilds are one of the most well - known of the thirteen families .
David J. Smith of Portland was asked to prepare an article on the Rothschilds for this newsletter .
His article follows this introduction .
Satan ’s selective breeding program has been continuing down through the ages hidden from the eyes of the public .
One of the most powerful Rothschild bloodline families in America are the Springs .
The Springs were originally the Springsteins when they came to America in the mid-I 1700s and settled in NY and NJ .
They later changed their name from Springstein to Springs to hide their identity .
Leroy Springs was hired by LC .
Payseur .
Now most American ’s have to ask , who is L.C. Payseur ?
One of the most secret and most powerful families in North America has been the Payseurs .
They have been so powerful that they could hide their wealth and power , and use other Satanic families as proxies .
The Payseurs are part of the 13 top Illuminati family .
The first Payseur to come to America was the former crown prince of France Daniel Payseur ( 1785 -1860 ) .
He came over about 1805 to the U.S. and married Susannah Kiser c. 1814 .
They had two boys Adam and Jonas ( 1819 - 1 884 ) .
Jonas married Harrietta Smith and they had Lewis Cass Payseur ( 1850 - 1939 ) .
It was this Lewis Cass Payseur who hired the Rothschild bloodline of the Springs to run a number of the Payseur ’s companies .
The Payseurs were one of the original big railroad families along with Issac Croom and William H. Beatty .
Isaac Croom ’s wife was a sister of William Beatty ’s , so the reader can see how all these elite bloodlines intertwine .
Remember that LC .
Payseur hired Leroy Springs to operate a host of his companies .
Leroy Springs father was A.A. Springs and A.A. Springs was the secret father of Abraham Lincoln .
In 1808 , Nancy Hanks , of the lineage of the McAdden Scottish family visited some of her famIly at Lincolnton , N.C. Nancy Hawks visited the Springs family and that is when A.A. Springs impregnated her , and her child when born was named Abraham Lincoln .
Abraham Lincoln ’s Rothschild blood was kept very secret , but he did grow up to be a famous lawyer , a secret leader of the Rosicrucians , and President of the United States .
It is believed from the evidence that the establishment conspiracy concocted the person of Thomas Lincoln out of thin air .
The actual early history of Abraham Lincoln is shrouded in myth and mystery , and as one encyclopedia puts it , " We know little about the family of his mother , Nancy Hanks Lincoln . "
While a lawyer , Abraham Lincoln had a sexual liaison with Elizabeth who was the illegitimate daughter of German King Leopold , who is also of elite blood lineage .
Abraham Lincoln and Elizabeth had two twin daughters Ella and Emily in 1856 who were adopted out .
Lincoln in fact had a fairly large number of illegitimate children .
Now A. A. Springs , who was both the biological father of Leroy Springs and Abraham Lincoln left an enormous amount of land in what is now Huntsville , AL to his son Abraham Lincoln .
Huntsville , AL by the way has become a hotbed of NWO activity .
Some of the mind - control research the intelligence community has been conducting has been done at Huntsville .
The Rothschilds even named one of their boys after Abraham Lincoln , his name was Lincoln Rothschild .
Although Abraham Lincoln secretly had powerful occult blood , he was a great man in his own right .
And just like JFK , he had the strength of personality to refuse to bow to the Illuminati ’s instructions .
Lincoln refused to go the path that his distant European International Banking Rothschild relatives wanted for the United States .
The Illuminati goal had been to split the U.S. into two easier to control nations .
And just as with JFK , who also came from a top 13 family , a large scale conspiracy Involving many government officials including the Secretary of Defense was put into place to assassinate Lincoln .
There are numerous indications that show that the Rothschilds were in part behind the assassination of Lincoln .
Some of the men who worked for the Payseurs of the 13th top family were Andrew Carnegie , J.P. Morgan , the Vanderbilts , Giftord Pinnchot , and John D Rockefeller .
These men were selected to run Payseur companies because they belonged to the satanic elite .
The Leroy Springs family got Payseur family companies in the early 1920s .
It was Leroy that managed to get the Rothschild ’s involved with the Federal Reserve .
Two companies that have come out of the Payseur ’s old Lancaster Manufacturing Co. ins Weyerhaeuser and Crown - Zellerbach .
I have long know these were companies tied to the elite , but it was n’t until i found the secret Payseur family at the very top of these companies that I really understood the full story .
The Payseurs have gone to extreme lengths to corrupt government documents , such as courthouse records .
They have hidden the births of many of their descendants , and have covered over with extreme secrecy most of their monetary holdings .
Remember the Beatty family was an early railroad family with business ties to the Payseur family .
Bartholomew F. Moore , who was the private attorney for years to President Abraham Lincoln , was a blood relative of the Beatty family .
It was Bart Fingers Moore who co-authored the 14th amendment for the conspiracy .
The Beatty family continually resurfaces when doing research on the conspiracy .
Shirley MacLaine , the famous New Age leader / author is from the Beatty family .
She credits her start to Edgar Cayce by the way , who in turn was interested in Blavatsky .
Blavatsky was a student of the Mason Anton Mesmer , who introduced the world to hypnotism .
Hypnotism had been secretly practiced by the Mystery Religions for thousands of years before Mesmer taught Blavatsky and others about it .
Charles Beatty Alexander , who is an Illuminati " prince " / Pilgrim Society member is an example of a Beatty in recent times who was within the elite .
Quantrill , who was a famous Confederate colonel and guerilla leader , whose band of raiders evolved into the Jessie James gang was married into the Springs ( Rothschild ) family
The recent lala Madelyn Payseur Gatling Fulghum ( 1876-1972 ) was the late head of the Payseur family .
The documentation on the above families is extensive , but much of the evidence that has been photocopied out of the few documents left intact have been destroyed since the documents were photocopied .
The amount of tampering with official documents is incredible , and further Illustrates the enormous power the Rothschilds and the Payseurs ( the 13th family -- the Holy Blood line ) have .
The researchers who wrote Holy Blood , Holy Grail got a taste of the power of the 13th blood line to manipulate documents held by libraries and governments in Europe .
The same type of thing has been happening in the United States .
The researcher into the Satanic elite has a hard row to hoe because the Satanic families have tried to cover their tracks through history .
They have also tried very hard to cover up what their financial assets are .
Those Rothschilds who have carried on the Rothschild name have had a higher visibility .
It is this group of Rothschilds which have gained the public ’s attention , even though they too are very secretive .
The origins of the Masonic and Rosicrucian movements lie with the medieval alchemists .
Manly P. Hall , Freemasonry ’s greatest philosopher writes , , , During the Middle Ages , alchemy was not only a philosophy and a science but also a religion .
Those who rebelled against the religious limitations of their day concealed their philosophic teachings under the allegory of gold - making .
In this way they preserved their personal liberty and were ridiculed rather than persecuted .
Alchemy is a threefold art , its mystery well symbolized by a triangle . "
( The Secret Teachings of All Ages , pg CLIV - ul ) -- Manly P
Hall also states in his book on magic entitled Magic , " ... [ the ] pentagram .
This was known to medieval alchemy as the sign of the cloven hoof .... ( Hall .. Magic , Los Angeles , CA : Philosophical Research Soc. , pg. 46 ) Quicksilver ( which was one of the things the early Astor family traded in ) was one of the primary items employed in the alchemical transmutations .
The oxide produced using quicksilver was considered magical and mystically identified with the god Osiris .
As the reader may have already figured out , alchemy practiced Hermetic magic from ancient Egypt .
Alchemy was really a front for the mystery religion of Satanic witchcraft .
The leading alchemist was a german Richard Bauer who was alive sometime in the 14 or 15 hundreds .
Richard Bauer is said to have been the only alchemist who was successful in transforming lead to gold .
Whether that report is meant in an allegorical way , or some other way I do not know What I am trying to communicate is that the Bauer family was a leading alchemical family which secretly practiced Hermetic magic during the late Middle Ages .
David ’s article on the Rothschilds is meant to be an extension of what I have already put out on the Rothschilds .
for instance my chapter 3.3 in the Be Wise As Serpents book .
Chapter 3.3 is entirely devoted to the Rothschilds .
I chose them to write about in the book , because the family is the most renown of the Satanic families and the easiest to expose to people just becoming acquainted with what is going on .
The other family which has a chapter devoted to it is the Russell family , which is described in chapter 1 .
6 . The Russell family has yet to be covered in this series , but was covered in the Be Wise As Serpents book because of their importance to the Watchtower Bible & Tract Society .
I am aware of intense secret meetings that have been going on in Frankfurt and Moscow between World Bank officials .
These secret meetings have been going on now for two months which gives some of the scope of their importance .
Undoubtedly the Rothschilds are playing a role in these secret meetings , even while I write this .
There has been a great deal of misinformation put out that the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers are fighting for control of the world .
It is true that they are in intense competition in some areas .
It has also been true that they have been in intense cooperation in many areas .
One of the difficulties for people to sort out what is going on , is that they do n’t know about the Satanic spiritual dimension of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers .
For instance , to make an analogy , if I am a minister and one of my brothers - in - Christ is my up line on a multi - level marketing distributorship , then he is my business head , but I could be the spiritual leadership that he looks up to .
The point is that essentially all researchers trying to expose the NWO are drawing conclusions about occult power on the basis of business relationships , and it does n’t always work .
Sometimes the business boss may be in a secret satanic leadership position over someone else , but it may also be that both men are on equal footing when it comes to occult power and status within the Illuminati .
So far I have seen only one book advertised ( and I have n’t read it ) which claims to expose the conflict between the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers as a sham .
If
It really does show this , then the book has contributed greatly toward helping people tear down their misunderstandings about the Illuminati power structure .
Part I
THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD
If one looked on the backstage of history , he would find the House of Rothschild .
They have indebted Kings , manipulated kingdoms , created wars and molded the very shape of the international world .
Among the hierarchy of the Illuminati they are revered as a powerful satanic bloodline .
They are " living legends . "
Said one biographer : " In America a boy wants to become President .
In Europe he would rather be a Rothschild ....
To be ‘ a Rothschild ’ is to be a modern Croesus , a twentieth - century Midas . "
They are a dynasty of enduring power ; a " magic " bloodline In Satan ’s Empire .
We will probably never know exactly when occultism was introduced to the Rothschilds .
Several of their ancestors have been rabbis , so the occultism probably came in the form of Jewish Cabalism , Sabbatism , or Frankism .
The House of Rothschild practices gnostic - satanism ( the Rothschilds would probably not call themselves satanists , but by our standards they are , considering the sacrificial and spiritual worship involved ) .
The truth is sometimes hard to tell .
The stories the family weave are hard to distinguish from the truth .
Myths are one of their best weapons , and a researcher must be wary .
The family began in Frankfort , Germany ( the city where paper money was popularized ) .
The oldest known Rothschild went by the name of Uri Feibesch who lived in the early 16th century .
His descendants lived in the House of Red Shield .
His great , great , great , great Grandson was Moses Bauer , who lived in the early 18th century .
The family was mostly made - up of Jewish retail traders , and lived in the Judengasse , or Jew ’s Alley in Frankfort .
Jew ’s Alley was the product of the anti-semitic bent in Europe , and did not have very good living conditions .
Most Ashkenazim
Jews of that time did not use sir-names , instead they preferred the Chinese custom of using a symbol as the family identity .
These symbols were sometimes used on signs outside Jewish houses as an address .
Some Jews had taken on sir-names , to fit in , but the use of symbols was more popular .
The early Rothschilds chose the sir-name Bauer ( meaning farmer in German .
Why would a family of retail traders call themselves Bauer ?
Perhaps to remain un-noticed ) .
The Bauer line continues today , but in the 1700 ’s one man re-named his branch of the family after its symbol and address - the Red Shield or the Seal of Solomon .
Mayer Amschel Bauer was a well - off coin trader in Frankfort .
In front of his house hung a sign with the family ’s symbol , which was a red hexagram .
The hexagram ( also known as the Seal of Solomon , the Magden David , or the Star of David ) is very occultic .
It is used today as the symbol of Israel , but It is not , , Jewish . "
In his excellent book THE SIX - POINTED STAR , O.J. Graham explains that the hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions .
It was the symbol of Moloch , Ashtoreth , and others .
In fact , the hexagram was used to represent Saturn , which earlier newsletters have discussed .
The six - pointed star is considered the equivalent of the Oriental Yin - and - Yang symbol , which is the Luciferian concept of balancing good and evil .
The symbol appears to have been used by King Solomon when he apostasized , and was thereafter called the Seal of Solomon .
Later on , Jewish Cabalism ( or Occultism - different name , same game ) picked it up as a magic symbol .
Through the promotion of the Cabalists and the Zionists it has become the symbol of Jewish identity , although the occult circles know better .
The Bauer ’s use of a hexagram as their family sign points to their involvement in Jewish Cabalism .
In fact , the six - pointed star was so significant to them that Mayer Amschel Bauer decided to adopt it as his new name - Mayer Amschel Rothschild ( Rot- schildt = Red Shield ) .
I believe this was done to identify his family with occultism and the likes of Saturn or Ashtoreth ( whom the Astors are named after ) .
Mayer was sent to be a rabbi when he was 10 , in 1753 .
A year and a half later his parents died .
Mayer was brilliant and was encouraged by relatives to continue his studies but coin trading was his love .
He left the school and when 13 was sent to Hanover to be an apprentice at the Illuminati Oppenheimer bank .
He worked there for 7 years , learning the ins and out of money .
The big question is why he left the Oppenheimer bank .
It was a good situation , both financially and socially ( Hanover was less antagonistic towards the Jews than Frankfort ) .
Why leave this security and head back home to an uncertain future ?
Because the future was n’t all that uncertain .
While in Hanover Mayer made the acquaintance of General von Estorff , a numismatist who was impressed by Mayer ’s knowledge of the subject .
In 1763 General von Estorff left Hanover and joined the Court of Prince William IX of Hesse - Hanau , whose territory included Frankfort .
Mayer knew that through his connections he would be able to get some business with the Prince .
It appears Mayer ’s stay at the Oppenheimer bank was used to establish himself in Illuminati circles and to find a way to get close to the Illuminati royalty .
General von Estorff was his key .
Prince William of Hesse - Hanau was tied into the Illuminati .
He was the son of Landgrave Frederick or Hesse - Cassel , of the royal family of Hesse .
Prince William was a Freemason , and his younger brother Karl , was according to JEWS AND FREEMASONS IN EUROPE , 1723-1939 , ‘ accepted as the head of all German Freemasons . ’
Members of the Hesse dynasty have been described as the leaders of the Strict Observance ( in 1782 a Masonic Congress in Wilhelmsbad , a city in the Hesse province , dropped the name ‘ Strict Observance ’ and changed it to " Beneficent Knights of the Holy City " ) .
The Hesse dynasty is totally connected to the Illuminati .
Prince William was the grandson of King George II of England .
The Hesse - Cassel ’s were one of the richest royal houses in Europe .
Their income came mainly from the loaning - out of Hessian soldiers to foreign countries .
( The elite loves to makes profit off of " peacekeeping " troops , which is exactly what the Hessians were called .
This " peacekeeping " always adds up to imperialism .
The Hessian troops were used by England in the American Revolution , in fact the colonial armies fought more Hessian soldiers than English .
The House of Hesse - Cassel made a lot of money off the American Revolution . )
Another example of the Hesse -
Cassel ’s ties to the Illuminati is the enigmatic figure St. Germain , who is hailed as a New Age Messiah - figure .
Many researchers believe that St. Germain was the son of Francis II of Transylvania .
Francis II ’s second wife was Charlotte Amalie of the House of Hesse , he married her in 1694 .
St. Germain was either her son , or the prior wife ’s , this point is debated .
His name was Leopold - George and they staged his death in 1700 to save him from the deadly collapse of the Transylvanian dynasty .
Prince Karl of Hesse , Masonic leader of Germany , wrote that St. Germain had been sent down to Italy to be raised by the Medici family .
Later on St. Germain appeared out of nowhere to work with the elite .
There were questions as to his identity and Napoleon Ill had a dossier gathered on him , but the house holding the dossier was mysteriously destroyed in a fire .
St. Germain was an alchemist and he claimed to have the alchemical Elixir of Life , the secret formula of immortality ( which the Rosicrucians also claimed to have ) .
He was a guest of William and Karl of Hesse in 1774 , and in 1779 returned to Karl to spend the last years of his known life .
Helena Blavatsky , cofounder of the Theosophical Society claimed that St. Germain was one of the Hidden Masters of Tibet who secretly controlled the world ’s destiny .
In 1930 Guy Ballard claimed that he met St. GermaIn on Mount Shasta .
This supposed meeting led to the creation of the ‘ I AM ’ movement .
The Hesse Dynasty has lasted clear up to the 20th century .
During WWII they were on Hitler ’s side .
Prince Philip of Hesse was a messenger between Hitler and Mussolini .
He was still alive in 1973 and was reported to be the richest prince in Europe .
The House of Hesse is still a powerful force in Germany .
In 1763 Mayer left Hanover to build his fortune in Frankfort .
His main objective was to become a financial agent of Prince William of Hesse - Hanau .
Prince William was an intelligent man who loved to make money .
( His passions went beyond money .
His wife did not please him so he became an adulterer and almost every woman he slept with became pregnant .
He fathered between 70 to 21 illegitimate children .
His main mistress , Frau von Lindenthal , bore him 8 children and ran his household . )
William loved to loan money at high interest rates .
He was the perfect man to aid Mayer ’s quest for riches .
Mayer began bribing Prince William ’s servants to become informants .
At that time he was an antique dealer , trader , coin collector , and exchanger ( the country was divided and as a result the separate currencies made money exchanging very profitable ) .
General von Estorff convinced Prince William of the value of a rare coin collection and then recommended Rothschild .
Thus began the relationship between the Prince and the Rothschilds .
Mayer would sell rare coins , precious stones , and antiques to the Prince at ridiculously low prices .
Then , in 1769 , after a significant amount of sales , he wrote the Prince asking for and receiving the designation ‘ Crown Agent to the Prince of Hesse - Hanau " ( a great commercial advertiser .
Titles and honors were important in that day , they opened doors ) .
Mayer then married Gutle Schnapper , daughter of a respected merchant , Wolf Salomon Schnapper , in 1770 .
He then set up a money exchange bureau .
His two brothers worked in this bureau with him until 1785 when Kalmann died and Moses quite .
Some researchers contend that Adam Wieshaupt of the Bavarian Illuminati was financially supported by the Rothschilds .
The Bavarian Illuminati was founded in 1776 , and the Rothschilds were not necessarily a financial power at that time .
I may be wrong , but I do not believe Mayer was in a financial position to support Wieshaupt .
It is possible , though , that when , in 1782 , the headquarters of the Illuminati moved to Frankfort , that it began to be controlled by the Rothschilds .
In 1785 Prince William ’s father , Landgrave Frederick of Hesse - Cassel , died and William became the new Landgrave .
This made him the richest prince in Germany and possibly Europe .
He left the small province of Hesse - Hanau to become ruler in Hesse - Cassel .
Around this time Wolf Schnapper , Mayer ’s father - in - law , introduced Rothschild to Carl Buderus who was the Prince ’s chief financial advisor .
Through either coercion , friendship , or occultic ties Mayer was able to convince Buderus to become an agent for him .
This was a big mover for Mayer .
The Landgrave William of Hesse - Cassel was to be the ‘ steppingstone " to power .
Until then Mayer had only done meager business with William , but by 1789 Buderus managed to get some royal bills for Rothschild to discount .
This was n’t much , but it was a start .
Carl received a cut of the profits when he did William ’s business through Rothschild .
This was the beginning of a long financial relationship that would benefit both parties .
Mayer Amschel Bauer - Rothschild was a shrewd man , but his quick rise in social status shows the power of money , for Mayer was not cultured .
He could never master the German language and so he and his family spoke a strange Yiddish German mixture ( which benefitted their secret network ) .
He enjoyed
discussing the medieval world and coin collecting .
When it came to business he was ruthless and naturally adept .
His occult side was well hidden .
He was most likely a Cabalistic Jew .
Although it is not known if he was a Freemason , he did accompany the Landgrave on several trips to Masonic lodges ( after the two had become better friends ) .
He had 5 daughters and 5 sons , plus several children that died young .
He moved from his old house , the , , Haus zur Hinterpfann " , to a new one , Green Shield , when he started making more money .
Green Shield was a dual residency and the other half was occupied by the Schiff family who were to play an important role later on as agents of the Rothschilds .
Every passage of Green Shield held hidden shelves and cupboards , and the backyard counting house 's walls had a number of secret shelves and a secret underground room which was connected to a neighbor ’s house for a quick getaway if necessary ( the house was built to protect Jews from the dangerous pogroms that would sweep Germany , it was a great place to secretly practice their gnostic - satanic rituals , if they were yet involved in that form of worship ) .
His five sons have been called the Mayer brothers because they all shared that middle name : Amschel Mayer , Salomon Mayer , Nathan Mayer , Kalmann ( Carl ) Mayer , and Jacob ( James ) Mayer .
Each son entered the family business at the age of 12 .
The humorous side of studying an elite IllumInati family is the
biographer ’s insistence on owing the family ’s ability to profit from circumstances as " luck . ’
They never seem to put two and two together .
Many of these circumstances happened by design .
They always say things like ‘... the infant opportunity seemed to be the child of coincidence . "
They never attribute a family ’s wealth to well planned extortion , cheating , or thievery , which is exactly how families like the Rothschilds attain their riches .
The French Revolution is an example .
The Illuminati fueled French Revolution got under way in the 1790’s , and Prince William began to get nervous .
He was afraid the revolutionary riots would reach Germany and he would lose his gold .
So he invested his money in a magnificent new palace called Wilhelmshoe , which was built from 1791 to 1798 .
Although the French Revolution frightened William it was a delight for Mayer .
The war helped his sales .
When the French ended up pitted against the Holy Roman Empire , the prices of imported goods skyrocketed , and importing goods from England was a Rothschild specialty .
In fact Mayer ’s English trade helped him secure a deal with the Landgrave ( through Buderus , of course ) in which he became a middleman in England ’s payments for the hire of Hessian soldiers .
‘... every ill wind of the 1790 ’s seemed to blow good to the Rothschilds . "
The winds were so good that by the end of the decade they were established as a rich and independent family .
In 1800 they were the 11th richest family in Frankfort ’s Jew Alley ( not counting the wealth in proxy ) .
Around the turn of the century Mayer decided to send his most clever son , Nathan to England to establish another Rothschild House .
The family tells a silly story about Nathan leaving for England to best an annoying English cotton trader , but I believe that Nathan was sent by Mayer with a specific purpose - to establish power with the Rothschild network in that country .
Nathan arrived in England with no knowledge of the language but a great amount of money .
He would soon be the most powerful man in Europe .
Many more profitable events occurred at the turn of the century .
Many of these events revolve around the Rothschild infiltration of the Thurn and Taxis postal system .
The House of Thurn and Taxis was of the Black Nobility .
In 1516 Holy Roman Emperor Maximilion I ( of the Merovingian bloodline and husband of a member of the Black Nobility ) commissioned the House to create a mounted postal service between Vienna and Brussels .
The service eventually included all of Central Europe .
The head office of the system was in Frankfort , which was rather convenient for Mayer who proceeded to do business with them .
His relationship with Thurn and Taxis became so close that the service began to inform him of any pertinent Information found among the letters ( that they had a habit of covertly reading ) .
This mail fraud system was also used by the Emperor Francis to keep abreast of his enemies .
While Mayer was receiving stolen news from Thurn and Taxis he was busy setting up his own postal service so that no - one could secretly discover his dealings .
This system was eventually so effective that the Rothschilds became the best and fastest informed individuals in the world .
The system was so good that many prominent men began to send their letters through the Rothschilds , who of course , always snuck a peak at the contents .
The business with Thurn and Taxis helped Mayer receive the title " Imperial Crown Agent " in 1800 .
This title served as a passport that allowed him to travel throughout the Holy Roman Empire .
It also provided the right to bear arms , and it freed him from having to pay the taxes and obligations upon the Jews of that period .
Mayer began to get even more titles , including one from the German Order of St. John .
His sons Amschel and Salomon were also busy getting various titles .
In 1801 they became crown agents of the Landgrave William of Hesse - Cassel .
All these titles were wonderful , but most important was the Landgrave ’s .
The Landgrave was the richest Prince in Europe and the Rothschilds were determined to take advantage of his wealth .
The relationship with the Landgrave improved greatly in 1803 .
A Danish King , and cousin of William , asked the Prince for loans but William declined because he did not want anyone to know how rich he had become .
Rothschild learned about it and through Buderus , proposed lending the money anonymously .
William thought the idea was splendid .
The loan was sent through Mayer and a Hamburg Jew .
The interests were paid to Rothschild who , after taking commission , forwarded the money to the Landgrave .
The event was a great triumph , after 36 years , Mayer had finally done a significant job for the Prince .
Six more Landgrave loans to Denmark were negotiated by Rothschild .
Many more loans ensued ( although they required some teeth pulling on Buderus ’ part ) , Including loans to the Order of St. John .
This negotiating of the Landgrave ’s loans greatly increased the reputation of the House of Rothschild .
By this time Napoleon had come to power in France .
This caused a distress in Europe , but brought great profits to the House of Rothschild .
As one biographer put it " Napoleon seemed bent on Improving the Rothschild ’s lot in life . "
Even though Napoleon was not purposely doing
It , the conditions he created were of great benefit .
Napoleon tried to get the Landgrave as his ally , but Prince William squirmed and politely as possible refused .
William ’s goal was to wait untIl the winning side in the Napoleonic conflict was clear so that he could join without any risks .
The pressure of the situation gave the Landgrave a very bad temper .
By this time half the crown heads of Europe were in his debt .
Napoleon grew tired of the Landgrave ’s games .
His troops Invaded Germany and the province of Hesse to " remove the House of Hesse - Cassel from rulership and to strike It out of the list of powers . "
Wllhelmshoe became frantic as William attempted to hide his riches .
After the scramble to conceal his wealth he fled the province and went to live in exile in Denmark .
The French immediately found most of his treasures .
Buderus and Mayer had to act fast to preserve the wealth of the Landgrave .
Some of the valuables had already been sold .
They quickly bribed a French General , Lagrange , who turned over 42 trunks to Hessian officials and lied to Napoleon about the Prince ’s true wealth .
Lagrange ’s deceptive act was eventually discovered and he was dismissed , but much of the wealth was preserved .
During the frantic moments before Hesse - Cassel ’s Invasion , the Landgrave gave Buderus the right to collect the Interest payments due from Holy Roman Emperor Francis .
Buderus eventually transferred this right to the Rothschilds .
Mayer began doing the Landgrave ’s business behind Napoleon ’s back .
These secret dealings were greatly boosted by the man Napoleon appointed to rule the area - Karl von Dalberg .
Dalberg was a friend of Mayer and Buderns and had done business with them ( his connection to them may have also been occult ) .
Napoleon made Dalberg Primate of the new Confederation of the Rhine , which included Frankfort .
As ruler of the region Dalberg protected the Rothschilds from being exposed as traders of contraband and as agents of the House of Hesse - Cassel .
When the French cut off trade with England prices on Imports soared .
The Rothschilds smuggled goods in and made large profits , with Dalberg keeping guard .
" It was certainly most remarkable , " said one biographer .
" That the Archbishop and Lord of the Confederation of the Rhine , who ruled over sixteen German princes , and stood so high in Napoleon ’s favor , should have shown so much good - will to the Jewish Mayer Amschel Rothschild at Frankfort , who , although now a rich man , had no dame to move in high and influential circles . "
Despite Dalberg ’s protection Mayer kept two sets of books , one inspectable and the other secret .
By 1807 Buderus , as proxy for the Landgrave , was almost exclusively using the Rothschilds for Hesse - Cassel business .
Mayer himself would visit the Prince in exile , but since he was getting old he soon had to give up these trips and sent his sons on the journeys .
The House of Rothschild was collecting the income of the wealthiest prince in Europe less than half a century after Mayer had begun building his fortune !
The satanic House of Rothschild ’s Illuminati dealings at this time are well exemplified by their involvement with the second Tugenbund League .
The first Tugenbund League ( or Virtue League ) was formed in 1786 as a kind of sex society .
The group would meet at Henrietta Herz ’s home ( her husband was an Illuminati Jew who was the disciple of the powerful occultist Moses Mendelssohn ) .
Many Illuminists attended this " Virtue " League .

Dutch Prepare for Climate Change With Floating Houses
April 10th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
[ social_buttons ]
With rising sea levels and more extreme weather events on the horizon , the Dutch are building houses modeled after arks .
These houses become buoyant during floods .
There is a string of 37 houses located along the Maas River in Holland that were designed and built by Dura Vermeer .
Such houses can rise 16 feet without problems and contain flexible pipes , electrical , and sewer lines .
The foundation of the sits on the river bottom .
If you were to drill a hole through the basement floor , water would come in ( so this is not recommended ) .
When the river floods , the house becomes buoyant .
Unlike a boat or an ark , two broad steel posts driven deep into solid ground hold the house in place .
“ In the other village we have lived , there was always the water , ” said Mariana Smits , a floating homeowner in Maasbommel .
“ I was very scared .
Two times , we have evacuated to leave our old house .
This was very scary for us .
And we got the opportunity to buy this house .
It ’s a safe place . ”
Design Advances
Floating houses are nothing new , but they are in higher demand and increasingly popular .
Buoyant gardens are also being designed , because nobody wants to loose their daisy collection after an extreme weather event .
Technology is now being developed to allow entire city blocks to float .
Having multiple structures connected adds stability , benefiting everyone .
Rising Sea Level Increasing Demand
Some degree of climate change is inevitable despite emission reduction efforts and adaptation initiatives are being considered .
“ As global warming causes the sea level to rise , this is the solution , ” explains Dick van Gooswilligen from the Dura Vermeer .
“ Housing of this type is the future for the delta regions of the world , the ones which face the greatest danger . ”
Market conditions are ripe for this building design .
“ The momentum is just right , ” said Koen Olthuis of Waterstudio , an architectural firm that specializes in living and working on water .
“ Because of the climate change , because of the Al Gore story , because of New Orleans , because of the financials of this moment , everybody is waiting for new innovations . ”

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Even as exonerated file - sharing defendant Tanya Andersen pursues her malicious prosecution case against the music industry , there is some unattended business left over from the RIAA 's original copyright infringement lawsuit .
After the RIAA threw in the towel on its lawsuit against Andersen , she sought and won an award of attorneys ' fees .
The two parties are now trying to settle the bill , and the RIAA is only willing to pay one tenth of what Andersen 's attorney is seeking .
Andersen 's attorney , Lory Lybeck , is looking for just under $ 300,000 in fees from his defense of Andersen .
The $ 298,995 figure submitted to the court includes a " multiplier " of two times the " reasonable " hourly rates due to the " high risk , successful " defense ( Oregon law allows for multipliers ) .
In a brief filed earlier this month , the RIAA called the $ 298,995 figure " excessive " and said that it should be drastically slashed to something along the lines of $ 30,000 .
In the RIAA 's opinion , Atlantic v. Andersen was a " straightforward copyright infringement claim , " and the labels ' independent expert believes that the fees sought are excessive " in numerous respects . "
Lybeck takes issue with the RIAA 's characterization of the case in his reply to the RIAA 's brief .
" Contrary to plaintiffs ' argument , this copyright case was anything but typical or ' straightforward , ' " argues Lybeck .
" As the court has previously found , the proceedings were complicated , prolonged , and made more expensive by the plaintiffs ' unreasonable tactics throughout the case . "
Indeed , the mere existence of a malicious prosecution case accusing the RIAA of all sorts of questionable tactics seems to belie the labels ' claim that Atlantic v. Andersen was " straightforward . "
The RIAA stands accused of racketeering , fraud , deceptive business practices , and a host of underhanded tactics such as seeking to directly contact Andersen 's then - eight - year - old daughter under false pretenses .
Recently retired Judge Donald Ashmanskas , who presided over Atlantic v. Andersen , took issue with the labels ' tactics , writing " [ w ] hatever plaintiffs ' reasons for the manner in which they have prosecuted this case , it does not appear to be justified as a reasonable exploration of the boundaries of copyright law . "
The RIAA did not act " in an objectively reasonable matter , " Judge Ashmanskas wrote in one ruling .
Lybeck is seeking payment for over 540 hours of work .
That 's way too much , argue the labels , because those hours include time spent on counterclaims that were voluntarily dismissed as well as on " talking to the media " and working on the attorneys ' fees question .
Lybeck replies that all of those things are covered and notes that the argument the RIAA makes is " exactly the opposite " of those made throughout the case .
That 's not the only double standard from the RIAA , Lybeck says .
He notes that the RIAA frequently had multiple attorneys present in court , including six at a single hearing .
Despite that , the RIAA says that Andersen 's having just two lawyers present at a hearing or deposition is " duplicative " and that only one should be reimbursed .
" Defendants like Ms. Andersen ... should be allowed to defend themselves as aggressively as the RIAA prosecutes claims against them , " Lybeck counters .
The labels are also upset about Lybeck 's travel expenses .
Lybeck told
Ars earlier this month that the RIAA was digging its heels in on that issue .
" Andersen tried to get a local lawyer , " he told us .
" But no one would take the case unless she agreed to default on the judgment and file bankruptcy . "
Ultimately , the dustup over attorneys ' fees is n't that surprising .
Losers seldom like writing checks for the winners , and the RIAA is no exception .
After exonerated defendant Debbie Foster won an attorneys ' fees award in the case the RIAA brought against her , the RIAA appealed and dragged its feet before finally cutting a $ 68,685 check .
As was the case with Capitol v. Foster , there 's likely going to be more back and forth before a final fee is agreed upon — or ordered by the judge .
One thing is certain : the RIAA sued , lost , and the judge has said it is going to have to pay up .

I 'm just back from Seoul , South Korea , for the World Science Forum : Brain Power after spending a few days in Hawaii recovering from the high energy event .
My bet is , the Forum is an event you probably heard zilch about ­ I sat at one of two press tables and was the only US journalist as far as I know .
The US press was n't interested , apparently .
But the government - sponsored meeting was clearly a Big Deal for S. Korea and it revealed developments which can be called " mind - blowing " in more ways than one .
Like what ?
Robots that learn and beat programmed humanoid mechanical creatures at games because the able - to - learn robots are thinking , trying , learning on the spot ­ their " brains " are based on how the human brain works ( a sort of back - engineering ) .
Brain / computer interfacing techniques that may sound like sci fi but are already being tested on animals and , in some cases , humans .
A new effort to map ­ literally and exactly ­ every neuronal twist and turn of the human brain , much like the human genome has been mapped ( and that gives a whole new meaning to the phrase " mind reading " ) .
The ways neuroscience can be used for " neuroeconomics " and " neuro - marketing " ­ terms used by Yale neurobiologist Daeyeol Lee to describe how neurobiological studies of the brain 's reward system can elucidate " the biological basis of our values and preferences " ( i.e. , how knowing how the brain works can help those who want to zero on in marketing directly to your mind 's biology ) .
In addition to these and other specific revelations , the forum also clearly put S. Korea 's passion for science in the spotlight .
There is an open agenda , a resolve to seize these developments and apply them to medicine and technology in this technologically savvy Asian country .
An invited gathering of many of the world 's top neuroscientists , the event was held at the uber futuristic W hotel convention center and open to the public .
And they came , by the thousands ­ families with kids , high schoolers , professionals , other scientists .
S. Korea is a place where scientists are treated with the enthusiasm most Americans only give to some talentless celebutard or rap star .
Newly - elected S. Korea President Lee Myung - bak spoke at the opening ceremony and reminded the audience his country now has the tenth strongest economy in the world .
Ninety percent of all Korean kids go on to college .
In 60 years , per capita income went from $ 100 per year , to $ 20,000 .
He also recalled that he comes from the world of business and entrepreneurialism -- and he 's determined that his country will be a leader in neuroscience and related technologies .
There 's clearly a lot of money in Seoul , by the way .
I visited a state - of - the - art imaging center built with the single - handed support of one woman , Dr. Lee , who forked over the equivalent of $ 40 million dollars for the project .
The hotel I stayed in , the 5 star W at Walkinghill , is a curious combination of idealized , caricatured l960ish decor a la Austin Powers and futuristic high tech details .
A huge red bathtub with a TV screen suspended over it , walls half glass with automatic curtains that open at the touch of a button to reveal the Han River and , through the misty morning haze , the outline of seemingly endless super modern high rises on the other side , rising up like some fantasy futuristic city .
In fact , you have to look hard to find a trace of ancient or even not - so - ancient Korean culture .
This is a city with one foot in tomorrow and the other foot almost totally there , too .
Which is one reason why the public seemed so smitten with talks from cutting - edge neuroscientists whom most Americans , I suspect , would avoid in droves .
There were also some non-scientist speakers .
Ron Reagan Jr. did nothing to conceal his absolute contempt for the disastrous rule of George W. Bush , the illegal invasion of Iraq and the stupefying waste of billions of dollars under the neocon regime while so much medical research into degenerative brain diseases is in need of funding .
French sci fi writer Bernard Weber , whom I 'd never heard of before , was greeted by adoration -- turns out he has a fan club of over 700,000 in S. Korea ­ as he spoke of using the brain 's power of imagination to touch nature , " see " the future and prepare for true human evolution that is coming .
More highlights from the scientists :
One theme that came up from several researchers ­ what is consciousness and how do we find , measure and , perhaps , shape it ?
Famed University of California at Santa Barbara psychologist Michael S. Gazzaniga ( who discovered much of what we now know about the differences between the left and right sides of the human brain ) and Nobel Laureate Gerald M. Edelman , director of the Neuroscience Institute , were among the Big Brains discussing what is being learned and mapped about our own brains and the perceptions , ideas , sensations that comprise what we call " consciousness " .
Zang - Hee Cho , Director of the Neuroscience Research Institute at the Gachon University of Medicine in Seoul , showed examples of 21st century brain mapping that were so precise , so clear , it was simply startling .
These techniques make the MRI and PET scan images available today in most U.S. medical centers look like hazy , blurry and downright creakily old technology .
Japanese neuroscientist Shun-ichi Amari , George Washington University Hospital neurologist Richard Restak , Medical College of Georgia neuroscientist Joe Z. Tsien and MIT professor of computational neuroscience Sebastian Seung talked about making brains smarter ( engineered evolution , anyone ? )
In fact , Tsien , via genetic engineering , has already created Super Mice ­ brainiac rodents .
Seung , by the way , is a native New Yorker born to Korean parents .
He dresses like a rock star ­ silver high top shoes , silver studded blazer , long hair ­ and is young and handsome , as well as being brilliant .
He had the crowd mesmerized as he spoke in Korean ( his first speech in the language ) .
German neuroscientist Klaus - Robert Muller from the Technical University of Berlin , Miguel Nicolelis , professor of neuroscience at Duke , Korean brain researcher Soo - Young Lee and neuroscientist Philip Kennedy , chief scientist of Neural Signals in Atlanta , Georgia , outlined their accomplishments linking brains to computers ( Nicolelis has implanted monkeys with electric terminals in their brains that allow them to use robotic arms by " thinking " of them , Kennedy has invented an implanted brain chip that is helping a " locked in " paralyzed young man speak via thinking words that are instantaneously sounded by a computer , and Muller has come up with a way to non-invasively make it possible to type without a keyboard by connecting brain signals to a compute cursor ) .
Yes , cyborgs are here .
Curiously , back in the U.S. of A. at the same time the World Science Forum was taking place in Seoul , a succession of American scientists were speaking at a symposium held by the U.S. National Academies designed to assess how the government has responded to a 2005 report to the U.S. Congress that attempted to rally the nation to improve scientific research .
And a whole lot of the speakers were n't happy .
" Not much has happened here , but a lot has happened elsewhere , " said G. Wayne Clough , president of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , who takes over the top position at the Smithsonian Institution this summer .
Former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine , who chaired the academies ' panel that wrote the initial report , listed progress being made in other countries and criticized U.S. policymakers for their lack of action in supporting science .
But it was Craig Barrett , former CEO of Intel , who came up with the best and probably most telling zingers : " There will be winners and losers , and the losers are the ones who insist on looking backwards , " he said .
" We continue to subsidize 19th century technology -- like in the $ 290 billion farm bill - - rather than the 21st century technologies that will allow us to remain competitive .
We 're fat , dumb , and happy . "
I can tell you the Koreans ­ scientists and public alike ­ are not dumb , or fat but they seem awfully happy about learning and working .
And they are clearly happy about inviting in , and soaking in , brains and research from around the world .
What they do with the knowledge they are gaining , when coupled with their clear industriousness and steadily growing economy , should be nothing short of astounding .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Bears are a rare breed , but not yet extinct in an oil market where prices have doubled in the past 12 months and risen by a quarter this year .

History shows price booms do not usually run on uninterrupted .
But for oil , which has been rising since 2002 , many of the elements that could bring prices down are still missing .
“ Until there ’s some definite evidence of a surplus growing somewhere in the system , prices will continue testing up , ” said Paul Horsnell , head of commodities research at Barclays Capital .
Investment bank Goldman Sachs has predicted a rise to $ 200 a barrel over the next six to 24 months , and other energy analysts see high prices for years to come .
There are a few analysts pointing to price - cooling factors .
“ The basic fundamentals are already very much in place for prices to move lower , ” said Tim Evans , energy analyst at Citigroup .
“ Inventories are above the five - year average in terms of days of supply coverage , supply may grow in excess of 3.0 percent this year , more than double the 1.5 percent growth that the International Energy Agency forecasts for global demand . ”
There is so far little evidence the price surge has had a major impact on consumption , which has become more responsive to levels of gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth than prices .
But in the United States , the world ’s biggest energy consumer , the combination of high prices and slower GDP growth is having some effect .
Higher prices for gasoline and the sluggish economy is forecast to hit U.S. oil demand through the summer driving season more than expected , the U.S. Energy Information Administration has said .
The EIA expects total petroleum demand , which includes diesel fuel and jet fuel , in the current quarter to be 90,000 barrels per day less than it forecast last month and down 170,000 bpd compared to the second quarter last year .
For 2008 as a whole , demand is forecast to fall by 190,000 bpd , 90,000 bpd more than the agency ’s forecast last month .
Lastest U.S. EIA data on fuel inventories for the week to May 2 showed a 5.7 million barrel rise in crude oil stocks , while gasoline stocks rose by 800,000 barrels .
High oil prices are cited as a factor pushing the U.S. stock market lower , because of fears record oil will dampen demand from consumers already hurting from a housing slump .
“ There are some leading indicators pointing to why you might see more structural weakness in the market in the remainder of the year , ” said James Crandell , energy analyst at Lehman Brothers .
CHINA DEMAND
Bulls are relying on China and India demand to offset weakness in the United States , but a removal of government subsidies on fuel in emerging economies could upset this balance .
“ The increase in demand from industrializing economies , together with ongoing supply constraints , mean that oil prices are likely to remain high well into the next decade , ” said Robin Batchelor , fund manager of Black Rock ’s world energy fund .
“ If China and India were to increase their consumption per person to current U.S. levels , these two countries alone would require 160 million barrels per day , more than twice the world ’s supply of oil today . ”
But if governments need to reduce or remove subsidies , their consumers would then feel the real cost of energy .
Oil has soared partly because demand from China and India is surging when supply growth is constrained after years of underinvestment in production and refining capacity in the West .
Producer group OPEC is keeping a lid on exports , Nigeria has seen big disruptions to production and Russia , the world ’s biggest non-OPEC producer , has seen a slowdown in output growth .
The pattern of oil prices over the past three decades is a roller - coaster , with big peaks and troughs .
Prices in nominal terms advanced from 1970 into the early 1980s , for example , driven partly by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ’ move to exert influence over prices , the Iranian Revolution and the Iran / Iraq war .
But then prices fell back through the mid-1980s to early 1990s , due to economic recession as well as supply growth from the North Sea and Alaska .
Oil ’s dizzying rise this time round has frequently led to warnings of a sudden and sharp correction .
“ Those signed up to bubble theories , or currency effects or speculative effect theories would no doubt speak in grim tones of a likely crash , ” said Horsnell .
“ Mind you , they did that at $ 30 , $ 40 , $ 50 , $ 60 , $ 70 , $ 80 , $ 90 , $ 100 and $ 110 and so I suppose it is too late at $ 120 for them to now change tack . ”
Llamatron
" READ ME "
File
" Llamatron " was a Robotron - esque action game released for the Atari ST , and later the Amiga , in 1991 as Llamasoft 's first foray into shareware .
( A PC version showed up later , but it was n't written by Jeff and it just was n't the same without a digital joystick . )
The " READ ME " file that came with " Llamatron , " parts of which are included here with permission , is a window into the Minter philosophy .
That mysterious note down at the bottom is about the Atari Panther , the unreleased predecessor to the Jaguar .
You may be wondering why you have the latest Llama release either for free or the price of a PD disk .
Loads of reasons .
Loads .
Call the cops .
Allow Yak to explain :
Llamasoft has been around since 1982 .
This makes us just about the longest surviving software house ever {okay except Microdeal , hey you guys , I know , well done , glad you are still around and hey !
do n't sue me , I just play this here keyboard} and we have a pretty good perspective on the industry of video game production and the way it has evolved .
This is how it was :
In the very early days , there was a very close relationship between the originators of games and those who played them .
You would go along to ( say ) the Vic Centre , there would be a bunch of games , you play them and buy the ones you like .
Funky .
Bad games did n't sell , good ones did .
Then , as with anything which becomes popular , the Men In Suits moved in .
They saw some programmers getting rich selling to the people , so they decided to move in .
" Let us help these poor programmers " , they sez .
" We can sell these games to the people .
Let the programmers get back to their assemblers and not have to worry about duplicating tapes and filling their living rooms with huge piles of stock " .
And so the Men In Suits came , and placed their full - page airbrushed artwork adverts in all the mags , and the programmers went back to their assemblers and for a while they were happy .
The Men In Suits were happy too , because they got to take a cut , and soon some of them were driving Porsches .
The Men In Suits looked out upon the market , and they were sorely dismayed at the diversity of the products .
" This is not efficient " , they thought .
" How can we best use this market ?
How can it be made to serve us well ? "
And they created film licences and arcade conversions .
They burned the midnight oil , murmuring incantations over their calculators and their mobile ' phones , and eventually they came up with the Formulas .
" Loads of graphics ! " , they told the programmers .
" Loads of music !
Arnie Schwarzenegger in it !
No need to design a new game - just change the graphics in these few basic designs and put a picture of Indiana Jones on the box !
You 'll never have to think again ! "
The programmers went back to their assemblers .
The Men In Suits handed them pieces of paper upon which were written the exact specifications for the games .
The programmers had to pay their mortgages , so they coded and were employed .
The Men In Suits laughed , and took a bigger cut , and moulded the market to make themselves an even bigger pile .
Soon , some of them were driving Ferraris and getting pissed at industry dinners .
This is how it is :
All video games are designed for a theoretical entity known as Darren .
Darren is a spotty 14 - year - old male who does n't get on that well with people , so he spends all his time in his bedroom playing games on his computer .
Darren is easily impressed by graphics and music , and he does n't really want to learn anything really tricky - as long as it has Ninja Hampsters in and works with a Kempston , that 's OK .
Somehow he can persuade his Dad to fork out 25 quid once every few weeks for the latest version of R - Type with different graphics on his Amiga , do n't ask me how .
Either that or he waits and hits up his mate Wayne for a pirate version in a couple of weeks ' time .
Consequently , it has become much harder for programmers to retain their creative integrity and earn a living too .
It is virtually impossible for a small independant developer to get games out to the people without first hooking in to one of the larger companies for distribution and advertising , and those larger companies tend to want stuff that 's very normal , spaceship - and - alien stuff , no llamas please and not too weird .
However , with popular disk - based machines , the idea of Public Domain programs has really come into its own .
PD libraries give access to a large amount of free software .
PD is usually sub-commercial stuff , often good utilities but without the ' polish ' of commercial versions .
It would be nice to use the existing PD libraries to distribute software to anyone who is interested , and make a bit of money too - and that is where Shareware comes in .
The principle of Shareware is simple .
The game is distributed by the PD libraries , by uploading onto BBSes and giving copies away .
Users can get a complete version of the game just for the price of the media , and then take it home and play it .
If the user likes the game , he sends the author a Shareware fee .
Usually , the author will send back a few goodies ( as an incentive to register ) and , if enough people send in the dosh to make it worthwhile , he may do more Shareware stuff .
Naturally you do n't have to pay anything if you do n't like the game .
Of course a lot of people might like the game and decide not to pay , but if too many people do that then nobody will ever bother doing any decent Shareware at all , and it 's back to Darren 's 25 quid games .
So , it 's down to the users - if they 're honest , then programmers will be more inclined to work hard on Shareware releases .
The idea of Shareware is very idealistic , perhaps impracticably so , but the advantages over the conventional videogame market are so enormous that I thought it had to be tried , at least once .
The response from this experiment will determine whether or not Llamasoft release any more shareware .
This game is based on an old Williams arcade game by the same dude who wrote Defender .
The game - Robotron - was a big hit in the early Eighties , and an official sequel - Smash TV - was an arcade hit last year .
Llamatron takes the Robotron idea and distorts it in a Yakly fashion , adding loads of new stuff and plenty of furry beasties in the Llamasoft style .
We could have flogged it as a pretty good budget game via conventional means , but Yak decided to try it as shareware ' coz he liked the idea so much .
Here 's the deal .
You play Llamatron and check out the hook .
If it gets you ( and I reckon it will if you like mayhem ) , then send us a fiver and , as a reward for being so honest , we will send you an ace poster of our gun-toting llama , a newsletter , and a complete copy of Andes Attack , originally released in 1988 to considerable critical acclaim .
Two games for a fiver - can't be bad .
And if the response is good , there will be more Shareware .
And better .
We 're asking a Shareware fee of five pounds for Llamatron , and you should send your lolly to : LLAMASOFT , 49 Mount Pleasant , Tadley , Hants RG26 6BN , U.K .
Do let us know what you think of the game and the principle of Shareware in general , too .

Back to the Jeff Minter interview
Former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney won 79 % of the vote in the Wisconsin Green Party ’s Presidential Preference Primary .
The Primary , conducted by mail among dues paying members of the party , ran from April 28 through March 27 .
Kent Mesplay , who campaigned in Wisconsin in November of 2007 , won 10 % .
Ralph Nader received 5 % through write - in votes , followed by Kat Swift 2 % , Uncommitted 2 % , and Jesse Johnson 1 % .
Wisconsin sends 24 delegates to the GPUS Nominating Convention in July , which will be held on the 40th anniversary of the 1968 Chicago riots at the Democratic National Convention .
Of these delegates , 19 will be voting for Cynthia McKinney , 2 for Kent Mesplay , 1 for Kat Swift , 1 for Uncommitted , and 1 for Ralph Nader .
Wisconsin is tied for the seventh largest delegate contingent among the 50 states ( the top states are California 168 , Illinois & Maine 44 each , New York 40 , Massachusetts & Pennsylvania 32 each , Wisconsin , Michigan & Oregon 24 each . )
The raw vote totals from Wisconsin are : 97 ballots counted , 77 votes for McKinney , 10 for Mesplay , 5 for Nader , 2 for Swift , 2 for Uncommitted , 1 for Johnson .
Counting only the five primary states ( AR , CA , DC , IL , MA ) plus Wisconsin so far , an estimate of delegate strength right now for the Green Party nomination would be :
* Ralph Nader 118 * Cynthia McKinney 110 * Kent Mesplay 11 * Howie Hawkins ( Nader stand - in ) 9 * Jared Ball ( dropped out of the race ) 8 * Elaine Brown ( dropped out of the race ) 8 * Kat Swift 7 * Jesse Johnson 3
Uncommitted = 13 , Undetermined = 5 .
Other state parties will be determining their delegate proportions over the next 6 weeks , and some are already in the process of caucusing or returning mailed ballots .
The fact that Ralph Nader is not seeking the Green Party ’s nomination has not resolved the question over the delegates he may have received so far to date .
From what I have heard about the debates among the GPUS National Committee and the Presidential Campaign Support Committee ( whose co-chair is a Nader Supporter ) , the effort within the Green Party to Draft Nader ( whether he wants it or not ) has not yet died .
I ’m happy to report that I will be a delegate from Wisconsin to the Green Party National Convention in July !
This is a story still in progress .
It records an ongoing series of skirmishes being fought sporadically across America , with little publicity , under arcane rules that make it difficult to determine winners and losers .
The final outcome will not be known for months .
Yet it could be the most important story of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , and how it unfolds could affect that party 's future more than any other single event this year .
That story is the ongoing struggle of the Ron Paul campaign to secure the largest possible number of delegates to the Republican Convention this Sept. 1 - 4 . I have followed that struggle with interest since February , but have been discouraged from writing about it ; some Paul supporters thought that it would reflect badly on the campaign for it to become generally known .
However , now that some mainstream media are beginning to report on it , I think it best to start writing myself on this most exciting , if not most important , underreported story of the year .
Many Americans may think that the National Delegates have already been chosen .
I used to myself : Before this year , I always thought that delegate slates were presented and elected on primary or caucus day .
From following the Paul campaign , though , I have learned that that is not how it works .
How it does work varies from state to state ; but the process generally follows this order :
First , party members gather in local caucuses and choose delegates to county conventions .
Next , the county conventions elect delegates to state and congressional district conventions .
Finally , the state and district conventions elect the National Delegates .
Some National Delegates are bound to vote for the state primary or caucus winner through the entire ballotting .
Others must do so on only the frst two ballots ; others on only the first ballot .
In still other states , delegates are not bound to vote for the winner at all ; the primary or caucus result counts as no more than a straw poll .
The Paul campaign has remained focussed on securing delegates , rather than on primary or caucus vote totals .
“ Our goal has always been to walk into the national GOP convention with as many delegates as possible , ” said Ron Paul 2008 campaign manager Lew Moore .
“ The number of delegates we [ win ] could very well be the difference in a Convention where no one has a first - ballot majority . ”
Even though McCain now appears to have a first - ballot win clinched , the Paul campaign continues to pursue the same goal .
There are good reasons to do so .
For one , Paul needs to be nominated by five states in order to appear on the ballot , and have a chance to speak at the convention .
For another , delegates will determine the 2008 election platform ; for the Paul campaign , which is about ideas rather than personalities , the platform is as important as the nominee .
Thus the Delegate Wars continue , state by state , county by county , delegate by delegate .
“ Ron Paul National Delegate Count Now 42 or More , ” Ron Paul 2008 , Feb. 6 , 2008 .
http://www.ronpaul2008.com/press-releases/237/ron-paul-national-delegate-count-now-42-or-more/
Alaska
Alaska ( where Paul came in third , wth 17 % of the caucus vote ) held its state convention Mar. 13 - 15 , in Anchorage .
Ron Paul Alaskans reports that , thanks to efforts at the district conventions , Paulunteers “ were to were able to secure 105 delegates to State , or roughly 30 % of the total . ”
At the convention , the Ron Paul Republicans ( RPR ) managed to pass several platform resolutions , calling for repeal of the Patriot Act , opposing Real ID , and advocating abolition of the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Education .
Another resolution , opposing the Iraq war , lost ; author Chris McGraw notes that “ we were simply unable to pull support from anyone outside of the Ron Paul delegates for this purpose ” .
The RPR also lost a heated battle to reapportion Alaska 's National Delegates among the two remaining candidates , Paul and Sen. John McCain .
That would have given Paul 14 delegates , and McCain ( whom Paul beat in caucus ) only 12 .
That motion died in Rules Committee , in part because “ both the Romney and Huckabee campaigns sent letters to the convention explaining that their campaign “ suspensions ” were intended to reserve delegates rather than release them . ”
In return for dropping their delegate challenge , the RPR won a resolution calling for Ron Paul to be allowed to address the National Convention .
“ The motion was proposed by the chairman and co-chairman of the rules committee , ” Ron Paul 's website notes , “ who were so impressed by the conduct and ability of the Ron Paul delegates that they felt it was the right thing to do . ”
However , the battle for delegates continues .
Heather Saarella reported , on Nolan Chart Mar. 31 , of a successful project by the Alaska Ron Paul Delegates Meetup “ to send our own media , in the form of a DVD , to every single registered delegate and alternate in Alaska . ”
Organizer Ewan Cutler is now working to replicate that success nationally , organizig “ a campaign that sends a DVD each month for four months to the national delegates and alternates going to St. Paul . ”
Colorado
Nolan Chart correspondent Jahfre Fire Eater reports that at the Jefferson County convention in Colorado ( where Paul received 8 % in caucus ) , “ there was a line of people at the Ron Paul table .
Everyone at this convention is a [ state ] delegate .
Those people in line are looking to sign up as Colorado Ron Paul delegates .
They are former Huckabee people and Romney people and Fred people and Tancredo people … .
The major topic of debate at the GOP breakfasts this week was how to hold your nose and vote for McCain .
I 'd say about 50 % say absolutely no way in hell will they vote for McCain . ”
On Apr. 8 , the Daily Paul reported that “ The Colorado State Republican convention is n't until May 31st and no National delegates from the State have been selected .
Nor will those delegates be bound to a candidate . ”
Florida
Though Paul took only 3 % in the Florida primary , some party honchos see the RPR as a major threat .
The Sarasota county Herald Tribune reports that local “ party leaders are doing everything they can to block new members from joining the Republican Executive Committee .
That has included freezing its membership and adjourning a monthly meeting early to prevent Paul supporters from speaking . ”
“ They want to take over the REC , ” county GOP chairman Eric Robinson told the paper .
Nolan Chart correspondent “ Paul from Clearwater , Florida ” recently reported on his local caucus : “ I got about 30 Ron Paul meetup members to join and become Commmittee Members for the Local Republican Party … .
We get there , roll call is taken .
We each individually introduce ourselves .
The Chairmen of our county and surrounding counties are there .
Voting time comes around and THEY DO ALL OF THE VOTING .
No one else .
And of course they vote themselves in and it is over ”
The Orlando Sentinel reports that “ similar struggles are occurring in other Florida counties and states . ”
In Orange County , party chairman Lew Oliver led a move to block Paul supporters from becoming precinct captains at this month 's party meeting .
In Pascoe County , Paul supporters were asked to publicly pledge their loyalty to the GOP .
Louisiana
Paul received just 5 % of the vote in the Feb. 9 primary .
However , as no candidate won a majority , by state rules the primary results are non-binding : All National Delegates from the state are officially uncommitted .
At the Jan. 22 caucuses , party officials violated several of their own rules in an attempt to freeze out the RPR .
First , they held off calling the original caucus until Dec. 17 – ten weeks after the legal deadline , and two weeks after the deadline for registering Republican .
Second , the deadline to file as a delegate was arbitrarily extended after Ron Paul supporters were the only ones to file a full slate in each congressional district .
Third , officials used an out - of - date party membership list , to challenge Paul supporters and force them to cast provisional ballots .
Reports Ron Paul 2008 : “ Had the LA GOP followed its own rules , Ron Paul would have won 5 of the 7 state congressional districts , giving the campaign a majority of the state convention delegates , resulting in at least 35 delegates elected to the national convention in St. Paul . ”
At the Feb. 9 state convention , delegate Michelle Gaudin moved to have the official slate replaced “ with a slate of delegates reflecting the results of the election had all votes been counted . ”
Though the motion was voted down , having it moved allowed the campaign to contest the Louisiana delegation before the Republican National Committee 's Credentials Committee .
The question may not be resolved until the St. Paul Convention .

The company that makes one of the pesticides state officials are considering spraying over the Bay Area to fight the light brown apple moth is owned by a wealthy California agribusinessman who has been a generous contributor to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and other state officials .
According to federal and state agriculture departments , the moth 's larvae could threaten more than 200 crops in California and could potentially put a significant dent in the state 's $ 32 billion agriculture industry .
Among the business owners whose agricultural operations in California could be affected by the insect is Stewart Resnick of Los Angeles , who owns nut and citrus tracts in the Central Valley .
His Roll International Corp. owns Paramount Farms , the world 's largest grower of almonds and pistachios , and Paramount Citrus , one of the biggest citrus fruit producers in the United States .
Roll International 's holdings also include Suterra LLC , a fledgling pesticide company in Bend , Ore. , that makes CheckMate , a pheromone pesticide that is one of four chemicals being considered for aerial spraying by officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food and Agriculture .
The chemical was sprayed over Santa Cruz and Monterey counties in the fall in an attempt to disrupt the moth 's mating .
Resnick has been a longtime donor to politicians , giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party and its candidates for state and federal offices .
In recent years , he 's also given nearly $ 150,000 to Schwarzenegger 's campaign , records show .
Although the governor supports the aerial spraying , that decision has no bearing on Resnick 's political donations , said Aaron McLear , a Schwarzenegger spokesman .
" The governor leads by what he believes is in the best interest of California and does n't take those types of things into consideration , " the spokesman said .
Rob Six , a spokesman for Roll International , said " there 's no quid pro quo " and added that Resnick and his wife and business partner , Lynda Resnick , generally make a lot of political contributions .
Six agreed that the moth could have an adverse impact on Roll International 's farming business .
While the extent of damage the moth 's larvae could cause is under debate , the pest is already affecting California growers ' ability to export because other countries have begun placing restrictions on fruits , vegetables and nuts that are grown in areas affected by the moth .
" This is a very bad threat for a lot of growers , " Six said .
" And one of the biggest threats is on quarantines on our exports .
...
There are many countries that have a blacklist for fruit or nut products if apple moth is found on them . "
The nine Bay Area counties have been placed on the quarantine list by the U.S. Department of Agriculture , which is recognized by many nations that import California 's produce .
Mexico last week added Los Angeles , Santa Barbara and Napa counties to that list , said Rayne Thompson , director of national affairs for the California Farm Bureau .
Federal officials need to contain and eradicate the pest before it becomes widespread in the Central Valley , the heart of California 's agricultural industry , she said .
" Other countries recognize the apple moth as a huge problem , " Thompson said , adding that California exports about $ 9 billion worth of produce each year .
Restrictions could range from more stringent testing for the pest , which would cost more , to not importing the products , she said .
But debate continues to rage over how destructive the pest 's larvae are and whether aerial spraying would work .
Larry Hawkins , a spokesman for the federal agricultural agency , said that there is no guarantee CheckMate would be chosen and that his department could also later change its decision about aerial spraying .
The Environmental Protection Agency must give its approval , followed by a program to inform the public , he said .
But many people are concerned about the health effects of the pesticide .
Last fall , hundreds of residents in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties complained of health symptoms including shortness of breath , muscle aches and sore throats after an aerial spraying of pheromone pesticides .
State officials have said they are examining the complaints but have not found evidence that the chemical is harmful .
Momentum to stop the spraying has been building in recent weeks , with thousands of Bay Area residents signing petitions to stop the spraying .
Lawmakers have introduced five bills to control aerial application over urban areas , and four city councils in the region have voted to oppose the spraying .

“ Michelle ’s always been very vocal about anything , ” her mother , Marian Robinson , told me .
“ If it ’s not right , she ’s going to say so .
When she was at Princeton , her brother ” — Craig , now the head basketball coach at Brown , was two years ahead of Michelle — “ called me and said , ‘ Mom , Michelle ’s here telling people they ’re not teaching French right . ’
She thought the style was not conversational enough .
I told him , ‘ Just pretend you do n’t know her . ’ ”
There is more to the Obamas ’ relationship , however , than the caricature of Michelle as a ballbreaker to Barack ’s Obambi ( Maureen Dowd ’s term ) .
Consider the moments leading up to Barack ’s career - making speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 .
The story that the Obamas like to tell , and that their chroniclers like to repeat , is that Michelle pulled Barack aside just before he took the stage , warning him , “ Just do n’t screw it up , buddy ! ” [ #unhandled_cartoon ]
Someone who was involved in the preparation of the speech recalls a more nuanced dynamic , as Michelle calmed an irritable Barack .
“ We were spending intense sessions tinkering with wording and commas , ” the person says .
“ It was pretty tense , because everybody was picking at Barack and making suggestions .
He was getting a little irate .
Michelle was in the room , and she was kind of handling both him as well as some of the speech . ”
The observer went on , “ She was listening intently and , without being overly directive , was somebody that he could glance over to , almost a telepathic kind of relationship .
He was clearly looking to her for reaction . ”
Earlier on the day that Obama visited the nursery school , she addressed a congregation at the Pee Dee Union Baptist Church , in Cheraw , a hamlet of about six thousand known as “ The Prettiest Town in Dixie . ”
The church ’s makeshift gravel parking lot , next to the Pee Dee Ice and Fuel Company and bounded by train tracks , was full .
After an invocation by the Reverend Jerry Corbett and an introduction by the mayor of Cheraw , Obama came to the pulpit .
“ You all got up bright and early just for me ? ” she asked the mostly elderly , almost all - black crowd .
“ Yes ! ” they roared .
Obama continued , “ On behalf of my church home and my pastor , Reverend Wright , I bring greetings . ”
Obama opened with some reminiscing .
“ My people are from South Carolina , ” she said .
“ I do n’t know if y’all knew that .
. . .
In fact , my brother and I came down last week for a mini family reunion at my grandparents ’ church , because they retired back down here , and before their death they were living here , attending an A.M.E. Baptist church in Georgetown . ”
Obama was playing to her audience — later she riffed on “ those relatives who have plastic on the furniture ” and reminded the churchgoers to get “ ten other triflin ’ people in your life ” out of bed and down to the polls on Saturday .
Her appearances at the church , and many like it , were a key point of strategy in a state that would be the first real test of whether or not Barack could attract significant numbers of black voters .
“ In South Carolina in particular , because she had family from there , it made a lot of sense for her to speak in the African - American community , ” David Axelrod said .
After warming up the crowd , Obama launched into her stump speech , a forty - five - minute monologue that she composed herself and delivers without notes .
Obama has been open about the value of her ability to speak to black audiences in cadences that reflect their experience , but she makes clear her distaste for the notion that she is a niche tool , wielded by her husband ’s campaign to woo black voters solely on the basis of their shared racial identity .
“ I mean , I ’ve been to every early state , ” she told me , when I asked her about reports that she was “ deployed ” in the South to reach black audiences .
“ I was ‘ deployed ’ to Iowa , ” she said , making air quotes with her fingers .
“ I was ‘ deployed ’ to New Hampshire . ”
The four times I heard her give the speech — in a ballroom at the University of South Carolina , from the pulpit of Pee Dee Union , at an art gallery in Charleston , and in the auditorium of St. Norbert College , in De Pere , Wisconsin —its content was admirably consistent , with few of the politician ’s customary tweaks and nods to the demographic predilections , or prejudices , of a particular audience .
Obama begins with a broad assessment of life in America in 2008 , and life is not good : we ’re a divided country , we ’re a country that is “ just downright mean , ” we are “ guided by fear , ” we ’re a nation of cynics , sloths , and complacents .
“ We have become a nation of struggling folks who are barely making it every day , ” she said , as heads bobbed in the pews .
“ Folks are just jammed up , and it ’s gotten worse over my lifetime .
And , doggone it , I ’m young .
Forty - four ! ”
From these bleak generalities , Obama moves into specific complaints .
Used to be , she will say , that you could count on a decent education in the neighborhood .
But now there are all these charter schools and magnet schools that you have to “ finagle ” to get into .
( Obama herself attended a magnet school , but never mind . )
Health care is out of reach ( “ Let me tell you , do n’t get sick in America ” ) , pensions are disappearing , college is too expensive , and even if you can figure out a way to go to college you wo n’t be able to recoup the cost of the degree in many of the professions for which you needed it in the first place .
“ You ’re looking at a young couple that ’s just a few years out of debt , ” Obama said .
“ See , because , we went to those good schools , and we did n’t have trust funds .
I ’m still waiting for Barack ’s trust fund .
Especially after I heard that Dick Cheney was s’posed to be a relative or something .
Give us something here ! ”
First Ladies have traditionally gravitated toward happy topics like roadside flower beds , so it comes as a surprise that Obama ’s speech is such an unrelenting downer .
Obama acknowledged to me that some advisers have lobbied her to take a sunnier tone , with little success .
“ For me , ” she said , “ you can talk about policies and plans and experience and all that .
We usually get bogged down in that in a Presidential campaign , over the stuff that I think does n’t matter .
. . .
I mean , I guess I could go into Barack ’s policies and rattle them off .
But that ’s what he ’s for . ”
In Cheraw , Obama belittled the idea that the Clinton years were ones of opportunity and prosperity : “ The life that I ’m talking about that most people are living has gotten progressively worse since I was a little girl .
. . .
So if you want to pretend like there was some point over the last couple of decades when your lives were easy , I want to meet you ! ”
After the speech , Obama was whisked into the church basement .
A clutch of people gathered nearby , hoping to catch a glimpse of her .
But when she emerged into the chilly morning air , she did n’t linger long with her well - wishers .
She can seem squeamish about politicking , put off by the awkward stagecraft of glad - handing and the small - group discussions —
Michelle , five or six women , and , as she put it one day in Wisconsin , “ five thousand cameras ” — that her staff bills as “ intimate conversations . ”
But she thrives in large venues .
Cindy Moelis said , “ The first time she got feedback on being such a wonderful speaker , I think when people said , ‘ Wow , you ’re really good at that , ’ she goes , ‘ Why ’s everybody surprised ? ’ ”
If Michelle Obama ’s husband succeeds in garnering the Democratic nomination and then in winning the general election in November , she will be not only the first black First Lady of the United States but also one of the youngest since Jackie Kennedy .
Yet , for a potential revolutionary , Michelle Obama is deeply conventional .
She exudes a nostalgia , invoking the innocence and order of the past , as much as her husband beckons to a liberating future .
Listening to her speeches , with their longing for a lost , spit - shine world , one could sometimes mistake her , were it not for the emphasis on social justice , for a law - and - order Republican .
“ It ’s not just about politics ; it ’s TV , ” she says , of our collective decay .
And , wistfully : “ The life I had growing up seems so much more simple . ”
She is a successful working mother , but an ambivalent one : “ My mother stayed at home .
She did n’t have to work . ”
Her music of choice is Stevie Wonder , and has been since her childhood .
( At the Obamas ’ wedding , a friend sang “ You and I . ” )
One of her favorite foods is macaroni and cheese .
In “ The Audacity of Hope , ” acknowledging the appeal of the Reagan Administration , Barack writes , “ It was related to the pleasure that I still get from watching a well - played baseball game , or my wife gets from watching reruns of ‘ The Dick Van Dyke Show . ’ ”
Obama draws a straight line from the way her parents , Fraser and Marian Robinson , raised her to the world as it ought to be .
For all her modern womanhood , she has not been tempted by rebellion or self - differentiation .
“ My lens of life , how I see the world , is through my background , my upbringing , ” she said , in South Carolina .
Fraser Robinson and Marian Shields , who both grew up on the South Side of Chicago , married in 1960 .
Craig was born two years later , and on January 17 , 1964 , Marian gave birth to Michelle LaVaughn , whom Fraser nicknamed Miche .
She and Craig looked so much alike ( and still do ) that people often mistook them for twins .
Fraser , who was partially handicapped by multiple sclerosis , worked swing shifts as a city pump operator , while Marian tended to the children .
The family lived in a modest house that they rented from a relative in the South Shore neighborhood .
“ If I had to describe it to a real estate agent , it would be 1BR , 1BA , ” Craig told Peter Slevin , of the Washington Post .
“ If you said it was eleven hundred square feet , I ’d call you a liar . ”
Money was scarce but sufficient .
Fraser took pride in providing for his family .
“ If the TV broke and we did n’t have any money to have it fixed , we could go out and buy another one on a charge card , as long as we paid the bills on time , ” Marian told me .
Saturday nights were spent at home playing Chinese checkers , Monopoly , or a game called Hands Down ( like spoons , with bluffing ) .
It was a simple time .
“ I probably had two sleepovers my entire life , ” Craig said .
“ We were home folks . ”
Many years , the family drove to Dukes Happy Holiday Resort , in Michigan , for a week ’s vacation .
The Robinsons went to church occasionally , but if they subscribed to any credo it was that of freethinking .
From a young age , Craig and Michelle were encouraged to make choices , and to contend with the consequences .
“ More important , even , than learning to read and write was to teach them to think , ” Marian Robinson said .
“ We told them , ‘ Make sure you respect your teachers , but do n’t hesitate to question them .
Do n’t even allow us to just say anything to you .
Ask us why . ’ ” Craig recalls , of Michelle , “ I would n’t say she ran roughshod over her friends , but she was sort of the natural leader . ” [ #unhandled_cartoon ]
Craig became a basketball star at a parochial school , while Michelle rode the bus , and then the El , to attend classes at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School .
Michelle ’s Class of ’ 81 yearbook — she was treasurer of her class — includes a picture of her as a serious - looking young lady in a bright - yellow silk shirt .
She did not play varsity sports , even though people were always telling her she should .
Craig told me , “ That ’s the best way to get her not to do something .
She did n’t want to play just because she was tall and black and athletic . ”
Bernadette McHale , one of her teachers , recalled , “ Our first full graduating class was in ’ 78 , so it was pretty experimental to come here .
She made a decision to choose an integrated environment that had more diversity in both curriculum and population . ”
Craig was recruited to play basketball at Princeton , and Michelle — who figured she could cut it if he could — followed him there .
Princeton in 1981 was not particularly hospitable to minorities of any sort .
“ It was a very sexist , segregated place , ” Angela Acree , who was Obama ’s roommate there for three years , recalled .
She continued , “ We could n’t afford any furniture , so we just had pillows on the floor , and a stereo . ”
Their social lives revolved around gatherings at the Third World Center , rather than the university ’s eating clubs .
Acree recalled , “ The white people did n’t dance — I know that sounds like a cliché — and they also played a completely different kind of music , whereas we were playing R. & B. , Luther Vandross , Run-D.M.C. , at the T.W.C. ”
Obama majored in sociology , investigating , in her senior thesis , “ Princeton - Educated Blacks and the Black Community , ” the ways in which attending Princeton affected black alumni ’s sense of connection to the black community .
At Obama ’s request , the thesis was embargoed until November 5 , 2008 .
Last month , amid charges of hypocrisy — the Obama campaign has congratulated itself on transparency — Obama finally released the document to the Web site Politico .
A sample passage : “ Unfortunately there are very few adequate support groups which provide some form of guidance and counsel for Black students having difficulty making the transition from their home environments to Princeton ’s environment .
Most students are dependent upon the use of their own faculties to carry them through Princeton . ”
She dedicated the project to “ Mom , Dad , Craig and all of my special friends .
Thank - you for loving me and always making me feel good about myself . ”

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - The U.N. atomic watchdog ’s top investigator began talks with Iranian officials on Monday to press them to explain Western intelligence which suggested Iran had covertly studied how to design nuclear bombs .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Iran ’s official IRNA news agency said Olli Heinonen , who arrived in Tehran on Monday , met Javad Vaeedi , deputy head of the Islamic Republic ’s Supreme National Security Council , behind closed doors .
Monday ’s discussions lasted for about three hours and will resume on Tuesday , the ISNA news agency said .
IRNA said Heinonen would leave Tehran on Wednesday after two days of meetings and did not plan to visit any of Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Ali Asghar Soltanieh , Iran ’s representative at the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , said Heinonen ’s visit was intended to advance cooperation between Iran and the IAEA , the U.N. body investigating Iran ’s disputed nuclear ambitions .
“ Such talks ... display Iran ’s policy and determination to carry on its technical and expertise cooperation with the IAEA , ” Soltanieh told the semi-official Fars news agency .
Last week , U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged a united effort to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb , possibly by expanding sanctions .
Iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful drive to produce electricity so that the world ’s fourth - largest crude exporter can sell more of its oil and gas abroad .
It has been hit by three rounds of limited U.N. sanctions since 2006 because of its inadequate cooperation with IAEA investigations .
Heinonen raised a diplomatic stir in February with a presentation that indicated links in Iran between projects to process uranium , test explosives and modify a missile cone in a way suitable for a nuclear warhead .
Iran has dismissed the intelligence as baseless , forged or irrelevant .
But the IAEA wants substantive explanations to enable it to wind up a long inquiry into Iran ’s secretive quest for nuclear power .
IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei has said the world “ needs to make sure Iran did not have a weapons program ” .
An Iranian official quoted by IRNA said Tehran had presented its “ evaluation ” of the issue to the U.N. agency but did not rule out discussing the matter with Heinonen .
“ Since there are differences between Iran and the agency ( over the Western intelligence ) the meeting ... will deal with finding a solution to this problem , ” ISNA quoted an official from Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organisation as saying .
IAEA officials stress that the intelligence details about weapons studies , many of them from a laptop computer spirited out of Iran by a defector in 2004 and handed to the United States , remain unverified but warrant thorough investigation .
World powers are considering improving a package of trade and other incentives for Iran if it stops enriching uranium , which can be used as nuclear fuel or provide material for bombs .
But Iran has refused to halt its nuclear drive and says it is working on its own proposals to help defuse the row .
ON MARCH 28th Ed Bangs will open the champagne .
Mr Bangs is the government 's chief wolf recovery co-ordinator , and on that day the grey wolf of the northern Rocky Mountains will lose its federal protection .
The Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) says the population has reached sustainable levels .
Mr Bangs has worked 20 years to see this moment .
Wolves were once found almost everywhere in the West , but settlers and ranchers made short work of them .
The last one disappeared from the Yellowstone region in 1926 .
By 1973 , when the Endangered Species Act became law , only a few wolves remained in northern Michigan and Minnesota .
After long and stormy debate , the federal government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone and parts of Idaho in 1995 .
The greater Yellowstone area , encompassing parts of Wyoming , Idaho and Montana , now has a population of 1,500 wolves .
These three states will now each manage their own wolves .
The USFWS will monitor their populations for the next five years .
It has set a minimum of 300 wolves and 30 breeding pairs , split equally among the three states .
Idaho , Montana and Wyoming plan to allow the animal to be hunted as trophy game .
The delisting also allows ranchers to shoot wolves that prey on their stock or threaten pets .
Conservation and animal - rights groups plan to sue , fearing that wolves will die in huge numbers .
Mr Bangs thinks otherwise .
“ Those states have done a superb job of managing their deer , elk and bear .
I expect they 'll do the same for wolves .
If they do n't , we 'll take it back . ”
The wolf has been a pain to some stockmen , but has hardly put ranchers out of business .
The Defenders of Wildlife , a wolfish outfit , says coyotes kill 20 times more cattle than wolves do .
It also says that wolves are responsible , in a typical year , for less than 2.5 % of sheep deaths .
The Muslim lie lingers
A new Pew poll out today reports that the Wright affair has n't really hurt Obama among Democrats , but he 's still having trouble with the older , white , working - class members of his party :
White Democrats who hold unfavorable views of Obama are much more likely than those who have favorable opinions of him to express less tolerant views on race .
In addition , nearly a quarter of Democrats ( 23 percent ) who hold a negative view of Obama believe he is a Muslim .
The survey also notes :
There is little evidence that the recent news about Obama 's affiliation with the United Church of Christ has dispelled the impression that he is Muslim .
While voters who heard " a lot " about Rev.
Wright 's controversial sermons are more likely than those who have not to correctly identify Obama as a Christian , they are not substantially less likely to still believe that he is Muslim .
Nearly one in 10 ( 9 percent ) of those who heard a lot about Wright still believe that Obama is Muslim .

From the campaign 's blog :
We appreciate Chris Wallace for doing his job as a tough but fair journalist on a network that has been deeply irresponsible over the last week in its unrelenting and sensationalistic coverage of Sen.
Obama .
Sen .
Obama gave the speech he did on Tuesday because he believes that Americans are ready for a thoughtful , mature discussion about race , and are hungry to move past media - generated controversies that distract from the struggles they face in their everyday lives .
If Fox News wants to play clips of the same offensive sound bites every day from now until November , that 's their right , but that type of coverage does a disservice to their viewers and to a nation that is facing serious challenges that merit thoughtful and honest reporting .
Pantheism as “ Sexed - up Atheism ”
Richard Dawkins , in his book The God Delusion , has described Pantheism as “ sexed - up atheism . ”
That may seem flippant , but it is accurate .
Of all religious or spiritual traditions , Pantheism – the approach of Einstein , Hawking and many other scientists – is the only one that passes the muster of the world ’s most militant atheist .
So what ’s the difference between Atheism and Pantheism ?
As far as disbelief in supernatural beings , forces or realms , there is no difference .
World Pantheism also shares the respect for evidence , science , and logic that ’s typical of atheism .
However , Pantheism goes further , and adds to atheism an embracing , positive and reverential feeling about our lives on planet Earth , our place in Nature and the wider Universe , and uses nature as our basis for dealing with stress , grief and bereavement .
It ’s a form of spirituality that is totally compatible with science .
Indeed , since science is our best way of exploring the Universe , respect for the scientific method and fascination with the discoveries of science are an integral part of World Pantheism .
If you are looking for atheist groups or freethought groups or brights groups and email lists , and if you would like ones that do a lot more than just attack religion , then you may well find World Pantheism the place you were looking for .
Why go beyond straight atheism ?
Does atheism need sexing up ?
As such , atheism answers only a single question : is there a creator God , or not ?
That ’s an important question , but if your answer is “ no ” it is only a starting point .
You may have reached that viewpoint based on your respect for logic , evidence and science , and those too are vital values .
Yet after you ’ve reached that initial “ no God ” answer , all the other important questions in life , all the options for mental and emotional wholeness and social and environmental harmony , remain open .
If atheism , humanism and naturalism are to advance , then they need approaches that do n’t simply leave the individual alone in the face of an increasingly threatening physical , social and international environment .
They need ways of life that offer as rich a range of benefits as traditional religious ones .
Atheism is advancing .
Growing numbers of people , across almost all nations , declare themselves to be non-religious or atheistic .
Atheistic books on religion , like those of Dawkins , Sam Harris or Christopher Hitchens , are best - sellers .
But so far atheism and atheist groups have focused on attacking conventional religions , especially the Western theistic religions of Judaism , Christianity and Islam .
It ’s true that these religions often come with high costs : submission to written or priestly authority , belief in terrifying concepts such as demons , Apocalypse , Last Judgment and Hell , or the drive to impose one ’s beliefs or religious values on other people .
In many cases they give cachet and endurance to backward , repressive or destructive social values , developed in agrarian societies many centuries ago .
And it ’s valuable to highlight these costs .
The attractions of religion
But negative critiques will not suffice .
There are many motives beyond fear or habit why people hold fast to old religions or convert to new ones .
There are many reasons besides ignorance and folly why they make religion the center of their personal and social lives .
Religions are not just a confidence trick on the part of prophets and preachers , or a self - destructive aberration on the part of believers .
They have had social survival value in the past , and they continue to provide individual and personal benefits today , and these benefits are the source of their continuing numerical strength .
Religions provide communities of mutual support .
They overcome existential isolation and alienation , giving people a meaning for their lives and a sense of their place in the universe and nature .
They provide remedies for grief at the death of loved ones , and for the fear of one ’s own death .
They combat the feeling of helplessness in a threatening world full of crime , conflict and disaster .
These benefits show up in the form of better health and longer life .
Of course , if you ’re buying these benefits at the price of abandoning logic , ignoring evidence , believing in contradictions and impossibilities , teaching your children to fear a God who is getting ready to destroy the planet , signing on for social values that repress the rights of others , let alone sacrificing your life to slaughter those who disagree with you , then maybe the price is too high .
A naturalistic spirituality
Are these negatives an inevitable part of the bargain ?
They may well be an inevitable part of belief in the unbelievable or of uncritical adherence to ancient scriptures .
But is it impossible to get the benefits that conventional religions offer , without giving up one penny of the value offered by reason , science , and progressive respect for the human rights of everyone ?
Do n’t we need approaches that offer the same range of advantages as supernatural religions â€ “ but without the costs ?
Can there be such a thing as a religion without god , an atheistic religion or a religious atheism ?
The Buddhism of the Pali scriptures does not have a God or gods .
Nor does the Taoism of Lao Tzu or ChuangTzu .
Can there be such a thing as a completely naturalistic form of “ spirituality ” with no supernatural elements ?
Increasingly , leading atheists and humanists like Neil De Grasse Tyson , Sam Harris and Michael Shermer are saying yes .
Of course we can quibble about the word “ spirituality . ”
When you pursue this approach of celebration and spirituality further , you are no longer in the real of basic atheism – which does no more than deny the existence of gods .
You have in fact arrived at Scientific Pantheism .
At World Pantheism we have been exploring this possibility since the beginning of 2000 CE .
We do so through our global and local mailing lists , through our magazine Pan , and through a growing number of local groups .
We have lists about scientific and philosophical ideas , as well as about practical ways of developing our naturalistic spirituality .
You can find links to these on our main page .
Our completely naturalistic Pantheism does not believe in any supernatural beings , forces or realms and is fully compatible with atheism and skepticism .
As Richard Dawkins writes :
Pantheists do n’t believe in a supernatural God at all , but use the word God as a non-supernatural synonym for Nature , or for the Universe , or for the lawfulness that governs its workings .
In practice , while a significant minority of our members like and use the word God to express the depth of their feelings for Nature and the wider Universe , the majority do not use the word about their own beliefs .
There are other names for similar approaches , such as religious naturalism or naturalistic paganism .
We have gone with Pantheism simply because it ’s the best known , and has a long pedigree .
Chinese New Year Firework Insanity
Chinese New Year is definitely something to see and experience .
At just about any corner store you can find , they sell cannon sized fireworks and they will sell them to anyone .
It is two fun filled weeks of dodging misfired missiles and hearing explosions literally 24 hours a day , including the 3 am wakeup call for everyone who dared to attempt catching some sleep .
On New Year ’s Eve , there are amazing firework displays in every direction you look and as far as the eye can see .
They go pretty much none stop for about 3 hours into the New Year morning .
Experiencing the fireworks during a Chinese New Year was probably the closest I ever felt to understanding what it must be like to be in a war .
It was disorientating , scary , and flat out dangerous .
Below are some pictures of the extremes the Chinese will go to when given anything that is fun and explosive .
Here are some videos that also show some of the firework madness you can expect to see during a Chinese New Year celebration .

But the issues have switched places in just a few months ’ time .
In the latest poll , 17 percent named terrorism or the war , while 37 percent named the economy or the job market .
( Another 16 percent listed an issue like energy or health care that is closely related to the economy . )
When looking at the current state of their own finances , Americans remain relatively sanguine .
More than 70 percent said that their financial situation was fairly good or very good , a number that has dropped only modestly since 2006 .
Yet many say they are merely managing to stay in place , rather than get ahead .
This view is consistent with the income statistics of the past five years , which suggest that median household income has still not returned to the inflation - adjusted peak it hit in 1999 .
Since the Census Bureau began keeping records in the 1960s , there has never been an extended economic expansion that ended without setting a new record for household income .
Economists cite a variety of factors for the sluggish income growth , including technology and globalization , and it clearly seems to have made Americans anxious about the future .
Fewer than half of parents  46 percent  said they expected their children to enjoy a better standard of living than they themselves do , down from 56 percent in 2005 .
Respondents were more pessimistic when asked broadly about the next generation , with only a third saying it would live better than people do today .
( Polls usually find people to be more upbeat about their personal situation than about the state of society , but the gap is now larger than usual . )
Charles Parrish , a 56 - year - old retired fireman in Evans , Ga. , who now works a maintenance job for the local school system , said that he was worried the country was not preparing children for the high - technology economy of the future .
Instead , the government passed a stimulus package that simply sends checks to taxpayers and worsens the deficit in the process .
“ Who ’s going to pay back the money ? ” Mr. Parrish , an independent , said .
“ We are .
They are giving me money except I ’m going to have to pay interest on it . ”
One of the unintended consequences of this housing market is the punishment conservative savers are taking .
Last month we had the rather astonishing release of data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics telling us for the month , that inflation was at 0 percent .
As disconnected as this is from reality , there is a reason the Federal Reserve is chopping rates even further and it is the opposite of what they are telling you .
Behind closed doors , they are hoping that you go out and spend and go into further debt .
In fact , they are setting up a system where savers are actually punished for not spending .
This game and charade of course can only go on for so long .
First , let us take a look at the current inflation rate and adjust it to an annual basis :
click to enlarge
The first thing I want to point out is the CPI .
You ’ll notice that last month , the reported inflation rate was 0 percent even though oil touched about $ 110 a barrel and has remained at those levels for sometime .
Let us first calculate the current annual inflation rate based on the above numbers :
If we add up the previous five months of data , we get 2 .
Since this is five months of data we ’ll have to adjust this for a 12 month calendar :
( 2/5 ) =( x/12 ) gives us X as being 4.8 percent
So currently the annual inflation rate is at 4.8 percent .
You will also notice that we have lost jobs in the previous three months to the tune of 76,000 , 76,000 , and 80,000 .
Keep in mind that during the previous three recessions , job losses during peak times reached over 300,000 a month even during the minor recession earlier in the decade .
This can be looked at a couple of ways .
Much of the data from the BLS lags the actual market .
That is why people were predicting a recession in the middle of 2007 even while jobs were still being added .
Keep in mind the way these things are calculated they leave out much of what the majority of Americans are facing on a daily basis .
For one , the CPI does not calculate mortgage payments and taxes but owners equivalent of rent which understates the current burden of housing prices on many homeowners .
Also , energy is blunted in the data so the rise in fuel cost is n’t reflected either .
Then , you also get complicated uses of hedonics for healthcare , food , and education which again understate the true nature of consumer inflation .
So with that said , for someone to simply preserve their wealth in the current market they will need to achieve a return of 4.8 percent after taxes .
Keep in mind that interest earned in CDs , savings , or money market accounts is taxed so a par rate of return is still not keeping up .
But let us take a look of a few major institutions to show you how any saver in the current market is being punished :
The first one we ’ll look at is Emigrant Direct .
They have offered very competitive rates on their savings accounts and currently they are offering a 2.75 % rate of return .
You may think this is low but as we ’ll show further , this is actually competitive for savings in the current market .
The next place we ’ll look at is ING Direct :
The current Orange Savings Account from ING is offering a rate of 3 % .
You notice that their CD offers a higher rate of return but let us look at what is required of this :
In order to achieve a yield of over 3 % , you will need to deposit at least $ 50,000 or more .
This is n’t even calculating the after tax amount you ’ll be getting .
We are simply looking at the current rates going for safe investments .
When I say safe investments , I mean accounts that are protected by the FDIC which insurers individual accounts up to $ 100,000 .
The next place is your typical brick and mortar place that is also offering an online product like Emigrant Direct and ING .
Washington Mutual is offering an online savings rate of 3.25 % so long as you have a checking account with them :
You ’re probably starting to notice a pattern here .
The savings rate for many of these places hovers from 2.75 % to 3.25 % .
Let us look at a different kind of account with Bank of American and their Money Market Savings Account :
Here , you ’ll notice that the rates up to $ 10,000 will only yield you .35 percent .
You will need $ 10,000 or more to get a rate above 1.24 % .
Bottom line is that if you stick your money into these accounts and let it sit , your money is actually eroding simply because the rate of inflation will eat it away .
And this is n’t to say anything about a dollar that is also going down as well :
During the past two years , the US Dollar Index has decline by 21.7 percent .
Given that many of the items Americans consume are imported , that means your purchasing power has declined by an incredible pace .
If you have any doubts about this just take a trip to Europe or anywhere in the world for that matter .
There may not be a direct correlation from the Federal Funds Rates and the actual payments you make on mortgages simply because market risk is so high at the moment .
But the funds rate does have a direct impact on the above savings rate on conservative accounts .
What the Fed is telling you is that if you plan on saving your money in guaranteed accounts , you will in fact be losing money .
Then you may be saying , what about playing the stock market .
Let us look at the performance of the three major indexes :
Looking at these three even after the recent rallies and major intervention actions by the Federal Reserve they are still down on a year to date basis by :
DOW : - 4.94 %
S&P 500 : - 6.67 %
NASDAQ : - 10.60 %
Clearly , the market is making it more difficult for people to protect their wealth .
The places that have done well are in foreign currencies and commodities .
Why are these doing well ?
Because they are simply reflecting the true devaluation of the dollar and the real rate of inflation that most Americans are feeling .
Let us look at a few currencies :
The Japanese Yen is up 9.91 % for the year against the dollar .
This has a lot to do with the carry trade unwinding and also the extremely low central bank rates over in Japan .
If you think we have low rates here , you just need to take a look over there .
But there is more to this than just easy rates .
In fact , the Euro is holding up strongly as well too because the ECB has held steady with their rates :
The Euro is up 7.68 % for the year against the dollar .
Now given that Europe may also be facing a credit bubble as big as our own by the reflection of recent writedowns on mortgage backed debt , their currency is perceived at least by foreign exchange markets as more valuable than the dollar .
The irony is that most Americans do not even have a tiny amount of money in commodities or foreign currencies to hedge their bets .
Given that we are in a recession short of the technical definition , if the Fed cuts rates again expect the yield on the already inflation lagging savings accounts to go down even further and expect foreign currencies to go up and also , commodities .
In this market , it is important simply to preserve wealth as many that are now seeing their equity evaporate in their homes are realizing .
Even the stimulus checks that are coming out next month are not touted as savings checks but a way for you to spend even further .
If anything , take those rebate checks and put them in a savings account or foreign currency .
The Fed wants you to spend and be in debt since that is the last straw of our economy .
Yet this is not good for you on a personal level .
No wonder why Americans now have a negative savings rate .
Conventional buy and hold investing styles are going to be proven extremely wrong in 2008 and if you want any more proof , just look at these scary charts .
Be wise and do n’t follow the advice of the Fed .

If one defines the occult as the unseen ( which is technically is ) then it would be easier ( and less lengthy ) to write an article on times that music was not affected by the unseen world than on the times it was .
In the world music tradition , we have rather extensive history ( extending all the way back to the Greeks ) of the use of music to induce certain states - modes were thought to have certain qualities .
There is even some evidence to suggest that the Egyptians used music as a healing tool
This anticipated the later utilization of these techniques by figures as diverse as Sun Ra , Jimi Hendrix , the Misunderstood , Rudolph Steiner , various " new age practitioners " such as Stephen Levine and the biased experiments tying plant growth to listening to classical music .
(1) These types of customs are utilized in Africa , India , South America and within most native cultures ( shamanic cultures from Russia to the Americas to the Pacific ) have some kind of tradition of sacred song to them .
The links run from the Russian shamanic traditions , the Australian aborigines to East Indian Gandharva Veda and Karnatak musics to Hawaiian chanting , to perhaps the most infamous occult music tradition of all , the Yoruban culture in Africa which found its expression as Voudon ( Voodoo ) in Haiti and Santeria throughout most of the remainder of South America .
This tradition has found its way into contemporary culture through jazz , tango , Cuban music , and of course , blues and rock and roll ( more on this later ) . ( 2 )
Getting back to tradition , in the more mainstream religions , it is valuable to know that Moslem , Hindu and Hebrew prayer is usually chanted , not spoken , and there are literally hundreds of books in all these cultures regarding the power of chanted prayer .
Balinese and Javanese Gamelan and African Joujouka are vessels for worship .
And the Western church also has a tradition of its own of this type plainsong or proportional chant , which later evolved into Gregorian chant , was one of the basic building blocks of the Western music tradition .
Also , as the years progressed , every major composer from the Renaissance onward ( and even before ) devoted most of their output to sacred work , up to and including 20th century composers like Stravinsky ( occasionally ) and Messiaen ( mostly ) .
A great many composers also chose subject matter of a more obscure occult / spiritual tilt .
Mozart wrote overtly about Masonic principles in his opera " The Magic Flute " ; Scriabin seemed under the influence of the Theosophical movement of his day with his Prometheus Symphony ; Richard Strauss " Also Sprach Zarathustra " is a piece dedicated to Nietzche but also to the misunderstood principles of the founder of the Zoroastrian religion ( considered to be the first continuous monotheistic religion ; in its current state it is a realtively small religion practiced pretty much exclusively in Iran and in a small colony ( Parsi ) in Bombay , India ) ; Erik Satie was a Rosicrusian who applied some of the principles of this secret society to his piano pieces ; Dane Rudhyar and Gustav Holst were astrologers ; Olivier Messiaen wrote numerous pieces dedicated to his unique form of Roman Catholic mysticism , but borrowed from Indian ragas and birds ( St. Francis of Assisi being the Catholic link ) and also wrote huge works drawing on Indian and Japanese works ; and Schoenberg 's most ambitious work was the unfinished opera Moses and Aron .
The most anti-mystical composer of the 20th century ( he claimed that the imagery of the Rite of Spring was derived from the music , and the large pagan gathering that was this major piece 's program was inspired by the music , not vice versa )
Stravinsky , wrote at least two major sacred works the Canticum Sacrum and the Symphony of Psalms .
Among more contemporary composers , Stockhausen has written works about mantra , the creation and the archangel Michael ; Penderecki has written religious works and mystical works , as has Ligeti ( " Lux Eterna " ) , John Cage was directly inspired by Zen and Indian thought about music , while the minimal trio ( Riley , Reich , and Glass ) are well known for their interest in Indian music , African and Hebrew traditions , and Tibetan Buddhism , respectively .
As George Crumb wrote the piece " Black Angels , " there was definitely an air of foreboding in the late 1960's and early 1970 - like " Tubular Bells , " this piece did not start out as an " occult " piece but became one by association by virtue of its inclusion in the soundtrack to the Exorcist ( an overtly occult piece like Stairway to Heaven was only marginally associated with occultism , by contrast ) .
The mystical tradition that inspired Wagner is well - known .
His finest work ( also his last ) is a opera called " The Comedy at the End of Time " in which the world comes to an end , prophesied by Sibyls and Anchorite monks and Lucifer is finally forgiven by God for his transgressions and accepted back into God 's hands .
Even Glenn Branca talks about angels and devils in his Symphonies ( and I have left out a ton of composers , I know , from Beethoven 's " Missa Solemnis " to Handel , Haydyn , Bruckner , well it never ends . )
We 'll talk about blues , jazz and rock further on .
Where do these people come up with this stuff ?
First of all , as one of my friends remarked to me long ago , music , being an auditory phenomenon , is not visible , save as a representation on sheet music .
It is an occult ( unseen ) science .
It seems to come from everywhere .
We interpret it in a congregation ( the audience ) and it has a wide variety of " secret messages " to it .
We can go all the way from the meanings that people derive from lyrics or music to the truly insipid interpretation of lyrics by the " Paul is dead " mania of the late 1960's to Geraldo Rivera hearing the words " Son of Sam " in Jimi Hendrix 's " Purple Haze " to the even more stupid " backwards masked " lyrics of Led Zeppelin , among others .
Before any of you ever reads too much into a song lyric again , I strongly encourage you to read Julian Jaynes ' Origins of Consciousness in the Bicameral Brain .
In it , he discusses the cross talk of schizophrenics as the model for messages from the Gods to early cultures .
It is a fascinating bit of work and one that should give pause to any one who thinks they hear a message from anywhere be it from a grizzled singer who can barely pronounce the words he is singing because of a drug - addled state or a " blues " affectation .
Thankfully , apart from Geraldo and a few Beatles - maniacs in the 1960's ( they are back , by the way and on the Internet ) , most of us do n't pay too much attention to words we can't understand on records .
Also , this diatribe should not be taken to mean that 1 ) their is n't real occult or spiritual significance to the music we enjoy or 2 ) that music can not be a consciousness altering experience for some people , even from sources that I would not necessarily like .
Both exist ; but like anything else unseen , interpretation must be made with caution .
Blues , rock , and jazz , it must be noted , are many times made in the presence of mind - altering substances .
To get to the essence of this , it is always useful to recall that alcohol is called " spirits " for a reason .
It has a potency that opens us up to very positive or very negative experiences .
Also , the grandfather of these musics is a blend of two musics that have profound occult roots the Yoruban and the Celtic cultures , for blues came out of Africa , jazz came out of Europe and Africa ( adding sex from the whorehouses  in the old days there used to be sacred sex temples in various cultures )  and rock coming out of blues and old country .
And country came out of the old Celtic folks who settled in Tennessee .
Ever wonder why groups like Fairport Convention and Jethro Tull had such an easy time blending rock rhythms into these weird little English folk pieces ?
The blues certainly had its share of occult imagery working for it .
There is of course the Robert Johnson legend of him going to the crossroads .
This is a place in most cultures where demons gather or the devil appears .
According to one sensationalistic television special I saw , the Allman Brothers Band used to spend time at Johnson 's grave and apparently picked up some kind of a curse by hanging out there - hence the deaths of Duane Allman and Berry Oakley .
Pieces like " Got My Mojo Workin " or even Screamin ' Jay Hawkins ' " I Put A Spell on You " are obviously huge parts of the history of rock and roll .
Even the sex and drugs part of rock represent a sacred tradition , because sex , if used properly , can lead to enlightenment or power , as can alcohol or drugs but they are considered rather dangerous for unprepared individuals , so a variety of spiritual traditions in the far east ( India with Tantra and Aghora ) , Shamanic cultures , and even , from what I know of the Santerian require long periods of preparation before these substances are used for spiritual purposes .
Here in the United States , all you need is a fake ID , a drug connection , and ( maybe ) a condom and you 're all set . ( 3 )
Anyone who has ever been to a rock concert sober knows the sense of power you feel from seeing thousands of fans masses and most of us have been witness to the power of sex , either in our own lives or through proximity .
Jim Jones ( and many sect leaders ) slept with his female devotees not only for pleasure , but for power and dominance .
The Hare Krishnas ( ISKCON ) also had stories of rogue Western gurus who abused their positions for sexual dominance .
( 4 ) The organization has made major changes over the past twenty years to ensure that the power struggles and corruption that plagued certain parts of the organization in the 1980's do not recur ) .
And think to the recent Heaven 's Gate cult the leader , plagued by guilt or fear over his homosexuality , convinced many cult members to become Eunuchsactually , somewhat perversely following a pattern that exists in the early Western church of eunuchs ( Origen , one of the truly great early church thinkers and founders , was a Eunuch .
Moving into music , it was a well - known custom in certain circles to castrate male choirboys in order to retain the high pitched purity of their voices , although this was apparently , done more for aesthetic reasons than spritual if only they had been blessed with the falsetto control of , say , Frankie Valli .
It happens in certain pagan traditions also - according to one who claimed to belong to a family of witches , Alex Sanders , ritual castration was once part of becoming a witch ( he got away with a nicked scrotum , though ) .
In India , certain dovotees of Shiva engage in surgery to eliminate sexual desire to this day , and a very bizarre group the Harridan go from village to village looking for male children with either deformed sexual organs or with hermaphroditic tendencies , and claim these children as part of their group .
The group dress in women 's clothes and have a reputation for being powerful magicians .
It is rare that parents refuse their demand for a child , because of the fear of a curse .
These individuals take the child , cut away all vestiges of maleness and travel the country , telling fortunes and offering magic remedies to villagers while seeking new recruits .
Power , intoxication and the creative energy of the universe ( sex ) are difficult to withstand .
Many sects call for abstinence , for similar reasons abstinence builds up energy in most people , which can be transmuted to satisfy the goals of the group or given proper guidance , can be channeled through the body to create higher states of consciousness .

Watch an evangelical meeting sometime ( or better yet a snake handling session watch this on TV ! ) --- you 'll see , in many cases , the kind of fervor connected with a rock concert , If you witness a coven meeting ( which is not as tough to do now as in the past ) you will notice the same kind of energy .
I have seen cabalistic and Santerian rituals ( no animal sacrifice ) that have similar energy .
I have been part of Hindu rituals that have the same energy as a great musical experience , and I have been at concerts that have a truly sanctified feeling to them .
But the experiences range from the ecstatic ( Mahavishnu , Alice Coltrane , Magma , Cecil Taylor ) to the oddly detached ( Leo Smith and Marion Brown , or ZAJ , led by Walter Marchetti and Juan Hidalgo , two Cage disciples ) to the traditional ( Korean Ah Ahk Theatre , Gamelan , Hare Krishna temple celebrations , chanting , church ) .
Some included the desire to communicate and make more money in the process - Chick Corea 's move to fusion , starting with the Moreira - Purim Return to Forever through the Mahavishnu - inspired groups , coincided with his involvement in Scientology .
Although it is not known how deeply involved Coryell was with spirituality after he left Sri Chinmoy 's tutelage , his most successful band , the Eleventh House , was named for an astrological term .
Some of the classical pieces that were inspired by spiritual concepts , like Messiaen 's work ( " Quartet for the End of Time " comes to mind , but there are so many more ) , Dane Rudhyar 's pieces , Bach 's religious works , Stravinsky 's pieces , Penderecki ( The Passion of St. Luke ) , Michael Tippett 's The Vision of St. Augustine and King Priam ( in both pieces the lead character has a vision of the totality of creation all at once ; this is similar to some Hindu concept of God realization ) ; Stockhausen 's Hymnen and Mantra , and even Cage pieces inspired by Zen , are truly amazing they are great pieces of art no matter what the context and I am not even touching upon one tenth of all the great religious pieces .
Oddly enough , because spirituality and overindulgence in sex and drugs have both produced some great music , it is tempting to look for a link and there is .
Both elements involve a loss of identity and surrender to something else God , wine , bliss .
Certain types of reggae ( such as dub ) and certain varieties of psychedelic ( and later ) rock and jazz showed some extraordinary music that would probably not have been made without the influence of intoxicants .
Sometimes intoxicants precipitated a crisis that led to other things .
We are all familiar of the various stories of how drugs ( particularly alcohol , psychedelics , speed , and the harder drugs -- cocaine and heroin in particular have wreaked havoc on people 's lived .
This has brought on death ( Charlie Parker , Jimi Hendrix , Jim Morrison , Kurt Cobain and Keith Moon to name a select few ) , ruined or interrupted careers ( Syd Barrett , Brian Wilson , Peter Green , Skip Spence , Ginger Baker , and David O'List ) or led to lame music ( Eric Clapton and Lou Reed ) to name the two people I wished had n't performed when they were on drugs ) and animal abuse ( accidentally on Ozzie Osbourne 's part , intentionally for which my estimation of him went down enormously on the part of John Cale ) .
But Santeria and Voodoo regularly engage in animal sacrifice , and many religions around the world , including Biblical Judaism and certain older sects of Hinduism , engaged in animal sacrifice .
But these seem to be used for the release of energy , which I think is totally unnecessary and to be honest , repellant .
Linking the pattern back to spirituality , part of the myth of Syd Barrett relates how he was interested in joining a sect of mid-Eastern mystics who practiced astral travel to planets also practiced in India  but the group felt he was too immature to handle it .
He resorted to a diet of LSD in order to produce the effect explaining the emphasis on the first two Floyd LP 's but burned himself out from chronic use of LSD , from which he has apparently still not recovered .
Syd sacrificed himself to his spiritual and material ambitions in a pattern not very different from martyrs and has n't rock has its share of " martyrs " to its life style , such as Hendrix , Morrison , Moon , Cobain and Laughner , to name just a few ?
But there are also stories of marvelous second chances , like John Coltrane 's incredible rebirth and spiritual awakening in the 1960's .
But these are very rare and Coltrane only had a short span of time in which to spread his new gospel .
Disciples like Pharaoh Sanders and his wife Alice Coltrane , despite great initial popularity , vanished into obscurity by the late 1970's ( although they re-emerged ) and the ones who exceeded Coltrane 's spirituality ( like Ayler ) were found dead in the East River in the late 1960 's under bizarre circumstances .
Although Coltrane really got into some incredibly mystical places ( albums included titles like the churning " Meditations " ( this piece sounds like one of the foundation stones for the German Free Jazz scene of Brotzmann and the late Peter Kowald ) , Om , Interstellar Space ( homages to the planets in duets with drummer Rashied Ali ) and the comparatively tame classic A Love Supreme .
Ayler 's entire set of work was spiritually based . , from his earliest to his last lame rock - based work .
Titles like " Witches and Devils , " " Ghosts " and " Universal Indians " barely hint at Ayler 's ecstatic virtuosity .
Anybody who just thinks he was blowing straight simple themes should listen with care to , for example , " Ghost " on his Love Cry LP in which he dances in and out of the melody , dropping notes and catching them intentionally like he was using the silences as a type of spiritual counterpoint , while Milford Graves does everything he can to avoid keeping a beat and Alan Silva keens to the higher consciousness .
It 's an amazing , ECSTATIC performance quite startling .
Are the missing notes being played by the Ghosts ?
And Sun Ra 's interest in Egypt , and spirituality was not just for show .
When I met him and spoke with him in 1973 ( it was an interview in only the loosest sense of the word more of a Sun Ra lecture ) , one of the things he told me to do was to look up a book that I would be interested in at the University of California at Berkeley .
The book Urantia has to be one of the strangest books ever written it was written through a technique that would later be called " channeling " but was composed in the early twentieth century by a spirit possessing a well - placed man in an apparently well - placed group of people .
If such a thing were to happen today , there would be a rush to record it or make a television series about it .
But , being " well - placed " at that time meant that you would not want anyone else to know of this , so a group met and recorded the book in secret .
The book purports to be a history of the universe told from the creation , and Ra was fascinated by it .
In one of the chapters of the book , it spoke of Green , blue , orange people so much so that Ra felt this was why people had distinct color preferences throughout their lives .
Somebody who liked green clothing was probably a green person in previous lifetime .
He also spoke freely about angels and UFO abductions he had experienced .
This was in 1973 , long before this kind of thing became popular .
Albert Ayler also had a famous vision in which he and his brother were zapped by a flying saucer but were immune to its negative effects because they possessed holy marks .
This type of dream is not dissimilar to the belief in certain Indian sects that UFO 's represent highly evolved spiritual beings who are intent on deceiving humanity for their own ends the one populated by faerie , vampires , ghosts and all the occult mischief makers .
(5 ) Interestingly enough , in some meditation circles , some folks seem to encounter UFO - like characters when they start to make spiritual progress , but these characters are considered distractions , not helpers .
My meeting with Sun Ra marked a time ( 1973 ) during which interest in the metaphysical and the occult was just about as strong as it is now , but most of us tend to have relatively short memories , so we tend to forget that the sixties and its expansion into drugs also led to a major concurrent interest in the occult and the spiritual life .
For example , astrology was HUGELY popular in the 1960's ; interest in Eastern Gurus , thanks in no small measure to the Beatles involvement with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the Hare Krishna , was enormous .
I can recall kids in college leaving to join spiritual groups and interest in Wicca or White Magic was also quite high .
So we had a major influence of different gurus affecting musicians who had come out of the drug culture , or even who needed a refuge .
Among the folks who were disciples of different gurus were of course , the Beatles who aligned themselves with TM and ISKCON the International Society for Krishna Consciousness appealed to John for a brief while , George died an adherent to ISKCON .
" The Fool on the Hill " was originally , the story goes , dedicated to the Maharishi and most of The White Album was written in retreat in India ) .
The Doors were into TM though Morrison was initiated into TM before the Beatles involvement : Morrison was the shaman who sacrificed himself for his vision , too in love with living on the edge to see the danger .
The Beach Boys were also TM devotees , but it was too late for poor Brian Wilson , who stopped work on Smile because he was sure that his music caused some of the Topanga Canyon fires .
Other followers were The Rascals whose song " It 's Wonderful " is their TM tribute .
There was also Pete Townshend , who devoted himself to Meher Baba - " Baba O'Riley " on Who 's Next name checks him and Townshend 's first solo album Who Came First was almost entirely written in dedication to him .
The jazz - rock contingent seemed drawn to Sri Chinmoy as John McLaughlin , Carlos Santana , Larry Coryell and Brian Auger were all devotees at one point in their lives .
Chinmoy seemed to attract instrumental virtuosos while he himself is known for the thousands of songs and paintings he completed , as well as his feats of strength ) .
And of course , there was Alice Coltrane ( whose best work , Universal Consciousness , was inspired by her spiritual interests and other musicians , like the late Larry Young ( Khalid Yasin ) went over to Islam ( as did Cat Stevens ) .
And many AACM musicians ( from Muhal Richard Abrams to Kalapurusha Maurice McIntyre ) were drawn to African and Jewish spirituality .
Other folks were drawn to Western Magick , like Graham Bond ( who committed suicide in 1975 ) , Robert Fripp ( in the early 1970 's before his involvement with Western guru J. G. Bennett and the Gurdjieff group ) , and of course , folks like Stevie Nicks .
But what of the heavy metal tradition the one most intimately ( and publicly ) connected to the " darker forces " ?

But the interest in the weird extra forces of the progressive rock world came to a head between 1971 and 1975 , when : 1 ) Magma came to pre-eminence ; 2 ) King Crimson became interested in Wicca ( the Wetton - Cross - Bruford Group ) ; 3 ) Yes composed titanic works dedicated to Theosophy ( followed by Todd Rundgren just a little later .
(7) These are only the three most obvious .
Vander actually developed his own language based upon a time when he was playing free jazz in a club .
As the story goes , he was playing to an unappreciative audience ; and he thought about the people who were dying to play this music ( think Coltrane  Vander viewed Coltrane as his major hero according to the press of the time ) and he wished the audience dead and he was going to tell them .
What came out of his mouth , if we are to believe him , was the foundation of Kobaian , the language of all of the Magma music .
This concept is quite a bit like " Glossalia , " or speaking in tongues when possessed by the Holy Spirit , a phenomenon documented in every religion in the world .
Also , I can recall a hell of a lot of apocalyptic thinking at the timeone of the reasons that Fripp gave for disbanding King Crimson in 1975 was because he thought the world was going to undergo massive disasters in 25 years and the idea of running a group seemed frivolous to him ; the story changed shortly after , to the " small mobile intelligent units " concept favored by Fripp , Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno , but apocalyptic thinking was the first reason I saw in print .
Not tough to see why escalating energy prices and unemployment were starting to worry folks , and there was a real feeling of doom ( perhaps fed by too much drug consumption ) in the mid-1970's .
The advent of Punk and Disco only seemed to make people more convinced that things would get worse and that it was time to get spiritual in time for a variety of Gurus ( eastern and Western ) to fill the gaps that the cessation of drugs and partying brought .
Also , pieces that had no occult origins like Mike Oldfield 's " Tubular Bells " acquired satanic connotations because of its lifting of Terry Riley 's trance ideas , and , of course , its use in the film The Exorcist .
In certain areas , ( mainly industrial England and heartland USA ) groups with huge Marshall Amplifers , and distorted guitars realized how ominous such sounds could be .
They took the basic concept of Cream , the Who and Hendrix , slowed down the beat and voila , Satanic heavy metal is born .
The forerunner is probably Black Widow , an obscure English group from the late 1960's who teamed up with our friend Alex Sanders ( see above ) caused a minor sensation with their live shows ( featuring a nude female celebrant at the end ) and releasing one album which faded into obscurity because their record company wanted to push Simon and Garfunkel instead of them !
So much for their association with Sanders ( according to them , the most powerful man in England ) .
Many groups , like the Crazy World of Arthur Brown ( who Ritchie Unterburger correctly identified as the daddy and grand daddy of all the latter " Satanic " rockers ) , Atomic Rooster , Black Sabbath , Kiss , and Alice Cooper , that were essentially Hammer studios and Hollywood visions of the occult world accidentally evil or occult at best , but entertaining for the spectacle .
The Stones , you will recall , were also involved in their earlier years of course they had a certain number of songs and album titles in their early years .
(8) And of course , there was " Dancing With Mr. D " and " Sympathy for the Devil " but their real involvement was with the films of Kenneth Anger , author of Hollywood Babylon .
Anger was a Luciferian satanist and also a devotee of Alesiter Crowley ( who was not a Satanist ) and the movies he mad with the Stones help were a bit bizarre , disturbing , and ultimately incoherent , like Bunuel / Dali on a bad day .
This interest lasted a very short while for the Stones ( probably 1968 - 1971 ) but the stigma stuck .
But they were the bad boys - it was expected .
The other fellow who exploits in this area are best known is our friend Jimmy Page .
Jimmy Page was fascinated with Aleister Crowley and eastern mysticism ( remember " Kashmir " ? ) , but the interest with Crowley lasted for more than a few years .
The late Aleister Crowley ( aka " the Beast " because , as he remarked , his mother called him that ) was born into a fundamentalist Christian family who also owned a brewing company .
In his early college years , he essentially started tapping into his family 's fortune and quickly spent it all .
He was involved in the Golden Dawn , a group of occultists from turn of the century England who also included W. B. Yeats among its members .
Crowley was invited in by McGregor Mathers one of the founders of the organization who perceived Crowley as brilliant , and tried to enlist his assistance in a battle for control of the group .
After a long series of disputes within the group , Crowley was out , and formed his own lodge ( Mathers was disgraced and died soon after ) , and the Golden Dawn turned more introspective and cautious .
But Crowley was convinced of his special role in the world , engaging in sex magick , drugs , esoteric rituals and demonic possession .
Although he still exhibited a high level of influence through the late 1930's ( and a great deal of press as " the Most Evil Man in the World " ) , his influence waned through the 1940's and he passed away in 1947 .
Although it sounds like he was just a profligate junkie , his contributions to the " new age " movement and occultism were considerable he was quite brilliant ( although incredibly egotistical , nasty and arrogant ) .
He wrote and " ghosted " wrote many significant works of occultism , including jobs for Evangeline Adams ( who made headlines as an astrologer in the early twentieth century ) and Gerald Gardner ( this was the man generally regarded as leading the Wiccan revival in England in the late 1940's , when it was still against the law to be a witch ) .
Crowley 's general decline can be seen as starting when he started to get addicted to opium and heroin , among other substances .
Israel Regardie , who served as his personal secretary , allegedly said that Crowley was a genius with the emotional development of a ten year old boy which , when you come to think of it , is a good description for a great many famous rock performers .
Page 's involvement with the Crowley legacy extended to the purchase of one of Crowley 's homes , and the symbols that adorned Led Zeppelin IV .
" Stairway to Heaven " was certainly a mystical piece of music ( it was praised by Kenneth Anger as being the most " luciferian " pieces of Page 's work a definite compliment if you view Lucifer , as Anger did , as a representation of truth and beauty ) , but Page never made it to the stage of finishing a soundtrack to Anger 's movies .
There are allegations that some members of the group blamed the death of John Bonham and other untoward events upon Page 's involvement with Crowley ; but Bonham 's drinking was getting out of hand even before Page 's involvement with Crowley .
The break up of Led Zeppelin probably did n't end Page 's involvement with Crowley , but the public knowledge and interest in this probably declined at that stage .
The interesting thing is , in the late 1970's , especially with the advent of punk , a lot of groups seemed to back away from occult ( particularly positive occult ) involvement , but the advent of " Death Rock " or occult rock , which developed in s slow pattern through the following bands : Black Widow - Atomic Rooster - Black Sabbath Angel Witch - Venom - Pagan Altar - Widow - Witchfynde - Hell Satan - Cloven Hoof  Warhammer - Onslaught - Sabbat  Antichrist - Ragnarok - Cradle Of Filth - Megiddo Bal Sagoth - December Moon  Ewigkeit - Adorior - Hecate - Enthroned - Phantasia - Forefather - Meads Of Asphodel - Reign Of Erebus Thus Defiled - Old Forest - Annal Nathrakh .
They all showed a steady but consistent interest in the underworld as a source of inspiration , although , as I indicated earlier , the evolution is part occult interest , part show biz .
Throbbing Gristle even had a bit of a run in occult circles and Genesis P. Orridge has an interest in the works of Austin Osman Spare , a contemporary of Crowley 's who established the foundation of a system called Chaos magic , which draws heavily on tapping into the patterns of nature ( such as repeating sets ) and partially on Shamanic - inspired altered states of consciousness which sort of fits in well with techno and other dance systems as a metaphysical delivery agent .
In the progressive world , Fripp continued his involvement with discipline , Art Ensemble founder Joseph Jarman got more deeply involved with his dojo , and the Belgian groups Present and Univers Zero put out gloomy CD after gloomy CD with strong senses of foreboding .
The 1980's also saw a great deal of interest in H.P. Lovecraft 's work .
Lovecraft was a writer from Providence , RI who was active in the 1920's and who developed intense and foreboding mythologies about the elder gods who ruled the earth before the advent of humans and who waited to seize it again .
Their worshippers were snake - like races who seemed more inspired by the influx of Southern European immigrants into the Northeast during Lovecraft 's time than by any recorded legends .
( Lovecraft was an introverted xenophobe .
But Lovecraft inspired more than a few groups , including Caravan (! ) , Magma , and Univers Zero .
Other groups , that emerged in the 1980's , such as Megadeath , Ministry and Slayer , had a stronger connection with the instrumental posture of groups like Black Sabbath , but the instrumental prowess greatly exceeded that of the earlier groups .
Slayer , in particular , in their earlier albums , played with a frenzy close to that of free jazz , and a truly threatening vocal style that inspired folks like Rob Zombie ( from the old industrial city of Lowell , Massachusetts ) , but that lost a lot of its bite when you see folks like Trey Parker ( creator of South Park ) imitating it pretty flawlessly .
The difficult part of the late 1980's was that , with the advent of the PMRC and various Christian fundamental groups , and police looking for scapegoats , ANYTHING connected with mysticism or the occult was automatically tagged as SATANIC even folks like Rush and Alan Parsons show up under the Satanic heading , much to my ( and their ) astonishment .
The 1980's was also the period in which New Age music , a combination of ECM , Terry Riley , ethnic music , and a sprinkling of light electronics .
This started to gain an enormous audience of over - stressed former hippies and baby boomers trying to find music that would transport them , but not force their heads to work harder than they already were .
It was , in some ways , a search for a nice refuge from the hyper - materialistic eighties .
In the 1990's , interest in the occult and spirituality seemed to skyrocket to heights not seen since the mid-1970's .
The introduction of drugs into a culture among youth seems to generate interest in alternative spirituality , but interest in Wicca seemed to run high in the 1990's there are more Wiccans than Unitarians at this point and the increasing diverse environment of the United States and Western Europe are bringing in many more religious traditions , including areas as diverse and dissimilar as Santero , Voodoo , Hinduism and Buddhism , these often having houses of worship or outlets in the same community .
( 9 )
Millennium fever probably fueled a lot of interest in the occult , and disenchantment with mainstream religions also seemed at a peak in the mid to late 1990's .
Prosperity in the United States always has seen us experimenting we find that money does n't buy happiness , or we start looking for new things to entertain us .
Also , the Goth scene started to develop with a new intensity , becoming the hippie movement of the 1990's .
This started to develop interest in alternative religions .
( 10 )
In the later 1990's , as groups like Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson ( who is allegedly , a minister in the Church of Satan ) started to gain in popularity , the middle class and fundamentalist Christianity started to get very concerned again , but the ability to confine this stuff is less easy than in the days before the internet ( there must have been a great deal of gnashing of teeth when Tool thanked Satan for its Grammy award ! ) .
The ultimate ramifications of the September 11 , 2001 attacks have had the interesting effect of both increasing animosity towards foreign cultures and increasing interest , while the Church 's recent spate of sexual molestation cases all around the United States have increased interest in alternative religion .
Madonna , for instance , is interested in the Cabala and has had a Hindu ( Indian ) astrology reading done for her ( this is the system of astrology that I myself practice ) .
There has been an enormous upsurge in interest in the more metaphysically oriented music of the late 1960's and early 1970's ( Gong , Magma , Hawkwind , Terry Riley , etc. ) .
But people are also a bit insecure and afraid now it would only take one more successful terrorist attack to turn the U.S. into raging xenophobes .
What does that have to do with music ?
Nothing and everything .
Basically , even though I am not a big fan of some of the music I 've discussed here , it does make the entire musical scene a whole lot more interesting .
And I really do n't want to listen to either basic rock 'n ' roll or Christian rock ( although some of it sounds OK to me ) or even new age stuff .
I grew up in a time when virtually everything was possible in music .
One of the biggest disappointments in the world as it exists today is the fact that the music scene has remained as fragmented as it was in the mid-1970 's onward with segregated markets .
The thing that we all have to fight is the belief that we have nothing in common with the rest of the world .
The universal undercurrent in every spiritual teaching stresses our similarities the differences are for spice and flavor , not evil .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Footnotes :
1 . Many of you may recall these experiments , conducted as far back as the early seventies , in which various experimenters " demonstrated " that plants responded more positively to Mozart than , let 's say Megadeath .
The hidden factor that was not explained up front , was that the first lady who conducted these experiments hated loud rock , indicating the distinct possibility of bias .
Recent experiments have been less conclusive I seem to recall that now country and western music is the best but research also tends to indicate that plants seem to thrive if the researcher likes the music being used so plants could , and mine have , thrive on a diet of free jazz , art rock , and noise .
2 . The more insidious side of this is that science , our new religion , is expanding on the " classical " experiments and has produced " studies " that show that learners learn better to the music of Mozart which is odd , considering the fact that Mozart was more of a burnt out party boy than Ozzy Osboune and many subliminal learning tapes have modeled their music on a certain number of beats oer minute that are supposed to optimize learning .
In fact , a friend of mine who programs funk jazz you know , like the Yellow Jackets , and various other fusack entities has told me that many of the lighter ( yes , Virginia , there is lighter jazz than the Yellow Jackets all kidding aside , they are good musicians whose combination of elements just happen to annoy ME ) jazz stations and producers have the music calculated so it hits a certain number of beats per minute , etc. in the theory that it will sell products better .
On the surface of it , it makes sense , but , IF IT WERE TRUE , we would expect , let 's say , Kenny G. to be more popular than Bruce Springsteen or the Rolling Stones and this is clearly not the case .
But we will be stuck with lame jazz on the airwaves because of this misconception .
And we wo n't even get into Scientology 's take on this ( refer to the section on jazz rock and Chick Corea 's desire to reach people ) .
3 . There is a story circulating that Shree Rajneesh , the Rolls Royce Guru , used to preside over ecstatic dancing and ( allegedly ) even sexual acts performed by his disciples and , in so doing , gathered tremendous Siddhi or power .
4 . See the interesting book Monkey on a Stick for an interesting though some would say biased expose of the abuses of power in this organization , especially after Srila Prabhupada passed away .
5 . This theory is not dissimilar to a theory put forth by John Keel , a veteran UFO and occult investigator , who sometimes felt that UFO's were the latest manifestation of history 's contact with the unseen occult world .
6 . An odd bit of musical trivia is that the occult connection with music can be traced to the most bizarre of connections Desi Arnaz .
It seems Desi was allegedly involved in an offshoot of Santeria in Cuba and was a devotee of one of the deities in his native Cuba .
" Babalu " was apparently a tribute to this deity and one Santero ( Santerian Priest ) I know claimed that the conga rhythms in the " I Love Lucy " theme were actually used in worship to this deity .
And they were worried about Led Zeppelin and Ozzy in the seventies !
( Note to lawyers in the audience : I am not claiming that Desi was a Satanist !
7 . Things like the success of " Rhiannon " by Fleetwood Mac and " Dream Weaver " by Gary Wright showed mainstream acceptance of these themes .
But I think " Rhiannon " in particular , pales in comparison to pieces like " Tam Lin " from Fairport Convention , a song about the evil side of the faerie folk that sent chills through me when I saw them perform it without Sandy Denny .
8 . I can remember innocently doing a public relations flyer in my high school that stated " Their Satanic Majesties Request Your Presence at Our Spring Dance " and it was a spring dance for two Catholic high schools .
Went over like a lead balloon but I was Episcopalian and forgiven for my error .
9 . There have been increased attempts at Christian conversion in other cultures the underhanded shenanigans that have occurred in India with the intention of drawing Hindus away from their native religion are extraordinary , deceitful , and reprehensible  but we are living in a time of cultural exchange unparalleled since the late 1800's , personally and through the use of the Internet .

Sucked Into Space
Really neither , unless you want to call " outgassing " a slow explosion .
( I should warn you in advance that , since I am not an expert in space medicine , the following is only based on my general knowledge of astronautics and of physics .
However I believe I know enough to answer your question , and I hope any inaccuracies are minor . )
Because the human body is something like 85 % water , the behavior of water in space is the key to understanding this subject .
Suppose we fill a big bottle half full of water in a vacuum -- but let 's say not in zero g , on the ground rather -- at some temperature T , and then seal the bottle .
The water will begin to evaporate pretty quickly .
What that means is that some of the water molecules near the surface of the liquid will simply fly off into the vacuum .
How many molecules do this and how fast they escape depends on T -- there will be more , faster , if it is hot , and fewer , slower if it is cold .
But soon the empty part of the bottle will begin to have quite a few water molecules in it , until what was vacuum is filled with water vapor .
Then the molecules in the vapor part of the bottle will start hitting the liquid and sticking , until as there is more and more vapor , at some point the number of molecules returning to the liquid from the vapor will equal the number escaping from the liquid into the vapor .
( In order to keep T constant during this process , we will have to warm the bottle gently , as when water molecules escape from the liquid it will cool . )
But eventually we will arrive at a situation in which the temperature is still T , part of the bottle contains liquid water , and part contains water vapor ( no air , notice , since we started in a vacuum ) , and no more water seems to be evaporating from the liquid -- because in microscopic terms , the net of molecules escaping and returning is zero .
The pressure of the vapor depends on T only , and is called the vapor pressure p( T ) of water at a temperature T .
The figure shows a plot of the vapor pressure of water , along with an approximation ( dotted line ) which shows it is fairly well approximated by a high power of the absolute temperature K ( T [ K ] = T [ C ] + 273.2 ) .
What does all this mean for an unprotected person in space ?
The vapor pressure of water at body temperature , 98.6 F or 37 C , is about 0.93 pounds per square inch ( PSI ) , or 48 mm of mercury ( Hg ) .
For comparison , the pressure of the atmosphere is 14.7 PSI or 760 mm Hg .
Since the surrounding pressure is zero in space , water in the body might be expected to start boiling furiously , except for one important thing : the water in the body is very significantly contained by skin , blood vessels , etc .
If the vapor pressure at body temperature were 1 atmosphere , the results would be immediately disastrous , as the skin and blood vessels cannot contain such a high pressure .
The result might well be something like an explosion , certainly severe rupture and hemorrhaging from many points .
But since the actual pressure is only about 50 mm , we have to ask how much pressure can the skin and blood vessels really contain ?
Well , the normal blood pressure in the arteries is 70 - 150 mm
Hg , so there is no way the blood is going to boil in the arterial side of the circulatory system , so long as one has a working heart and normal blood pressure .
Furthermore , the arteries can contain at least 200 mm for short periods without rupture .
Even the veins have to withstand the pressure differences caused by gravity between head and feet when we stand up , and these must be of the order of 75 - 150 mm , well above 50 mm .
It appears to me that the main source of water loss will be through the lungs .
As soon as one is exposed to the vacuum , almost all of the air in the lungs will escape , since one cannot effectively contain more than a fairly low pressure , much less than 1 atmosphere , by closing the mouth and nose .
So taking a deep breath in advance wo n't help much .
After that , the lungs should fill with water vapor at about 50 mm pressure , mixed with some gases that are dissolved in the blood , oxygen and carbon dioxide certainly , and some nitrogen .
Because 50 mm is such a low pressure , I believe that a trained person could significantly slow the loss of water vapor and gases from the lungs by simply trying to keep the mouth and nose closed as much as possible .
Then unconsciousness and death would come when the amount of oxygen in the blood was sufficiently depleted .
The time for this to occur would probably depend on the oxygen content of the blood immediately prior to the depressurization ; it could range from a few seconds if you were caught in the midst of strenuous exercise , to possibly as long as a minute or more if one had some warning and were to hyperventilate in advance .
After death , water and gases would continue to escape slowly , and the interior of the body would cool off .
The cooling would cause the vapor pressure to drop even more ; at freezing temperatures it is less than 5 mm Hg .
Thus the escape of water vapor ( along with gases and other volatile substances ) would be progressively slower and slower .
This process is known as " outgassing " , and happens whenever anything with a significant content of volatile substances is placed in a high vacuum or in space .
In the end , the body would be entirely dried out , dessicated , and reduced to a small fraction of its original mass .

Friends have been asking me to guess what happened to the Boeing 777 that crashed while landing at London Heathrow the other day .
The preliminary report is that the pilots pushed the throttles forward for more power and the engines did not respond .
How is it possible for a $ 50 million airplane connected to $ 10 million engines to fail in this manner ?
The connection is through a collection of software known as a full authority digital engine control ( FADEC ) .
There is no mechanical linkage from the cockpit of a Boeing 777 to the engines .
If the software fails , the engines can not be controlled .
Could that ever happen ?
It happened in 2006 , according to
http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UBT/is_39_20/ai_n16766814 .
One engine was essentially killed by the software while the plane was trying to take off .
The failure was traced to “ a flawed software algorithm ” .
If the software flaked out on one engine and the same code runs on both engines , what is to stop the software from failing on both engines at the same time ?
http://www.aaib.gov.uk/latest_news/accident__heathrow_17_january_2008___initial_report.cfm is the preliminary report and the best guess answer at this point might be “ nothing stops the software from failing on both engines simultaneously ” .
[ September 2008 Update : Look as though we wo n’t be able to blame Windows Vista for this one …
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7598267.stm talks about the latest report from investigators and has a video .
It looks like the problem was simply ice in the fuel system .
Why the ice formed when it should n’t have and how the engines were both stopped almost simultaneously remain mysteries .
Details : official interim report ]
When will we get a Government that is prepared to say no to the bishops ?

Editorial by Terry Sanderson
Every year , as schools admission results are announced , the NSS receives a blitz of emails from parents who have been turned away from their local school — sometimes right next door to where they live — because they are n’t the “ correct ” religion or they do n’t go to church often enough .
They are told that their children must go somewhere else , sometimes quite a distance from their home , to get an education .
“ Surely this ca n’t be right , ” they say , “ Have I got a case for legal action ? ”
We have to tell them that they do not .
The discrimination is perfectly lawful , and there is nothing they can do about it .
We suspect the schools minister , Ed Balls , gets lots of similar complaints from outraged parents who simply were n’t aware that their lack of interest in religion renders them and their children second - class citizens when it comes to education .
As if being able to pick and choose their pupils on the basis of their parents ’ religion was n’t privilege enough , “ faith schools ” have also been operating other — not so legal — tests to ensure that they get only the cream of the pupil crop .
Some of them have even been “ suggesting ” that parents who want places might like to make “ donations ” and other financial commitments to the school .
Parents wanting the best for their children ( and what parent does n’t ? ) have no option but to play the elbow - or - be - elbowed game in which only the pushiest can win .
Atheists , or people who have been indifferent to organised religion , suddenly find a piety that they did n’t know they had and start attending church on a regular ( I mean , very regular ) basis .
Unless their faces are familiar at the local house of worship , they wo n’t get the all - important vicar ’s letter that gives them entrée to the school .
That ’s right .
In many instances , it is the vicar who decides who does and does not get a place in the local school .
The schools that we all , as taxpayers , have to pay for .
Ed Balls heard about these abuses and decided to check to see if there was any substance to the claims .
He found many “ faith schools ” flagrantly breaking the rules .
And he said so .
And like any politician who dares even look at a “ faith school ” with anything less than complete adoration , he brought the wrath of the religious establishment and its media supporters crashing down on him .
Look at some of these reactions in the right - wing press here :
After attacking faith schools , now Ed Balls turns his sights on grammar schools
Stalin would be proud of this grotesque attack on faith schools
Admissions breaches trivial , say faith schools
A middle England warning to Ed Balls : lay off faith schools
Nasty Ed Balls tears up Tony Blair 's homework
' Ed Balls is witch hunting faith schools '
and many others besides .
We do n’t know how Mr Balls is feeling after this drubbing .
If he was testing the water to see how far he could go with the reform of the religious schools system , then this might cause him to pull back .
( Just as his predecessor , Alan Johnson , did when he suggested that “ faith schools ” should be required by law to take 25 % of children from other religions and none .
The Catholic Church fell on him like a hoard of screeching banshees , and he was forced to perform what came to be known as the fastest U - turn in political history . )
The conventional wisdom is that any political party that tries to challenge the religious grip on schools “ has a death wish ” and will be shown the door at the next election .
“ Do n’t try it mate , or we ’ll punish you , ” is always the first cry of the bishops and cardinals when there is even the faintest whiff of change .
At one time that threat might have had real power – but does it anymore ?
Do the churches still wield that much influence among the population of this country that they can bring down a government with a click of their bejewelled fingers ?
( See next story for an indication ) .
Parents are asked by pollsters whether they think “ faith schools ” are a bad idea , or if they want their children to be educated in what amounts to an apartheid school system – between 60 % and 96 % say no .
But many still fight to get into religious schools .
Why ?
The answer , of course , is that they may not want faith schools , but they want good schools .
The perception that religious schools perform well can be countered with the argument that they achieve their results by selecting so ruthlessly .
If the religious schools were taken into local authority control and their religious selection criteria removed , the skilled teachers and the heads would still be there .
They would , though , be available to the whole population instead of just the privileged few .
Ed Balls has dipped his toe in the water and found it scalding hot .
But he should n’t necessarily assume that the churches have the power over the people that they claim to have .
One day a politician with guts will come along and stand up to the bullying bishops .
Then we ’ll know who really runs this country ’s education system .

Tis ’ the Season to Binge Watch : The Best New Shows to Watch in 2019
Temperatures may soon dip , but the streaming wars are just heating up !
On average , people spend six hours per day streaming video content from their favorite sites .
But with these awesome new shows , six hours might seem like chump change .
Here are a few of this year ’s best shows that you ca n’t miss out on !
Living With Yourself ( Netflix )
Starring Paul Rudd and …Paul Rudd , Living With Yourself is a dark comedy about what happens when you ’re forced to compete with a version of yourself that ’s better in every way .
Do n’t be fooled by the first episode — Living With Yourself gets increasingly funny and outrageous as it goes on .
And since each episode is only around 26 minutes , so you can binge the entire show in an afternoon .
Creepshow ( Shudder )
If you ’re a horror fanatic , Shudder is about to become your favorite streaming service .
Aside from dozens of original movies and series , as well as a vast library of classic and contemporary horror flicks , podcasts , and TV shows , your Shudder subscription now includes the fantastic Creepshow .
Part homage to the classic Stephen King / George Romero flick and part update , Creepshow offers the kind of a blend between horror and humor that we ’ve missed on TV .
To see what the fuss is about , you can also visit o2tvseries .
The Politician ( Netflix )
The Politician is House of Cards for teens and adolescents .
The series revolves around over - achiever and cutthroat teenage politician Payton Hobart and his friends / cabinet members ( did we mention he takes school politics seriously ? ) on their quest to win their classmates ’ votes .
While every character is flawed and unlikeable in their own horrible ways , by the time the final credits roll you might just find yourself surprised at how deep The Politician gets .
Castle Rock ( Season 2 ) ( Hulu )
After a divisive first season , Hulu ’s original Stephen King - based series is back for an all - new story .
This season , Castle Rock revolves around Annie Wilkes — yes , the Annie Wilkes from King ’s dread - inducing story Misery and her struggle to combat her psychotic tendencies .
While you ca n’t binge every episode right away , the first three episodes are available for streaming right now , with new episodes hitting each Wednesday .
American Horror Story : 1984 ( FX / FX Now )
American Horror Story has had its ups and downs .
Okay , mostly downs .
Still , it ’s a guilty pleasure of ours , and this season is perhaps the franchise ’s best .
1984 draws heavily from classic slasher flicks like Friday the 13th , Sleepaway Camp , and Maniac , making for a gore - soaked camp - fest that still includes plenty of AHS ’ signature humor .
The Righteous Gemstones ( HBO )
With its freshman season wrapping up a few weeks ago , The Righteous Gemstones might be HBO ’s best new series this week .
Gemstones features an all - star cast including John Goodman , Eastbound & Down ’s Danny McBride , Workaholics ’ Adam Devine , stand - up star Edi Patterson , and Justified ’s Walton Goggins as the owners of a family - operated megachurch .
Suffice to say , just about everyone in the cast has ulterior motives , causing some serious chaos .
But what ’s truly impressive about Gemstones is how each story intertwines in satisfying and often surprising manners .
Do n’t get caught misbehavin’ , catch up on The Righteous Gemstones stat !
The Best New Shows to Binge
These new shows should be enough to keep you busy for a while , so grab a blanket and some popcorn and cuddle up .
It ’s time to binge !
And when you ’re done with these new shows , make sure to come back for even more info on the best entertainment .
Bad behaviour in schools is being fuelled by " overindulgent " parents who do n't know how to say no to their children , according to new research .
Teachers are dealing with a " small but significant " number of pupils who throw tantrums in class if they do n't get their own way , turn up exhausted because they stay up late and have increasingly " belligerent " parents who take their child 's side .
" These parents , themselves under social pressure and often unable to deal with their own children 's behaviour , could be highly confrontational , sometimes resorting to violence in protecting their children 's interests , " the Cambridge University study , commissioned by the National Union of Teachers , said .
" Teachers described ' highly permissive ' parents who admitted to indulging their children , often for the sake of peace or simply because they had run out of alternative incentives or sanctions . "
Steve Sinnott , NUT general secretary , said parents were under increasing pressure because of the commercialisation of childhood .
" Some parents are struggling to cope with their children .
Parents seem to be trying to cope by indulging their children , and perhaps more accurately overindulging their youngsters , " he said .
The Cambridge University study revisited primary schools which were involved in a study five years ago .
In 2002 , schools reported that their greatest problem was trying to control classes bored by a narrow and unchallenging curriculum .
Last year the same schools told the researchers they were getting better at navigating the constricts of the curriculum to engage pupils , but were facing new behaviour problems in the face of a " rapidly changing social scene " .
" Faced with deteriorating standards of behaviour and a more belligerent stance from some parents , primary schools were becoming more like secondary schools , instituting formal recording systems whereby incidents were logged and behaviour monitored , " it said .
Interviews with 200 teachers , and hundreds of pupils and parents revealed families struggling to control their children .
One mother said she considered the fact that her son went to bed at 1 am a success as previously he had refused to sleep before 3 am ; and a six - year - old told his teacher how to go about " killing pimps and prostitutes " after mastering the Grand Theft Auto computer game .

Cognitive Complexity as a Personality Dimension
Complexity refers to the extent to which an individual or organization differentiates and integrates an event .
Differentiation is the number of distinctions or separate elements ( i.e. , factors , variables ) into which an event is analyzed .
Integration refers to the connections or relationships among these elements .
Persons who are high in cognitive complexity are able to analyze ( i.e. , differentiate ) a situation into many constituent elements , and then explore connections and potential relationships among the elements ; they are multidimensional in their thinking .
Complexity theory assumes that the more an event can be differentiated and the parts considered in novel relationships , the more refined the response and successful the solution .
While less complex people can be taught a complex set of detailed distinctions for a specific context , high complexity people are very flexible in creating new distinctions in new situations .
Research on complexity shows some of the following conclusions of relevance to managers :
Information : Complex people tend to be more open to new information , rely on their own integrative efforts than new information , seek more novel information , search across more categories of information , and are less externally information bound .
They tend to take in more information and form more well rounded impressions than less complex persons .
Attraction : People of high complexity are attracted to each other and to less complex people , while people of lower complexity are usually attracted only to each other based on similar content ( e.g. , similar attitudes ) .
Flexibility : Complex persons are more flexible in thinking , and may demonstrate more fluency of ideas in creativity .
Social Influence : Less complex persons are more stable in attitudes , more prone to polarize on an issue , and less affected by environmental changes .
However , attitude change may be easier when incongruent information is made highly salient .
In contrast , highly complex persons change attitude more easily ; presumable because they consider greater variety of information resulting in more moderate attitudes .
Problem Solving : Complex people tend to search for more different kinds of information when faced with a decision problem .
They are often less certain after a decision , especially if verification is unavailable .
Strategic Planning : Complex individuals are better strategic planners due to consideration of more information , from more perspectives , and greater flexibility in considering alternatives .
They usually develop more inclusive long range goals , consider wider range of implications , and develop more complex develop strategies .
Communication : Complex persons are more effective at a communication - dependent task .
They are more resistant to persuasive attacks if inoculated ( e.g. , have been trained in counter arguments ) .
Creativity : Flexibly complex persons are able to generate more novel , unusual , and potentially remote views and actions .
Leadership : Leaders are generally more complex but must be able to be flexible across situations as the environment changes .
They are also high integrators in which they are able to relate complex patterns of many elements .
Greater complexity may not be helpful or useful under certain conditions :
When the person is unable to " turn off " complex perceiving , processing , or responding when it becomes inappropriate .
When the problem requires a rapid and simple response .
When the environment or organizational culture is incompatible with complexity .
When a high degree of openness does not permit closure on a decision .

Flash memory will eventually become cheap enough to become a viablereplacement for CDs , DVDs and possibly Blu-ray discs , assuming people still want to buy music and movies on physical objects in coming years .
SanDisk is betting they will .
The company plans to announce Wednesday the first installment of its plan to deliver music on microSD cards .
So far there 's only one offering : SansaSessions , a DRM - free promotional MP3 compilation on a 512 - MB card .
Assembled with the help of Nonstop Riot , the compilation includes 50 songs by bands like All Time Low ,
Architecture in Helsinki , Magnet , Ladytron , Loquat , Nada Surf , OfMontreal and TheCoup .
Aside from being a nice freebie for early U.S. purchasers of the 8 - GB Fuze MP3 player ( which has a microSD slot ) , the comp is also meant to demonstrate to the rest of the industry the use of tiny physical media as a distribution platform .
However , Sandisk 's plan comes at a time when physical music formats are on the decline .
" It 's a pretty tough business proposition right now , " said JupiterResearch associate Michael Greene .
" We have seen
sales of physical formats decline sharply in recent years , we 're not expecting that trend to change any time soon . "
In addition , those who prefer physical formats may not see theallure of microSD .
" The attachment is to the format , the artwork andextras that come with having a CD , " Greene added .
" It 's hard for me tosee someone having an emotional attachment to a little microSD card . "
The analyst also pointed out that while SanDisk 's Sansa Fuze and certain cellphones have microSD slots , the format hardly has
the install base of the CD .
The cards could be stacked , so to say , against a form of physical media that 's not
universally compatible .
There 's another cause for skepticism .
Seven years ago , a DataPlay
executive told me that Tower Records would soon be stockingshelves with music stored on his company 's physical media format .
The DataPlay cartidges never showed up , despite the prototypes , and Tower Records closed its U.S. stores .
But unlike DataPlay , microSD already has an install base .
SanDisk representatives indicated that this announcement is just the tip of the iceberg .
The companyalready makes a 12 - GB microSDHC card that can hold two DVD - quality movieswith room left over .
With flash prices expected to continueplummeting , the future could be surprisingly rosy for this physicalformat , even as the focus elsewhere turns to digital distribution .
Dan Schreiber , senior vice president of SanDisk 's A/V division , described microSD as a possible format for music distribution :
" Artists want to give their fans an easy andlegal way to experience and share their music , while labels are looking for aform of physical distribution with more usability than the CD .
The SansaSessions promotion is a great opportunity to explore this new format and gives bothartists and labels a glimpse of the potential for music distribution in thismedium . "
The Sansa Store
already sells music , movies and games on CD , DVD , SACD and otherformats , and a microSD card section would be a natural fit there .
Partnerships with Hollywood and the music industry couldfollow .
The new compilation consists of DRM - freeMP3 files , but a source inside the company says SanDisk is working onways to secure content onto cards , which could help build those relationships .
In the long term , the company 's strong alliance with Best Buy could also come into play ( SanDisk 's Sansa MP3 players sell briskly at the chain ) .
Best Buy also likesto sell CDs and DVDs because they bring in repeat customers who buy other products .
The same rules could apply to new forms of physically distributed media .
Retailers and the entertainmentindustry could see SanDisk 's prefilled microSD cards as somethingof a savior .
And , under the right circumstances , users could find reasons to appreciate them too : ease of use , ability to resell media and sneakernet trading , for starters .

Kluster is a new effort to harness the power of online social networks to collaborate and work together on projects .
At its core , the system involves a virtual currency ( " watts " ) which are invested in projects started by community members .
Projects can be " sparked " with ideas , and users collaborate in work phases to build a product online .
Some projects are financed by real - world money , which makes it way back to the community members who invest their time , " watts , " and ideas into the project .
The site gives the example of a logo design -- I could put up a challenge to design a logo , back it with $ 500 , and let the community go to work for me .
At the end , my $ 500 is distributed among community members who took a stake in the project , and I get the design ( or designs ) they created .
Neat , huh ?
Kluster is currently making a splash at TED , creating a brand new product in just 72 hours -- and offering $ 15,000 in rewards to fund the work .
The product is still under development ( until tomorrow ) , and currently it 's shaping up to be an educational game .
Currently work is proceeding on creating the game cards ; the next phase will design the packaging , then the marketing campaign , and so on .
You can sign up for free at Kluster.com .
Because there 's a lot of lingo involved ( " sparks , " " amps , " " watts , " and so on ) , it 's a good idea to take a video tour of the site first .
You can also read a bit more about the site 's origins at ReadWriteWeb .
This has got to be one of the most amazing clock designs I ’ve ever seen .
At first glance , the display looks like a bunch of random matchsticks , but over time , they gradually transform into words that tell the time .
Conceived by Dutch industrial designer Christiaan Postma , the clock goes beyond the simple dial and number paradigms we ’re all used to seeing , and really thinks outside of the box .
Postma used over 150 individual clock mechanisms to power the 55 - inch square timepiece .
For those of you with Flash installed ( who does n’t these days ? ) , check out the animation below to see how it really works .
At this point , it ’s not clear if Postma plans to produce the word clock , or if it ’s simply a design prototype .
Regardless , it ’s a really unique idea , and I ’d be thrilled to hang one on my wall if he ever does bring these to market .

And just think -- last year you were singing Dino Dai Zovi 's praises for taking control of a MacBook Pro in nine whole hours .
This year , the PWN 2 OWN hacking competition at CanSecWest was over nearly as quickly as the second day started , as famed iPhone hacker Charlie Miller showed the MacBook Air on display who its father really was .
Apparently Mr. Miller visited a website which contained his exploit code ( presumably via a crossover cable connected to a nearby MacBook ) , which then " allowed him to seize control of the computer , as about 20 onlookers [ read : unashamed nerds ] cheered him on . "
Of note , contestants could only use software that came pre-loaded on the OS , so obviously it was Safari that fell victim here .
Nevertheless , he was forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement that 'll keep him quiet until " Tipping Point can notify the vendor , " but at least he 'll have $ 10,000 and a new laptop to cuddle with during his silent spell .

Well , that 's a bunch of cr*p .
The reality is that right now Hillary Clinton needs roughly 70 % of the remaining pledged delegates to draw even and while that 's never going to happen , they can pretend it is a possibility .
Depending on how you count it she also needs an unrealistically large ( 60 % ) margin in popular vote from now on .
However , unless she wins BOTH North Carolina AND Indiana this will be impossible .
Look at the math .
Even if she wins Indiana by PA margins and Obama only wins NC by 1 % she can't recover her losses .
Right now the media is focusing on Indiana because it looks to be close there , but this is just another example of people following the Clinton spin that lets her chose her battles .
If we can get out there the framing that she needs to win both NC and IN , it will dishearten her supporters and bring them closer inline to the numerical realities of the campaign .
We need to tell everyone we meet that Hillary needs both and given that some of us have media connections we can try get this framing accepted .
Truly , if Clinton does n't make serious ground by taking the popular vote and pledged delegates in both she 'll be impossibly behind on both measures .
If we tell Clinton supporters the battle is already over , they will get angry ( I know , I 've tried ) , but if we tell them she needs to win both IN and NC they will be disheartened and when it fails to happen they will feel as if they have lost .
Anyway , just an idea .

Bad day for the beehive : Amy Winehouse
What 's a superstar to do when she wants to pop out for a kebab but does n't want to spoil her hairdo ?
Why , she reaches for a designer Fendi headscarf , of course .
Amy Winehouse may have had more pressing things on her mind than making a fashion statement , but the troubled singer was clearly determined to protect her trademark beehive during a break from a recording studio in London .
Troubled Amy , 24 , could find nothing to her taste in the High Street takeaway and left empty - handed – but at least not a hair was out of place .
Meanehile it has been reported that the Grammy winner 's marriage is on the rocks after she ignored her jailed husband 's birthday this week .
She failed to send a card to or visit Blake Fielder - Civil in Pentonville Prison when he turned 26 on Wednesday and according to friends she is now living as a " single woman " .
Fielder - Civil , who is charged with assault and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice , allegedly threatened Amy with divorce for repeatedly missing prison visits last year .
And a month ahead of their first wedding anniversary , he is now reportedly self - harming on a regular basis due to her continuing absence while he is behind bars .
Scroll down for more ...
Just out for a kebab : But Winehouse left the takeaway without her favourite treat
Miss Winehouse has been spotted recently with a series of bizarre phyisical problems .
Earlier the singer , who is writing the next 007 movie theme tune , stepped out of the recording studio looking worryingly thin .
Her legs were so skinny that a tendon could clearly be seen bulging out of her right thigh .
And late last month it emerged the award - winning singer was suffering from the bacterial skin infection impetigo after she stepped out of a kebab shop with spots and scabs on her wrinkled cheeks , chin and nose .
After Barack Obama ’s defeat in Pennsylvania , David Axelrod , his campaign manager , brushed it off : “ Nothing has changed tonight in the basic physics of this race . ”
He may well be right  but what a comedown .
A few months ago the Obama campaign was talking about transcendence .
Now it ’s talking about math .
“ Yes we can ” has become “ No she can ’t . ”
This was n’t the way things were supposed to play out .
Mr. Obama was supposed to be a transformational figure , with an almost magical ability to transcend partisan differences and unify the nation .
Once voters got to know him  and once he had eliminated Hillary Clinton ’s initial financial and organizational advantage  he was supposed to sweep easily to the nomination , then march on to a huge victory in November .
Well , now he has an overwhelming money advantage and the support of much of the Democratic establishment  yet he still ca n’t seem to win over large blocs of Democratic voters , especially among the white working class .
DIGG THIS
There is a movie called Idiocracy in which two average people partake in a hibernation project and end up 500 years in the future .
To their surprise , the people in society have turned into complete idiots .
Sometimes I feel like this is the world I am living in , especially lately with Earth Day .
The whole " green " movement is a joke and I am baffled by how many people have been swindled out there .
I have nothing against others helping the environment or nature , provided that it is done peacefully , but all of this environmental anguish is out of control .
Luckily , the average American is only talking about it and doing small symbolic gestures and is not ready to sacrifice their lifestyle .
Most of the so - called solutions we hear from so - called environmentalists are not really solutions at all .
They are ideas that simply make life for human beings more difficult and more expensive , while slowing down human progress .
The whole so - called environmental movement is anti-human and anti-freedom .
When communism collapsed in the late 80's and early 90's , it was given a bad name association , and rightly so .
The communists had to go into hiding and could no longer directly call for communism since their ideas had been discredited .
The communists decided to become environmentalists and take a new approach to their agenda .
If you 'll notice , nearly every single solution offered by the green movement is to impede human progress .
It also usually involves using the force of government or at least it is a suggestion that could later lead to government force .
The whole global warming debate has to be a hoax .
We live in a variable climate that has always varied as long as mankind has walked the earth .
If this year is warmer than last year , it means nothing .
If this century is warmer than last century , it means nothing .
Next week may be warmer or colder than this week .
It could go either way because we live in a variable climate .
Even the reports that the earth has warmed in the last century can be doubted .
Some of the official thermometers have been found to be within a short distance of pavement that attracts heat .
If the earth has actually warmed by a degree in the last century , so what ?
The century before that may have been 2 degrees warmer .
If you ever get a chance to see Greenland , you will find that it is mostly ice .
There is n't much green to it .
But the people that settled Greenland probably named it that for a reason .
Could it have been much warmer there when it was first settled centuries ago ?
Even if the earth is warming , it does n't mean it has anything to do with humans .
Most of the scientists that preach man-made global warming get their funding from government .
If they did n't preach man-made global warming , then their funding would miraculously disappear .
It is amazing how incentives work .
If the earth is warming , it might not be such a bad thing , especially for some of the brutal places near the poles .
But even if we did want to stop global warming from occurring , we certainly should n't turn to government and another FEMA - like agency .
Another green idiocracy issue is that of saving water .
The last time I checked , about two - thirds of the earth is covered in water .
There is this incredible process where water evaporates and is purified and falls as fresh water from the clouds .
It is like a huge filtration system for our planet .
It makes no sense when people talk about saving water .
We pay for water when we pay our water bill .
The more water you use , the more you pay for it .
It is just like any other good that we buy .
When you see areas that have a drought and a supply problem with water , that is an automatic indication that the government is interfering .
In a normal free market , if there is an increase in demand or a decrease in supply of something , the price rises .
This will decrease demand and may help increase the supply if the good can be obtained from another place that has a larger supply .
In areas with droughts , the government control of the water supply is really the only reason for a shortage .
If you walk into a grocery store in those areas , there will be plenty of bottled water on the shelves as this operates in a more free market environment .
Then we have recycling .
I have nothing against recycling , just government forced recycling .
This includes being forced to pay for others to recycle .
If it is worth it to recycle a particular material , then the free market will take care of this .
If the government forces you to pay for a recycling program , then it is not cost effective .
For example , if it costs an average of 5 cents per can to recycle soda cans and it saves only 4 cents per can in making new ones , then it is not worth it .
However , if they could be recycled at a cost of only 3 cents per can to later save 4 cents , then it may be worth it and some company may come in and do it and give you a monetary incentive to participate .
But if the government has to subsidize it , then it is a waste of money .
The same goes for more fuel - efficient vehicles .
If the price of gas gets high enough , it will be worth it for people to pay more for hybrid and other fuel - efficient vehicles .
You should n't need a government subsidy .
This also applies to ethanol .
If using corn to make ethanol for our gasoline were an efficient use of resources , the government would not have to " give " out billions of dollars in subsidies .
It actually uses more energy to make ethanol from corn than it produces , but this fact does n't even matter .
If it were really cheap to make ethanol or if ethanol could make your car get 500 miles to the gallon , then people would freely choose to use it out of their own self - interest .
But when the government has to force us to pay for it , we can all be certain that it is a waste of resources .
The ironic thing about the whole environment issue is that the governments of the world are by far the biggest destroyers of it .
When you hear about one of those forest fires raging in California , it most likely originated on government land .
The best answer to having a good environment is through strong property rights .
When individuals are secure in their property , they can confront those that infringe on their property with pollution or anything else , as the justice system would provide a remedy of the situation with possible restitution .
And more , when property is owned privately and not through the government , it is much more likely to be taken care of .
People will treat their own property with the respect that it deserves , whereas government property will be abused , neglected , and possibly destroyed .
People need to stop being so phony about going green and start thinking with their heads .
The green movement today does little , at best , to help the environment and it is a total waste of time and resources .

The Best of Geoffrey Pike
If anybody thought the Ron Paul Revolution had expired , they need to rethink that one .
Clearly , the 72 - year - old libertarian - minded Texas representative was not going to win the Republican Party 's nomination this year with his 12 , 20 or 42 delegates , whomever you believe .
Sen . John McCain already has enough to win the GOP nod in St. Paul in September .
So Paul has taken his well - funded campaign and gone rather underground to the local level where his loyal Paulunteers are organizin g and taking over numerous county party operations in several states .
Quietly , beneath the political radar of the Republican Party establishment and mainstream media , they 're laboring at the local level .
Last month Paul forces read the party rule book in Missouri and elected about a third of the delegates to the state convention that will pick the delegates to the national convention .
Last weekend in Nevada they drove through a rules change in the state party convention that halted the approval of pre-approved slates of convention delegates as a means to eventually substitute their own supporters to travel to St. Paul and boost Paul 's delegate totals for platform and other struggles this fall .
Using sophisticated communications techniques on the Nevada convention floor in Reno , Paul supporters transmitted mass text messaging to maneuver and direct their troops .
When Paul appeared to speak , the ovation was thunderous .
At other times they shouted down the convention chair , Sen. Bob Beers .
Taken by surprise the convention organizers and the McCain camp , which for instance had no supply of campaign signs to compete with the blizzard of Paul signs , eventually adjourned the convention in chaos without electing any delegates .
The excuse was the expiration of the convention 's contract with the host casino .
No new convention date was announced .
The Ron Paul crews move on to their next target .

TOKYO , March 13 , 2005  --
On the high - energy streets of Tokyo , bristling with so much life , a troubled teenager named Yoko says she constantly thinks of taking her own life .
" I want to die , " the 17 - year - old said .
And if she decides to go through with it , she 'll have plenty of company .
Japanese
Web sites offer countless invitations to join in group suicides .
It 's become one of Japan 's most morbid trends -- total strangers making meticulous arrangements online to kill themselves en masse .
The group suicides usually take place inside sealed cars , where people burn charcoal so that they will die of carbon monoxide poisoning .
Recently , seven people in Saitama , six in Kanagawa and four in Hokkaido have taken their own lives in this way .
Ritual suicides have long been part of Japanese culture , often considered the honorable way out of failure .
A best - selling book even offers advice on various methods .
But counselors at Japan 's few help lines are worried that the suicide Web sites are accelerating the trend by literally pushing people over the edge .
Hundreds of Options
Translators helped ABC
News check out these suicide sites .
A search turned up hundreds of messages from people contemplating ending their lives .
On one site , according to a translator , an 18 - year - old man wrote : " I 'm looking for someone who can die with me .
This is my decision to die .
I would appreciate if somebody joins me with a car . "
Journalist Tatsuya Shibuyi says the anonymity of the Web is tailor made for troubled people in Japan .
Most Japanese , according to Shibuyi , even when suicidal , are too embarrassed to talk face to face about personal problems -- so when they find other lonely people wanting to die , a group mentality takes control .
For many , it 's then scarier to back out than it is to follow through .
Yoko did find a suicide companion on the Internet , but has backed away for the moment .
She is seeing a psychiatrist , taking medication and trying to stay away from the suicide sites .
But when asked if she still wants to commit suicide , she says , " Yes . "
ABC News ' Mark Litke originally reported this story March 6 , 2005 , on " World News Tonight . "
A trillion dollars here , a trillion dollars there , and soon you ’re talking real money .
But when it comes to reporting on what the Bush war legacy has cost American taxpayers , the media have been shockingly indifferent to the highest run-up in military spending since World War II .
Even the devastating defense spending audit released Monday by the Government Accountability Office documenting the enormous waste in every single U.S. advanced weapons system failed to provoke the outrage it , and five equally scathing previous annual audits , deserved .
This is not about the waste of taxpayer dollars — already pushing a trillion — in funding the Iraq war , which , while reprehensible enough , pales in comparison to the big - ticket military systems purchased in the wake of 9/11 .
In the horror of that moment , the floodgates were lifted and the peace dividend promised with the end of the Cold War was washed away by a doubling of spending on ultra-complex military equipment originally designed to defeat a Soviet enemy that no longer exists , equipment that has no plausible connection with fighting stateless terrorists .
Example : the $ 81 - billion submarine pushed by Sen. Joseph Lieberman , presumably to fight al - Qaida ’s navy .
That ’s the huge scandal the media and politicians from both parties have studiously avoided .
But as the GAO ’s authoritative audit details , the costs are astronomical .
The explosion of spending on expensive weaponry after 9/11 had nothing whatsoever to do with the attacks of that day .
The high - tech planes and ships commissioned for trillions of dollars to defeat an enemy with no navy , air force or army , and using $ 3 knives as its weapons arsenal , were gifts to the military - industrial complex that will go on giving for decades to come .
The Iraq war may end someday , but rest assured that major weapons systems , once commissioned , have a life - support system unmatched in any other sector of public spending .
Rarely does the plug get pulled on even the most irrelevant and expensive war toy .
Not while both Democratic and Republican politicians feed at the same trough , and when so much is at stake in the way of jobs and profit .
Just how expensive and wasteful this is was marked in the GAO ’s audit : “ Since 2000 , the Department of Defense ( DOD ) has roughly doubled its planned investment in new systems from $ 790 billion to $ 1.6 trillion in 2007 , but acquisition outcomes in terms of cost and schedule have not improved . ”
Pentagon cost overruns , always a huge problem , have mushroomed .
As the GAO reported , “ Total acquisition costs for major defense programs in the fiscal year 2007 portfolio have increased 26 percent from first estimates , compared with 6 percent in 2000 . ”
I know eyes glaze when government budgets are discussed , but keep in mind that defense spending accounts for more than half of all the federal government ’s discretionary spending .
In short , funding for all the other stuff we argue about — science research , education , Arabic translators , insuring uninsured children — is minor compared to the waste on these military boondoggles that go unexamined .
Yet nothing else the federal government does involves such waste because we are talking about weapons systems shrouded in secrecy and protected from unwelcome scrutiny by the Teflon coating of “ national defense . ”
Credit the GAO for providing a rare glimpse into the most egregious waste of taxpayer dollars , concluding in its exhaustive , 205 - page report :
“ Of the 72 programs GAO assessed this year , none of them had proceeded through system development meeting the best - practice standards for mature technologies , stable design , or mature production processes by critical junctures of the program , each of which are essential for achieving planned cost , schedule , and performance outcomes . ”
That ’s a grade of zero for every major weapons system .
Let ’s take just one , the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , a program estimated to be worth $ 300 billion in sales to its manufacturer , Lockheed Martin , the nation ’s biggest defense contractor and most generous donor to lobbyists and politicians ’ campaigns .
The program to build what Lockheed boasts is “ the most complex fighter ever built ” is also the most expensive , with estimated acquisition costs having increased a whopping $ 55 billion in just the last three years .
Lockheed need not worry about future profits , because the procurement schedule on this troubled plane has been stretched out to the year 2034 .
As the GAO says , “ currently unproven processes and a lack of flight testing could mean future changes to design and manufacturing processes . ”
Hey , no problem , Lockheed will just add that to the taxpayer tab .
Maybe by 2034 , the plane will be ready to go take out Osama bin Laden .
Or not .

Post - mortem tests showed that Helen Maughan died from a combination of head injuries and drowning
Two drunken teenagers raped and murdered a mother - of - two before finally dumping her body in a river , a court heard .
Helen Maughan , 24 , was found floating half naked in a river two days after the brutal murder , the jury was told .
The teenagers aged 13 and 16 , who can not be named for legal reasons , bragged to friends about the killing , it is claimed .
When arrested the defendants , now 14 and 17 years old , then blamed each other for beating up the 5ft 1ins mum and throwing her into the River Colne in Colchester , Essex , on May 18 last year .
The pair were interviewed by police after being recognised by friends from CCTV shots taken from the night of the murder .
When detectives questioned the younger boy , he claimed his pal had threatened to kill him if he did not keep quiet , the jury heard .
Chelmsford Crown Court heard how the day began with the boys guzzling wine and Stella lager with friends before a chance meeting with drunken Miss Maughan , who asked to share their alcohol .
The 13 - year - old told police the three of them sat on a bench next to the river and claimed Miss Maughan tried to kiss him before asking him for sex .
He said he refused but the older boy became jealous and began rowing with the victim .
Sasha Wass QC , prosecuting , said : " The ( younger ) boy told police the older boy pushed her and she fell over .
" She then tried to head - butt the older boy but only just made contact and did not manage to injure him .
" According to the younger boy she was screaming .
" He told police the older defendant punched her about 20 times then elbowed her and stamped on her face .
" She was bleeding from the mouth and nose .
He remembers the older boy having blood on his trainers .
" He also remembers the older boy punching her in the throat . "
The younger boy described how his older peer began sexually assaulting the victim , Miss Wass said .
The 13 - year - old told police the older boy dragged her lifeless body two metres to the edge of the water , asking the younger boy to help but he claimed he refused .
When the older boy was arrested on the same day , July 31st last year he claimed that the 13 - year - old kissed Miss Maughan .
He added that was the last thing he saw after rolling a joint and passing out on the bench for up to 45 minutes .
The older boy told police when he woke he saw his friend dragging the unconscious woman towards the river by her ankles , it is claimed .
However , the court heard how both boys had boasted to friends about the killing before they were arrested .
Miss Wass said : " The older boy told a friend he had assaulted a girl badly and was n't sure if she was still breathing so put her in the river . "
She added : " It was not only the older boy bragging about what happened .
The younger boy did also .
In July he threatened a young girl out fishing with friends saying ' You 're a slag , you are going to be the second body in the river like Helen Maughan ' . "
Miss Maughan 's body was discovered naked from the waist down , except for a sock , two days after she was killed by a man walking along a riverside footpath on Sunday , May 20 .
The court heard that troubled Ms Maughan was in a relationship with Simon Elam .
They had a son Aaron who had been taken into care along with another child from a previous relationship .
She had taken drugs in the past and had turned to drink since losing her children , the jury of six men and six women heard .
On the night of May 18 2007 , she had left her boyfriend fitting a carpet at home and began drinking at pubs near the river at 2.45 pm .
Ms Maughan , who was just 5ft 1ins tall , was thrown out of three pubs and had spoken to her boyfriend for the final time at 10.30 pm .
Meanwhile , the court heard how the two defendants persuaded a passer - by to buy them booze at a local one - stop shop .
At about 11.20 pm , Ms Maughan was captured on CCTV talking to two boys after spotting them with alcohol close to the Marquise of Grandy pub .
Forensic tests on Miss Maughan 's body found she had 22 injuries to her face and genitals but she was still alive when she hit the water and died of drowning .
Toxicology tests revealed she was more than three the drink drive limit and had been taking anti-depressants but this had not caused her death .
Miss
Wass told the jury : " The Crown say the boys acted together when they killed Helen Maughan , maybe one was the leader and one was the follower , but you will have to decide if they did it together . "
Pathologist Dr David
Rouse said there were no drag marks on the body and the prosecution claimed her body would have been carried .
Both boys deny murder .
The case continues .
ATHENS  A rash of refugees from Africa , southern Asia and the Middle East has been crossing the Aegean Sea and besieging a cluster of craggy Greek islands .
Local officials have called for the central government to declare a state of emergency on the tiny island of Leros , after the Greek coast guard picked up more than 200 refugees , half of them minors , over the weekend .
The immigrants , Pakistanis , Ethiopians , Iraqis and Somalis , said they had reached Greece by boat from Turkey .
Some were sent to reception centers across the country , while others were released after requesting political asylum , the authorities said .

I drank a cup of herbal brew
Then the sweetness of the air
Combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo
— Lyrics from the song Spirit Voices by Paul Simon
IQUITOS , PERU —
The first time he drank ayahuasca , an infusion of psychoactive plants considered sacred by Amazonian Indians , Hamilton Souther felt himself falling into a spinning vortex of total insanity .
The California native was deep in the Peruvian Amazon and the dark visions were coming hard and fast .
He saw hummingbirds with 30 - foot wingspans .
A bush turned into a wild boar and began screaming obscenities at him .
He puked .
He pooped .
He prepared to die .
As he tells his story , Souther 's audience of two dozen mostly American tourists sitting in a thatched hut in the rain forest remains silent .
They 're not sure whether to laugh or cry .
They each have paid $ 1,680 to spend nine days at Souther 's Blue Morpho lodge in the Peruvian jungle and to sample the plant potion for themselves .
But this is not some Amazonian Kool - Aid Acid Test and these are not Merry Pranksters .
LSD and other recreational drugs are not for them , and many shun alcohol .
Ranging in age from early 20s to late 50s , they work as university professors , marketing executives and environmental activists .
Then there 's Heather , a tall , muscular woman who competes in Ironman races .
With the help of ayahuasca , they hope to address persistent emotional , physical or psychological afflictions that Western medicine has failed to alleviate .
Others seek more spirituality in their lives .
Their guide is Souther , a blond 29 - year - old who seems wise beyond his years .
Feeling frustrated and lost after studying anthropology at the University of Colorado at Boulder , he abruptly moved to Peru in 2001 to learn about medicinal plants alongside Indian curanderos , or medicine men .
A quick study , Souther received the title of master shaman after just 20 months .
He then set up Blue Morpho to offer shamanic workshops and ayahuasca ceremonies to outsiders .
He has hosted more than 600 tourists in the past two years .
As they listen to Souther 's narrative , some of his guests wonder what they 've gotten themselves into .
His description of ayahuasca coursing through the brain and bloodstream sounds like a kaleidoscopic torture chamber , like Abu Ghraib on angel dust .
But then Souther turns the corner .
After hours of sheer terror , he recalls , an Indian shaman blew tobacco smoke over his body and he vomited a gelatinous mass the size of a lemon .
From then on , the demons disappeared and he felt enveloped by divine light , in touch with the spirits of every person he had ever known .
" It does n't have to be hell , " Souther assures his guests .
" These are plants that positively transform people 's lives .
There is no way to get ayahuasca wrong .
Just ask it to help you , and it will . "
For centuries , Indians in Brazil , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador and Peru have sought the assistance of the plant they call " the sacred vine of the soul . "
With the guidance of a shaman , they drink a concoction of ayahuasca vine and other plants to communicate with spirits , travel through time , cleanse their bodies , and relieve a broad range of ailments .
Many Indians view ayahuasca as a continuous vine that stretches back to the beginning of time , an umbilical cord connecting them to their ancestors .
A handful of religious sects , like Brazil 's União do Vegetal and Santo Daime , consider the plant a sacrament .
Those simply looking to get high have rarely felt the pull of the vine .
For one thing , taking ayahuasca usually involves a violent purge from both ends of the body .
Then , there 's the acrid smell and taste which is like " the entire jungle ground up and mixed with bile , " ethnobotanist Wade Davis writes in his book One River .
Mixed with certain foods or recreational drugs , ayahuasca can be toxic , even fatal .
Yet within New Age circles in the United States , the buzz about ayahuasca is growing .
About a dozen lodges catering to American pilgrims have sprung up in and around Iquitos , a city of 400,000 that is Peru 's main jumping - off point for Amazon River tours .
The business is becoming so popular that , at the Iquitos airport , locals trying to drum up clients for freelance medicine men shout " Ayahuasca ! Ayahuasca ! " to the tourists exiting the terminal .
The standard Blue Morpho tour involves five ayahuasca ceremonies over nine days .
They take place on a 180 - acre spread where Souther has put up a series of gorgeous wood - and - thatch buildings , including a massive ceremonial roundhouse .
The furnishings are sparse : mattresses covered with mosquito nets , cold - water showers and kerosene lamps .
But outward austerity promotes more focus on the inner journey that 's about to begin .
Among the current group of guests , a man from Seattle suffers from depression and wants to kick his prescription drugs .
A woman from Chicago wants to communicate with the spirit of her teenaged son who was killed in a car accident .
A woman from San Diego talks of revisiting her childhood .
At Blue Morpho , visitors go through the entire process , from gathering the plants to making the infusion .
After fasting most of the day , the guests gather in the roundhouse where they sit on mattresses equipped with toilet paper and plastic buckets in case they need to vomit .
Each steps forward to drink a few ounces from a metal cup .
Then , the lights go out and Souther and veteran Peruvian shaman Alberto Torres Davila shake leaf rattles and chant icaros , songs to communicate with the spirits and guide people through their mental expeditions .
Soon , the roundhouse fills with the sounds of people burping and retching .
Some wail as if possessed by the devil .
When they need help , Souther and Torres come forward with soothing advice .
No one sees giant hummingbirds , but many guests struggle with nightmarish visions and are exhausted at daybreak .
" Doing ayahuasca is like years of psychotherapy , " says Laura Elvins , 40 , of Boston , who is back at Blue Morpho for a repeat session .
" My friends still think it 's kind of nutty , but the changes to my life have been just huge . "
The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is funding a number of technologies that tap into the brain 's ability to detect threats before the conscious mind is able to process the information .
Already , there is Pentagon - sponsored work on using the brain 's pattern detection capabilities for enhanced goggles and super - fast satellite imagery analysis .
What happens , however , when the Pentagon ultimately uses this enhanced capability for targeting weapons ?
This question has led Stephen White to write a fascinating article exploring the implications of a soldiers ' legal culpability for weapons that may someday tap into this " pre-conscious " brain activity .
Like the Minority Report notion of " pre-crime , " where someone is convicted for contemplating a criminal act they have n't yet acted upon , this article raises the intriguing question of whether a soldier could be convicted for the mistake made by a pre-conscious brain wave .
* One of the justifications for employing a brain - machine interface is that the human brain can perform image calculations in parallel and can thus recognize items , such as targets , and classify them in 200 milliseconds , a rate orders of magnitude faster than computers can perform such operations .
In fact , the image processing occurs faster than the subject can become conscious of what he or she sees .
Studies of patients with damage to the striate cortex possess what neuropsychologists term “ blindsight , ” an ability to predict accurately where objects are positioned , even when they are placed outside these patients ’ field of vision .
The existence of this ability suggests the operation of an unconscious visual perception system in the human brain .
These blindsight patients often exhibit “ levels of accuracy well beyond the performance of normal observers making judgments close to the threshold of awareness , ” particularly with regard to locating ‘ unseen ’ objects .
The speed of visual recognition varies depending on its degree of the perceived object ’s multivalence ; ambiguous objects take more time to process .
If neuralinterfaced weapons were designed to fire at the time of recognition rather than after the disambiguation process , a process that would likely need to occur for the pilot to differentiate between combatants and protected persons , the pilot firing them presumably would lack criminal accountability for the act implicit in willful killing .
Because of the way brain - interfaced weapons may interrupt the biology of consciousness , reasonable doubt may exist as to whether an actor performed a conscious act in the event of a contested incident . *
It 's not just legal analysts who recognize this issue .
After reading my article on " Luke 's Binoculars " – DARPA 's brain - tapping binos program – one neuroscientist raised an obvious concern : Psychopathy is linked to bypassing the inhibitory control mechanisms of prefrontal cortex , and do we really want psychopathic soldiers ? "

How about this for an opening about the founder of American Apparel in today 's New York Post ?
" Dov Charney walks around his office in his underwear , sleeps with employees , and calls women bitches , sluts , whores and the c-word - and that 's the stuff he admits to . "
We 've all heard rumors that Charney is an ass and it's all coming out before a civil trial that begins here in Los Angeles tomorrow between former employee Mary Nelson , a sales manager who began in November 2003 , and the clothing founder .
The specific claim ?
Charney had a meeting with her wearing only a cock sock , invited her to masturbate and fired her when she said she would be talking to a lawyer .
In a deposition , Charney " absolutely " admits to calling women " sluts " and the female genitalia c-word , because , you know , it 's " endearing . "
" There is no evidence to say that you can't walk around in your underwear all day anywhere in the United States of America , " he testified .
Said Fink : " She felt uncomfortable from the get - go , " a feeling that deepened when she and a colleague went for a business meeting at Charney 's house and he stripped down to show off the sock on his privates .
Charney said that he could n't remember the incident but that it was possible he was trying to show them new merchandise .
Nelson says she was fired after complaining about outrageous sexual shenanigans by company employees at trade shows and then consulting with a lawyer .
[ New York Post ]
American Apparel calls the suit " outrageous and false , " in a statement obtained by the New York Post .
It continues to explain that the " facts are these : Mr. Charney never harassed Ms. Nelson .
Mr. Charney never propositioned Ms. Nelson .
The only time he was in his undergarments was for strictly professional reasons ...
We are glad this frivolous case will be soon behind us . "

Nearly one week after a U.S. intelligence report revealed that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , the saber - rattling inside the Washington Beltway appears to have receded for the moment , and with it , the George W. Bush administration ’s strongest pretext for a military confrontation with Iran .
The judgments of the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) contradicted findings in a similar 2005 report , which assessed that Iran was 10 years away from developing nuclear weapons .
That report  the first major review since 2001 of what is known and what is unknown about Iran  also said Iran ’s military was conducting clandestine nuclear work , and that if " left to its own devices , Iran is determined to develop nuclear weapons . "
Critics of President Bush ’s Iran policy believe that the new intelligence estimate provides the rationale for a shift in the administration ’s stance on Tehran , away from confrontation and towards engagement .
The estimate did not portray Iran as a rogue ideological state zealously questing for nuclear weapons , as many neoconservatives have fiercely argued , but rather a rational political actor whose " decisions are guided by a cost - benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political , economic and military costs . "
But the competition of dueling intelligence estimates is already underway , as is a battle for the integrity of the U.S. intelligence community , which has been harshly criticized for its failure to properly assess the WMD threat  or the lack thereof  in the lead - up to the Iraq War .
Former Central Intelligence Agency director George Tenet called the 2002 NIE about Iraq ’s weapons programs " one of the lowest moments of my seven - year tenure . "
The Iraq report relied heavily on information provided by a source called " Curveball , " an Iraqi chemical engineer later revealed as Rafid Ahmed Alwan , who had fed false information to German intelligence in exchange for asylum protection for him and his family .
Germany did not trust him , but Alwan ’s claims eventually made it to Washington .
Critics argue that intelligence was also manipulated by policy - makers within the Bush administration to justify an U.S. - led invasion , and that neoconservatives are still trying to exert political control over the intelligence process .
" The last thing we need is more political input into intelligence matters .
The facts are the facts , and it ’s time conservatives began to deal with the facts on the ground , " said Jon Wolfsthal , a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , responding to the attempts to undermine the NIE ’s findings .
" The days of Doug Feith and Steve Cambone creating intelligence to suit their ideology are thankfully behind us , " he said .
Meanwhile , neoconservatives and former Bush officials have launched a ferocious counterattack on the NIE , and more pointedly at its authors  the intelligence officers whose presumable goal is to undermine the Bush policy agenda .
" I must confess to suspecting that the intelligence community , having been excoriated for supporting the then universal belief that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction , is now bending over backward to counter what has up to now been a similarly universal view … that Iran is hell - bent on developing nuclear weapons , " wrote Norman Podhoretz in the right - wing Commentary magazine .
" But I entertain an even darker suspicion .
It is the intelligence community , which has for so many years now been leaking material calculated to undermine George W. Bush , is doing it again . "
In the opinion pages of the Washington Post , former U.S. envoy to the United Nations John R. Bolton was more pointed , accusing the NIE of being polluted by " refugees from the State Department " who were brought into the new central bureaucracy of the director of national intelligence , a position created in the response to the Sept. 11 Commission ’s assessments on U.S. intelligence failures .
Bolton also criticized the intelligence community for engaging in " policy formulation " rather than " intelligence analysis , " and said that the new estimate was based on a bias given to new piece of information that could not decisively negate all previous knowledge .
" It is a rare piece of intelligence that is so important it can conclusively or even significantly alter the body of already known information , " said Bolton .
" Yet the bias toward the new appears to have exerted a disproportionate effect on intelligence analysis . "
Some experts have suggested that the new information involved the interception of a conversation between top Iranian military officials who were bitter over the Iranian leadership ’s decision to halt its weapons program .
More importantly , the U.S. intelligence community ’s belief that Iran was pursuing a covert nuclear weapons program up until 2003 was largely based on information contained in a laptop computer belonging to an Iranian engineer , said Jeffrey Lewis , the director of the non-proliferation Initiative at the Washington - based New America Foundation think - tank .
Lewis said that media outlets erroneously reported that the laptop , which the U.S. obtained in 2004 and which contained documents describing two Iranian nuclear programs , termed L - 101 and L - 102 by the Iranians , directly related to weapons work .
He said it more specifically referred to modifications to a missile that would ostensibly carry a nuclear warhead .
" A lot of folks , myself included , have wondered about the reliability of the information .
We ’ve even taken to calling it the ‘ laptop of death , ’ " he said .
But it was the crude manner in which the documents were constructed that gave Lewis pause .
" What led many of us to have serious doubts about it was how utterly unconnected from reality some of the information seemed .
Some of the reports indicated that some of the view graphs were done in Powerpoint , which suggested to me that the program was not terribly sophisticated , " he said .
The report also seems to vindicate the U.N. nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , but the NIE has been rejected by Israel , which claims that Iranian nuclear weapons program is still running .
And it appears that for the Bush White House , even facts will not get in the way of policy .
" We ’re dealing with a country that is still enriching uranium and remains a leading state sponsor of terrorism .
That is a cause of great concern to the United States , " said Vice President Dick Cheney in remarks delivered Friday at the National World War I Museum .
" Not everyone understands the threat of nuclear proliferation in Iran or elsewhere but we and our allies do understand the threat and we have a duty to prevent it , " he said .
Earlier in the week , Cheney did express support for the estimate , saying that he had no reason to question " what the community has produced , with respect to the NIE on Iran . "
' Give It Away And Pray ' Is n't A Business Model ...
But It Does n't Mean That ' Free ' Does n't Work
from the once - again ...- with - feeling dept
" I 'll call it , for short , " the Slashdot argument " .
It says that books , music , films , software and so on ought to be freely distributed to anyone who wants them , simply because they can be freely distributed .
What is the writer or musician to do , though , if she can't earn money from her art ?
Simple , says the Slashdotter : earn your money playing live ( if you 're one of those musicians who plays live ) , or selling T - shirts or merchandise , or providing some other kind of " value - added " service .
Many such arguments seem to me to be simple greed disguised in high - falutin ' idealism about how " information wants to be free " .
Perhaps it 's not empty pedantry to point out that " information " does n't want anything in and for itself .
The information in which humans traffic is created by humans .
And most information - creating humans need to earn dollars or yuan to survive .
In any case , I think the Slashdot argument can actually be disposed of rapidly with one rhetorical question , as follows .
Oh Mr Freetard , you work as a programmer , do you ?
How interesting .
So do you perform all your corporate programming duties for free , and earn your keep by selling personally branded mousemats on the side ?
Did n't think so .
Perhaps I could have tried distributing Trigger Happy the Radiohead way , making sure you had to pay a minimum to get the goods .
Would I still have attracted 30,000 readers like that ?
I doubt it .
The sublime In Rainbows seems to have been a nice little earner for Radiohead , but that 's because they 're Radiohead -- and they became Radiohead through the nasty old music - industry business model .
So did Nine Inch Nails , whose recent internet release of ( the excellent ) Ghosts was very clever -- the first nine songs of a triple album for free in compressed mp3 ; the whole thing in a lossless format for $ 5 .
But if there 's been a comparable success by a band that has n't already gained its cultural capital and name - recognition through the evils of copyright and corporate promotion , I 'd like to know about it .

I 've been noticing an interesting trend lately .
While more folks are n't totally averse to the idea that they need to somehow embrace " free , " they 're mishandling what they do with " free " and then going on to complain how " free " does n't work .
The basic problem is this : they hear about the importance of " free " and so they give something away for free .
But they do n't have a business model around the free content .
They do n't understand the economic forces at work .
They just give stuff away and pray ... and then whine when nothing happens .
As we 've pointed out before , no one says that " free " by itself pays the bills .
You need to have a more complete strategy than that -- and it involves a lot more than " give it away and pray . "
It 's good that they 're at least trying , but if they do n't understand the real issues and fail at the experiments , they suddenly come back and claim that " free " is n't the answer , and suddenly rule out all business models involving free .
Andis a real recipe for failure .
The latest to head down this road is NY Times columnist David Pogue , who bashes the idea of digital publishing of books by pointing to a long and interesting blog post from author Steven Poole , who did the " give away and pray " option along with a tip jar .
It did n't make him much money .
That should n't be any surprise , because tip jars are n't a real business model .
But , because Poole seemed to have an expectation in his mind , he ends up being quite disappointed , noting that 1 out of every 1,750 downloads ( 0.057 % ) left some money .
What 's left implicit here is that that figure is too low .
What this really means is that Poole didn ' tgive away the book for free .
He had an expectation that people would magically pay for it .
But , that 's not a business model .
That 's not tying the free and infinite good to other scarce goods thathelp you make money .
Unfortunately , both Pogue and Poole then use this to bash the entire concept of free - based business models , with Poole getting unnecessarily offensive in his response :
While I 'm sure there may be some Slashdot - types who may make this argument , it does n't mean that it's an accurate representation of the more important discussion of these business models .
The main problem is his use of " ought , " as in people saying things " ought " to be free .
It 'sthat thingsto be free because they can be free -- but that thingsbe free because that 's just basic economics .
Price gets driven to marginal cost in a competitive market , and the reason it happens is becausedo learn to put in place business models that work , and then if you 're the lone holdout , people start to ignore you .
Also , I 'll note that that Poole brushes off the ( indeed , simplistic ) business model suggestions as being " high falutin ' idealism " but fails to actually try out any real business model .
And then he weakly follows it up by implying that you can't earn money by giving away stuff for free .
But , again , he 's blaming the wrong thing : he 's blaming free for his own failure to use a real business model where the free offering was closely tied to additional scarcity he could sell .
He continues , getting even more insulting as he goes :
This misleading and mistargeted argument has been debunked so many times , it 's disappointing to see both Poole and Pogue repeat it .
But , since it needs a response , let 's do it again : you give away thegoods , not thegoods .
Your time is agood .
No one is saying that everything needs to be free -- they 're saying that infinite goodsbe free , because of it's very nature in economics .
In fact , Poole 's argument is particularly weak when it comes to programmers , because most programmers do n't earn any kind of royalties for the software they write .
They are paid a salary , for their time -- but not for the software itself ( which is an infinite good ) .
And , I wo n't even get into the number of programmers who work on open source projects for free ... or the fact that Poole is blogging for free ... Again , Poole and Pogue are so focused on free , that they fail to distinguish between infinite and scarce goods or the business models involved in what 's going on .
Poole then weakly dismisses the Radiohead experiment : Poole and Pogue ( who quotes the same snippet ) both miss the fact that in both cases described above , the bands in question did n't " give away and pray , " but both put together real strategic business models that were focused on using the infinite goods ( the music ) to sell more scarce goods .
In the case of Radiohead ( despite some claims to the contrary ) at the same time Radiohead announced the downloads it also told fans that it would be selling a beautiful " discbox " for the album as well .
This was a very valuable scarce good -- that the free music made a lot more valuable by increasing the demand for it .
As for Nine Inch Nails , Trent Reznor offered a tiered system of scarce goods that were all made more valuable by the availability of the music -- proven by the fact that Reznor quickly sold out of his limited edition deluxe offering .
And I still chuckle about the argument that these models " only work for big bands . "
That 's because a few years ago , when we pointed out how this worked for some small up - and - coming bands , people would whine " but that only works for small bands -- big bands would be screwed ! "
The model , when well designed works for small bands just as well as big bands .
No , it might not turn around millions in a week , but it can certainly help an artist make a living .
Witness the case of Maria Schneider , who ended up making a Grammy - winning album using some the concepts discussed around these parts .
And , of course , we 've worked out the details of the type of business model that an up - and - coming band could use to embrace these concepts to grow .
So , it 's nice to see someone at least willing to explore the concept of free without shutting out the possibility .
But free alone is n't a business model .
And it 's wrong to blame free for the lack of establishing a complete business model .
Just because " give it away and pray " is n't a workable business model , that does n't mean that there are n't business models that do work .
Hopefully , Poole and Pogue will eventually recognize that they 're dismissing the wrong thing .
They should n't be complaining about free ( or making misleading accusations about those who simply recognize the economic forces at work ) -- they should be complaining about a failure to put in place a real business model to take advantage of what will be free .

Important news was issued yesterday on the legislative battle over the State collection of genetic material on newborn babies to use for government - endorsed genetic research without parents ’ consent .
Last night , the Minnesota Senate Judiciary Committee voted against consent rights ( ownership ) of infant blood and DNA , reported Twila Brase , RN , President of the Citizens ' Council on Health Care .
That means DNA material on children can be stored and used by the government or third parties without the consent of parents .
The bill ( SF 3138 ) now goes to the Senate for a full vote .
This is a complicated issue of medical ethics and privacy , public health over individual rights , the integrity and advancement of science , genetic discrimination , and the potential abuses of genetic information by the state .
As reported last year , the CCHC had discovered that for ten years , the Minnesota Department of Health had been illegally collecting DNA material on at least 780,000 babies which it was storing indefinitely , and has already given away the material on more than 41,000 babies for genetic research , all without the knowledge or consent of parents .
Since then , the CCHC has been working for informed consent and arguing that the state cannot take or use genetic material without parents ’ consent .
The CCHC has cautioned that the state ’s genetic database will soon be linked electronically to its medical database , with a permanent impact on patient records and genetic profiling that could be used against people by insurers or employers .
Few parents are even told of their rights or given the option to opt - out of testing or allow testing , but require the blood sample to then be destroyed and not retained by the state .
No one is arguing against saving the lives of babies or preventing the devastating effects of genetic and metabolic conditions .
These can be the benefits of screening programs that accurately identify conditions which have effective treatments .
[ For an overview of newborn screening tests , some of the metabolic and other conditions included , and the value for babies and parents , the March of Dimes offers a parent guide here . ]
But we almost never hear the downsides , the past history of failures of screening programs , the problems and reliability .
With advances in technology making new forms of genetic screening possible , despite limited understanding of the risks or accuracies ; the ability to detect growing numbers of conditions for which there may be no effective or necessary treatment ; the ability to pick up abnormalities that we may have no understanding of what they mean or that might never cause a medical problem ; the growing commercial interests in using genetic technology and the potential for abuse ; it is imperative for us to think about this .
Now .
National agencies and interest groups under the National Task Force on Newborn Screening have recommended a mandatory federal government - run uniform newborn screening program that is integrated with the health care delivery system and under public health agency oversight .
( It would be administered through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA ) , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , Health Care Financing Administration ( HCFA ) , Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , and other agencies . )
They argued against parental informed consent , in the interests of public health .
Their other recommendations included the development of public health databases integrated with the newborn screening system and genetic data collection .
Along with the push for nationalized electronic medical records and the government ’s proven inability to not allow the healthcare system to be overtaken by commercial interests , this deserves our attention before we ’ve tumbled down the proverbial slippery slope .
According to the Task Force , 49 states require newborn screening , but only 3 states have provisions for informed consent .
Maryland has a voluntary newborn screening program , Wyoming uses an informed consent model and Massachusetts recently began using an informed consent process in a pilot program .
Most states , it found , permit parental refusal , but only under limited circumstances .
However , parents are rarely told that refusal is even an option , and mandatory offering of screening is often confused with mandatory screening .
We cannot begin to address all of the medical , legal , scientific or political issues surrounding this debate in a blog post .
But the fascinating ethical discussions of newborn screening that have been taking place at the President ’s Council on Bioethics deserve recognition , especially in light of recent legislation across the country .
Last Friday , the Council met in Arlington , Virginia , to discuss the development of its paper on the ethics of newborn screening .
I want to share some of the points raised by the pediatric and medical ethics and genetic experts at this meeting , as well as two earlier conferences .
[ Note to readers : The Bioethics Research Library at Georgetown University has archived these valuable bioethical papers and discussions from the President 's Council on Bioethics , led by Dr. Edmund Pellegrino , MD .
You can now find them here .
The Obama Administration removed from the government 's website all of the papers and discussions from the President 's Council on Bioethics .
As one of its first acts , the Administration dissolved this long - standing Council , which had examined issues in light of the ethical principles guiding medical practice , the Hippocratic Oath , and human experimentation that arose from the 1946 Nuremberg trials when the world witnessed distortions of medical ethos for political and economic agendas .
The new commission established by Obama 's Administration has been given a new mandate to help it establish " ethically defensible " governmental policy .
It has also redefined medical ethics itself .
Now , the value of human life is based on one 's value ( and costs ) to society and the state ; and medical care is allocated based on what serves the interests of " public " health .
Medically ethical behavior is no longer devoted to the patient 's best interest , along with the patient 's right to informed consent and freedom of choice and autonomy over their own bodies . ]
As we look at some of the ethical issues and the history of newborn screening , we find it filled , not only with promising potentials to help babies , but with shocking cautionary tales .
Warning :
This is a very long post , but I hope one that provides healthcare professionals , parents and readers with interesting and valuable things to consider that have n’t been raised in mainstream media ...
Bioethics and American Children — December 2005
I want to begin by sharing a talk by one of the most renowned experts on pediatric ethics , Dr. Norman Fost , M.D. , M.P.H. , professor of pediatrics and Director of the Program in Medical Ethics at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison .
[ I 'll confess to being especially affected by his talk , not only because I ’ve watched similar developments in pediatric research and found his insights thought - provoking , but because one of my university thesis papers was on phenylketonuria ( PKU ) .
He reveals disturbing and stunning information on PKU screening in the early days of newborn screening that was n’t known by most healthcare professionals some 35 years ago , and downsides that few ever thought to even consider back then . ]
Before beginning any discussion of genetic screening , he said it was important to understand the history of newborn screening , which illustrates why it ’s important to not simply jump behind and do every available screening test because we believe it might save lives , especially before we know what we ’re doing .
PKU screening was begun under the assumptions that a positive result meant a baby had the disease and that the available treatment was safe and effective — both turned out to be horribly wrong .
The result was thousands of normal kids who were wrongly diagnosed and killed or left brain damaged when given a treatment that proved to be ineffective and dangerous .
The problems have since been sorted out , but PKU has n’t been the only screening test to run into problems or that will again , which makes this an important history lesson .
While his entire talk was a fascinating look at the evolution of ethical issues in pediatric issues , for today ’s consideration , here are excerpts specifically addressing newborn screening :
In 1960 , PKU , Phenylketonuria , was known to be an admittedly rare , but a well understood , cause of profound mental retardation .
It affects approximately 1 in 10,000 live - born children .
The biochemistry of it was fairly well understood .
It 's due to inability to metabolize an amino acid named phenylalanine , which is ubiquitous in proteins .
It was known that if you could diagnose this early enough and get a child started on a restricted diet [ low in phenylalanine ] that you could ameliorate , and in some cases prevent completely , the profound brain damage that uniformly occurs ...
[ Back then , the only test available was a urine test done at the baby ’s first check - up , but by then , brain damage had already occurred . ]
There were three breakthroughs in 1960 — the discovery by Dr. Robert Guthrie of a simple test , making it cheap and efficient to diagnose this condition on all newborns on a single drop of blood ; second , the development by Mead Johnson of Lofenalac , a low phenylalanine milk that was reasonably affordable and palatable ; and , three , the election of John Kennedy .
President Kennedy , because of his profound interest in mental retardation , his family 's interest , with Dr. Guthrie formed a so - called PKU lobby and arranged for laws to be passed in all states requiring PKU testing ...
The problem was , it turned out , that the PKU test was the worst test in the history of the world .
It had a sensitivity and specificity that have not been matched to the best of my knowledge .
That is , the test had a five percent true positive rate .
It had a 95 percent false positive rate .
That is , a child with a positive test , confirmed by a whole blood assay , had a 20 to 1 chance of being normal .
This was not appreciated for many years .
So many normal children , we now know , were started on a restricted diet , and it turned out that a phenylalanine - restricted diet was as harmful , or more harmful , as a diet with excess of phenylalanine .
That is , this essential amino acid , when withheld from normal children , resulted in brain damage due to starving of brain cells , and every other cell in the body , because phenylalanine is a part of so many proteins .
So many children — we do n't know how many — were made retarded by this program .
Some were killed .
In fact , kwashiorkor developed in America in the PKU program in children who had profound protein malnutrition because of the restricted diet ... when this happened in a normal child , it 's obviously a major tragedy .
In 1965 , the American Academy of Pediatrics sent a letter to the Secretary of DHHS urging that the mandatory PKU screening programs be stopped , because we did n't understand the significance of the test , and we did n't know how to regulate the diet .
This letter was suppressed .
People were called Luddites who were against newborn screening .
The PKU lobbying was very powerful , and testing went on until 1971 when a political scientist named Joseph Cooper uncovered this story through the Freedom of Information Act and led to the appointment of the IOM Committee , whose report was published in 1975 articulating principles for ethically responsible newborn screening , particularly genetic screening or screening for genetic disorders ...
There is virtual unanimity on the principles of responsible genetic screening , and newborn screening in particular ....
The only problem is that the [ IOM ] guidelines are systematically ignored .
That is , newborn screening has expanded like topsy , with the same mistakes that beleaguered the PKU program happening over and over again .
That is , numerous screening and treatment programs have been implemented without testing , evaluation of the tests , without any systematic study of the sensitivity , specificity , or predictive value of the test , or of the interventions .
This happens in part because genetic testing and treatment falls outside of the regulations of the FDA .
That is , there is no toll gate through which an investigator or an innovator has to go to get these kinds of programs approved .
He or she only needs to persuade existing committees and state health departments to simply add another test onto the drop of blood or the drops of blood that now exist for virtually every newborn in America .
I wo n't take time to rehearse for you other examples of newborn screening gone awry , and the large number of children in my view who have been killed , normal children in some cases , by screening and treatment programs that have never been adequately evaluated .
Not enough research .
The new technologies , such as tandem mass spectrometry , now make it possible to test for hundreds of conditions on this single drop of blood .
And , indeed , a committee of the American College of Medical Genetics has persuaded the Secretary 's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing to recommend to the Secretary national implementation of a uniform standard for testing of newborns using tandem mass spectrometry .
These recommendations include over 50 conditions , half of which have no known association with human disease .
That is , approximately half of the tests on the committee 's recommended list are abnormalities that have been observed whose relationship to clinical manifestations are unknown or uncertain , and the other half roughly involve serious diseases but diseases for which the sensitivity and specificity and predictive value of the test is unknown , and in which the interventions have never been systematically tested .
It is telling , in my view , that the UK equivalent of the FDA has recommended implementation of only one of these 50 conditions .
Even worse , multi-array DNA testing — that is , the ability to test for a thousand genetic variations using recombinant DNA techniques on a single drop of blood is also now upon us , and work is proceeding rapidly to add multi-array genetic testing to the newborn PKU spots .
So we now already have many states , including Wisconsin , that does routine testing without consent , without prior research , for dozens of conditions using tandem mass spectrometry .
And I predict , unless there is some dramatic change in the way we think about these things , the way we do these things , that multi-array DNA testing will occur within the next few years , as soon as the cost comes down to make it efficient to do it .
This , to me , is a calamity involving every child in America , the amount of mischief .
The amount of harm , psychosocial harm that will occur to families and children , not to mention medical harm , is , in my view , going to be quite extensive .
And , worse , 20 years from now we wo n't know what harm has been done , because in the absence of systematic studies we wo n't know which children were helped and which were harmed , because we wo n't know whether like — in the PKU program , we wo n't know if a positive test meant that that was a child who was destined to become brain damaged or dead , or whether it was a false positive test that had poor predictive value .
The follow - up discussion brought to light additional considerations as he answered the question : “ What drives this mania for testing ? ”
There are several factors that are quite common in these — in this repetition compulsion .
One is that the PKU lobby has been duplicated over and over again .
That is , there almost always is a very zealous lobby that forms , consisting of parents of children who have died or have become profoundly — you know , if your child died of a rare disease , you understandably do n't want to see this happen again to anybody ever .
And so — but you 're not a scientist , and so you say it 's just unimaginable to me that every child in America is n't tested for this very rare disorder , and so that something can be done about it .
So parents are very much out in front of this .
Second , they are put out in front by the testers , some of whom have , frankly , commercial interests , so there is serious financial conflicts of interest in some cases .
That was n't the case in PKU , and it 's not the case in all screening programs .
But there are commercial testing laboratories who would love to have this happen , and are funding publicity campaigns , as happens in other areas of medicine .
So there is just frank commercial conflicts of interest .
Third , there are empires that do n't make people rich , but that make people more powerful or influential ...
My sense of what was going on is that the people at the [ advisory ] meeting were the equivalent of state lab directors who , you know , it was another machine .
It was another couple of people on their staff whose expanded budget — it was getting more information , possibly some research interest .
I do n't think they were getting rich off of it , but they — technicians like to do things .
Doctors like to do things .
Testers like to test .
So that 's part of it also .
And concerning calls for a national government - run system under a uniform policy , he added : [ P ] art of [ the justification used to support a national program ] is very poorly thought out moral claims of justice and unfairness ...
Well , if it 's a bad policy , there 's no virtue in it being uniform .
There is no unfairness in not distributing something that has no known value or whose harms may exceed the benefits ...
If the PKU program had been subject to a — even a randomized clinical trial , which is sometimes hard to justify for what you think is a uniformly horrendous disorder , some children with PKU would have been lost — that is , would fail to have been treated .
But many hundreds — we do n't know the number — of normal children would have been saved .
That is , we would have found out in a year or two , instead of 10 or 15 years , what we were doing .
So that 's point number one is if these new technologies were studied systematically , I think in the long run we 're less likely to harm and more likely to help .
[ F ] or conditions in which it is hard to justify a randomized trial , even a simple registry ... would at least allow for some observational collection of data , so that 10 years from now we know what the outcomes of all these children are .
Ethical Questions About the Current U.S. Newborn Screening System — June 2006 Dr. Richard Roblin , Ph.D. , the scientific director of the Council on Bioethics , talked in more detail about the potential benefits and harms of emerging technology used in newborn screening that can look for conditions far beyond the handful of tests that have proven accuracy and effective treatments .
New tandem mass spectrometry , for example , now makes it possible to test for many metabolic abnormalities using a single drop of blood , but how many test results are accurate and how many babies will be helped versus harmed by the resulting treatment ?
The American College of Medical Genetics ( ACMG ) report commissioned by the HRSA , based on the availability of the new technology , has now recommended an expanded testing program where states mandate a uniform screen for 29 different conditions .
By pursuing an expanded menu of newborn screening tests , he said , a U.S. newborn screening system runs the risk of making similar mistakes [ as described by Dr. Fost with PKU testing ] that would harm children .
In considering the ethics of expanding newborn screening , he pointed out how screenings became the domain of public health in the first place : Newborn screening programs have been traditionally viewed as “ public health ” programs .
They make possible the early identification of children with abnormal metabolic conditions leading to confirmatory diagnosis and possible treatment .
Newborn screening is seen as a routine component of childbirth , and in most states no parental consent is obtained before obtaining the newborn ’s blood sample and the initiation of testing .
Historically , the testing for these programs has been the responsibility of the health departments of each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia , further strengthening the view that these are “ public health ” programs .
When such programs were started back in the 1960s , and included only a few tests , perhaps the public health view was appropriate .
Is the “ public health ” program framework still appropriate to a complex system that tests 4 million newborns each year for 29 different conditions ?
In 1968 , at the World Health Organization , ten criteria were written which have traditionally come to define screening programs considered for “ public health : ” 1 .
The condition is an important health problem 2 .
There is an accepted treatment for cases identified 3 .
The condition is recognizable at an early stage 4 .
The natural history of the condition is known 5 .
There is an agreed upon policy on whom to treat as patients 6 .
Harm from a screening program is small in relation to benefits 7 .
Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available 8 .
There should be a suitable test 9 .
The screening test should be acceptable to the population 10 .
The costs and effectiveness of the screening should be balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care as a whole A number of the 29 tests now being recommended in the ACMG report , however , would not meet these criteria because they are for rare conditions where the safety and efficacy of possible treatments are currently not known .
There are also unknowns about how accurately these screening tests identify conditions , what positive findings mean , and the lifetime consequences for someone of being labeled as having a genetic abnormality .
So , he said , it is imperative upon us to be more careful to not just look at the good things screening might ideally do , but also admit what we do n’t know and the potential harm to children and parents .
The goods are easy to articulate , he said :
In contrast , many of the possible “ harms ” are harder to specify .
One , articulated by Dr. Fost , is that individuals will be identified as positive by screening programs and treated , for example , with special diets before we understand the relationship between the screening result and disease , and that some may be harmed thereby .
The other is that , because of the low positive predictive value of some of the tests , the operation of the [ newborn screening system ] exposes a reasonably large number of families to the risk of psychological harm from an initial positive screening test result that is not confirmed on follow - up tests .... [ I ] f all states tested for all 29 conditions ... from 63,965 to perhaps 128,000 U.S. families would initially be given information that their newborn has an abnormal screening test result , and would return for additional follow - up tests that ultimately prove negative for the presence of disease [ false positives ] .
Receipt of such information is stressful for the parents .
There are studies reporting that some parents remain anxious for years , even after they have received the results of follow - up tests showing that their newborn does not have a specific metabolic disease .
There may also be adverse effects on the children in such situations .
In summarizing the results of a Scandinavian study of family responses to such testing results , the authors noted : “ Thirty - two families were investigated four years after a false alarm in the neonatal screening of their newborns .
Sixteen of the families showed signs of persistent anxiety 6 - 12 months after the screening .
Thirteen of them still showed anxiety after four years .
Of the 16 without anxiety at 6 - 12 months , 6 show signs of anxiety now .
This persistent anxiety may be related to the initial psychological trauma of the false positive screening result .
Thus , 19 of the 32 families have not completely integrated their experience .... ”
Medical measures have psychological side - effects , which can be interpreted as iatrogenic ...
In light of the numbers of families at risk as estimated above there is significant potential for harm when one considers the operation of [ a federal newborn screening program ] .
Yet , with new technological developments , even more tests will likely be added to a national newborn screening program .
More significant than tandem mass spectrometry tests , he said , are DNA “ chips ” that , from a heel stick blood sample , could detect mutations associated with a possible increased risk for diseases that might not show up until much later in life .
Would newborn screening then be used to identify anyone with a possible genetic risk for cancer or diseases of aging ?
The DNA chip technologists , he says , are suggesting that the tried - and - true principle of not screening for things we can’t immediately and effectively treat be abandoned — which could dramatically change the goals of newborn screening and transform it into something more like genetic profiling .
Another concern he raised was that , as of 2002 , there was no uniform legal protection of the confidentiality of the results of newborn screening tests across the United States .
“ Among the concerns associated with non-confidential storage and use of genetic test result information is that it will be used in employment or health insurance decisions in ways that are discriminatory . ”
Newborn Screening for Genetic Disorders — June 23 , 2006
The follow - up discussion of Dr. Roblin ’s paper by the members of the Council on Bioethics revealed how seriously medical ethicists are taking the issue of newborn screening — a point rarely mentioned in mainstream media .
Pop media successfully keeps the public distracted with concerns over their diets , body appearance and fashion , while really important issues being decided that will have lasting impact on lives and futures are ignored .
Dr. Peter A. Lawler , Ph.D. , for instance , said that newborn screening needed to be investigated as part of broader concerns about the gathering and use of genetic information .
Here are just a few of the comments made by Dr. Leon R. Kass , M.D. , Ph.D. , chairman of the President 's Council on Bioethics from 2002 to 2005 , which were especially poignant : I do think that one should not underestimate the seriousness and importance of this move to increase mandatory screening .
These 29 metabolites are just the tip of the iceberg and when genomic knowledge is added and the DNA screening can be done , we will see a massive increase in screening and it , therefore , behooves somebody , a body like this to at least consider whether there are ethical questions beyond saying proceed with caution and to see whether there is some kind of positive intellectual contribution that one could make just sorting out those questions ...
This is a big subject and coming fast .
Second , without in any way casting any doubts on the motives , intentions , goodwill of the people who are bringing us these questions , there is a certain kind of logic which goes something like this and this is a caricature but have test , can screen , will find , may treat , must screen .
And for certain kinds of conditions where there really is clear treatment , where the ratio of false positives to true positives is small , much less worrisome , but if you look at [ the data on the 29 newborn screening tests being proposed ] we are talking really about false positive to true positive ratio in the neighborhood of 15 to one over all of these diseases and I think it 's very important to raise the question that he does about the absence of information about what the effect of this false positive diagnosis is and whether or not it 's enough to say , “ You 're baby is in the clear " when you 've got some empirical studies that suggest that there are deleterious consequences to children and their families going long beyond and the need to study that before speaking with confidence that this is really a marginal problem , I think is evident ... [ I ] f you want to take this subject up under the question of the health of the public as a whole , then you get into considerations of well , how big a public health problem is this compared to other sorts of things , and then you have questions of resource allocation and we heard in the last session that we 're talking close to a billion dollars just for the [ initial screening tests ] for the detection of 4,000 , 8,000 cases .
I do n't want to trivialize the human suffering that 's here , but if we 're going to put this in terms of public health then you get into questions ... of resource allocation , especially with respect to treatment , efficacy , for loss of these things ... [ I ] f you ask me what am I personally concerned about here , it would come under the sort of funny heading of not only toxic knowledge and where you might have certain kind of knowledge that you can't put to any good use .
You have knowledge that there is some impending disease for which there is no treatment but toxic misinformation or toxic opinion based upon misunderstanding , say in the false positives , especially when , and this is a thing I did n't mention before but I think it 's very important , doing the testing however sophisticated , that 's easy relative to actually communicating with these poor parents what the meaning of all of this is .
Ethics of Newborn Screening — March 7 , 2008
Finally , years of discussions and research came together in an especially hard - hitting session last Friday among the bioethicists as they shared concerns over the ethics of newborn screening and what it means for future generations and our country .
Alfonso Gómez - Lobo , Dr. phil , argued that the genomic knowledge obtained through newborn screening is basically good and reasonable to pursue if it does n’t burden children :
On the other hand — these are all points having to do with the good of knowledge — on the other hand , the potential misuses of genomic knowledge should be seen as reasons to erect safeguards wherever they are detected .
For example , the danger of eugenicide should be blocked by legal means that are independent of the expansion of the panel for universal newborn screening .
Likewise , the danger of being denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions should be blocked by legal measures but not by promoting ignorance of those conditions .
And , of course , there is before Congress the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act , which has been passed by the House but is still pending in the Senate .
So that would be an example of the kind of safeguards that can and should be erected .
While society may have an interest in knowledge for knowledge ’s sake , said Rebecca Dresser , J.D. , M.S. : I 'm not sure a lot of people have thought through the downsides , the risks that this will go into your record and so forth .
So I wonder about the level of understanding among people who are advocating universal screening for all these different conditions , many of which can't be treated ...
I 'm worried about how thoughtful the pressure to expand screening is among the parent groups .
I also am worried about the research justification .
So do people really understand that some of the motivation for collecting these data is not to help their child or their family but to advance science ?
Now , maybe many of them would say , “ Great .
I want other families to benefit from anything we can learn about the illness , " but I just wonder if people understand that dual agendas are developing , not just personal benefit to the patient and family but also to society .
And is that something people want to validate and pursue , or do they want to limit this more to a medical justification ?
Concerning the “ good of knowledge , ” Dr. Gilbert Meilaender , Ph.D. , countered with a caution : I 'm not sure I 'm quite as confident that it 's always a good .
But even granting that , I do n't know why each of us is under some obligation actively to pursue all the possible goods that may exist .
It 's one thing to say that knowledge is a good .
It 's a different thing to say that each of us must actively pursue it .
There are lots of goods .
We not only do n't have to pursue all of them — in fact , you could n't pursue all of them in a coherent life ... whether what we ’re talking about is the pursuit of genomic knowledge or whether what we 're talking about is finding information that may help to treat people with certain problems .
Dr. Janet D. Rowley , M.D. , D.Sc. , professor of medicine , molecular genetics and cell biology and human genetics at Pritzker School of Medicine , University of Chicago , said that a critical issue to remember is whether genetic screening techniques are accurate .
Except for a handful of the 29 conditions being mandated for screening , medical science does n’t yet know if in the end , identifying many of these abnormalities and treating them is of benefit to children and their families .
Even less is known about what the genetic findings mean .
[ W ] hat they 're talking about is the detection of mutations of some sort in protein - coding genes , which probably account for , say , 2 percent of our genome .
And what the rest of it is doing in terms of its contribution to us as living human beings is something that science is only now beginning to understand , so that you may have perfectly normal genes , but their epigenetic control may be abnormal ...
And I think we also have to recognize we all carry about 7 percent of , if you will , genetic mutations which under certain circumstances could be deleterious but under other circumstances can be very beneficial , so that it partly depends on what your circumstances are as you grow up whether a particular gene is beneficial or not to you .
Dr. William B. Hurlbut , M.D. , a professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford Medical Center , Stanford University , brought home just how complicated this issue is and what the meaning and kind of knowledge genetic tests are actually bringing to us :
We have to be very , very careful as a society in introducing worry , not just without direct therapy but worry that just changes the sense of how a parent relates to their child or a child to him - or herself .
It 's obviously an invitation to intervention of some kind , even if it 's statistical , and that makes it even more complicated .
Suppose you have a 60 - percent chance of some condition or disposition of personality that is negative for , say , educational aptitude or something .
Parents are going to be invited to intervene in ways that may be even pharmacologic at an early age , and what a dilemma that puts people in .
And it turns every child or at least many children into not just research subjects for a wider grasp of knowledge but into patients instead of just children growing up .
And there could be good in this , but it 's a very tricky business because very quickly it could move from an individual invitation to the family to a realm of social pressure ...
It 's always dangerous to bring up the experience of Nazi Germany , and I do n't want to do this in an inflammatory way .
But there is something overarching here that I think is valuable to consider .
There 's an extraordinary essay by a man named Leo Alexander called “ Medicine Under Nazi Dictatorship . "
I think that 's the title of it .
And I do n't want to speak of the egregious abuse of human rights of the Nazis , but the more subtle program that allowed this to be pervasive , even within the medical community .
There was a shift of attitude that he describes where medicine went in the mid to late nineteenth century from being really an arena of compassionate care ...
Medicine moved from being a relatively ineffective profession at the end of the nineteenth century to starting to have some really effective interventions .
And this led us from the realm of care and comfort to the realm of treatments .
And then , logically , treatment became early diagnosis and preventive treatment .
And preventive treatment then became prevention of any symptoms with whatever interventions you could do ...
But there is this strange shift in this process that moves from a focus on compassion and a focus on the deep human realities of what 's happening to a much more mechanistic and social perspective on the phenomenon such that you relatively quickly in your inner mind , your general personal psychology and social attitude , move from prevention to a — I do n't know quite what the right word is , but it 's a preemptive disposition .
And I 'm personally concerned about this because it 'll take us time , and as a human civilization we 'll mature into this new knowledge .
But one thing we need to bear in mind in this process — and we could bring this out in a report , I believe — is the depth of the human meaning of all of this , the importance of sustaining the fundamental core of what medicine and , of course , all of individual and social life is .
It 's a human , personal process and a collective process that we are not products , and our children should never become products .
We are processes and journeys , and these journeys are inevitably going to involve a dimension of suffering and , as we pointed out in our other reports , frailty and ultimately finitude .
And this kind of knowledge that we 're entering into could change not just the general character of our culture but our internal experiences of what life is .
I think we could use the subject of newborn screening as a moment for speaking more broadly to the whole other side of testing in general and speak about some of the personal dimensions of this and also , by the way , some of the commercial dimensions because there 's different kinds of discrimination .
I mean , when you do the equivalent of seductive advertising , especially when there 's fear involved , and draw people into testing that is largely inconclusive or useless or even misleading , there 's something really wrong going on there .
And even if the FDA controls some of that , or whatever agency would , there 's some things to warn people about .
And so the broad social attitudes , the specifics of the relationship within commercial society , and the personal dimensions of this I think are very worth commenting on .
The concerns of groups such as CCHC and bioethicists , that parents and the public deserve to be fully informed of the risks as well as the benefits of genetic screening and that people need to retain full ownership of their personal genetic material — what makes you , you — speaks to far greater issues .
It is ultimately about what rights and choices individuals in a free society retain and what they give away to the government .
While the ' need ' for the government to house and use genetic information on people without their consent deserves close scrutiny itself , the fact that the government is even disputing the right of people to own their own genetic material is the most unsettling aspect of all .

So , CNN personality Richard Quest was arrested early Friday morning for drug possession when police found in Central Park well after the park's 1 a.m. curfew .
Sure , the initial reports said Quest told police he was carrying methamphetamime in his pocket , but leave it to the NY Post to add the really detailed details .
Not only did Quest have drugs , he also had a " rope around his neck that was tied to his genitals , and a sex toy in his boot . "
That was so not in the NY Times ' account .
The Post also reported , " It was n't immediately clear what the rope was for " and that " the officer at the scene was able to ID the drug because of 'his prior experience as a police officer in drug arrests , observation of packaging which is characteristic of this type of drug , and defendant 's statements that ... " I 've got some meth in my pocket . " ' "
Ha !
Quest , who was in jail most of yesterday , was charged with loitering and drug possession ( but not lewdness because he was n't exposed ) .
His lawyer claimed Quest was " returning to his hotel with friends " and had no idea there was a curfew for the park .
Quest will attend six months of drug counseling and if he stays out of trouble , the charges will be dismissed and his case sealed .

University of Mumbai's Kalina Campus is on Top of the Headlines Due to Sex Romp
Source :- www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com
High drama played out on the University of Mumbai 's Kalina campus in the early hours of Tuesday when two students were found in a compromising position on the floor of the student council office .
The incident was captured on a mobile phone camera by other students through the window .
The clips were immediately sent to the media .
By 8.00 am , the campus was crawling with cameras , policemen and the members of the National Students Union of India
While the faces of the couple are not visible on the MMS clips , the male student accused of making out with a female hostelite is the general secretary of the university 's student council .
At around 4.30 am , students in the study hall , which is on the second floor of the Administrative Building , heard noises that seemed to be emerging from the ground - floor office , and went down to check .
" They peered through the window and saw the general secretary and a girl student making out , " alleged Aboli , who is the same person who blackened the face of a
Wilson College
professor two years ago after alleging that the latter had sexually harassed a girl student .
The professor however was given a clean chit by the police .
When the police unlocked the door , Aboli said , the student council 's general secretary and two girl students walked out .
Oddly , while the general secretary denied all allegations , one of the girls told the police that she had taken part in a " consensual act " .
The three students told police they were in the council office till late while working on the varsity 's annual magazine .
The girls , also final - year MSc students , had obtained night - out passes from their hostel wardens to work on the magazine .
University officials have pulled up the security officers for allowing the students to work till late .
University pro vice chancellor A D Sawant said that the security officer complained that students regularly used the council office for a host of reasons even after office hours .
Some states have experienced more recent surges .
From December 2006 to December 2007 , more than 40 states saw recipient numbers rise , and in several  Arizona , Florida , Maryland , Nevada , North Dakota and Rhode Island  the one - year growth was 10 percent or more .
In Rhode Island , the number of recipients climbed by 18 percent over the last two years , to more than 84,000 as of February , or about 8.4 percent of the population .
This is the highest total in the last dozen years or more , said Bob McDonough , the state ’s administrator of family and adult services , and reflects both a strong enlistment effort and an upward creep in unemployment .
In New York , a program to promote enrollment increased food stamp rolls earlier in the decade , but the current climb in applications appears in part to reflect economic hardship , said Michael Hayes , spokesman for the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance .
The additional 67,000 clients added from July 2007 to January of this year brought total recipients to 1.86 million , about one in 10 New Yorkers .
Nutrition and poverty experts praise food stamps as a vital safety net that helped eliminate the severe malnutrition seen in the country as recently as the 1960s .
But they also express concern about what they called the gradual erosion of their value .
Food stamps are an entitlement program , with eligibility guidelines set by Congress and the federal government paying for benefits while states pay most administrative costs .
Eligibility is determined by a complex formula , but basically recipients must have few assets and incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line , or less than $ 27,560 for a family of four .
As a share of the national population , food stamp use was highest in 1994 , after several years of poor economic growth , with an average of 27.5 million recipients per month from a lower total of residents .
The numbers plummeted in the late 1990s as the economy grew and legal immigrants and certain others were excluded .
Last week Bill Moyers sat down with Leila Fadel while she was stateside to receive a George Polk Award for Foreign Reporting .
In this interview she bluntly lays bare all the spin on Iraq and Iran in a way that is all too rare these days .

I can't say enough good things about this brave woman , but I would echo all of what Spencer and Matthew have written about her and then some .
McClatchy , one of the few sane voices on Iraq since before the invasion ( when they were still known as Knight - Ridder ) continues to impress .
Watch the full interview on Moyers ' PBS website , and you can check out Leila Fadel 's McClatchy blog , Baghdad Observer and her team 's Inside Iraq .
Transcript after the jump .
BILL MOYERS : Just this week Iraq was struck by a fresh wave of violence .
At least 50 people died from a bombing at a funeral - a funeral !
Sixty people were killed earlier in the week , and 120 wounded .
It 's difficult … but gruesome news does n't go away because we look away .
So consider these photos taken in Baquba , Ramadi , and Mosul -- victims of car bombs and suicide attacks .
Such scenes are routine for the people in Iraq and the journalists who still cover them .
One of those journalists is Leila Fadel - the Baghdad bureau chief for the McClatchy Newspaper Group .
She was born in Saudi Arabia of a Lebanese father and a mother from Michigan .
The fact that she speaks Arabic may have saved her life when she was covering the war between Hezbollah and Israel .
She 's reported on everything from Iran 's relationship with Iraq … to the impact of war on families in ethnically torn neighborhoods … to the constant stress on US troops .
And she does it all so well that this week she received a George Polk award for foreign reporting - an honor bestowed for courage under fire .

BILL MOYERS : [ W ]e read a lot about the thousand Iraqi soldiers who quit the fight in Basra , laid down their arms .
And this week there were stories of more defectors in Sadr City .
Are these people cowed ?
Are they afraid ?
What 's happening ?
LEILA FADEL : I think it 's a combination of things .
I think there are people who do n't feel that they should be fighting the Mahdi Army , who do n't feel that they should be killing their Shia brothers because most of the Iraqi security forces are Shia .
And I think there is also threats .
I mean , we had reports of the Mahdi Army going house to house in Sadr City and if they were Iraqi security forces , they would say , " We know where you live .
We know where your family is .
And if you fight us , we 'll find you . "
And so I think it 's a combination of the fear that their families will be killed and that they 're being killed as well as a moral objection by some of them .
BILL MOYERS : Moral objection ?
LEILA FADEL : I think so , yes .
BILL MOYERS : To ?
LEILA FADEL : To fighting who the people they consider their brothers .
BILL MOYERS : You broke the story that it was an appeal to an Iranian source .
You broke the story that the Iranians actually intervened to stop the fighting in Basra , right ?
LEILA FADEL : That 's right .
Yeah , that 's right .
BILL MOYERS : So there 's real evidence on the ground that Iran is influential in Iraq .
LEILA FADEL : Yes .
I mean , I do n't think anybody questions that Iran is influential in Iraq .
I do n't know that all of Iran 's influence in Iraq is bad influence .
Iran has chips on every table , you know ?
They 're betting on everybody .
You 'll talk to Iraqi officials who say that the Iranians are willing to give money to anybody .
You have Sunni leaders going to meet with Iranian officials in Iran .
The man who is the Iraqi affairs man is the head of the Qods force in Iraq in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , who the United States says is a terrorist .
He is the man that deals with Iraqi affairs .
He is the man that deals with Iraqi officials .
He is the man that was involved when an Iraqi delegation went to Iran in March to stop the fighting in Basra and apparently was the one that was helping get Moqtada Sadr to say stand down .
Now maybe it's a bad thing that the Iranians have so much influence , but what do we expect when we put a Shia government into power ?
These men took refuge and had funding in Iran .
BILL MOYERS : Let 's listen to what President Bush said recently about Iran 's influence in Iraq .
PRESIDENT BUSH : The regime in Tehran also has a choice to make .
It can live in peace with its neighbor , enjoy strong economic and cultural and religious ties .
Or it can continue to arm and train and fund illegal militant groups , which are terrorizing the Iraqi people and turning them against Iran .
If Iran makes the right choice , American will encourage a peaceful relationship between Iran and Iraq .
Iran makes the wrong choice , America will act to protect our interests , and our troops and our Iraqi partners .
BILL MOYERS : What 's your reaction hearing the President talk that way ?
LEILA FADEL : First of all , just in the practical sense , the American Army 's tired .
They 're on third and fourth rotations in Iraq .
Can they really go after Iran at this point ?
And secondly , what are we going to do if we go into Iran , the United States ?
They say that the Iranian government is bringing weapons into Iraq and funding and training the Shia militias .
I do n't know if the Iranian government is doing that .
I know that they say that the rockets hitting the Green Zone are 107 - millimeter rockets that are made in Iran .
I know they say the deadliest weapon used against U.S. troops are the EFPs , and those are deadly .
But do you really go and invade the neighboring country of the unstable nation that you 're already in ?
BILL MOYERS : But do you , as a reporter , find evidence of mischief on the part of Iran ?
LEILA FADEL : Oh , definitely .
I do n't think Iran is not mischievous .
I do n't think the United States is not mischievous in Iraq .
I think Iran has a vested interest in having a weak Iraq next to them because they did have an eight - years war with Iraq .
They did have a hostile environment between the two nations .
And I think it's in their interest to have some control over that neighbor .
And that 's what they have .
I mean , they have groups , the parties that are in power are the parties that were created in their area , are the parties that thrived and fought Saddam from Iran .
And so when the best friend in the government of the United States , which I explain the Islamist Supreme Council of Iraq , when Hakim is coming to the White House and speaking to President Bush but also going to Iran and speaking to Ahmadinejad and is very , very much influenced by Iran , it 's really unclear what we 're complaining about .
I mean , we should have expected that this government would be Iran friendly .
BILL MOYERS : Here 's Senator Joe Lieberman speaking on this when General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were in town recently .
SENATOR LIEBERMAN :
Let me ask you first , are the Iranians still training and equipping Iraqi extremists who are going back into Iraq and killing American soldiers ?
GENERAL PETRAEUS :
That is correct , Senator .
SENATOR LIEBERMAN :
Is it fair to say that the Iranian - backed special groups in Iraq are responsible for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians ?
GENERAL PETRAEUS :
It certainly is .
I do believe that is correct .
Again some of that also is militia elements who have then subsequently been trained by these individuals .
BILL MOYERS : What about that ?
LEILA FADEL : Well , I do n't , you know , the U.S. military says that they have people in detention that say they were trained and supplied in Iran and apparently have killed U.S. soldiers .
I do n't know .
That 's what they say .
I do n't know that it 's true .
They have -- and they also , you know , they 're calling these Iranian - backed special groups .
The entire Iraqi government is Iranian backed .
You know , all these -- they say that if the United States pulls out , Iran says they can fill the security vacuum in Iraq .
That 's what Iran says .
And Iran says , on their side of the story when they 've never admitted to being involved in these things publicly .
And when you ask them about it , they say , " Well , actually the problem is the United States .
They want unrest in Iraq so they 'll never leave . "
BILL MOYERS : So , on the one hand , Iraq is working behind the scenes to broker a cease fire in Sadr City .
And yet we 're , again , making Iran out to be the one behind the violence .
I mean , there 's a paradox there , right ?
LEILA FADEL : Right .
Right .
I do n't think Iran is nothing 's black and white .
I do n't think Iran is the white knight or the evil villain either .
I think that Iran is playing a political game in Iraq .

John Adams , who was later the second president of the United States , wrote some words in the Constitution of Massachusetts that have been quoted approvingly by the U.S. Supreme Court and every state supreme court in the United States .
He described a separation of powers among three branches of government and said that this would be done
" to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men . "
Thomas Paine in his " Common Sense " pamphlets that helped launch the American war for independence , wrote that
" so far as we approve of monarchy , ... in America THE LAW IS KING .
For as in absolute governments the King is law , so in free countries the law OUGHT to be King ; and there ought to be no other . "
I raise this point in order to suggest that the question of whether the US Constitution requires impeaching Bush and Cheney is not an academic one and is very closely tied to the straightforward question of whether we should impeach Bush and Cheney .
The Constitution is the highest law of this land .
If it requires that something be done , then a failure to do it amounts to moving the country in the direction of lawlessness , and possibly in the direction of the rule of men and women , not of laws .
This is the case unless , of course , we amend the Constitution to fit our chosen behavior .
The Constitution is not infallible .
There are sections of the original text that I 'm pleased have been removed through the amendment process .
There are other sections that I think should be changed , things that should be added that are not there , etc .
But there is a great danger in sidestepping the democratic process of amending the law and proceeding to simply violate it .
The Constitution , of course , gives the three branches of the national government different powers , and provides each with checks on abuses of power by the others .
The president is to execute the laws created by Congress .
He , or she , serves as commander in chief of the military .
He can pardon crimes ( but not impeachments ) .
If he consults with and gets the support of the Senate , the president can negotiate treaties and appoint officials , ambassadors , and judges .
That 's about it .
There is no constitutional presidential power to write or alter or violate laws , to act in secret , to abridge the judicial system , to violate the Bill of Rights , to violate existing treaties , to build an empire , or to launch a war .
Oh , and the Vice President under the Constitution has no particular powers at all , other than serving as the president of the Senate , where he or she only gets to vote if there 's a tie .
In contrast , the legislative branch of our government , historically and even today in the version students are still taught in schools , has much greater power .
The Congress , to which the first half of the entire Constitution is devoted , has the exclusive power to enact laws .
Congress also has the sole power to raise and spend money .
It has the power to declare war and to fund and oversee the military .
It has the power to regulate international and interstate trade .
Congress handles immigration , bankruptcies , the printing and valuing of money , the post offices , copyrights .
Congress has the power to " constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court , " and " to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations . "
But the first power that the Constitution grants the House of Representatives is the power of impeachment .
The first power it grants the Senate is the power to try all impeachments .
In school we learn about the " Separation of Powers " and about something called " Checks and Balances . "
Our three branches of government are supposed to be separately elected , none of them created by any other .
The Supreme Court is constituted by both the executive and legislative branches , not one alone .
And the power to run the nation is supposed to be divided .
Congress has certain powers .
The courts have other powers .
The president has others .
Congress , as the most powerful branch , is further divided into two houses with somewhat separate powers .
It 's important to understand that Congress is more powerful than the other branches , which is one reason the phrases " balance of power " and " checks and balances " can be misleading .
There is not supposed to be anything evenly balanced about it .
Under the U.S. system , the executive branch is understood to have the following checks on legislative power , and it still has them , plus some :
1 . The veto .
Bush does still have this power , but it is overshadowed by his newly created signing - statement power .
No longer must he choose between signing a bill and vetoing it .
Now , he can choose to sign it and rewrite it .
While signing statements are not new , this use of them is , and twice studies by the GAO have found that in a significant percentage of cases the laws Bush announces the power to violate he has proceeded to violate .
2. Commanding the military .
Bush does still have this power , but he has added to it the power to declare war in violation of Article I of the Constitution and in violation of the UN Charter which under Article VI is the law of the land , plus the power to misappropriate funds for wars that were not approved for them , and the power to take state militias ( also known as the National Guard ) away from the states to join the US military in fighting foreign wars .
3 . The vice president 's vote in the Senate .
He does still have this power .

UC Berkeley tenured law professor John Yoo epitomizes the failure of the conservative movement in America .
Known as " the torture professor , " Yoo penned the Department of Justice ( sic ) memos that gave a blank check to sadistic Americans to torture detainees at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib .
The human rights violations that John Yoo sanctioned destroyed America ’s reputation and exposed the Bush Regime as more inhumane than the Muslim terrorists .
The acts that Yoo justified are felonies under US law and war crimes under the Nuremberg standard .
Yoo ’s torture memos are so devoid of legal basis that his close friend and fellow conservative member of the Federalist Society , Jack Goldsmith , rescinded the memos when he was appointed head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
Yoo ’s extremely shoddy legal work and the fervor with which he served the evil intentions of the Bush Regime have led to calls from distinguished legal scholars for Yoo ’s dismissal from Berkeley ’s Boalt Hall .
I sympathize with the calls for Yoo ’s dismissal .
In the new edition of The Tyranny of Good Intentions , my coauthor and I write : " Liberty has no future in America if law schools provide legitimacy to those who would subvert the US Constitution . "
However , John
Yoo is but the tip of the iceberg .
Scapegoating
Yoo diverts attention from a neoconservative movement that has become the greatest enemy of the US Constitution .
In theory conservatives adore the Constitution and seek to protect it with appeals to " original intent . "
In practice conservatives hate the Constitution as the protector of homosexuals and abortionists .
Conservatives regard civil liberties as coddling devices for criminals and terrorists .
They see the First Amendment as a foolish protection for sedition .
The neoconservative magazine , Commentary , has called for the New York Times to be prosecuted for informing Americans that President Bush was illegally spying on them without warrants .
The conservative assault on the US Constitution is deeply entrenched .
The Federalist Society , an organization of Republican attorneys from which the Republican Party chooses its Justice Department appointees and nominees to the federal bench , was organized as an assault on the checks and balances in the Constitution .
The battle cry of the Federalist Society is " energy in the executive . "
The society has its origin in Republican frustrations from the days when Republicans had a " lock on the presidency , " but had their agenda blocked by a Democratic Congress .
The Federalist Society set about producing rationales for elevating the powers of the executive in order to evade the checks and balances the Founding Fathers wrote into the political system .
With the Bush Regime we have seen President Nixon ’s claim that " it ’s not illegal if the President does it " carried to new heights .
With the complicity of Democrats , Bush and Cheney have appointed attorneys general who have elevated the presidency above the law .
Just as liberals used judicial activism in the federal courts to achieve their agenda , the conservatives are using the Department of Justice to concentrate power in the executive branch in order to achieve their agenda .
In America the Constitution has no friends .
It is always in the way of one agenda or the other and , thus , always under threat .
For now , however , the threat is from the right .
Conservatives have confused loyalty to country , which is loyalty to the Constitution , with loyalty to the Bush Regime .
It is purely a partisan loyalty based in emotion — " you are with us or against us . "
When I was a young man conservatives were frustrated that facts , reason and analysis could not penetrate liberal emotion .
Today facts , reason and analysis cannot penetrate conservative emotions .
When I write a factual column describing how we have been deceived into wars that are clearly not in our interest , self - described conservatives indignantly write to me : " If you hate America so much , why do n’t you move to Cuba ! "
Conservatives have become so intellectually pathetic that they regard my defense of civil liberties as an anti-American act .
Today ’s conservatives are so poorly informed that they cannot understand that to lose the Constitution is to lose the country .
John
Yoo was a willing accomplice of inhumane and illegal acts .
But his greatest crime is that he was a willing participant in the Bush Regime ’s assault on the Constitution , which protects us all .
If Yoo is to be held accountable , what about George W. Bush , Dick Cheney and his aides , attorneys general Gonzales and Mukasey , Yoo ’s Justice Department boss , now federal judge Bybee , Rumsfeld , Rice , Hadley , and the legion of neocon brownshirts that comprise the regime ’s subcabinet ?
Is Yoo any more culpable than anyone else who served the corrupt , evil , and anti-American Bush Regime ?
The ease with which the Bush Regime has run roughshod over the law and Constitution indicates that the brownshirt mentality to which many Americans have succumbed has sufficient attractive power to cause a professor from one of the country ’s great liberal institutions to serve the cause of tyranny .
The conservative movement has produced a cadre of brownshirts that might yet succeed in destroying the American Constitution .

A Spaceloft SL - 2 rocket is launched Saturday , April , 28 , 2007 , from Spaceport America carrying the ashes of about 200 people whose family members were on hand to witness the launch .
The launch was the spaceport 's first successful mission .
The general public may soon have the chance to rest in peaceon the moon , at least briefly .
Houston - based Celestis , Inc. has announcedplans to launch cremated human remains to the surface of the moon as soon as2009 .
A small portion ?
1 gram ? of theencapsulated cremated remainsof one person can be sentto the moon for $ 9,995 .
The price includes the option of watching the launch , an inscription of the deceased 's name on an accompanying plaque , and complimentary scattering of the remainder of the remains at sea near thelaunch site .
For $ 29,985 , Celestis will launch 14 grams total of thecremated remains of two people together .
These prices do not include cremation , which can generallycost about $ 2,000 , said Doug Sholette , funeral director of the FraryFuneral Home in Ogdensburg , N.Y .
For comparison , coffin burials on Earth usuallycost at least $ 5,000 , Sholette said .
One gram of cremated remains is less than 1 percent of theaverage person ?s remains , which usuallyweigh 3 to 5 pounds , Sholette said .
When Celestis sends a person's ashes to the moon , they stay within a capsule in a spacecraft on the lunar surface forever , and are not dispersed .
" We are pleased to schedule theseLuna Service missions , to extend our leadership in the commercial spaceindustry , and ?
most importantly ?
to serve our global community of familiesand loved ones wishing to honor the life of a special person , " said Charles M.Chafer , Celestis founder and president .
Celestis has partnered with Odyssey MoonLimited and Astrobotic Technology , Inc. , which will do the actual transportingof the remains to the moon .
Future customers wo n't be the first peopleto have their remains spread on the moon .
In 1998 , Celestis , at the request ofNASA , provided a Luna Flight Capsule to the family and friends of the latelegendary astronomer and planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker .
The CelestisFlight Capsule , containing a symbolic portion of Shoemaker ?s cremated remains , was attached to NASA ?s Lunar Prospector spacecraftand launched on a one - year mission orbiting the moon .
On July 31 , 1999 , at the completion of Lunar Prospector 's mission , the spacecraft was intentionally crashed into themoon 's south pole , making Shoemaker the first human to be laid to rest onanother celestial body .
NASA called the memorial " a special honor for a specialhuman being . "
Since 1997 , Celestis has been sendinghuman remains into Earth orbit .
The company conducted six memorial spaceflightsfor people from 14 nations , including " Star Trek " creator Gene Roddenberry , Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper and " StarTrek " actor JamesDoohan ( " Scotty " ) .
The next Celestis mission , set for June 2008 , will send the remains of 205 participants to Earth orbit aboard a Falcon 1rocket .

Capital in the form of credit is normally and , certainly , properly , extended out of previously accumulated savings .
In sharpest contrast , credit expansion is the creation of new and additional money out of thin air , which money is then lent to business firms and individuals as though it were a supply of new and additional saved up capital funds .
Its existence serves to reduce interest rates and to enable loans to be made and debts to be incurred which otherwise would not have been made or incurred .
Always and everywhere , to the extent that private banks participate in the process of credit expansion , they do so with the sanction and generally with the active encouragement of the government .
Economists , above all Ludwig von Mises , have shown how credit expansion is responsible for the boom - bust business cycle and how its existence depends on deliberate government policy .
Nevertheless , public opinion believes that the business cycle is an inherent feature of capitalism and that the role of government is not that of causing the phenomenon but of combating it .
Indeed , as Mises observed , " Nothing harmed the cause of liberalism [ capitalism ] more than the almost regular return of feverish booms and of the dramatic breakdown of bull markets followed by lingering slumps .
Public opinion has become convinced that such happenings are inevitable in the unhampered market economy . "
The truth is that credit expansion is responsible not only for the boom - bust cycle but also for another major negative phenomenon for which public opinion mistakenly blames capitalism : namely , sharply increased economic inequality , in which the wealthier strata of the population appear to increase their wealth dramatically relative to the rest of the population and for no good reason .
It is not accidental that the two leading periods of credit expansion in history — the 1920s and the period since the mid-1990s — have been characterized by a major increase in economic inequality .
Both in the 1920s and in the more recent period , a major cause of the increased economic inequality is that the new and additional funds created in credit expansion show up very soon in the financial markets , where they drive up the prices of securities , above all , common stocks .
The owners of common stock are preponderantly wealthy individuals , who now find themselves the beneficiaries of substantial capital gains .
These gains are the greater the larger and more prolonged the credit expansion is and the higher it drives the prices of shares .
In the process of new and additional money pouring into the financial markets , investment bankers and stock speculators are in a position to reap especially great gains .
Since it 's so important , the main point just made needs to be repeated : credit expansion creates an artificial economic inequality by showing up in the stock market and driving up stock prices .
Since the stocks are owned mainly by wealthy people , they are the main beneficiaries of the process .
The more substantial and the more prolonged the credit expansion is , the larger are the gains enjoyed by wealthy people more than anyone else .
The new and additional funds injected into the economic system also soon show up in an additional demand for capital goods , such as business inventories and plant and equipment , and in an additional demand for consumers ' durable goods , such as houses and automobiles .
The purchase of these latter goods , like the capital goods purchased by business firms , depends largely on credit and is encouraged by lower interest rates .
It is also fed by the capital gains being reaped by wealthy individuals , which results in an especially pronounced increase in the demand for luxury housing and for luxury goods in general .
The additional demand for capital goods and consumers ' durable goods serves to increase business sales revenues and thus business profits across a wide spectrum of the economic system .
Credit expansion increases profits in the economic system because the expenditure of the new and additional money in buying capital goods and labor increases the sales revenues of business firms immediately , while it increases the costs they must deduct from those sales revenues only with a time lag .
This is also true to an extent of inflation that enters the economic system by means of its creators simply spending the new and additional money rather than lending it out — " simple inflation , " as Mises calls it .
What is present in both kinds of inflation — credit expansion and simple inflation — is the fact that sales revenues rise as soon as new and additional money is spent , but the costs deducted from the sales revenues of any given year largely reflect outlays of money made in previous years .
In those previous years the quantity of money and volume of spending of virtually all types was smaller , including the spending that shows up in the present year as costs in business income statements .
Credit expansion boosts profits more than does simple inflation because the reduction in interest rates it brings about serves to increase the time lag between the making of expenditures for capital goods and labor and their subsequent appearance as costs in business income statements .
The low interest rates encourage the purchase of such things as durable machinery and the undertaking of construction projects .
The kind of increase that this must bring about in economy - wide profits can be seen in the following examples .
Thus in one case , imagine that a business firm uses newly created money that has come into its hands to increase its newspaper advertising , say .
Its additional expenditure will be equivalent additional sales revenue to the newspaper .
It will also most likely be an equivalent immediate additional cost to it — a cost that it must deduct from its sales revenues in its very next income statement .
Thus , in the same accounting period that the newspaper records additional sales revenues equal to the firm 's additional expenditure , the firm itself must record an equal additional cost of production to deduct from its own sales revenues .
Obviously , in this case there is no increase in the economy - wide aggregate amount of profit .
This is because economy - wide , aggregate sales revenues and economy - wide aggregate costs have both increased to the same extent .
But now imagine that the firm spends the same amount of money in buying durable machinery that will be depreciated over a ten - year period .
Once again , a seller — this time the seller of the machinery — will immediately have additional sales revenues equal to our firm 's additional expenditure .
But in this case , our firm will certainly not have an equally large additional cost of production to report in its next income statement .
If its expenditure for the machinery was $ 1 million , say , then while the seller has $ 1 million of additional sales revenues in his next annual income statement , our firm will probably have merely $ 100,000 of additional costs to report in its next annual income statement .
This is because the purchase price of the machine is not charged off all at once , but only gradually , over its depreciable life .
The implication of this example is that in the current year there will be an addition of $ 900,000 to economy - wide , aggregate profits .
If our firm 's $ 1 million were part of an investment in the construction of a building with a forty - year depreciable life , the implied addition to economy - wide , aggregate profits would be even greater .
Such boosts to profits go hand in glove with the rise in common - stock prices and greatly reinforce them .
Of course , once credit expansion comes to an end , the stimulus it gave to profits and to the stock market both disappear and at that point profits plunge and capital gains turn into capital losses .
And at that point , the enemies of capitalism turn to attacking capitalism for causing depressions .
Now as the new and additional money created in credit expansion works its way through the economic system , one would expect the demand for labor and thus wage rates also to rise .
This certainly does tend to happen , and in the 1920s wages increased substantially in terms both of money and real buying power .
They simply did not increase to nearly the same extent as the incomes of the wealthier strata of the population , nor , of course , to the extent that business profits increased .
In addition to the special stimulus given to profits , a second reason for the failure of wages to keep pace with the rise in profits is that the encouragement given by credit expansion to the purchase of durable capital goods , particularly plant and equipment , tends to take place at the expense of funds that otherwise would be devoted to the purchase of labor services .
As a result , the rise in wages is retarded at the same time that profits sharply advance .
For this reason too it does not keep pace with the rise in profits .
Despite any appearances to the contrary , the rise in real wages in the 1920s was not the result of credit expansion but of rising production .
Credit expansion actually operated to retard the rise in production insofar as it caused the wasteful investment of capital , i.e. , what Mises calls malinvestment .
The rise in production is what prevented the prices of goods and services from rising as rapidly as credit expansion raised wage rates in terms of money .
The rise in production , in turn , was based on a high degree of availability of capital funds provided by actual savings , as opposed to credit expansion , together with rapid scientific and technological progress .
It was this that increased real wages , i.e. , the goods and services that wage earners could actually buy with their wages .
In contrast to the experience of the 1920s , in the two great recent credit expansions , i.e. , the dot - com bubble of 1995 – 2001 and its successor , the presently collapsing housing bubble that began not long thereafter , there has been very little , if any , rise in real wages .
Most commentators appear to attribute this to nothing more than the unrestrained greed of businessmen and capitalists .
They apparently go on the theory that if there is anything in the economic system that breathes or moves other than at the command of the government , or other than with the active supervision and control of the government , it is proof that we live in an era of " laissez - faire . "
For example , in The New York Times of December 30 , 2007 , in an article titled " The Free Market : A False Idol After All ? "
Times columnist Peter Goodman writes :
For more than a quarter - century , the dominant idea guiding economic policy in the United States and much of the globe has been that the market is unfailingly wise .
So wise that the proper role for government is to steer clear and not mess with the gusher of wealth that will flow , trickling down to the [ sic ] every level of society , if only the market is left to do its magic .
That notion has carried the day as industries have been unshackled from regulation , and as taxes have been rolled back , along with the oversight powers of government .
This alleged laissez - faire environment , such writers pretend , has enabled businessmen and capitalists shamelessly to enrich themselves at the expense of increasingly impoverished wage earners , to whom nothing any longer even " trickles down . "
Increased free trade and " globalization , " of course , are attacked as part of the process and as greatly contributing to the stagnation or outright decline in real wages .
In sharpest contrast to such blather , in the real world there are innumerable rules and regulations enacted by the federal government to control virtually every aspect of economic activity .
They are contained in the more than 70,000 pages of The Federal Register .
The overwhelming mass of government interference described therein , and in its counterparts at the state and local level , is a glaring refutation of claims about the existence of any kind of laissez - faire in the present - day world .
The very description of such interference , in tens of thousands of pages of official text , is a refutation of such size and literal weight as to render any claims about laissez - faire or insufficient government controls or regulations utterly nonsensical .
This truly massive body of material also suggests that the actual explanation for the stagnation in real wages is precisely an ever - growing burden of government intervention in the economic system .
The intervention is in the form of policies that undermine genuine saving and in numerous other ways undermine capital accumulation and the rise in the productivity of labor .
Personal and corporate income taxes , the inheritance tax , the capital gains tax , and government budget deficits — all entail the taking away of funds that , if left in the hands of their owners , would have been heavily spent , indeed , overwhelmingly spent , in the purchase of capital goods and labor services .
Instead , those funds are diverted into financing the consumption of the government and those to whom the government gives money .
Inflation and credit expansion greatly exacerbate this diversion of funds , because their effect is artificially to increase the incomes subject to these taxes and thus to deprive business firms of the funds required to replace assets at prices made higher by the same process that increases their taxable incomes .
The progressive aspect of income and inheritance taxes also worsens their effects , because incomes tend to be saved and invested the more heavily the larger they are ; at the same time , substantial inheritances are more likely to be retained in the form of accumulated savings and capital than are modest inheritances .
Because of the reduced demand for labor that results from the taxation of funds that would otherwise have been used in employing labor and in buying capital goods , wages are substantially less than they otherwise would have been .
At the same time , the buying power of those reduced wages is also sharply reduced in comparison with what it otherwise would have been .
It is worth pointing out that , totally apart from the effect of social security in undermining the incentive to save , the sheer rise in tax rates since 1965 to pay for the system has taken away fully eight additional percentage points of the income of every wage earner whose earnings are equal to or less than the amount subject to such taxation .
In 1965 the combined social security tax on wage earners and their employers was 7.25 percent , which applied to a maximum annual income of $ 4,800 .
Today , the combined rate is 15.3 percent , which includes 2.9 percent for Medicare .
The 15.3 percent rate currently , i.e. , in 2008 , applies to all wages and salaries up to a maximum of $ 102,000 per year .
The effect of these major increases both in social security tax rates and in the amount of income subject to them has been to reduce the take - home wages of many workers by considerably more than 8 percent .
The social security contribution of employers is a loss to wage earners , because it is a cost of employment no different than the payment of take - home wages .
Financially , it is a matter of indifference to employers whether they pay this sum to the government or to their employees .
The cost to them is the same .
It is money that the employees could and would have had , if the government had not taken it from the employers .
The same is true of all other costs borne by employers on behalf of their workers , whether it is health insurance , day care , family leave , or whatever .
The costs in question are all costs of employment , which , in the absence of such government interference , the wage earners could and would have had in their own pockets .
Compelling employers to pay the costs of such things is at the expense of the workers ' take - home wages .
The more such costs are imposed , the lower are take - home wages in comparison with what they otherwise would have been .
The increase in such costs over time has correspondingly held down any rise in take - home wages .
Government intervention , as I 've said , not only holds down the demand for labor and thus wages , particularly take - home wages , but it also reduces the buying power of wages .
This is because the supply of capital goods is less , thanks to the diversion of funds from their purchase .
The absence of these capital goods prevents the productivity of labor from being increased as much as it otherwise would have been .
This in turn holds down the production both of consumers ' goods and of further capital goods .
The consequence of a lesser supply of consumers ' goods is prices of consumers ' goods that are higher than they otherwise would have been and thus a buying power of wages that is correspondingly lower than it otherwise would have been .
The consequent absence of further capital goods compounds the negative effect on production , in a process that can be repeated over and over again , with each passing year .
What this means is that because fewer capital goods in the form of factories and machines are available this year , the ability to produce capital goods in the form of factories and machines for the following year is reduced , because capital goods in the form of factories and machines are the means of producing further capital goods in the form of factories and machines no less than they are of producing consumers ' goods .
The buying power of wages is also reduced by all of the other laws and regulations that hold down the production and supply of goods in general and thus keep up prices .
And again , there is a compounding effect .
Environmental legislation deserves an especially prominent place in any list of such laws and regulations .
Already , because of the restrictions it has imposed on the production of oil , coal , natural gas , and atomic power , it has served to raise the price of energy to unprecedented levels and to deprive many wage earners of the ability to buy gasoline for their cars or trucks and heating oil for their homes .
To the extent that wage earners are able to pay energy prices reflecting a $ 100 - per - barrel price of oil , their ability to buy other goods is correspondingly reduced .
If the environmental movement 's agenda of radical reductions ( up to 90 percent ) in carbon dioxide emissions is imposed , meeting it will require absolutely crippling cutbacks in the production and use of oil , coal , and natural gas , which must result in corresponding reductions in production , increases in prices , and absolute devastation for real wages .
The negative effect on production here is again a cumulative one , inasmuch as lack of energy supplies hampers the ability to find and exploit further supplies of energy .
The more abundant and cheaper energy is , the greater is man 's ability to move masses of earth and to process them , thereby developing further energy supplies .
Thus , government intervention that reduces energy supplies reduces the ability to find and exploit further energy supplies .
Other examples of laws and regulations holding down production are minimum - wage , pro-union , and licensing legislation .
These cause higher costs , higher prices , the diversion of labor from more productive pursuits to less productive pursuits , and , finally , unemployment .
Subsidies of all kinds , tariffs , and consumer - product safety legislation also serve to hold down the production and supply of things and to keep up or add to their costs and prices .
Again , to whatever extent production in general is curtailed , so too is the production of capital goods , with a consequent cumulative negative effect on subsequent production .
It should be clear that the resumption of an era of high and progressively rising real wages requires a radical reduction of government intervention into the economic system and the reestablishment of economic freedom .
What we have seen is that credit expansion is responsible not only for the boom - bust business cycle , as Mises showed , but also that it is a major source of artificial economic inequality and sharply increases profits relative to wages .
These are processes that come to an end and are actually thrown into reverse as soon as credit expansion stops and the recession / depression that is its ultimate consequence begins .
In wasting capital through malinvestment , it undermines the rise in production and accompanying rise in real wages .
Despite credit expansion , real wages could still rise through most of American history , because of the substantial economic freedom enjoyed in the United States and did so even in the midst of credit expansion , as in the 1920s .
In the last two episodes of major credit expansion , however , and over the last several decades as a whole , real wages have largely stagnated .
This stagnation is the result of massive government intervention into the economic system that undermines capital accumulation and both the demand for labor and the productivity of labor .
It is not the result of economic inequality , the profit motive , or any other aspect of the capitalist system .
I have explained all of the essential matters discussed in this article in full detail , with all of their presuppositions and implications , in my book Capitalism : A Treatise on Economics .
US housing sales have fallen sharply in the past year
Sales of previously - owned US homes fell 20 % in March as the downturn in the housing market continued , the nation 's main estate agency trade body has said .
The number of sales contracts signed during the month was 20 % lower than March 2007 , according to the National Association of Realtors .
It added that the number of contracts signed was down 1 % from February .
The decline had been expected by economists , with the market showing no signs of pulling out of its slump .
' No shock '
" This is not a shock , " said David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services .
" The pace of sales seems to be stabilizing but that 's the best you could say about it .
" But I do n't think we 've hit a bottom yet .
" Combining this with the other data , the housing market is continuing downward and it wo n't bottom until this summer or some time in the third quarter . "

Are liberal Jewish voices in America being drowned out by powerful conservative lobbyists ?
A group of prominent left - leaning Jewish - Americans thinks so .
They have launched a new lobbying organisation , called J Street , which they hope will redress this perceived imbalance .
America 's relationship with Israel has often sparked debate " The term ' pro - Israel ' has been hijacked by those who hold views that a majority of Americans , Jews and non-Jews alike , oppose , " says executive director Jeremy Ben - Ami , a former adviser to President Bill Clinton .
He says J Street will campaign for a two - state solution to the conflict in the Middle East .
Its political fundraising sister group - J Street PAC , for political action committee - will raise money and donate to sympathetic politicians .
Furious debate
The group is billing itself as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) , the most prominent Jewish lobbying organisation in the US .
J Street says Aipac does not reflect the liberal views of a large number of its existing donors , let alone the mainstream of Jewish - American opinion .
The role of the pro-Israeli lobby - and of Aipac itself - in American politics has been the subject of furious debate in recent years .
The most pro-Israel thing any American politician or policy maker can do is help to bring about a two - state solution and a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and her neighbours
Jeremy Ben- Ami , J Street
In 2006 , academics Stephen Walt of Harvard and John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago caused a storm when they published an article arguing that groups like Aipac had pushed US foreign policy in a pro-Israeli direction often against America 's national interests .
Critics of the two academics countered that the pro-Israeli lobby should be allowed to make its case to government just like any other interest group , and that characterisations of Jewish lobbyists as " well - funded " and " powerful " were liable to play into the hands of anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists .
The team behind J Street do not necessarily buy into the Walt - Mearsheimer analysis , but they do believe that America 's current policy tilts too strongly towards Israeli right - wingers , and is in the long - term interests neither of Israel nor the US .
" The most pro-Israel thing any American politician or policy maker can do is help to bring about a two - state solution and a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and her neighbours , " says Mr Ben - Ami .
No threat Although Aipac have not publicly commented on J Street 's launch , they are - perhaps unsurprisingly - not thought to be particularly supportive of the new group 's aims .
Nor are they concerned that they will lose their pre-eminent position within the Jewish - American community .
" I believe that Aipac has very broad support and will continue to enjoy it , " Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations , of which Aipac is a member , told the Washington Post newspaper .
J Street wants the US to help broker a peace deal Financially , J Street is certainly unlikely to pose a threat to Aipac .
Its first - year budget of $ 1.5 m ( £ 750,000 ) will be no match for Aipac , which has an endowment of more than $ 100 m ( £ 50 m ) , over 100,000 members and 18 offices around the US .
J Street hopes that its voice will be amplified by some of its more high - profile backers , including former senator Lincoln Chafee .
It may also be able to draw on the power of online fundraising groups like Moveon.org , from which some of J Street 's organisers have come .
A similar attempt to create a liberal Jewish pressure group took place in the UK last year , with the launch of Independent Jewish Voices ( IJV ) .
IJV set itself up as an alternative to the Board of Deputies of British Jews , which it said was too uncritical in its attitude to Israeli policy .
' Vague approach '
At its inception , IJV was able to unveil a number of high - profile supporters , including the writer Stephen Fry and the film director Mike Leigh .
But it was criticised by some for what journalist Seth Freedman described as its " vague , indistinct approach " , particularly in its attitude towards the controversial proposal from members of the UK - based University and College Union to boycott Israeli academic institutions .
J Street will get hammered and accused of being anti-Israel
Ken Wald , political scientist
In November 2007 , one of IJV 's leading members , Rabbi David Goldberg , resigned from the group , citing the organisation 's " lack of direction " .
J Street will be more focused on raising money and lobbying influential politicians than IJV , and the American group is unlikely to engage in divisive political campaigns .
But it is likely to draw criticism from more conservative pro-Israeli factions .
" [ J Street ] will get hammered and accused of being anti-Israel , " University of Florida political scientist Ken Wald told the Jewish Week newspaper .
" A lot will have to do with the way they actually frame their arguments , " he added .
J Street may not succeed in its ambition to become a rival to Aipac and the other pro-Israeli lobby groups .
But the vibrant - and sometimes fractious - Jewish - American conversation will certainly be getting a little louder .

Critics say the cards are unlikely to prevent future terrorist attacks
The government has set out changes to its planned identity scheme - including allowing people to use passports or driving licences instead of ID cards .
Most people will not now have to give their fingerprints when getting a passport until 2011 / 12 - three years later than had previously been planned .
And plans to force passport applicants to get an ID card have been dropped .
The exception will be airport and other workers in security - sensitive jobs who will need an ID card from 2009 .
ID CARDS TIMETABLE 2008 - Some non-EU nationals will have to get them 2009 - Compulsory for 200,000 UK citizens and EU nationals who work in ' sensitive ' airport jobs 2010 - Voluntary scheme for students
2011 / 12 - Biometric passports issued , applicants can choose to get ID card 2017 - Full roll - out of identity cards
In full : Smith 's ID speech Q&A : Identity card plans Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said students would also be encouraged to get identity cards from 2010 , as part of plans to let " consumer demand " drive take - up .
She confirmed that some non-EU migrants applying for leave to enter or remain in the UK , such as students or spouses , will need ID cards from November .
The aim is that by 2015 , 90 % of foreign nationals will have identity cards , she added .
The announcement was branded a " complete U- turn " by Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne - but the Tories said the government was trying to introduce the scheme by stealth .
The government had planned to take biometrics - including fingerprints and iris scans - of everyone applying for a new passport from 2008 .
' Public acceptance '
The original proposal was that from January 2010 everyone getting a new passport would have to get an ID card in addition to a passport .
Ex -Prime Minister Tony Blair had said that a major plank of Labour 's next election manifesto would be a bill to make it compulsory for everyone , irrespective of whether they get a passport or not , to get an ID card .
But those timetables have slipped , the proposed biometric data cut back to just fingerprints and no mention made of any foreseeable plans to make identity cards compulsory .
To engage consumers ' hearts and minds on the scale required , enrolment and any tokens should be provided free of charge
Sir James Crosby
ID cards ' must be free ' Student views on ID cards " While there are big advantages to making ID cards as widespread as possible , we need to be clear there is public acceptance , " Ms Smith told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
She said that information on the national identity register would not be held on a single , central database for security reasons and she said the " full roll - out " of ID cards would happen by 2017 .
Private firms will be encouraged to set - up " biometric enrolment centres " where passport and ID card applicants will be fingerprinted .
Recommendation rejected
In a speech in London , Ms Smith " endorsed " the findings of Sir James Crosby - whose report on working with the private sector on ID cards recommended a more consumer - driven approach .
But the home office rejected one of Sir James ' key recommendations - that ID cards should be free of charge .
The government 's plans for ID cards , linking personal data to a fingerprint , have been plagued by technical delays , budget overspend and political controversy .
Biometric technology guide
The government claims identity cards will boost security , tackle identity fraud and prevent illegal immigration .
Critics oppose the cards on cost , effectiveness and civil liberty grounds .
Shadow home secretary David Davis told BBC One's Question
Time the government was trying to bring in compulsory ID cards " by stealth " .
" They are trying to introduce this very slowly so that by the time they come to make it compulsory they will have more than half the population already on and the politics will have gone out of it , " he said .
' Disastrous idea '
He was particularly concerned about the " lethally dangerous " National Identity Register because he said holding personal details of everyone in one place would be a target for criminals , hackers and terrorists .
" It 's a disastrous idea , they should have the guts to actually cancel it , " he said .
Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams told the same programme her party would fight ID cards " all the way " adding : " The terrifying thing about the ID card system , and it is unnecessary , is the sheer amount of information the government is trying to pick up on every single one of you . "
Phil Booth , of campaign group NO2ID dismissed Ms Smith 's latest announcement as a " marketing exercise " .
" Whether you volunteer or are coerced onto the ID database , there 's no way back .
You 'll be monitored for life , " he said .
The UK's main aviation trade union , Unite , has also criticised the plans , which it said could discriminate against some of its members who already have to undergo " vigorous pre-employment checks " .

Here ’s how it went :
Artist ties a dog to a tether on one corner of a room in a museum Artist places bowl of food just out of reach in other corner
Over a period of days , dog dies of starvation .
I first read about this here , and I was livid ; however , it turns out that what people believed was happening was not happening at all .
In fact , the dog was well cared for , and was fed daily .
The point of the exhibit was that the artist …
… intended the work to be a stunt to show how a starving dog suddenly becomes the centre of attention when it is in a gallery , but not when it is on the street .
The work was intended to expose people for what they really are – “ hyprocritical sheep ” .
He said that in order for the work to be valid , he and the gallery had to give the impression that the dog was genuinely starving to death and that it died .
In retrospect , he certainly did prove his point , did n’t he ?
There are two million signatures on the petition and nearly 73,000 members on the Starving Dogs is not art Facebook Group .
Clever , in a morbid kind of way .
Almost 100 security breaches resulting in personal information going missing have been reported to the government 's privacy watchdog in the last six months , it was revealed today .
Information has been recovered in only three of the cases , the information commissioner , Richard Thomas , said .
Thomas said it was " inexcusable " that public and private organisations were continuing to lose data following the controversy in November about HM Revenue & Customs ( HMRC ) losing computer discs carrying details of 25 million child benefit claimants .
Of the total number of incidents reported to the commissioner , 62 security breaches were in the public sector , 28 were in the private sector and four in the charity or third sector .
Fourteen of the private sector losses involved financial institutions .
Of those reported by public sector bodies , almost a third happened in central government and associated agencies , and a fifth in the NHS .
Thomas said : " It is particularly disappointing that the HMRC breaches have not prevented other unacceptable security breaches from occurring .
" The government , banks and other organisations need to regain the public 's trust by being far more careful with people 's personal information .
" Once again I urge business and public sector leaders to make data protection a priority in their organisation . "
Lost information included unencrypted laptops , paper documents and computer discs and memory sticks .
Some of the breaches were due to theft and others due to items going missing in the post or a courier service .
Thomas said : " The level of understanding about data protection and the need to safeguard people 's personal information have no doubt increased and I am encouraged that more chief executives and permanent secretaries appear to be taking data protection more seriously .
" But the evidence shows that more must be done to eradicate inexcusable security breaches . "
The commissioner is investigating the cases and in 16 incidents has already required an organisation to make changes to improve data security , such as encryption .
The Revenue & Customs scandal involved staff losing two computer discs in their internal mail which held the personal details of all families in the United Kingdom claiming child benefit .
Information included dates of birth , national insurance numbers and bank details .
The shadow justice secretary , Nick Herbert , said : " How can we trust a government with ever more of our private information and a national ID card database when two thirds of data breaches involve government or public sector bodies ?
" Perhaps this explains why the government has been so reluctant to accept our call for a new offence of reckless mishandling of data .
It is time for ministers to get serious about protecting personal information . "
A Cabinet Office spokesman said : " We are already taking steps to improve information assurance across government and the cabinet secretary 's ongoing review of data - handling has resulted in immediate action to improve data security arrangements .
" The final report from the review will be published later this spring .
In the interim , any security breaches that are reported are taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly investigated . "
Introduction
We have seen in other posts some of the different aspects associated with no deposit bonuses .
They are among the most popular bonuses at online casinos today , and that is regardless of whether the bonus is a small one or a big one .
The fact of the matter is that it is free , and everybody loves free stuff .
Imagine a scenario where you go to buy something and the storeowner gives you some equally delightful stuff to you even before you have paid for your purchases , that too at no cost !
You feel good about the place and are determined to come back for more .
Even before that , you will probably buying a few more things than you had originally planned , just as a gesture of thanks to the storeowner .
That is how a no deposit bonus works for people ; the benefits it brings to the player are just too good to ignore .
We have already seen in various posts what a no deposit bonus is , how it works , some dos and don’ts , and lots more .
So is that all a casino offers by way of bonuses and incentives to its players ?
Or are there more where they came from ?
Let us take a look at some of the other bonuses available at casinos today .
The Welcome Bonus
The welcome bonus is usually the first bonus that a player gets on signing up with a casino .
A no deposit bonus is also a welcome bonus , and it does not require you to deposit funds into your account .
The usual welcome bonus that most online casinos offer is operational only once you have funded your account .
The welcome bonus is usually a match bonus , i.e. the casino matches a percentile of the amount you are putting up .
Some casinos spread this bonus across multiple deposits , for instance , across the first three deposits .
In such cases the percentile of the match bonus may vary for each deposit .
The Cashback and Referral Bonuses
Two other bonuses that many online casinos commonly offer are the cashback bonus and the referral bonus .
The cashback bonus comes into play usually for existing players , and is a good way of recovering some of the money you may have lost at the casino .
An online casino usually offers a percentile of the amount , with a ceiling amount in place , through this bonus .
The referral bonus is also a great bonus because it is paid out each time you refer a friend to the casino .
The friend must have signed up with a real money account at the casino for you to be eligible for this bonus .
The referral bonus is usually a fixed number that is credited to your account once your friend has opened his account with the casino .
Alternate Payment Method Bonuses
A large number of online casinos encourage players to use the alternate payment methods available for making deposits or taking out winnings .
One direct way of encouraging this is by offering a bonus .
A number of online casinos offer an alternate payment method bonus for choosing certain specific payment methods to deposit funds into her account .
Alternate payment method bonuses are not necessarily available at all online casinos .
The ones that have them usually have a good spread of payment methods .
So this means the player does not have to worry about making the right choice when it comes to picking a payment method to deposit funds into his online casino account .
__UPDATE 05/12 : NASA 's lead investigator on the study discussed herein sent a picture of the bed rest lab to Wired Science .
__
* UPDATE 05/09 : According to a Q&A we did with the study 's head scientist , you can , in fact , play * World of Warcraft or any other computer game while taking part in the study .
Check out the full question - and - answer session for answers to all your questions , i.e. conjugal visits , food , and TV .
Need a break from the working , walking , and standing required by the demanding and stressful life you lead ?
Well , pack your bags for Houston because NASA wants to pay you $ 17,000 to stay in bed for 90 straight days .
The bed - rest experiment , to take place in the Human Test Subject Facility of Johnson Space Center , is designed to allow scientists to study some of the effects of microgravity on the human body .
We read on the Bed Rest Study website :
Participants will spend 90 days lying in bed ,
( except for limited times for specific tests ) with their body slightly tilted downward ( head down , feet up ) .
Every day , they will be awake for 16 hours and lights out ( asleep ) for 8 hours .
It 's unclear , however , whether you 'll be allowed to read with a flashlight under the covers .
Jokes aside , astronauts who 've spent lengthy stays in space have suffered serious repercussions .
Our bodies have evolved mechanisms to deal with a certain amount of gravitational force–namely , the amount present on Earth ; reduce * g * and blood pools in the feet , muscles atrophy and bones lose their density .
It can take astronauts ( or cosmonauts ) months to readjust to the Earth 's gravitational force .
If you 're still interested , feel free to apply .
You 'll have to pass the Air Force medical examination standards and take a blood test , which we assume means that you wo n't have any help from recreational drugs to alleviate the boredom of lying prone for 2,160 hours .
Here at Wired Science , we can't decide if this is the sweetest way to make five grand a month or the worst punishment you could inflict on a person .
The deciding factor seems to be the inclusion of a World of Warcraft subscription .

Earlier today a friend of mine , Marc Grabanski , pinged me with a question :
What ’s the optimal way , in JavaScript , to convert a query string like “ foo=1&foo=2&foo=3&blah=a&blah=b ” into one that looks like this : “ foo=1,2,3&blah=a , b ” .
He had already come up with a solution of his own and was curious as to if it could be improved upon .
I pondered this for a moment and came up with a solution :
function compress ( data ) {
var q = { } , ret = “ ” ;
data .
replace ( / ( [ ^=& ] + ) = ( [ ^& ] * ) /g , function ( m , key , value ) {
q [ key ] = ( q [ key ] ? q [ key ] + “ , ” : “ ” ) + value ;
} ) ;
for ( var key in q )
ret = ( ret ?
ret + “ & ” : “ ” ) + key + “ = ” + q [ key ] ;
return ret ;
}
Besides being 10 lines shorter than Mark ’s solution it also did n’t require the use of any libraries ( his required the use of jQuery ) .
He was especially surprised at my result – and the replace technique that I used , in particular .
I want to outline two quick tricks that I used that some may not be familiar with .
Array Joining Without an Array
One step to solving the above problem is to collect together the various values associated with a key – joining them with a ‘ , ’.
At first glance the obvious solution might be to construct an array for each key , push each of the values on , and then . join ( ) the array results into a string .
However all of this is both costly ( the overhead of creating all these extra arrays ) and verbose .
The alternative is one that I use twice in the program :
q [ key ] = ( q [ key ] ? q [ key ] + “ , ” : “ ” ) + value ;
The key part is that we ’re concatenating the value onto the q[key ] string adding in an extra “ , ” if there ’s nothing in the string already : q[key ] ? q[key ] + " , " : " " .
If no existing value is in the key we seed it with an empty string , otherwise we ’re simply merging on to the already - existing value along with the needed “ , ” .
The end result is that we ’re only ever dealing with strings and string operations ( instead of arrays ) but achieving the result of joining a set of values without using an array .
Search and Replace Without Replacing
The second , and arguably more interesting , aspect is in using the JavaScript string replace function as a means of traversing a string for values , rather than as an actual search - and - replace mechanism .
The trick is two - fold : Passing in a function as the replace value argument to the .replace ( ) method and , instead of returning a value , simply utilizing it as a means of searching .
Let ’s examine this piece of code :
data .
replace ( / ( [ ^=& ] + ) = ( [ ^& ] * ) /g , function ( m , key , value ) { } ) ;
The regular expression , itself , captures two things :
A key in the query string and its associated value .
This match is performed globally , locating all the key - value pairs within the query string .
The second argument to the replace method is a function .
It ’s not uncommon to utilize this function - as - an - argument technique when attempting to replace matches with complex values ( that is values that are dependent upon their associated matches ) .
The function is called every time a new match occurs and it receives a variable number of arguments .
The first argument is always the entire matched portion of the string and all remaining arguments are each of the ( ... ) capturing blocks , in order .
The return value of the function is injected back into the string as its replacement .
In this example we do n’t return a value from the function therefore we end up injecting the serialized “ undefined ” value , repeatedly , back into the string .
We can see this behavior here :
“ a b c ” . replace ( /a/ , function ( ) { } ) ;
// => " undefined b c "
Now that we ’ve collected all of our key values pairs ( to be re-serialized back into a query string ) the final step is n’t really a step at all :
We simply do n’t save the search - and - replaced data query string ( which , most likely , looks something like " undefined&undefined&undefined " ) .
In this manner we can use a string ’s replace method as our very - own string searching mechanism .
The result is , not only , fast but also simple and effective .
Another excellent tool in your JavaScript toolbox .
This topic will be discussed , in depth , in my work - in - progress book : Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja .

Two decades of scrutinizing Saturn are finally paying off , as scientists have discovered a wave pattern , or oscillation , in Saturn 's atmosphere only visible from Earth every 15 years .
The discovery of the wave pattern is the result of a 22 - year campaign observing Saturn from Earth ( the longest study of temperature outside Earth ever recorded ) , and the Cassini spacecraft 's observations of temperature changes in the giant planet 's atmosphere over time .
The Cassini infrared results , which appear in the same issue of Nature as the data from the 22 - year ground - based observing campaign , indicate that Saturn 's wave pattern is similar to a wave pattern found in Earth 's upper atmosphere .
The earthly oscillation takes about two years .
A similar pattern on Jupiter takes more than four Earth years .
The new Saturn findings add a common link to the three planets .
Just as scientists have been studying climate changes in Earth 's atmosphere for long periods of time , NASA scientists have been studying changes in Saturn 's atmosphere .
Glenn Orton of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , says patience is the key to studying changes over the course of a Saturnian year , the equivalent of about 30 Earth years .
" You could only make this discovery by observing Saturn over a long period of time , " said Orton , lead author of the ground - based study .
" It 's like putting together 22 years worth of puzzle pieces , collected by a hugely rewarding collaboration of students and scientists from around the world on various telescopes . "
The wave pattern is called an atmospheric oscillation .
It ripples back and forth like a wave within Saturn 's upper atmosphere .
In this region , temperatures switch from one altitude to the next in a candy cane - like , striped , hot - cold pattern .
These varying temperatures force the wind in the region to keep changing direction from east to west , jumping back and forth .
As a result , the entire region oscillates like a wave .
A " snapshot " of the hot - cold temperature patterns in Saturn 's atmosphere was captured by the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer ( CIRS ) .
Along with Earth - based data , the " snapshot " also uncovered other interesting phenomena .
Among them : the temperature at Saturn 's equator switches from hot to cold , and temperatures on either side of the equator switch from cold to hot every Saturn half - year .
Mike Flasar , co-author on the Cassini paper , and Principal Investigator for Cassini's CIRS at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , said that Cassini helped define this oscillation in combination with the ground observation campaign .
" It 's this great synergy of using ground - based data over time , and then getting up close and personal with the oscillation in Saturn 's atmosphere through Cassini , " said Flasar .
" Without Cassini , we might never have seen the structure of the oscillation in detail . "
" CIRS has mapped the vertical structure of Jupiter ( from the swingby in 2000 ) and now Saturn .
In both cases CIRS saw evidence of an equatorial oscillation from the vertical structure in temperature : an alternating stacking of warm and cold anomalies with height .
Being in orbit about Saturn , CIRS was much closer to its atmosphere and could directly point at Saturn ’s limb .
This provided both better vertical resolution and a much broader range of altitudes observed than on Jupiter , " added Flasar .
" The other partners in this are the ground - based telescopic observations in the infrared , which generally have lower spatial resolution , and so they do n’t provide very good information on vertical structure .
However , they have continued to observe Saturn ( and Jupiter ) for more than two decades , and they show the temporal behavior of the equatorial oscillation , with temperatures at the equator oscillating between warm and cold , relative to adjacent latitudes .
On Jupiter , the cycle is about four to five years , and it seems to be about 15 years for Saturn , " said Flasar .
Cassini scientists hope to find out why this phenomenon on Saturn changes with the seasons , and why the temperature switchover happens when the sun is directly over Saturn 's equator .

The Pleasures of the Flesh
If you care about hunger , eat less meat .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 15th April 2008
Never mind the economic crisis .
Focus for a moment on a more urgent threat : the great food recession which is sweeping the world faster than the credit crunch .
You have probably seen the figures by now : the price of rice has risen by three - quarters in the past year , that of wheat by 130 % ( 1 ) .
There are food crises in 37 countries .
One hundred million people , according to the World Bank , could be pushed into deeper poverty by the high prices ( 2 ) .
But I bet you have missed the most telling statistic .
At 2.1bn tonnes , last year ’s global grain harvest broke all records ( 3 ) .
It beat the previous year ’s by almost 5 % .
The crisis , in other words , has begun before world food supplies are hit by climate change .
If hunger can strike now , what will happen if harvests decline ?
There is plenty of food .
It is just not reaching human stomachs .
Of the 2.13 bn tonnes likely to be consumed this year , only 1.01bn , according to the UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , will feed people ( 4 ) .
I am sorely tempted to write another column about biofuels .
From this morning all sellers of transport fuel in the United Kingdom will be obliged to mix it with ethanol or biodiesel made from crops .
The World Bank points out that “ the grain required to fill the tank of a sports utility vehicle with ethanol … could feed one person for a year ” ( 5 ) .
Last year global stockpiles of cereals declined by around 53 m tonnes ( 6 ) ; this gives you a rough idea of the size of the hunger gap .
The production of biofuels this year will consume almost 100 m tonnes ( 7 ) , which suggests that they are directly responsible for the current crisis .
In the Guardian yesterday the transport secretary Ruth Kelly promised that “ if we need to adjust policy in the light of new evidence , we will . ” (8 ) What new evidence does she require ?
In the midst of a global humanitarian crisis , we have just become legally obliged to use food as fuel .
It is a crime against humanity in which every driver in this country has been forced to participate .
But I have been saying this for four years and I am boring myself .
Of course we must demand that our governments scrap the rules which turn grain into the fastest food of all .
But there is a bigger reason for global hunger , which is attracting less attention only because it has been there for longer .
While 100 m tonnes of food will be diverted this year to feed cars , 760 m tonnes will be snatched from the mouths of humans to feed animals ( 9 ) .
This could cover the global food deficit 14 times .
If you care about hunger , eat less meat .
While meat consumption is booming in Asia and Latin America , in the United Kingdom it has scarcely changed since the government started gathering data in 1974 .
At just over 1 kg per person per week ( 10 ) , it ’s still about 40 % above the global average ( 11 ) , though less than half the amount consumed in the United States ( 12 ) .
We eat less beef and more chicken than we did 30 years ago , which means a smaller total impact .
Beef cattle eat about 8 kg of grain or meal for every kilogramme of flesh they produce ; a kilogramme of chicken needs just 2 kg of feed .
Even so , our consumption rate is plainly unsustainable .
In his magazine The Land , Simon Fairlie has updated the figures produced 30 years ago in Kenneth Mellanby ’s book Can Britain Feed Itself ?
Fairlie found that a vegan diet grown by means of conventional agriculture would require only 3 m hectares of arable land ( around half the current total ) ( 13 ) .
Even if we reduced our consumption of meat by half , a mixed farming system would need 4.4 m hectares of arable fields and 6.4 million hectares of pasture .
A vegan Britain could make a massive contribution to global food stocks .
But I cannot advocate a diet I am incapable of following .
I tried it for about 18 months , lost two stone , went as white as bone and felt that I was losing my mind .
I know a few healthy - looking vegans and I admire them immensely .
But after almost every talk I give , I am pestered by swarms of vegans demanding that I adopt their lifestyle .
I cannot help noticing that in most cases their skin has turned a fascinating pearl grey .
What level of meat - eating would be sustainable ?
One approach is to work out how great a cut would be needed to accommodate the growth in human numbers .
The UN expects the population to rise to 9bn by 2050 .
These extra people will require another 325 m tonnes of grain ( 14 ) .
Let us assume , perhaps generously , that politicians like Ms Kelly are able to “ adjust policy in the light of new evidence ” and stop turning food into fuel .
Let us pretend that improvements in plant breeding can keep pace with the deficits caused by climate change .
We would need to find an extra 225 m tonnes of grain .
This leaves 531 m tonnes for livestock production , which suggests a sustainable consumption level for meat and milk some 30 % below the current world rate .
This means 420g of meat per person per week , or about 40 % of the UK ’s average consumption .
This estimate is complicated by several factors .
If we eat less meat we must eat more plant protein , which means taking more land away from animals .
On the other hand , some livestock is raised on pasture , so it does n’t contribute to the grain deficit .
Simon Fairlie estimates that if animals were kept only on land that ’s unsuitable for arable farming , and given scraps and waste from food processing , the world could produce between a third and two thirds of its current milk and meat supply ( 15 ) .
But this system then runs into a different problem .
The FAO calculates that animal keeping is responsible for 18 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
The environmental impacts are especially grave in places where livestock graze freely ( 16 ) .
The only reasonable answer to the question of how much meat we should eat is as little as possible .
Let ’s reserve it – as most societies have done until recently – for special occasions .
For both environmental and humanitarian reasons , beef is out .
Pigs and chickens feed more efficiently , but unless they are free range you encounter another ethical issue : the monstrous conditions in which they are kept .
I would like to encourage people to start eating tilapia instead of meat .
It ’s a freshwater fish which can be raised entirely on vegetable matter and has the best conversion efficiency – about 1.6 kg of feed for 1 kg of meat – of any farmed animal ( 17 ) .
Until meat can be grown in flasks , this is about as close as we are likely to come to sustainable flesh - eating .
Re-reading this article , I see that there is something surreal about it .
While half the world wonders whether it will eat at all , I am pondering which of our endless choices we should take .
Here the price of food barely registers .
Our shops are better stocked than ever before .
We perceive the global food crisis dimly , if at all .
It is hard to understand how two such different food economies could occupy the same planet , until you realise that they feed off each other .

[ UPDATE :
Here are some more observations from Ruby - coloured glasses . ]
Alex Papadimoulis over at The Daily WTF ( one of my favorite IT blogs ) has posted a lengthy and thoughtful solution to the problems I raised in my post on the “ Dead Sea effect “ .
Specifically , he refers to the “ Up or Out ” model , pioneered over a century ago by Paul Cravath and well - known to anyone who has worked in a law firm or one of the Big Eight Six Five Four ( how many are left now ? )
Consulting Firms .
In fact , I ’m quite familiar with it , because I spent two years as a Director ( one level below Partner ) at PricewaterhouseCoopers , which definitely used the “ Up or Out ” model .
In addition , I ’ve been serving off and on as a expert witness in IT - related litigation for nearly a decade and so have spent many long hours in law firms and with lawyers ( ranging from associates to partners ) , and as Alex notes , law firms tend to use this same model as well .
So , how well does this model work in developing and maintaining top talent ?
Well , that depends upon what you define as “ talent ” .
I have n’t read Cravath ’s book , so I do n’t know what he originally proposed .
But in modern law firms and large consulting firms , “ talent ” is mostly defined as “ bringing in clients with lots of money ” and “ keeping the staff under you fully occupied with billable hours ” ( though , to be fair , it also includes your actual performance over the course of multiple engagements ) .
Let me explain .
Modern “ up or out ” firms typically have four to six basic job titles , sometimes with subdivisions .
( For example , in our division at PwC , we had — as I recall — Partners , Directors , Senior Managers , Managers , Senior Associates , and Associates . )
Ideal engagements follow the “ pyramid model ” — say , a Partner , one or two Directors , two to four Managers , and four to eight Associates .
( You scale up all the numbers for larger engagements , and so on . )
In a firm like this , everyone below Partner is typically on a fixed salary , but has a billable rate for clients that was roughly some multiple of their salary .
So , for example , in such a firm an associate might be paid $ 70,000 / year but might be billed out to clients at $ 140 / hour ( equivalent of $ 280,000 / year , assuming 2000 hours / year in billable time ) .
The two key words are “ leverage ” and “ utilization ” .
You want an engagement with leverage — that is , one in which you could apply the pyramid model , staffing it primarily with Managers and Associates .
You also want an engagement that would allow high utilization — that is , it would keep those Associates ( and hopefully the Managers ) billing 30 + hours / week ( 80 % utilization ) throughout the course of the engagement .
The “ Up or Out ” process itself can be pretty brutal .
Here ’s a simplified example , again typical of such firms .
Once a year , each level would do stack rankings on a fixed curve of all those on the level beneath them .
So , for example , the Managers would have to stack - rank all the Associates — if you had 20 Associates , you would have to rate them # 1 through # 20 , with no ties .
Then you would have to apply a fixed curve — say , 10 % A , 20 % B , 40 % C , 20 % D , and 10 % F .
That would mean that of those 20 Associates , only #s 1 & 2 could be A - rated , #s 3 - 6 would be B-rated , and so on , regardless of how much or little separated them .
Those not making the minimum grade ( whatever that was ) would be invited to leave .
Even those who were above the cut but who did not score high enough for a certain number of years running would be informed that there was no promotion to Manager in their future and that they should start looking elsewhere .
The Directors would repeat the same process for the Managers , and the Partners for the Directors .
( All that said , let me add that the mentoring aspect that Alex mentions was very real and extremely valuable .
I learned most of what I know about being an expert witness from PwC — specifically from Jeff Parmet , the PwC Partner who hired and supervised me , as well as from other PwC Directors and Partners , not to mention the significant in - house training sessions that PwC ran each year .
I enjoyed my two years at PwC and am grateful for them , particularly when I find myself up against an expert witness who has not had such a background . )
Now , if we look at applying “ Up or Out ” to an in - house IT department , two immediate questions arise .
First , what do we define as “ Up ” ?
Most large organizations really do n’t have a career track for IT engineers above “ senior programmer ” , except for maybe a handful of “ architect ” slots and possibly a Chief Technical Officer ( CTO ) position .
The usual “ promotion ” is to move onto a management track , which a lot of IT engineers do n’t really want and are n’t necessarily very good at .
This is , I believe , one of the factors behind the Dead Sea effect — your talented IT engineers see very few choices ahead within the organization that let them keep doing what they do best , so they leave ; the less talented / skilled IT engineers , on the other hand , are content to remain in their current positions and not advance at all .
I have proposed before to organizations that they implement a non-management technical track all the way to the CxO level , because it ’s a lot cheaper to keep your best people on salary than to hire them ( or their equivalents ) back as consultants at 2 x to 6 x their salaries .
Such a track might look like this : Associate Engineer -> Engineer -> Senior Engineer -> Technical Officer -> Senior Technical Officer -> Executive Technical Officer -> Chief Technical Officer ( only one of these ) .
The ranks from Technical Officer and up would have salaries , perks , and benefits equivalent to progressing through management ( VP , Senior VP , Executive VP ) , but without actual management / head count responsibilities .
Architects , mentors , and project overseers would be drawn from these ranks .
I honestly believe that this upper - level technical track would save most organizations anywhere from millions to hundreds of millions of dollars in failed or late IT projects because they would constantly disrupt the ‘ thermocline of truth ‘ before it even formed .
The second question is , how , and on what basis , do we evaluate the IT engineers ?
This is a trickier question than it would appear at first .
That ’s because whatever criteria you select for evaluation will then become the key factors that the IT engineers will “ game ” to .
Suppose , for an example , that you judge IT engineers on the basis of accurate schedule prediction and on - time completion of subprojects .
You will suddenly have a group of hyper - conservative IT engineers who maximize schedule estimates and minimize completion criteria in order to ensure that they have a great ( for them ) track record .
There ’s actually some upside to that — you ’ll dampen the inherent ( and often excessive ) optimism found in many IT engineers — but you have to be willing to live with the consequences as well ( such as very long , drawn - out projects ) .
As for the ‘ how ’ question , I think that a group evaluation from two levels up might work the best ; that is , have all the Senior Engineers evaluate the Associate Engineers , the Technical Officers evaluate the Engineers , and so on .
I think the extra distance will allow for a more objective evaluation ; IT engineers are notorious for being competitive .
I do n’t even mind stack ranking so long as there is no fixed curve .
If you ’re doing your recruiting and hiring correctly , you should n’t have many ( if any ) D- or F - level IT engineers .
So , Alex ’s proposal has definite merit , but has some potential pitfalls as well .
I ’m curious to see what more details he may suggest for it .

Rep. Capps endorses Obama
A California congresswoman with long ties to both Clintons will announce her endorsement of Barack Obama today , a campaign source said .
Rep. Lois Capps , who represents a district on California ’s central coast , is the third member of Congress to announce an endorsement of Senator Obama Wednesday , the day after he responded sharply to one of the deepest crises of his campaign , a confrontational and , he said , “ appalling ” set of remarks by his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
The campaign is using the flurry of endorsements to shore up political support and demonstrate the frontrunner ’s continuing strength .

“ Barack Obama is the better choice because of something larger and perhaps more important .
Simply put , he has made a call to the better angels of our nature .
He is challenging us to lift ourselves out of the ugliness that increasingly consumes Washington , where the heat of your argument counts for more than the light it should bring , ” Capps said in a statement .
“ He is asking us to stand together as Americans and transcend the traditional lines that have so often divided us by party affiliation , economic status , gender , or race . ”
In her statement , Capps praised Clinton , but also suggested she ’d been pushed to Obama by negative aspects of the campaign .
“ I came to Washington 10 years ago after winning the seat my husband Walter held .
In office for a mere 10 months before he died , he had lost none of the idealism and faith in American democracy that propelled his life .
Quite frankly , I do n’t believe he ever would have and I know that I have tried to keep that fire burning .
But I ’ll admit it ’s hard , when so much of what ’s going on around you is less about meeting our country ’s challenges and more about demonizing your political opponents , ” she said in the statement .
“ Walter once said that ‘ we are strongest as people when we are directed by that which unites us , rather than giving into the fears , suspicions , innuendos and paranoias that divide . ’
For years I have been waiting for a President that speaks to that vision .
I believe Barack Obama may very well be that rare leader . ”
Capps has long been close to both Clintons , who supported and raised money for her late husband , Rep. Walter Capps , and then for her in a campaign for what was then a contested seat .
Bill Clinton also spoke at the memorial service for her late husband , Rep. Walter Capps , whom the then - president described as “ entirely too nice to be in Congress . "
Capps ’ daughter , Laura Burton Capps , also worked in the Clinton White House starting in 1995 , first as an assistant to Clinton advisor George Stephanopolous and then as a speechwriter .
Capps also has an Obama tie , however : Burton Capps , now Senior Vice President for communications and outreach at the Ocean Conservancy is married to Bill Burton , Obama ’s national press secretary .
Research undertaken at Oxford University suggests that an increasing number of people are spying on their partners online .
One in five couples admitted to reading a partner 's emails or text messages , and 13 per cent examined their partner 's internet browsing history .
More than 2,400 individuals were questioned in the research .
Six per cent of the couples had met online , of which over a third had met at an internet dating site and 19 per cent in a chat room .
Online daters choose more diverse partners , according to the research , as 36 per cent of the ' online ' couples had different levels of education compared with 21 per cent of ' offline ' couples .
Bill Dutton , director of the Oxford Internet Institute , said : " This study is a dramatic illustration of the potential for the internet to reconfigure social relationships . "
The survey also found strong evidence to suggest that couples believe ' online ' relationships to be just as important as ' offline ' ones .
Around 85 per cent of respondents disapproved of a partner ' flirting ' online with someone else .
This rises to 89 per cent for ' communicating relationship troubles to others ' , 94 per cent for ' having cyber - sex ' and 97 per cent for ' falling in love ' , raising interesting questions about the three per cent who are fine with this .
One of the biggest areas of disagreement is on the viewing of pornography online .
Some 46 per cent of couples disagreed on its acceptability , but men are apparently much more tolerant than women of this activity .

It has been a rough few weeks for “ The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer ” on PBS .
In late April , Mr. Lehrer , who turns 74 on Monday , had aortic valve replacement surgery .
He said he was recovering nicely and expects to be back on the air toward the end of June .
But the nightly newscast ’s funding situation could take longer to heal .
In its 25 years on the air , “ NewsHour ” has had fallow budget periods , but none that equal the current one , Mr. Lehrer acknowledged .
The financial squeeze was precipitated last summer when Archer Daniels Midland ended its 14 - year sponsorship of the program .
That sponsorship provided nearly $ 4 million ( and some years as much as $ 7 million ) of the program ’s yearly budget , which varies from $ 26 million to $ 28 million .
On May 1 , salaries were frozen at the newscast , and company contributions to 401 ( k ) retirement funds were suspended , cutbacks suggested by the staff .
“ NewsHour ” still has two corporate sponsors  Chevron and the Pacific Life Insurance Company  and it receives support from PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting .
But only part of the Archer money has been replaced , leaving the budget several million dollars short .
“ NewsHour , ” along with other PBS mainstays , may have a longer - term problem .
Not only are corporations cutting back on all forms of advertising during the current economic slowdown , but public television ’s model  soliciting long - term commitments  is also increasingly out of step with the changing needs of corporations , which no longer sponsor public television programs for purely philanthropic reasons .
WASHINGTON  The Energy Department is subsidizing two Russian nuclear institutes that are building important parts of a reactor in Iran whose construction the United States spent years trying to stop , according to a House committee .
The institutes , both in Nizhny Novgorod , gave American officials copies of sales presentations that listed the Bushehr reactor , which Russia has agreed to fuel , as one of their projects .
One institute is providing control systems , including control room equipment , and the other , hundreds of pumps and ventilation fans .
The Energy Department is subsidizing the institutes under the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention , a program set up in 1994 , after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
The program was intended to prevent newly impoverished scientists and their institutions from selling expertise to states or terrorist groups that want nuclear weapons .
The United States supplements the salaries of scientists and pays overhead at those institutes , according to the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee .
In this article , we describe the construction of the Ultimate Linux Lunchbox , a 16 - node cluster that runs from a single IBM ThinkPad power supply but can , as well , run from an N - charge or similar battery .
The lunchbox has an Ethernet switch built - in and has only three external connections : one AC plug , one battery connector and one Ethernet cable .
To use the lunchbox with your laptop , you merely need to plug the Ethernet cable in to the laptop , supply appropriate power — even the power available in an airplane seat will do — and away you go , running your cluster at 39,000 feet .
We 've designed the lunchbox so that we can develop software on it , as a private in - office cluster or a travel cluster .
The lunchbox is an example of a newer class of clusters called miniclusters .
Miniclusters Miniclusters were first created by Mitch Williams of Sandia / Livermore Laboratory in 2000 .
Figure 1 shows a picture of his earliest cluster , Minicluster I . This cluster consisted of four Advanced Digital Logic boards , using 277MHz Pentium processors .
These boards had connectors for the PC / 104 + bus , which is a PC / 104 bus with an extra connector for PCI .
As you can see , there are only four nodes in this cluster .
The base of the cluster is the power supply , and the cluster requires 120 Volts AC to run .
We also show a single CPU card on the right .
The green pieces at each corner form the stack shown in the pictures .
A system very much like this one is now sold as a product by Parvus Corporation .
Figure 1 . Minicluster I used four Pentium - based single - board computers ( courtesy Sandia National Labs ) .
Figure 2 . One Node of Minicluster I ( courtesy Sandia National Labs )
The Bento Series
We were intrigued by this cluster and thought it would be an ideal platform for Clustermatic .
In the summer of 2001 , we ported LinuxBIOS to this card and got all the rest of the Clustermatic software running on it .
When we were done , we had a card that booted to Linux in a few seconds , and that booted into full cluster mode in less than 20 seconds .
Power and reset cycles ceased to be a concern .
We provided the LinuxBIOS and other software to Mitch , and he modified Minicluster I to use it .
Mitch was able to remove three disks , reducing power and improving reliability .
One node served as the cluster master node , and three other nodes served as slave nodes .
Inspired by Mitch 's work , we built our first Bento cluster in 2002 .
In fact , the lunchbox used for that system is the one we use for the Ultimate Linux Lunchbox .
This system had seven CPU cards .
It needed two power supplies , made by Parvus , which generate the 5V needed for the CPU cards and can take 9 –45 VDC input .
It had a built - in Ethernet hub , which we created by disassembling a 3Com TP1200 hub and putting the main card into the lid .
This cluster used three IBM ThinkPad power supplies .
Two of the supplies are visible in the lid , on either side of the Ethernet hub .
The third is visible at the back of the case .
One supply drives the hub , the other two drive each of the two supplies .
The supplies and fan board for each supply can be seen at the far right and left of the box ; the seven CPU boards are in the middle .
Figure 3 . The First Lunchbox Cluster , Bento Bento was great .
We could develop on the road , in long and boring meetings and test on a seven - node cluster .
Because the reboot time was only 15 seconds or so for a node at most , testing out modules was painless .
In fact , on this system , compiling and testing new kernel modules was about as easy as compiling and testing new programs .
Diskless systems , which reboot really quickly , forever change your ideas about the difficulty and pain of kernel debugging .
During one particularly trying meeting in California , we were able to revamp and rewrite the Supermon monitoring system completely , and use it to measure the impact of some test programs ( Sweep3d and Sage ) on the temperature of the CPUs as it ran .
Interestingly enough , compute - intensive Fortran programs can ramp up the CPU temperature several degrees centigrade in a few seconds .
The beauty of these systems is that if anyone suspects you are getting real work done , instead of paying attention to the meeting , you always can hide the lunchbox under your chair and keep hacking .
Bento used a hub , not a switch , and Erik Hendriks wanted to improve the design .
The next system was called DQ .
DQ was built in to an attractive metal CD case , suitable for carrying to any occasion , and especially suitable for long and boring meetings .
As our Web page says , we 'll let you figure out the meaning of the name .
Hint : check out the beautiful pink boa carrying strap in the picture .
DQ Cluster Figure 4 .
The DQ cluster featured an Ethernet switch and a colorful carrying strap .
We were able to get an awful lot of development work done on DQ at a meeting in Vegas .
The switch improved the throughput of the system , and the package was bombproof ( although we avoided using that particular phrase in airport security lines ) .
The hardware was basically the same , although one thing we lost was the integrated ThinkPad power supplies — there was no lid on DQ in which to hide them .
Nevertheless , this was quite a nice machine .
Sandia was not asleep at the time .
Mitch built Minicluster II , which used much more powerful PIII processors .
The packaging was very similar to Minicluster I .
Once again , we ported LinuxBIOS to this newer node , and the cluster was built to have one master with one disk and three slaves .
The slave nodes booted in 12 seconds on this system .
In a marathon effort , we got this system going at SC 2002 about the same time the lights started going out .
Nevertheless , it worked .
One trend we noticed with the PIII nodes was increased power consumption .
The nodes were faster , and the technology was newer , and the power needed was still higher .
The improved fabrication technology of the newer chips did not provide a corresponding reduction in power demand — quite the contrary .
It was no longer possible to build DQ with the PIII nodes — they were just too power - hungry .
We went down a different path for a while , using the Advantech PCM - 5823 boards as shown in Figure 5 .
There are four CPU boards , and the top board is a 100 M bit switch from Parvus .
This switch is handy — it has five ports , so you can connect it directly to your laptop .
We needed a full - size PC power supply to run this cluster , but in many ways it was very nice .
We preserved instant boot with LinuxBIOS and bproc , as in the earlier systems .
Figure 5 . The Geode minicluster needed a full - size power supply to deal with the demands of Pentium III - based nodes .
As of 2004 , again working with Mitch Williams of Sandia , we decided to try one more Pentium iteration of the minicluster and set our hungry eyes on the new ADL855 PC from Advanced Digital Logic .
This time around , things did not work out as well .
First , the LinuxBIOS effort was made more or less impossible by Intel 's decision to limit access to the information needed for a LinuxBIOS port to Intel chipsets .
We had LinuxBIOS coming up to a point , and printing out messages , but we never could get the memory controller programmed correctly .
If you read our earlier articles on LinuxBIOS ( see the on- line Resources ) , you can guess that the romcc code was working fine , because it needs no memory , but the gcc code never worked .
Vague hints in the available documents indicated that we needed more information , but we were unable to get it .
Second , the power demand of a Pentium M is astounding .
We had expected these to be low - power CPUs , and they can be low power in the right circumstances , but not when they are in heavy use .
When we first hooked up the ADL855 PC with the supplied connector , which attaches to the hard drive power supply , it would not come up at all .
It turned out we had to fabricate a connector and connect it directly to the motherboard power supply lines , not the disk power supply lines , and we had to keep the wires very short .
The current inrush for this board is large enough that a longer power supply wire , coupled with the high inrush current , makes it impossible for the board to come up .
We would not have believed it had we not seen it .
Instead of the 2A or so we were expecting from the Pentium M , the current needed was more on the order of 20A peak .
A four - CPU minicluster would require 80A peak at 5 VDC .
The power supply for such a system would dwarf the CPUs ; the weight would be out of the question .
We had passed a strange boundary and moved into a world where the power supply dominated the size and weight of the minicluster .
The CPUs are small and light ; the power supply is the mass of a bicycle .
The Pentium M was acceptable for a minicluster powered by AC , as long as we had large enough tires .
It was not acceptable for our next minicluster .
We at LANL had a real desire to build 16 nodes into the lunchbox and run it all on one ThinkPad power supply .
PC /104 would allow it , in terms of space .
The issues were heat and power .
What is the power available from a ThinkPad power supply ?
For the supplies we have available from recent ThinkPads , we can get about 4.5A at 16 VDC , or 72 Watts .
The switches we use will need 18 Watts , so the nodes are left with about 54 Watts between them .
This is only 3W per node , leaving a little headroom for power supply inefficiencies .
If the node is a 5V node , common on PC / 104 , then we would like .5A per node or less .
This power budget pretty much rules out most Pentium - compatible processors .
Even the low - power SC520 CPUs need 1.5A at 5 V , or 7.5 Watts — double our budget .
We had to look further afield for our boards .
We settled on the Technologic TS7200 boards for this project .
The choice of a non-Pentium architecture had many implications for our software stack , as we shall see .
The TS7200 The TS7200 , offered by Technologic Systems , is a StrongARM - based single - board computer .
It is , to use a colloquialism , built like a brick outhouse .
All the components are soldered on .
There are no heatsinks — you can run this board in a closed box with no ventilation .
It has a serial port and Ethernet port built on , requiring no external dongles or modules for these connections .
It runs on 5 VDC , and requires only .375A , or roughly 2W to operate .
In short , this board meets all our requirements .
Figure 6 is a picture of the board .
Also shown in Figure 6 is a Compact Flash plugged in to the board , although we do not use one on our lunchbox nodes .
Figure 6 . The TS7200 , from Technologic Systems , is StrongARM - based , needs no heatsinks and draws only about two Watts ( courtesy Technologic Systems ) .
One item we had to delay for now is putting LinuxBIOS on this board .
The soldered - on Flash part makes development of LinuxBIOS difficult , and we were more concerned with getting the cluster working first .
The board does have a custom BIOS with the eCos operating system , which , although not exactly fast , is not nearly as slow as a standard PC BIOS .
Building the Lunchbox
There are several factors that determine the shape of a minicluster : the box , the size and shape of the board and the board spacing , or distance between boards .
The spacing tends to dominate all other factors and is complicated by the fact that PC / 104 was not designed with multiprocessors in mind .
All I/O boards in PC / 104 stack just fine , as long as there is only one CPU board ; we are breaking the rules when we stack CPU boards , and it gets us into trouble every time .
On all the miniclusters shown , there was at least one empty board space between the boards .
Nevertheless , the process of designing starts with the box , then the board shape and then the board spacing .
First , the box : it 's the same box we used earlier .
Also , we 're going to use the same Parvus SnapStiks that we have been using for years to stack boards .
We bought the professional set , part number PRV - 0912 - 71 .
The SnapStik works well in the lunchbox format .
One warning : just buy 1/4 " threaded rod to tie the stack together .
Do not use the supplied threaded plastic rod that comes with SnapStik kits .
That plastic rod tends to , well , “ snap ” under load , and watching bits of your minicluster drop off is less than inspiring .
Second , the size and shape of the TS7200 nodes : there 's a slight problem here .
The boards are not quite PC / 104 : they 're a little large .
One way to tell is that two of the holes in the TS7200 are not at the corners .
In Figure 7 , the holes are in the right place , but the board extends out past them , leaving the holes too far in from the edge .
The board is a bit bigger to accommodate the connectors shown on the right .
These connectors caused two problems , which we will show below .
Third , the stack : the tight spacing was going to make the stack more challenging than previous miniclusters .
We would have to find a way to make the SnapStiks work with a nonstandard board form factor and the close spacing .
To solve the SnapStik problem , we spent some time seeing how the supports could fit the board .
The best we could find was a configuration in which three SnapStiks fit on three of the holes in the board , as shown in Figure 7 .
Notice the threaded metal rod , available in any hardware store .
Figure 7 . Stack Showing
Three out of Four SnapStiks Connected
For the fourth hole , we set up a spacer as shown in Figure 8 .
Figure 8 . The Spacer in the Fourth Hole
The spacer is a simple nylon spacer from our local hardware store .
The bolts and nuts allow us to create an exact spacing between the boards .
We needed the exact spacing for the next problem we ran into .
The boards cannot be stacked at exactly a one - per - slot spacing .
There is an Ethernet connector that needs just a bit more room than that — if the boards are stacked too closely , the Ethernet connector on the lower board shorts out the Ethernet connector pins on the higher board .
The spacing could be adjusted easily with the nut - and - bolt assembly shown above , but how could we space the SnapStiks ?
If you look at the Geode cluster shown in Figure 8 , you can see some white nylon spacers between the green SnapStiks .
That is one way to do it .
But that spacing would have been too large to allow 16 nodes to fit into the lunchbox .
We needed only about 1/32 of an inch in extra spacing .
Josiah England , who built this version of the lunchbox , had a good idea : small wire rings , which he says he learned how to build while making chainmail .
The fabrication is shown in Figures 9 –11 .
The wire rings add just enough space to create enough clearance between the boards , while still allowing us to put 16 boards in the lunchbox .
Figures 9 –11 .
Medieval solution to a 21st - century hardware problem : wire spacing rings constructed chainmail - style ( courtesy Josiah England ) .
With this fix , we now had a stack that was spaced correctly .
The stack shown above was finished off with a Parvus OnPower - 90 power supply and a Parvus fan board , which you can see at the top .
This supply can provide 18A at 5V , more than enough for our needs , as well as the 12V needed for the switch .
Our next step was the Ethernet switch .
At first , we tried using several cheap eight - port switches in the lid , as shown in Figure 12 .
By the way , these miniclusters always include a bit of improvisation .
The switches shown are bolted to a shelf from our departmental mailbox .
The shelf is a nice , gray plastic and was ideal ( once we trimmed it with a hacksaw ) for our purposes .
Notice the nice finger hole , which can be used for routing wires under the lid .
We 'd like to think we used the Erik Hendriks mailbox shelf , since Erik 's bproc work was so important to our minicluster development .
Erik is now at Google .
Figure 12 .
First try at switches : the gray panel is a mailbox shelf .
The cascaded switches worked very poorly .
The nodes would not come up on the network reliably .
It all looked great , with 48 LEDs , but it did not work at all .
DHCP requests were dropped , and the nodes took forever to come up .
The second attempt was to get a Netgear 16 - port switch , remove the switch from the case and put it into the lid .
This required that we sacrifice another mailbox shelf , but we have plenty .
This change worked fine .
The nodes come up very quickly now , as packets are not getting lost .
You can see the final configuration in Figure 13 .
Notice the two switches : one switch controls power to the Ethernet switch and nodes , and the other controls power to the fan .
We 're not yet sure we need the fan but we 're being careful .
Figure 13 .
Final design : one of the switches on the gray metal panel , to the left of the Ethernet plugs , controls power to the nodes and the Ethernet switch , and the other one controls the fan .
Regarding Ethernet cables : always label them , and always make it so you can figure out , easily , which one goes into which network switch connector .
Put them into the switch in some order , left to right or right to left .
Just make sure you can tell , at a glance , which LED on the switch goes with which board .
You 'll be glad you did .
Lunchbox Software Okay , we 've built the hardware .
Now , what is the software ?
In years past , it would have been bproc , as found on the Clustermatic site ( see Resources ) .
bproc has a problem , however ; it cannot support heterogeneous systems .
The very nature of bproc , which requires that process migration works , makes the use of different architectures , in a single system , impossible .
We 're going to have to use something else .
We want to continue using our ThinkPad laptop as the front end ; there are no StrongARM laptops that we know of .
It 's clear that we are going to need new software for our minicluster .
Fortunately , the timing for this move is good .
As of 2.6.13 , there is now support for the Plan 9 protocol in the standard Linux kernel .
This module , called 9 p ( formerly v9fs ) , supports the Plan 9 resource - sharing protocol , 9p2000 .
At the same time this code was being ported to the Linux kernel , Vic Zandy of Bell Labs was working with us on xcpu , a Plan 9 version of bproc .
One of the key design goals of xcpu was to support heterogeneous systems .
The combination , of 9 p in the Linux kernel and xcpu servers ported to Linux , has allowed us to build a replacement system for bproc that supports architecture and operating system heterogeneity .
Finally , the introduction of new features in 2.6.13 will allow us to remove some of our custom Clustermatic components and improve others .
A key new feature is Eric Biederman 's kexec system call , which replaces our kmonte system call .
Figure 14 shows a quick outline of the standard bproc boot sequence , as it works on our miniclusters and clusters with thousands of nodes .
Figure 14 .
A View of SA Components
The boot sequence , as shown , consists of LinuxBIOS , Linux , Linux network setup , Linux loading another kernel over the network and Linux using the kmonte system call ( part of Clustermatic ) to boot that second kernel as the working kernel .
Why are there two kernels ?
In Clustermatic systems , we distinguish the OS we use to boot the system from the OS we run during normal operation .
This differentiation allows us to move the working kernel forward , while maintaining the boot kernel in Flash .
The new boot sequence is shown in Figure 15 .
If it looks simpler , well , it is .
We no longer have a “ boot kernel ” and a “ working kernel ” .
The first kernel we boot will , in most cases , be sufficient .
Experience shows that we change kernels on our clusters only every 3 – 6 months or so .
There is no need to boot a new kernel each time .
Because the 9p protocol and the xcpu service do n't change , and the Master node kernel versions are not tightly tied together , we can separate the version requirements of the Master node and the worker node .
We could not make this kind of separation with bproc .
Figure 15 .
New Boot Sequence
The result is that we can weld the StrongARM boards and the Pentium front end ( Master ) into one tightly coupled cluster .
In fact , we can easily mix 32 - and 64 - bit systems with xcpu .
We can get the effect of a bproc cluster , with more modern kernel technology .
Figure 16 shows how we are changing Clustermatic components for this new technology .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters )  Israel dismissed a proposal by the Palestinian group Hamas for a six - month truce in the Gaza Strip , saying Friday that the group wanted to prepare for more fighting rather than peace .
The Hamas offer , issued Thursday after talks with Egyptian mediators , proposed a truce during which Israel ’s embargo on the territory would be lifted .
The offer departed from previous demands by the group that any cease - fire apply simultaneously in Gaza and the occupied West Bank , the territories where Palestinians want to establish a state .
Hamas said that Egypt would raise the truce idea with Israel next week .
Israel has been reluctant to enter any formal agreement that could shore up the hard - line Islamists of Hamas against the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , who is their West Bank - based rival .
Mr. Abbas is pursuing peace talks with Israel that are sponsored by the United States .
Pork Stone… Get Your Pork Stone
What you see below might look like a regular Chinese meat market with potential customers looking over a fresh haul of pork , but that would be false .
It is actually attendees of the Suzhou Int’l Expo for Natural and Weird Stones .
Yup , besides the physical appearance , these are just really cool and weird stones , that happen to look like pieces of pork in an everyday market .
The “ pork stone ” is formed when natural stone mixes with other types of minerals to form multi-colored layers , which you can get for your kitchen table at about $ 17/kg .

Americans and American congressmen need to come to handle the truth about war costs and healthcare expenses .
The AP article above noted statistics in recent US military reports that show that during the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , there are “ 15 soldiers wounded for every fatality , compared with 2.6 per death in Vietnam and 2.8 in Korea . ”
This huge shift in war statistics involving the huge percentage of those surviving -- but injured — American veterans in war these days results ( 1 ) from U.S. advances in medical handling of injuries and ( 2 ) from the fact that the weapons of choice in these 2 locations of asymmetric - warfare have often been roadside bombings .
MENTAL HEALTH AND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
Two sets of recent official governmental reports have indicated that already , over 29,000 , U.S. soldiers have been treated for physical injuries -- while more than 31,000 other cases of non-combat related illnesses and injuries have been reported stemming from both battle field theatres .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Democratic presidential nomination rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will debate tonight in Philadelphia before next Tuesday 's crucial Pennsylvania primary .
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update shows Obama with a 50 % to 42 % lead over Clinton in national Democratic voters ' nomination preferences .
This marks the 10th consecutive day that Obama has held a statistically significant lead over Clinton , easily his best stretch of the campaign .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
That included a campaign best 11 percentage point lead in Tuesday 's release .
Obama 's current margin is down slightly , but still in line with the average 9 - point lead in this recent stretch .
Both Democrats hold an advantage over John McCain in registered voters ' presidential election choices .
In an Obama - McCain match up , 46 % of registered voters say they would vote for Obama if the election were held today and 43 % would choose McCain .
The Clinton - McCain trial heat has Clinton at 46 % and McCain at 44 % .
Obama has now held at least a slim advantage over McCain for the last nine days , and Clinton has done so for six days .
The fact that the Democratic candidates ' margins over McCain are their best to date underscores the closeness of the election .
McCain has led the Democratic candidates by as many as four percentage points .

Cardi B has no shame in her game , coming out on Instagram recently after a sex tape with her man Offset hit the web .
In the social media world Cardi is very well known to have no filter stating : “ I do with my ni** ga what I like , and fu** you if you judge me . ” or “ I love sex , what the fu** is wrong with that haters . ” or “ What I do with my man is my business , if you want to see it , just watch me then you can see one of the BIG reasons we together . ”
The video is smoking hot , and offset seems to be packing the goods all men wish they had .
The video starts with her twerking in front of offset and then quickly moves into a doggy - style show , as Offset could not contain himself anymore .
Cardi has been in major beef with Nicki Minaj ( who has her own past sex tape rumors ) now for a while , and after the video surfaced of Cardi and Offset , Nicki simply said , she watched it and of course she ( Cardi ) looks like a stank ass hoe .
All we can say is the video is hot , let ’s have some more of that shi*t !
[ UPDATE ]
Offset claims that the video is him in the video …
We get it , Offset you will now be chased by damn near every piece of ass in town now that they have seen that .
Reminds us of a guy named Ray J who showed Kim Kardashian what BIG really is .
As the book progresses , however , Mr. Paulos ’s writing becomes increasingly technical and increasingly jokey , and his reasoning becomes more and more difficult for the nonmathematician to follow .
His repudiation of the ontological argument for the existence of God , for instance , is based on a reductive , paper - tiger summation of the argument itself :
God is “ the greatest and most perfect possible being ; ” this “ most perfect being must possess all characteristics of perfection ” ; and “ since it ’s better to exist than not to exist , existence is a characteristic of perfection . ”
Hence , “ God exists by definition . ”
Similarly , Mr. Paulos ’s argument that “ doubt that God exists is almost banal in comparison to the more radical doubt ” that people “ exist , at least as anything more than nominal , marginally integrated entities having convenient labels like Myrtle and Oscar ” is hardly persuasive .
After all , how many readers who are n’t college students having stoned , late - night conversations want to debate whether or not they exist themselves ?
As for Mr. Paulos ’s discussion of the contradictions involved in a deity being both omnipotent and benevolent , it consists of little more than regurgitation of the Epicurus aphorism to the effect that if God is willing to prevent evil but unable to , then he is not omnipotent ; that if he is able to but unwilling , then he is malevolent ; and that if he is both able and willing to prevent evil , then there is no explanation for evil ’s continued existence .
Although Mr. Paulos begins “ Irreligion ” by promising that he will not use any hard - to - follow scientific formulas to make his case , he soon leads the reader deep into the mathematical wilderness by talking about things like the “ Boolean satisfiability problem ” and “ combinatorial identities ” and posing annoying paradoxes that do little but remind the reader of the ordeal of taking SATs .
( “ What is the smallest number of guests who need be present so that it will be certain that at least three of them will know each other or at least three of them will be strangers to each other ? ” )
In the course of this volume Mr. Paulos does provide some interesting asides about the so - called “ confirmation bias , a psychological tendency to seek confirmation rather than disconfirmation of any hypothesis we ’ve adopted , however tentatively ” ( which would seem to have applications to the Bush administration ’s use of intelligence in the prelude to the Iraq war ) .
And he also does an entertaining job of applying probability theory to people ’s talk about miracles and amazing coincidences , which they ’ve taken as evidence of the existence of God .
Still , there is something perfunctory and hurried about all of Mr. Paulos ’s arguments , which will be shrugged off by anyone who has made the leap of faith into belief , and which will seem obvious to anyone who is already a proud heathen .
Indeed , the reader finishes this volume with the suspicion that it was a rushed and cursory project , turned out quickly in an effort to catch the coattails of Messrs .
Hitchens , Dawkins and Harris .
Abolish the Fed
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
In the House of Representatives , September 10 , 2002
Mr. Speaker , I rise to introduce legislation to restore financial stability to America ’s economy by abolishing the Federal Reserve .
I also ask unanimous consent to insert the attached article by Lew Rockwell , president of the Ludwig Von Mises Institute , which explains the benefits of abolishing the Fed and restoring the gold standard , into the record .
Since the creation of the Federal Reserve , middle and working - class Americans have been victimized by a boom - and - bust monetary policy .
In addition , most Americans have suffered a steadily eroding purchasing power because of the Federal Reserve ’s inflationary policies .
This represents a real , if hidden , tax imposed on the American people .
From the Great Depression , to the stagflation of the seventies , to the burst of the dotcom bubble last year , every economic downturn suffered by the country over the last 80 years can be traced to Federal Reserve policy .
The Fed has followed a consistent policy of flooding the economy with easy money , leading to a misallocation of resources and an artificial " boom " followed by a recession or depression when the Fed - created bubble bursts .
With a stable currency , American exporters will no longer be held hostage to an erratic monetary policy .
Stabilizing the currency will also give Americans new incentives to save as they will no longer have to fear inflation eroding their savings .
Those members concerned about increasing America ’s exports or the low rate of savings should be enthusiastic supporters of this legislation .
Though the Federal Reserve policy harms the average American , it benefits those in a position to take advantage of the cycles in monetary policy .
The main beneficiaries are those who receive access to artificially inflated money and / or credit before the inflationary effects of the policy impact the entire economy .
Federal Reserve policies also benefit big spending politicians who use the inflated currency created by the Fed to hide the true costs of the welfare - warfare state .
It is time for Congress to put the interests of the American people ahead of the special interests and their own appetite for big government .
Abolishing the Federal Reserve will allow Congress to reassert its constitutional authority over monetary policy .
The United States Constitution grants to Congress the authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency .
The Constitution does not give Congress the authority to delegate control over monetary policy to a central bank .
Furthermore , the Constitution certainly does not empower the federal government to erode the American standard of living via an inflationary monetary policy .
In fact , Congress ’ constitutional mandate regarding monetary policy should only permit currency backed by stable commodities such as silver and gold to be used as legal tender .
Therefore , abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a constitutional system will enable America to return to the type of monetary system envisioned by our nation ’s founders : one where the value of money is consistent because it is tied to a commodity such as gold .
Such a monetary system is the basis of a true free - market economy .
In conclusion , Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to stand up for working Americans by putting an end to the manipulation of the money supply which erodes Americans ’ standard of living , enlarges big government , and enriches well - connected elites , by cosponsoring my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve .
WHY GOLD ?
By Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
As with all matters of investment , everything is clear in hindsight .
Had you bought gold mutual funds earlier this year , they might have appreciated more than 100 percent .
Gold has risen $ 60 since March 2001 to the latest spot price of $ 326 .
Why was n’t it obvious ?
The Fed has been inflating the dollar as never before , driving interest rates down to absurdly low levels , even as the federal government has been pushing a mercantile trade policy , and New York City , the hub of the world economy , continues to be threatened by terrorism .
The government is failing to prevent more successful attacks by not backing down from foreign policy disasters and by not allowing planes to arm themselves .
These are all conditions that make gold particularly attractive .
Or perhaps it is not so obvious why this is true .
It ’s been three decades since the dollar ’s tie to gold was completely severed , to the hosannas of mainstream economists .
There is no stash of gold held by the Fed or the Treasury that backs our currency system .
The government owns gold but not as a monetary asset .
It owns it the same way it owns national parks and fighter planes .
It ’s just another asset the government keeps to itself .
The dollar , and all our money , is nothing more and nothing less than what it looks like : a cut piece of linen paper with fancy printing on it .
You can exchange it for other currency at a fixed rate and for any good or service at a flexible rate .
But there is no established exchange rate between the dollar and gold , either at home or internationally .
The supply of money is not limited by the amount of gold .
Gold is just another good for which the dollar can be exchanged , and in that sense is legally no different from a gallon of milk , a tank of gas , or an hour of babysitting services .
Why , then , do people turn to gold in times like these ?
What is gold used for ?
Yes , there are industrial uses and there are consumer uses in jewelry and the like .
But recessions and inflations do n’t cause people to want to wear more jewelry or stock up on industrial metal .
The investor demand ultimately reflects consumer demand for gold .
But that still leaves us with the question of why the consumer demand exists in the first place .
Why gold and not sugar or wheat or something else ?
There is no getting away from it : investor markets have memories of the days when gold was money .
In fact , in the whole history of civilization , gold has served as the basic money of all people wherever it ’s been available .
Other precious metals have been valued and coined , but gold always emerged on top in the great competition for what constitutes the most valuable commodity of all .
There is nothing intrinsic about gold that makes it money .
It has certain properties that lend itself to monetary use , like portability , divisibility , scarcity , durability , and uniformity .
But these are just descriptors of certain qualities of the metal , not explanations as to why it became money .
Gold became money for only one reason : because that ’s what the markets chose .
Why is n’t gold money now ?
Because governments destroyed the gold standard .
Why ?
Because they regarded it as too inflexible .
To be sure , monetary inflexibility is the friend of free markets .
Without the ability to create money out of nothing , governments tend to run tight financial ships .
Banks are more careful about the lending when they ca n’t rely on a lender of last resort with access to a money - creation machine like the Fed .
A fixed money stock means that overall prices are generally more stable .
The problems of inflation and business cycles disappear entirely .
Under the gold standard , in fact , increased market productivity causes prices to generally decline over time as the purchasing power of money increases .
In 1967 , Alan Greenspan once wrote an article called Gold and Economic Freedom .
He wrote that : " An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions .
They seem to sense — perhaps more clearly and subtly than many consistent defenders of laissez - faire — that gold and economic freedom are inseparable , that the gold standard is an instrument of laissez - faire and that each implies and requires the other .
. . .
This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists ’ tirades against gold .
Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth .
Gold stands in the way of this insidious process .
It stands as a protector of property rights . "
He was right .
Gold and freedom go together .
Gold money is both the result of freedom and its leading protector .
When money is as good as gold , the government cannot manipulate the supply for its own purposes .
Just as the rule of law puts limits on the despotic use of police power , a gold standard puts extreme limits on the government ’s ability to spend , borrow , and otherwise create crazy unworkable programs .
It is forced to raise its revenue through taxation , not inflation , and generally keep its house in order .
Without the gold standard , government is free to work with the Fed to inflate the currency without limit .
Even in our own times , we ’ve seen governments do that and thereby spread mass misery .
Now , all governments are stupid but not all are so stupid as to pull stunts like this .
Most of the time , governments are pleased to inflate their currencies so long as they do n’t have to pay the price in the form of mass bankruptcies , falling exchange rates , and inflation .
In the real world , of course , there is a lag time between cause and effect .
The Fed has been inflating the currency at very high levels for longer than a year .
The consequences of this disastrous policy are showing up only recently in the form of a falling dollar and higher gold prices .
And so what does the Fed do ?
It is pulling back now .
For the first time in nearly ten years , some measures of money ( M2 and MZM ) are showing a falling money stock , which is likely to prompt a second dip in the continuing recession .
Greenspan now finds himself on the horns of a very serious dilemma .
If he continues to pull back on money , the economy could tip into a serious recession .
This is especially a danger given rising protectionism , which mirrors the events of the early 1930s .
On the other hand , a continuation of the loose policy he has pursued for a year endangers the value of the dollar overseas .
How much easier matters were when we did n’t have to rely on the wisdom of exalted monetary central planners like Greenspan .
Under the gold standard , the supply of money regulated itself .
The government kept within limits .
Banks were more cautious .
Savings were high because credit was tight and saving was rewarded .
This approach to economics is the foundation of a sustainable prosperity .
We do n’t have that system now for the country or the world , but individuals are showing their preferences once again .
By driving up the price of gold , prompting gold producers to become profitable again , the people are expressing their lack of confidence in their leaders .
They have decided to protect themselves and not trust the state .
That is the hidden message behind the new luster of gold .
Is a gold standard feasible again ?
Of course .
The dollar could be redefined in terms of gold .
Interest rates would reflect the real supply and demand for credit .
We could shut down the Fed and we would never need to worry again what the chairman of the Fed wanted .
There was a time when Greenspan was nostalgic for such a system .
Investors of the world have come to embrace this view even as Greenspan has completely abandoned it .
What keeps the gold standard from becoming a reality again is the love of big government and war .
If we ever fall in love with freedom again , the gold standard will once more become a hot issue in public debate .

The AC Milan footballer has been recovering after surgery in Brazil
Brazilian football star Ronaldo has been caught up in a sex scandal with three cross-dressing prostitutes .
Having dropped off his girlfriend at her house in Rio de Janeiro on Monday night , the 2002 World Cup winner picked up three prostitutes .
When they all booked into a motel , the AC Milan striker discovered that the prostitutes were in fact men .
According to Rio police , he alleges that the transvestites then tried to extort money from him .
Local press reports quoted one of the prostitutes , Andreia Albertine - otherwise known as Andre Luiz Ribeiro Albertino - as saying that Ronaldo had threatened to hit him , on discovering that he was a transvestite .
' Extortion '
Ronaldo " reported that Andreia had taken his car documents and demanded $ 30,000 [ £ 15,000 ] " , said Rio police superintendent Carlos Augusto Nogueira .
Albertino is accused of taking the footballer 's documents
He added : " Ronaldo admits the facts .
He said he just wanted to amuse himself , that 's not a crime .
To pay to have sexual relations is n't illegal .
" There 's a strong chance that Ronaldo has been the victim of extortion . "
When the footballer refused to pay the prostitute , the latter claimed that Ronaldo had taken drugs , and had threatened to hurt the three transvestites .
Under Brazilian law , while pimping sex workers and running establishments where sex is sold are illegal , prostitution itself is not .
In a statement Ronaldo is reported to have denied ever using drugs , and reiterated that he was a victim of extortion .
The three - time Fifa world footballer of the year is in Brazil recovering from knee surgery .
He told police he was having some psychological problems linked to his injury .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck on Saturday at 7:44 a.m. Pacific time off the U.S. northern Pacific coast of Oregon , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
The quake was centered 112 miles west of Port Orford , Oregon , at a depth of 6.2 miles , the USGS said .
The USGS initially put the quake at 6.0 magnitude .
There were no reports of a tsunami threat to the area .
This week ’s series in Dilbert caused quite a stir .
It featured a new guy in the office whose name is pronounced hay - soos and spelled Jesus .
I drew those strips a few months ago , and in my typical careless way I did n’t realize they would be running around Easter time .
Oops .
You can see the series at www.dilbert.com while they are still in the archive .
As you might imagine , I got a lot of e-mail about this strip .
Comments were about evenly divided between people who are deeply offended and people who think it was my best work yet .
Interestingly , the people most amused often described themselves as religious , and those offended often noted that they were not especially religious .
My favorite rhetorical question , which I received an alarming number of times , was “ Why do n’t you mock Mohammed next ?
Huh ?
Why not ? ”
Well , aside from the blindingly obvious reason that I prefer life over death , I did n’t realize I was making fun of Christianity this week .
It ’s a standard cartoon practice to take well - known historical or fictional stories and put other characters in those roles .
I did the same thing with The Wizard of Oz , and no one thought I was insulting Dorothy .
Anyway , I had to answer a lot of angry e-mail .
Here ’s a typical letter I received , with my pithy answer at the bottom .

Hello ! Mr. Adams ,
Mr. Adams
I just want to tell you that I do n’t really appreciate you making a mockery of my faith .
I used to think that your comic strip was funny , now I think it is very disgusting and not funny at all .
I have found your last comics strips in reference to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ very offensive .
There is a place for everything and there is a place for humor and humor has its limits , especially when it comes to those things and issues that some of us hold as sacred .
I will pray for you and that some day you may come to know Jesus as your Lord and Savior .
Otherwise you will find
Him some day as your judge , and He will justly judge you for your sins and whether or not you believe in Hell that day you will believe and you will repent when you see Him face to face , but then it will be too late .
Repent from your wicked ways and stop making fun of my Savior .
Thanks for your time .
Pastor ( name deleted ) .

My response …
Thank you for taking time out from feeding the poor to complain about comic strips .
I know Jesus would have played it the same way .

Sneaky Business learned today that the domain name pizza.com has been bought for a whopping $ 2.6 m .
That 's almost $ 0.5 m per slice .
Given that the domain owner , Chris Clark from Maryland , had maintained the site for a mere $ 20 a year since 1994 , this represents an astonishing return on his investment .
According to the BBC article on pizza.com , Mr. Clark was prompted to sell after learning of another sky high valuation for a similar site , Vodka.com – that sold for $ 3 m in 2006 .
" I thought , ' Why do n't I just try to see what the level of interest is ? ' "
Mr. Clark said .
" If someone 's willing to pay that much for Vodka.com , maybe there 's more interest in pizza.com . "
Interestingly , the pizza.com price - tag would n't even make the top three list of time most expensive list domain name sales .
That list is dominated by two adult oriented sites – though , intriguingly , seniors.com was also picked up for $ 1.5 m .
And Tandberg managed to shell out $ 1.5 m for the rights to use their name on their website .
We 're sure they must be very pleased about that investment .
All time most expensive domain names :

Reaching Beichuan is a long march into hell .
When you finally emerge scrabbling through the dirt into the town , what lies before you is a breathtaking vision of horror .
Official estimates say China 's worst natural disaster in 30 years has claimed 50,000 lives so far , but looking at the devastation here , it is hard not to imagine the final toll will be much , much higher .
Beichuan county in Sichuan province used to be home to 160,000 people , and most of them lived in the now - forsaken town of the same name , nestling in one of the world 's most beautiful valleys .
But everyone is gone , either dead or having abandoned their flattened home .
Beichuan was too close to the epicentre of this week 's earthquake to stand a chance .
At least 80 per cent of it is destroyed , with many thousands of bodies still buried in the rubble .
It 's hard to imagine this place ever functioning as a town again .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There is still no access by road .
People 's Liberation Army soldiers rally behind red flags at a rescue station three kilometres away , before starting the trek into the heart of this shattered place .
Our journey to reach Beichuan , which has been almost completely cut off since last Monday 's quake , began at a good pace but we were soon forced to slow to a solemn , single - file column as we negotiated the side of the mountain .
We stopped to allow soldiers carrying bodies , and occasional survivors to pass , their faces straining with the exertion of carrying their heavy burdens up these steep slopes and across the wreckage of roads and fields .
The narrow access track up to the town is also full of villagers bringing whatever little items they can as they scramble back to the refugee camps in neighbouring towns spared the worst of the quake .
These are often old people , who move slowly but steadily , in a way that clearly irritates the fit young teenage troops itching to get past .
But who is going to tell a grandmother carrying her life on her back to speed up ?
The first sighting of what used to be the town happens about two kilometres away .
It now looks like a model railway village that a nasty child has melted and covered with sand .
The town was built on the sides of the valley and when the earthquake struck , the buildings slid down on top of others in a sickening concertina , leaving most of the settlement collapsed at the base of the valley .
One or two large , newer buildings survived but the other big buildings folded on houses and apartment blocks , leaving mountains of rubble dozens of feet high .
Every day I have reported the story of the Sichuan earthquake it has seemed impossible to imagine things getting worse .
Hanwang , with its bodies lying everywhere , was grotesque .
Dujiangyan , where hundreds of teenagers were dragged out dead from the mud , was nightmarish .
But every day is worse than the next .
No one knows what horrors await after Wenchuan , directly above the epicentre , is opened up .
At this stage , there can be precious few survivors there .
But Beichuan is a truly horrendous sight .
The prospect of the death toll reaching beyond 50,000 looks increasingly likely .
Driving up along the valley , along the Chang Jiang , or Long River , which we call the Yangtze , a JCB carrying a mound of corpses wrapped in tarpaulin was an early sign that the scene in Beichuan was going to be harrowing .
But it was worse , much worse , than I 'd expected .
Shutters are pulled three - quarters of the way down on some shop fronts , and feet are visible beneath them , but the grocer 's and fruit shops they are meant to protect are just giant mounds of debris .

At the Middle School , hundreds were buried alive , just as they had been in other schools around Sichuan .
The town 's prison collapsed , and who knows how many inmates died .
Negotiating the rubble is torturous ; finding survivors even worse .
Outside a kindergarten , parents went around calling the names of their children .
A pile of small bodies had already been recovered and lay on the ground .
This earthquake happened during school time , at 2.30 pm .
One man found his son's body in the pile , wrapped it carefully in a plastic sheet and carried him away .
His wife is a migrant worker who lives elsewhere in China and he tried to call her on his mobile to tell her their child was dead , but there was no signal yet .
" There are people alive in there , and over there , and over there , " said one rescuer , outside the ruins of a hairdressing salon .
" But we can't get them out ; what are we supposed to do . "
It 's impossible not to get swept up in the relief effort ; anyone who is in this town has to help , journalist or not .
A crying woman said she could hear cries from beneath the rubble , and I was sent to find a stretcher and workers , but by the time we got back with assistance , the rubble had shifted and there was only a body .
People hear things in earthquake zones , mistaking the wailing of the bereaved for the cries of help from their loved ones .
Rescuers clamber around the debris shouting " hello " and " anyone there " but only an eerie silence answers .
The rescue effort is centred on one very small section on the edge of town , and only a tiny part of Beichuan has been explored so far .
Premier Wen Jiabao , who has flown around from disaster area to disaster area in a helicopter , has visited the town twice so far , but he has been able only to voice words of encouragement to the rescue workers .
China has , cautiously , welcomed some foreign input .
When Mr Wen first visited the town he spotted an American doctor , Brian Robinson of the Heart to Heart aid outfit , walking with other volunteers along the road and he ordered the car to stop .
He embraced the doctor , thanked him and told him to go to Beichuan and help .
An unprecedented action .
It is still impossible to get through to Beichuan with meaningful assistance and aid : most of the cranes , medical supplies and military personnel are all still back down the valley at the disaster relief headquarters .
Rescuers struggle across a bridge lying on the river bed in large chunks , a smashed car on what was the roadside the only evidence that this was ever a bridge .
In the streets , the smell of corpses is accentuated by the searing heat that has replaced the heavy rain of days ago .
The dry weather makes rescue work easier , but you cannot help worrying about disease being the next problem here .
At one point yesterday there was a small aftershock , causing brief panic .
People are also angry that it has taken so long for the relief effort to make it to Beichuan , saying there were hundreds of people crying and shouting in the rubble even on Wednesday , but that it was too late now .
There was little evidence of sniffer dogs , hi-tech equipment , and not too many helicopters around either ; you would expect to see choppers ferrying supplies and people .
What they have is primitive relief work : manpower and womanpower .
Thousands of soldiers and volunteers have arrived in the area , some from as far away as the provincial capital and other parts of China .
Anger , too , is growing about the poor quality of buildings .
In Mianzhu , an apartment block collapsed on itself .
The flats had been built using contributions from a local work unit , a group of workers organised by the Communist Party at a factory or office .
Residents searching for survivors said it was because corrupt officials had demanded so much in kickbacks that the building fell .
The neighbouring buildings had not collapsed , including one which housed cadres from the Communist Party .
" Show me the structural steel in that building , " said one woman , whose mother is missing in the rubble .
" It all went into some official 's pocket , " she spat .
The foreign media have a poor image in China because most people now believe the international community does not want China to host the Olympics and is planning a boycott .
This makes reporting the disaster difficult ; before the anti-Chinese riots in Tibet , and the sympathetic view of Tibetans in the Western media , foreign journalists were popular .
Now we are seen as a threat .
But the soldiers are still helpful , even offering to lift us over the worst of the holes .
All privately owned cars are stopped at a roadblock 20 kilometres from the town to give better access to emergency vehicles .
We leave our car and start to walk , but we are picked up by a trio of relief workers in a blue CDW truck , laden with baskets for carrying debris .
For the first time in four days of reporting the Sichuan earthquake , I see the classic quake image , the fissure stretching the length of a road , made by tectonic plates shifting and tearing the Tarmac apart .
Later even this truck is stopped and we walk the remaining three kilometres with volunteers from nearby Mianyang , bringing money , clothes , food and water .
" We are all one family and one nation and when our friend suffers , it 's our duty to help , " says Lu Fushan , 49 , a farmer .
His truck was stopped , as were many of the volunteers , because there is not enough room for the material to get through .
Dotted along the narrow mountainside road are smashed cars and rocks the size of lorries , which limit traffic to one lane .
There are hundreds of military vehicles along the roadside .
Back along the valley , a couple sit clinging to each other on a bench , looking at the wreckage of their house .
" Our house is smashed , broken , " says Fu Youjun , 34 , a farmer .
" My father is in the hospital .
We felt the quake , we were terribly scared and we rushed out .
When we came out we just saw white smoke and dust .
" My brother is in town , but I can't reach him .
Lots of friends and relatives .
We can't get in touch with them , we tried to get through to them but there 's no road .
And the water is rising , there could be flooding too .
I do n't know what we 'll do next , "
His wife , Wang Hongmei , 30 , says : " The house is slipped , subsided .
My nephew is in there , over there in Beichuan .
What are we going go do ?
We just got married this year . "
But even amid the heartbreak of Beichuan there is an occasional story of hope .
" Do n't help me , help the others , they need it more , " one woman said , as soldiers bore her on a stretcher into a makeshift first - aid centre , seconds after pulling her from the wreckage .
She had lived through 72 almost unbelievable hours under the rubble .
At the first - aid station , there is no time for medics to find the woman 's name .
She looks a youthful 40 , wearing a pale blue top and smart trousers .
She is weak and delirious , but so far she is alive .
The woman is carried on a stretcher back across the mountains by eight strong , sure - footed young PLA soldiers .
Back at the rescue station , rescuers form a cordon for the returning stretchers .
When a survivor is brought through , the soldiers cheer , and when yet another stretcher comes through with a corpse there are disappointed murmurs and sad comments .
The woman is brought through on the stretcher , a scarf covering her face , and the response is at first muted , depressed .
Then , she raises her hand and waves ; the scarf is there to protect her from the hot sun .
Some of the PLA 's most hardened troops laugh and cheer like schoolboys .
This one is alive .

There 's a good discussion revving up in the comment thread of Mark Frauenfelder 's entry , Documentary examines possibility of US dollar collapse .
The first major salvo came from Cowicide , twenty comments in , responding to arguments that the problem is n't that serious :
ConsideredOpinion came in with a balanced and knowledgeable analysis :
… Secondly – the impact of realignments will be felt unevenly across the economy .
The super - rich will , by in large , remain insulated from these changes .
The highly - educated ( with marketable skills ) will remain the most globally competitive , and barring labor movement restrictions should compete evenly against the best anywhere in the world for any currency .
If the realignments can be ' dialed in ' slowly enough , skilled industrial laborers should do better in the US … but I do n't care to think what this will mean for unions and the ILO . …
Then Zuzu weighed in , and became the most prominent commenter in that thread .
He 's something of a monetarist , which is okay ; monetarists are good on the consequences of grossly inflating the currency .
it 's like nobody has ever been through a recession before …
All this fear mongering is getting a little out of control .
I know people love their anecdotal evidence , especially in an economic discussion .
But the concern here is pretty straightforward .
From about 2001 – current the United States has funded a comprehensive restructuring of domestic government agencies ( i.e. Homeland Security ) with new and far - reaching " anti-terrorism " programs ( e.g. Federal subsidy of enlarged state and local police , USVISIT , etc. ) , funded an invasion and ongoing active occupation of Iraq ( at a cost of about $ 1 billion per month ) , while at the same time cutting taxes , and in September 2007 Congress raised the debt ceiling $ 9.815 trillion .
The U.S. Government went from an ostensibly balanced budget in 1999 , to a mind - boggling increase in spending , while at the same time collecting less revenue ( i.e. taxes ) .
How do they afford it ?
They increase the supply of money and credit through the Federal Reserve .
This is a stealth tax .
By debasing the fiat currency of the dollar , they spend the new dollars on the military - industrial complex to " keep us safe " * , which dilutes the value of the dollars we save in our bank accounts ( or that we negotiated with our employers to earn in our paychecks ) , but all of the other goods and services are still just as scarce , so more dollars are needed for the same value to exchange for them , which is inflation .
(* Recently " keep us safe " has been extended to including bailing out financiers such as Bear Stearns and soon Lehman Brothers . )
The " Three Trillion Dollar War " or whatever you want to call it was all paid with inflation , which explains why the price of gold went over $ 1000 / oz , why oil and food prices are up , but people are still generally acting as if dollars are worth what they used to be worth before the new money was created .
( Arguably his is also why the Federal Reserve ceased publishing M3 data in March of 2006 , and why the Department of Labor and Statistics has redefined the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) to exclude energy ( i.e. oil ) and agriculture from its " basket of goods " estimation of dollar purchasing power . )
The economic crisis the United States can no longer ignore is the unwinding of this inflation .
However , economists who speak on television or for politicians will tie themselves in knots and circular logic to avoid ever saying the word " inflation " — it 's like a taboo .
So first they pitched this problem as a " sub - prime mortgage crisis " , until now the problem is obviously not contained to just that market sector .
Recently I 've heard people start saying " contagion " like when the Asian Tigers melted down from their inflationary bubble in the 1990s .
But the crisis is simply that the Bush - Cheney administration has spent more money than God by borrowing and printing it ( i.e. creating inflation ) , which in the central banking system of fractional reserve multiplies several times over into even more inflation .
This creates an enormous market bubble — that so - called " economic recovery " Bush has claimed in his speeches of yore .
So this bubble did n't even feel like a bubble so much because the " improvement " was marginal over the pre-existing recession from the previous dot - com bubble and housing " foam " created by Alan Greenspan .
But soon all of that inflation is about to collapse .
Think of inflation like those Warner Bros. cartoons where Wile E. Coyte runs off the edge of a cliff , and he can keep running and running on the air as long as he does n't look down and realize that there 's no more dirt beneath him .
But eventually he looks down and plummets until he hits real dirt .
That 's what a correction for inflation is like .
And we 've had this inflation / recession building up for approximately a decade now .
It could take at least that long to get back out of it .
So I would not chalk this up to " fear mongering " .
Fear mongering of the phantom menace called " terrorism " is what got us into this hole .
I 'm reminded of an episode of Duckman ( 1994 ) : Once again , the U.S. is spending millions to oust a puppet they spent millions to get into office .
They 'll spend more millions on the coverup to hide having spent those millions and even more millions to discredit members of the media who report otherwise .
It 's a good thing they print their own money .
Other major comments by Zuzu :
Partway through that sequence , Fran Six popped in with a link to a set of charts she 's constructed :
There 's one brief additional comment from Fran Six .
She should feel encouraged to come back and explain more about those charts .
Near the end of the discussion 's current endpoint , Spinobobot entered the conversation with a couple of comments ( first , second ) I 'd quote at greater length , if this entry were n't already too long .
He 's in favor of welcoming our new robot overlords .
Mostly , he talks about things monetarism does n't :
In seriousness , I simply do n't understand why some people trust " the market " to solve all of our problems .
This quote particularly got me : " You ca n't expect bureaucrats to know better than the market itself . "
This market fundamentalism in which any economic woes are blamed on attempts to regulate and interfere with the economy is as unfalsifiable a position as the that of Marxists who maintained that the Soviet Union and other Communist nations were n't really Communist , because a true Communist nation would be successful .
As though we did n't already see the fallout of total laissez - faire in the 19th Century .
I take your point about the problems of bureaucracy and I definitely think that market processes which are response to things like supply and demand have their benefits .
I do n't want to see the elimination of markets by any means .
But we need to put constraints on markets , establish certain kinds of incentives that exercise a general direction for how things will go .
What I really do n't like about unchecked markets is the way that they destroy common goods .
Self - interest is not the only viable human motive .
The conversation 's not over .

Mr Wen says the protesters are trying to sabotage the Olympics
Mr Wen speech Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has accused the Dalai Lama of masterminding the recent days of demonstrations against Chinese rule in Tibet 's capital , Lhasa .
Mr Wen said the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader 's claim of " cultural genocide " was " nothing but lies " .
The Dalai Lama denied he was behind the unrest and said he would resign from the government - in - exile if it worsened .
China says 13 people were killed by rioters in Lhasa .
Tibetan exiles say 99 have died in clashes with authorities .
The protests began on 10 March - the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule - and gradually escalated , culminating in a day of violence late last week .
If things are getting out of control , then the option is to completely resign
The Dalai Lama
Send us your comments Mr Wen 's comments - his first since the violence broke out - came in response to a question by a Western journalist at a news conference following the close of parliament .
Mr Wen defended China 's handling of the violence , accusing protesters of robbery , arson and violence .
He said Tibetan exiles had instigated the violence .
" There is ample fact and plenty of evidence proving this incident was organised , premeditated , masterminded and incited by the Dalai clique , " he said .
" This has all the more revealed the consistent claims by the Dalai clique that they pursue not independence , but peaceful dialogue , are nothing but lies . "
The Dalai Lama , who in 1989 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his consistent opposition to the use of violence , has repeatedly called for dialogue with China .
Tibetans describe unrest
Your pictures : Machu protests Speaking from Dharamsala in northern India , he said his message to Tibetans was to refrain from violence .
" Violence is against human nature , " he said .
" We should not develop anti-Chinese feelings .
We must live together side by side . "
He added : " If things are getting out of control , then the option is to completely resign [ as political head ] , " he said .
" This movement is beyond our control . "
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang has said the Dalai Lama should be put on trial for his role in the unrest .
The Dalai Lama responded by saying : " Investigate thoroughly ... if you want to start investigating from here you are most welcome .
Check our various offices . "
He reaffirmed that he wanted autonomy for Tibet within China , but not outright independence , which he said was " out of the question " .
Convoys Mr Wen had also said the protesters " wanted to incite the sabotage of the Olympic Games in order to achieve their unspeakable goal " .
The Games begin on 8 August .
There have been no moves so far for an international boycott .
European Union ministers have ruled out such a move , saying it would only punish athletes .
But Ma Ying - jeou , the front - runner in Taiwan 's presidential election , to be held on Saturday , said he would " not rule out " a boycott if the crackdown worsened .
TIBET DIVIDE China says Tibet was always part of its territory Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before 20th century 1950 : China launched a military assault Opposition to Chinese rule led to a bloody uprising in 1959 Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India
Q&A : China and Tibet International reaction Tibet adds to Olympic woes Large numbers of police are patrolling the streets of Lhasa .
A Chinese deadline for protesters to surrender passed at midnight on Monday ( 1600 GMT ) and there is no immediate word on the military 's actions .
However , the BBC has received reports from Lhasa of the Chinese authorities conducting house - to - house searches and arresting suspected Tibetan protesters as the deadline approached .
The BBC's Daniel Griffiths , who is close to the border with Tibet in western China , said he had seen long convoys of military vehicles heading across the mountains into Tibet .
There are unconfirmed reports of troops sealing off towns .
Demonstrations have spread to Tibetan communities in Gansu and Sichuan provinces .
A Chinese source with links to the security forces told the BBC that 600 monks had been flown overnight on military planes from Lhasa to Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan .
The report could not be independently verified .
The source was told that the monks were transported because the authorities feared they would become a focus for protests if they stayed in Lhasa .
Police have also stopped BBC journalists from entering the village in which the Dalai Lama was born in north - eastern Tibet .
China says
Tibet has always been part of its territory but Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before the 20th Century and many Tibetans remain loyal to the Dalai Lama , who fled in 1959 .

New travel document requirements for USA citizens
Under new regulations and procedures announced to take effect over the next month , citizens of the USA will , for the first time , be required to obtain USA government permission in order to return home to their own country from abroad -- from anywhere else in the world , by air or sea or land .
On no other aspect of the right to travel is international law more clear than on the right of return to the country of one 's own citizenship : " No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country . "
The new regulations are a flagrant violation of the obligations of the USA as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international human rights treaties , as well as a violation of the Constitutional duty of the USA government to treat such treaties as the highest law of the land .
It 's to be hoped that some civil liberties or human rights organization or individual will go to court before the end of this month to enjoin the government from putting these rules and procedures into effect , and that citizens will assert their rights by attempting to cross borders without papers , and suing those goons from the USA Department of Homeland Security who try to stop them .
But if that does n't happen , here 's what the DHS has promulgated as " final rules " and " procedures " :
As I 've noted previously , the so - called International APIS final rules effective 19 February 2008 will require all travellers to , from , or via the USA by air to obtain two forms of government permission to travel : ( 1 ) a passport , and ( 2 ) a " cleared " message from the DHS authorizing the airline to allow the specific person to board the specific flight or ship .
One might argue that a passport is merely a travel document , not a form of permission .
But that would be wrong .
Because nothing in the law or the regulations for passport issuance ( which were revised in November 2007 ) , guarantees anyone a right to a passport , it is in effect a travel permit , issued at the government 's discretion .
The individualized , per- flight , advance " clearance " message is quite unambiguously a permission - to - travel requirement .
This International APIS rule as originally promulgated in August 2007 applied only to air and sea travel .
So it might have allowed , for those with enough time and money , at least a theoretical possibility that , if the USA would n't give them permission to come home , they could fly to Canada or Mexico , and return to the USA from there by land .
In practice that might be very difficult , because Canada has been barring passage to people on the USA " no - fly " list , and most flights betwen Europe and Mexico overfly the USA and thus are subject to USA jurisdiction and the APIS rules .
But there are some very roundabout and expensive routes from Europe or Africa to Mexico by way of South America .
The DHS has proposed that the " Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative " ( WHTI ) rules that already ( purport to ) reqire passports for USA citizens for air travel between Mexico , Canada , and the USA be extended to those crossing USA borders by land and sea .
But that portion of the WHTI rulemaking proposals remains pending , with no final rules yet published ..
Even this narrow loophole for return to the USA without government permission will apparently be closed , however , by new procedures announced by the DHS in a notice published in the Fegeral Register on 21 December 2007 :
CBP [ the DHS Customs and Border Protection division ] is now amending its field instructions to direct CBP Officers to no longer generally accept oral declarations as sufficient proof of citizenship and , instead , require documents that evidence identity and citizenship from U.S. , Canadian , and Bermudian citizens entering the United States at land and sea ports - of - entry ....
Beginning on January 31 , 2008 , a person claiming U.S. , Canadian , or Bermudian citizenship must establish that fact to the examining CBP Officer 's satisfaction by presenting a citizenship document such as a birth certificate as well as a government - issued photo identification document .
The Federal Register " Notice " acknowledges that the WHTI proposed rules to require passports for land border crossings have not been finalized .
But the " Notice " claims that the new document requirement is " separate from WHTI " , is not a " rule " , and is not subject to any of the same procedural requirements :
The instruction for CBP Officers to no longer generally accept oral declarations alone as satisfactory evidence of citizenship is a change in DHS and CBP internal operating procedures , and therefore is exempt from notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act , 5 U.S.C. 553 ( b ) .
On the basis of this claim .
the DHS " Notice " neither acknowledges nor responds to any of the numerous objections that were raised to the proposed WHTI rules from both sides of the border , including formal comments on their illegality by the Identity Project .
Clearly , the DHS does n't want to address those legal defects in its travel document amd permission schemes .
The problem for the DHS is that -- regardless of the procedural requirements for changes to DHS instructions to CBP officers -- CBP officers who act on the new instructions by preventing citizens from entering or leaving the USA will be acting in violation of those citizens ' rights and the obligations of the government of the USA under the Constitution and international human rights treaties .
With both this document requirement for USA - Canada / Mexico land travel and the document and permission requirement for international air travel between the USA and the rest of the world coming into effect within the next month , there is an urgent need for someone to challenge these regulations .
The procedural issues are quite different , but the substantive issues of the right to travel without government papers or permission are identical .
For what little it's worth , the DHS followed its notice of the new procedures and document requirements for land border crossings with the announcement of the details of a new " passport card " .
Their idea was , apparently , to assuage the intense and widespread criticism of the new document requirements for land border crossings by promising to offer a cheaper alternative to a passport , " real soon now " .
But passport cards wo n't begin to be available until after the new procedures for USA - Canada / Mexico land border crossings take effect .
As I had expected , the passport card will contain a " vicinity " RFID chip , i.e. a chip that can be read at longer range than the " proximity " chip in " RFID passports .
The DHS admits that each passport card will respond to any query by sending back a unique chip ID number -- apparently in the clear .
So if you want a cheaper alternative to an ( RFID ) passport , it will have a much longer - range identity broadcasting mechanism .
And as with RFID passports , there 's nothing in the new rules to restrict private and commercial tracking of passport cards by their unique chip numbers , or secret commercial aggregation , use , and sale of those tracking logs .
March 31 , 2008  --
For centuries , Catholic priests wrote about how to subdue it .
Some historians surmise Martin Luther had it , along with several renowned saints .
When he was in seventh grade , Cole M. , now 23 , saw an episode of " 20/20 " and surmised he had obsessive compulsive disorder , though he did n't the exact name of his disorder : scrupulosity .
Scrupulosity is a rare form of obsessive compulsive disorder focused on prayers , rituals or thoughts rather than the more common germ - phobia and compulsive hand washing .
" Whatever thing that is most important to you , that 's what the obsessive compulsive disorder will grab , " Cole said his therapist once told him .
" My No. 1 fear was that I was going to become an evil person . "
Cole , who asked that ABC News not use his last name , agreed to share his struggle with scrupulosity so that others might recognize it and get help .
Hidden Rituals
Family and friends often have no idea that someone is suffering from scrupulosity , because it often manifests in silent rituals of the mind , says Simon Rego , associate director of psychology training at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York City .
Before he got treatment , Cole silently kept a ritual of finding the number seven in places and avoiding the number six .
Even during conversations ,
Cole silently counted , multiplied and added letters in words to make a sum of seven .
For instance , take the sentence :
The cat is gray .
In less than a second Cole has an answer :
" Cat plus gray equals seven letters .
The and is equals five , " said Cole .
" So , in order to get the [ second ] seven , I 'd make the cross of the t count and the dot of the i count . "
" Nobody would be able to tell that I 'm doing this , " Cole said .
Although it took a tremendous amount of mental energy to count during conversations and everyday life , Cole could not stop his consuming attachment to seven and fear of six .
He explained the number 777 stuck in his mind from a newspaper classified ad he saw as a child that read " 666 SIN 777 GOD . "
" I consciously knew that there was nothing wrong with the number six and seven , " Cole said .
" We need all the numbers , because otherwise we would n't be able to do math , " he added with a laugh .
But Cole was still driven to count words , or to go through a 20 - minute bowing ritual before religious iconography before going to school , or to never swear .
Just like people who have other forms of obsessive compulsive behavior , Cole keeps up his rituals to quiet a fear and get back to his " just right " feeling .
" It 's really not about religion and it's not about faith , " said Jeff Szymanski , director of psychological services at McLean Hospital 's Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Institute in Belmont , Mass .
What begins to drive a person with scrupulosity and with obsessive compulsive disorder are intrusive thoughts , Szymanski said .
Intrusive Thoughts
" Everyone has intrusive thoughts , " Szymanski said .
But not everyone attaches a meaning to the thought in a way that spirals into obsessive compulsive behaviors .
" You have a new mother who 's bathing a baby and she thinks ' what if I put the baby under the water ? ' "
Szymanski said .
" She might just say , 'oh that 's weird , why did I think that ? ' but then she eventually dismisses it . "
People with obsessive compulsive disorder can't just dismiss it , says Szymanski .
Instead , they start what he calls the " thought - action fusion " process where the person believes that because he or she thought about letting the baby slip under the water , there 's a chance he or she will lose control and do it .
After giving so much credence to a thought , a person with obsessive compulsive disorder tries to suppress it .
" When you try to push a thought away , they come back , " said Szymanski .
" But you tell someone ' do n't think about pink elephants , ' and the first thing you do is think about pink elephants . "
In reaction , a person with scrupulosity or obsessive compulsive disorder will compulsively do something to temporarily counter this feeling like pray , bow or confess .
" But that little drop in anxiety in your compulsive behavior actually reinforces the anxiety the next time , " said Szymanski .
To stop the obsessive compulsive spiral , therapists do n't even try to stop the thoughts .
They just try to sap the fear from the intrusive thought -- a difficult undertaking when the fear is of eternal damnation instead of germs or contamination .
Blasphemy , Treatment and Sleeping With Bacon
" When you 're talking about the possibility of someone going to hell , that is something that is just very difficult to challenge someone on , " said Elyssa Kushner , a psychologist with the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
" That 's where it becomes very tricky , " Kushner said .
Obsessive compulsive disorder strikes less than 3 percent of the population , and only 10 percent of those with obsessive compulsive disorder also suffer from scrupulosity .
To use the standard exposure - response obsessive compulsive disorder treatment with someone who has scrupulosity , the therapy can sometimes appear blasphemous .
For instance , some orthodox Jewish scrupulosity patients have been forced to sleep with a sandwich bag of bacon .
To treat Cole 's scrupulosity , his therapist made him sit and write hundreds of sixes without writing a single seven .
Then he took Cole on a field trip and forced him to litter .
" He took a piece of paper out of the trash and tore it in half and threw it on the ground , then gave the other half to me , " Cole said .
" I was really upset .
I do n't want to litter . "
Cole 's therapist even made him swear .
" He had me occasionally curse in these therapy sessions , " Cole said .
" I told him to screw himself , but it was actually a stronger word than that . "
But for all the personal distress a person with scrupulosity faces in treatment , they have a fraction of a chance of adequately controlling their obsessive compulsive behavior .
" Two - thirds of people who go through treatment will see about 50 percent or more of reduction symptoms , " Rego said .
Cole , who briefly studied scrupulosity in graduate school , knows this reality all too well .
Before his treatment he would occasionally have panic attacks when people around him used too many swear words .
Once in college , he even broke down sobbing in a hallway .
" My sophomore year of college , it was just culture shock , " Cole said .
Once in a dance class , his classmates wanted to do a number to a song with very suggestive lyrics and sexually suggestive moves .
" I walked out of class and I sank down in the hallway sobbing because I felt dirty .
When my friend came by and asked what was wrong , in response I screamed and I screamed , " Cole said .
" I was trying to find some way to verbalize the stress I was feeling . "
Today Cole feels much more comfortable with his scrupulosity and even talking about the battling thoughts in the back of his mind .
" Because I no longer turn my focus to it , it does n't get loud , " Cole said .
" It 's always going to be there whispering , but I do n't have to listen to it . "
Further tests are needed to assess the potential of the find
Brazil has discovered what could be the third biggest oil reserve in the world , according to the head of the country 's National Petroleum Agency .
The deep - sea find by state - run oil firm Petrobras could yield 33 billion barrels in reserves .
Further tests are required to assess the scale of the find , off the coast of Rio de Janeiro , but analysts say it could have significant implications .
Brazil announced sizeable new gas and oil discoveries last year as well .
' Big number '
In December 2007 , Brazil said it had found a new reserve in the Espirito Santo region a month after a reserve in the nearby Tupi oil field of up to eight billion barrels was found .
According to the US Energy Department , Brazil 's existing proven oil reserves total 11.8 billion barrels , while the US holds 21.8 billion .
Referring to the latest discovery , Citigroup analyst Tim Evans said : " It 's a big , big number " .
Petrobras said " more conclusive data " about the potential of the discovery would only be known after further evaluation .
A spokesperson for the National Petroleum Agency said the statement by its president Harold Lima about the find was based on unconfirmed sources .
Even if the reserves are proven , it is likely to take ten years before the latest find can be turned into significant supplies .

Until recently , I have to admit to being very skeptical of the long term value of social media .
My own experience has been relatively poor in that social media has provided me with few long term readers , which has lead me to discount its value , and largely ignore its potential .
I said as much in a recent post on ProBlogger , at which point Brian Wallace took me to task and encouraged me to update my thinking .
My discussion with Brian made me realize that my current position on social media is in fact the complete opposite of the longer term thinking that I usually try to promote .
In the long game , social media does indeed offer significant value through allowing smaller blogs to be noticed , enabling the cream of the blogosphere to rise to the top more quickly , and effectively democratising the media industry by allowing readers to determine what gets attention based on merit , instead of allowing editors to decide this for them .
Social media will undoubtedly change things for everybody , from bloggers at the lower end of the media food chain to the global news corporations at the top .
Like good politicians , bloggers need to master the process of building a following and becoming nominated to stand in the daily social media elections ( my own best performance has been a miserable 50 diggs , and about 15 stumbles – pretty poor ) , but what are the further implications of the social media phenomenon ?
Knowing that this revolution is coming , which strategies can be employed to fully exploit the opportunities that social media presents beyond simply becoming a top social media community member ?
Right now I have a few emergent and ill - defined thoughts , and even fewer answers .
I would like to use this post to share my musings and start a discussion before pretending to come up with some smart ideas of my own ..
How will social media continue to be influenced ?
I believe that blogs will represent a crucial media battleground in the coming years .
Large media firms are beginning to exploit blogs as a cheap way to produce insightful content and win back readers who are being drawn in large numbers to savvy and entrepreneurial bloggers who are becoming increasingly organized , professional and consolidated .
Social media will certainly play an important part in this battle , as large media seeks to influence by weight and small media seeks to influence by guile .
Will large media firms begin to exploit social media , or will they continue to rely on the strength of their existing brands ?
What are the wider implications for the blogosphere if large media firms truly engage in this market ?
To what extent will the media merge and differentiate ?
What about the wider influence of social media on the landscape of content produced ?
Democracy is not without its share of problems .
Winston Churchill once declared that “ Democracy is the worst form of government , except all of the others have been tried . ”
Elaborating on these thoughts he later said “ The strongest argument against democracy is a five minute discussion with the average voter ” .
Reading some of the comments on Digg one can derive some sympathy for that position !
As social media begins to evolve and increase its influence , will the resulting media democracy have a dramatic influence on the content created in the first place ?
Will editors begin to focus on stories that will bring in votes rather than on quality content ?
Will quality become less important or more important – or will it simply be defined by what is ‘ diggable ’ ?
With this in mind , if you were building a new blog enterprise today , what style of content would you go for ?
How much would social media influence your content and how central would it be to your overall content strategy ?
Are blogs which do not appeal to social media still viable ?
Will branding continue to play an important role ?
Good brands provide a promise which acts as a useful tool for consumers during the selection process .
People go to CNN.com or news .
BBC.com today because they know what to expect and what they are going to get .
However , branding may begin to influence reader behaviour in other ways .
Firstly , the rise of new media brands such as Digg will enable the media democracy and become an important and trusted news source , potentially relegating other brands to the position of content provider instead of content portal .
Secondly , branding is likely to play some role in the social media voting process .
Will voters vote purely on merit , or will they be more inclined to vote for sources they know ?
Will existing brands be able to use their brand power to leverage social media , or will we see a truly democratic democracy ?
Will brand building remain important , or will the value of existing brands be stripped away by the new democratic process ?
Will social media truly level the playing field , or just partially redistribute it ?
What impact will social media have on entrance barriers to the media world ?
Before the advent of the Internet , getting published was a big deal .
Before the advent of the blogosphere , getting noticed was a big deal .
Today , with the right techniques and an interesting message it ’s relatively easy to build a following , and by exploiting social media it ’s possible to reach a very wide audience very quickly .
As social media takes off and enters the mainstream , will it become easier or harder to enter the game ?
Will individuals once again become lost in a sea of content as everybody fights over the same space within social media , or will new content creators be able to succeed purely on merit ?
Will the world of media see evolution or revolution ?
These are questions which promise to occupy my mind for a good while .
I ’ll be back shortly with another post as my thoughts crystallize , but in the meantime I would love to hear your views .
Last month we reported that Geremi Adam , producer of some of the highest quality pirate movie copies ever seen on the Internet , had been caught and had been ordered to appear in court in January .
Adam , aka ' maVen ' had other ideas - and has disappeared .
Between 2004 and 2006 , Geremi Adam , delighted the movie piracy scene with some of the highest quality Telesync movies ever seen .
From ‘ The Bourne Supremacy ’ and ‘ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ’ through to ‘ Spongebob Squarepants ’ and plenty of other titles , the work of ‘ maVen ’ set a very high standard for quality pirated movies .
Following an FBI investigation into ‘ maVen ’ , his file was handed to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) in April 2006 .
By September of the same year , Geremi Adam was arrested by police outside a Montreal theater after ‘ camming ’ the movies ‘ How to Eat Fried Worms ’ and ‘ Invincible ’ .
They seized his laptop and other equipment but later released him .
A month later he was arrested again outside another theater .
Facing a $ 25,000 fine and six months in jail , Geremi Adam was ordered to appear in court on 30th January .
Clearly unimpressed by the prospect of being locked up and / or bankrupted , he failed to appear in court and has gone on the run .
“ We have a warrant and the police officers will try to find Mr. Adam , ” said federal prosecutor Yacine Agnaou in a statement .
“ When he is found , he will be mandated to appear in court . ”
Meanwhile , outside the court a demonstration was taking place by a group calling themselves ‘ Hors - d - Oeuvre ’ who say that ‘ maVen ’ is being unfairly treated and that all media should be available on the Internet for free .
“ Free Geremi ! ” they chanted in unison .
Fortunately for Adam , he committed the alleged offenses before new tough legislation was introduced to punish movie cammers caught in Canada .
He will likely escape the severe punishment of 2 years in prison , a fate awaiting fellow cammer , Louis - Rene Hache .
RCMP Staff Sgt. Noel St - Hilaire said : “ Unfortunately at the time there was no legislation that forbid anyone from filming in a cinema .
There ’s not much we could do then other than issue a warning . ”
Although not turning up at court is likely to inflame the situation , it ’ll be interesting to see if the mounties are prepared to put any serious effort into ‘ getting their man ’ in this instance .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The warning that Group of Seven finance officials sent to foreign - exchange markets -- that it 's unhappy with all the recent volatility -- is a signal they want to give the dollar a breather after its pummeling by currency traders , experts said Sunday .
But Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and their counterparts from the G7 also conveyed a second signal this weekend , analysts said .
Namely , do n't expect central banks to buy up dollars in the open market .
Instead , they hope that their jawboning can stabilize the market .
They believe , with a little time and luck , events might begin to turn in the dollar 's favor .
" It looks as though the G7 is trying to buy the beleaguered dollar some time , as it trades just off its all - time low versus the euro , " said Ronald Simpson , foreign - exchange analyst at Action Economics .
" They are hoping that the economy will turn around , that credit markets will stabilize to a degree and perhaps we will start to see a bottom in the U.S. housing market , " Simpson said .
In a very unusual move , the G7 nations said in a statement Friday : " Since our last meeting , there have been at times sharp fluctuations in major currencies , and we are concerned about their possible implications for economic and financial stability . "
See related story .
Although the statement did n't specifically mention the greenback , it was clear that the G7 was saying they are not happy with the dollar 's weakness .
“ ' The G7 will see what the market reaction is .
If it stabilizes the dollar , they wo n't have to do anything more .
If that does n't work , they 'll go to the next step . ' ” — Desmond Lachman , American Enterprise Institute
" It is trying to signal that the dollar is falling too quickly and that this is causing problems " throughout the global financial market , said Desmond Lachman , analyst at the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington think tank .
Lex Rieffel , a former U.S. Treasury official and now a scholar at the Brookings Institution , said he believed that the Europeans pressed for the new language .
" I have to believe it was the Europeans who said , ' Look , we 've got to make it clearer to markets that we are not pleased with the weakness of the dollar , ' " Reiffel said .
Stability 's the objective
The goal is n't necessarily to turn the dollar around in the wake of its dramatic recent weakness .
" I do n't think we 've reached that point where intervention is necessary .
They are trying to stabilize " the U.S. currency , Reiffel said .
" Officials are trying to play for time , " said Marc Chandler , head of currency strategy with Brown Brothers Harriman & Co .
It 's widely anticipated that the Fed is going to again cut interest rates when the U.S. central bank meets later this month , but the European Central Bank has given no hints that it's to do anything but hold firm against easing euro - zone monetary policy , preferring instead to exercise vigilance against inflation .
But this might change by September , analysts said .
The Fed is n't going to keep easing forever , and analysts see the ECB coming around to the idea of cutting rates later this year .
If Bernanke and other Washington policymakers are correct that the U.S. economy can rebound in the second half of 2008 , this will also help the dollar .
While the Europeans had a clear interest in seeing a weaker dollar , it was surprising to some that the U.S. would agree to the language change .
After all , the U.S. with its soft economy is benefiting from a weak dollar .
Manufacturers are able to export more goods and compete on a better footing in global markets .
Sobering side effects
What brought Paulson to the negotiating table , experts said , is concern that these benefits are being outweighed by two negative factors of a weak dollar : high oil prices and the risk that foreigners will pull out of dollar investments .
The market has linked the falling dollar to higher oil prices .
And if oil remains at these high levels , it will offset any gains from the economic stimulus package that will start to impact the economy next month , Lachman said .
And the fear that foreigners might divest their holdings of U.S. Treasurys has been a long - standing concern .
" The fear is that if the U.S. is paying very low interest rates and the dollar keeps declining , why these foreigners are holding all these bonds .
If they begin off - loading these bonds , it becomes a financial market problem , " Lachman said .
What will happen Monday ?
Chandler downplayed suggestions that the G7 is close to intervening in the currency markets .
He said he viewed intervention as a ladder , and while the statement does move finance officials up a few rungs , they are still well below the intervention step .
Lachman agreed .
" The G7 will see what the market reaction is .
If it stabilizes the dollar , they wo n't have to do anything more .
If that does n't work , they 'll go to the next step , " he said .
A few analysts were dismissive of the language change , however .
" It is a green light to continue selling U.S. dollars .
It is most likely what we 're going to see on Monday and Tuesday , " said Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon .
" It was a very bland statement , " he said .
Ashraf Laidi , chief foreign - exchange strategist at CMC Markets U.S. , said nothing short of intervention would stop the dollar weakness .
But Kathy Lien , chief strategist at Forex Capital Markets , raised the possibility that behind the scenes , " something very big " might be in the works at the G7 .
She said she 's been advising traders to be ready for some creative action that might be aimed at overall market liquidity .
As such , she sees the G7 statement as supporting the dollar .

At the southernmost end of Brooklyn , just off Dead Horse Bay , there 's a weather - beaten helipad where the New York Police Department keeps a gray unmarked twin -engine Bell 412 helicopter .
Detective Brendan Galligan ushers me aboard .
" We do n't really let people see this , " he says .
We climb in behind the pilot and find ourselves facing a console with three screens :
One shows a map of the city ; another , an interface for checking license plates and addresses ; and the third , the view from a gyro - stabilized L - 3 Wescam camera attached to the chopper 's nose .
The camera can see clear across the city , in both the visible and the infrared slices of the spectrum ; then it can broadcast the images to police headquarters using an onboard microwave transmitter .
The helicopter , part of New York City 's antiterror arsenal , takes off and climbs to 1,000 feet in the afternoon sunshine .
Passing the Verrazano - Narrows Bridge , Galligan scans for suspicious trucks lingering on approach ramps .
Over the Staten Island Ferry , he explains how police routinely use the chopper to look for boats that might be trailing too closely .
Then , as we swing past the gaping World Trade Center site , the 22 - year veteran adjusts the joystick to turn the camera eastward , filling the third screen with the towers of lower Manhattan : the center of the center of the bull 's - eye .
The New York Stock Exchange , the American Stock Exchange , the Federal Reserve Bank , City Hall , four major bridges and tunnels — a bomb at any of these places could kill hundreds , cost the city billions , and rattle the world financial system .
Al Qaeda has hit lower Manhattan twice , in 1993 and 2001 , and officials say that several other plots have been broken up since .
City agencies have done their best to harden the financial district in the years since 2001 .
Today , explosives - sniffing dogs and two truckloads of cops wearing military - style body armor and waving M - 4 machine guns surround the flag - draped stock exchange .
Black metallic barriers rise out of the asphalt , blocking traffic on Wall Street , while concrete planters and strategically parked trucks keep vehicles off Broad Street .
Some of the other streets surrounding the exchange have been cut off to pedestrians , and only invited guests are allowed inside .
" Closed since 9/11 , " the guard tells visitors .
But you can't block off every street or have a guard by every door .
There 's no budget for that , and no one would want to live or work in that kind of armed camp anyway .
" You can make a justification for putting bollards in front of every building , " says a former high - ranking NYPD counterterrorism official .
" But pretty soon you can't walk anywhere .
People leave . "
So New York has an audacious blueprint to wrap a high tech cloak around lower Manhattan .
It will provide the most sophisticated armor of any major urban area in the world — one that relies on brains as much as brawn , on barely visible technology as much as brute stopping power .
And the chopper I 'm in will be just a small piece of it .
Every so often , great cities have to remake themselves if they want to stay great — adding a new layer of technological infrastructure to meet the challenges of the day .
In the 1880s , Thomas Edison built the first central electrical power plant in lower Manhattan .
In 1904 , the city finished its very first subway line .
The 1980s saw new fiber - optic data pipes , and today New York is in the middle of its next major makeover .
This time , the technological update is about keeping the city safe .
There will be upgrades citywide , including a new , next - gen cell network , an overhaul of the subway 's security system , and an increase in manpower .
But the financial district is a special case , and in June 2006 the NYPD announced a three - year , $ 106 million plan called the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative .
Its centerpiece is an array of 3,000 cameras that will turn the area into a 1.7 - square - mile , open - air Panopticon .
The first cameras started going in earlier this year .
In contrast to London 's surveillance system , the so - called Ring of Steel , New York 's cameras will do more than identify terrorists after they 've struck .
The new cameras will be fully networked , with video - intelligence algorithms that aim to spot potential attackers before they perpetrate their crimes .
Assistant chief John Colgan , who commands the police department 's counterterrorism bureau , hopes the LMSI will keep the next disaster from happening .
" This is about identifying and eliminating a threat , rather than dealing with the consequences , " says Colgan , a compact redhead with a bushy mustache .
" I 'm not in the consequence - management business . "
* Photo : Vincent Laforet *
To support the plan , Colgan says , extra officers will be reassigned to downtown .
Electronic license plate readers , both stationary and mounted on mobile police units , can already scan thousands of cars per day and instantly alert police if a suspect in their database approaches or enters the financial district .
Massive vehicle barriers will be able to block off the busiest streets on a signal from HQ , even shutting down the Brooklyn - Battery Tunnel .
Of course , the same technology could be used to invade privacy more efficiently , and even some in the NYPD are concerned : " I certainly do n't want my family to come under view just because they 're walking through a certain part of town , " one counterterrorism official told me .
And those questions become even more complex as Colgan brings the financial giants of lower Manhattan into the network : 2,000 of the 3,000 LMSI cameras will be privately owned , including 200 of the first 250 , just installed .
The plan will also require builders of new skyscrapers , like the high - profile Goldman Sachs headquarters in Battery Park City and the Freedom Tower going up where the World Trade Center once stood , to submit blueprints to the city so police can ensure that security measures are part of the designs .
( The Freedom Tower , for example , was moved farther away from the West Side Highway . )
Colgan also wants those electronic blueprints on the network so they can be accessed easily during a crisis to help guide rescue efforts .
Eventually , Colgan would like to be able to control just about every aspect of any new tower — the lights , the air - conditioning , the internal security cameras , the access controls — from a desktop at the new LMSI command center at 55 Broadway .
The question is whether any amount of gear can stop a dedicated suicide bomber .
At 4:54 on the morning of July 7 , 2005 , Shehzad Tanweer entered a gas station about 200 miles north of London .
As he was leaving , he looked into the lens of a security camera .
At 7:21 , another camera caught him and three other men walking into the train station in Luton .
Tanweer shifted his backpack uneasily .
An hour later , the four were recorded again , and at 8:50 a camera captured passengers boarding a train .
Seconds after the doors closed , the bombs detonated .
The blast killed eight , including Tanweer , and wounded 171 .
London may be the most heavily surveilled city on the planet , with thousands of cameras in train stations , on street corners , and in parks , but this surveillance is useless against suicide bombers .
Tanweer did n't care if he was caught on tape — he'd be dead before anyone reviewed the footage .
Two weeks after the Luton bombing , cameras recorded another group of four as they brazenly tried to detonate more explosives on London 's subways and buses .
Fortunately , their weapons malfunctioned , and no one was killed .
Again , the presence of electronic eyes did nothing to inhibit them .
That 's because London has only a hodgepodge of partially connected cameras — some public , some private — not a fully integrated network .
Monitoring them all is impossible , and security guards get little guidance about what to look for .
But video surveillance technology has gotten a lot smarter since London 's security was installed .
New software can sound an alarm when it spots suspicious behavior — bags left on a platform , trucks circling , people entering a building through an exit .
Surveillance networks can now be taught even to recognize familiar faces .
Technology from 3VR , a security firm in San Francisco that 's funded partially by the CIA , makes it easy to sift through surveillance video .
Click on a face and you 'll see every instance in which that person has come within the field of view of a networked camera , allowing companies and government agencies to set up video watch lists .
The system has already been used successfully to foil a check - cashing scheme .
British intelligence had followed Tanweer before , and tapes showed him and some fellow bombers rehearsing their plot several weeks prior to July 7 .
If the London cameras had been outfitted with the right software , his face might have triggered an alarm .
Dumb systems , no matter how extensive , do n't seem to deter even small - time bombers .
In early March , a bicyclist left a small homemade explosive at a military recruiting station in New York 's Times Square , in plain view of more than a dozen security cameras .
Weeks later , the bomber still remained at large , a perfect example of why the NYPD is turning to newer , networked video systems instead .
No one expects to catch a bomber in the act ; this is real life , not 24 .
But with the right people and the right gear , it might — might — be possible to nab potential attackers while they 're still casing their targets , when they 're most vulnerable , Colgan says .
If someone sneaks around the back of the New York Stock Exchange , say , or lingers too long in front of the Federal Reserve , the NYPD will know .
" This is preventative , " Colgan adds , " because we would expect those people who would attack us to be dead on the day they attack us . "

York 's counterterrorism overhaul is more than just a collection of shiny new gadgets .
Under commissioner Ray Kelly , the NYPD has already put in place a combination of protective measures — some aggressive , others invisible .
The police 's intelligence unit used to be a trivial operation , just a handful of cops to protect VIPs .
Today , it 's a 500 - person bureau headed by a former CIA director of operations , with so many Harvard - trained analysts that , at a party last October , more people were cheering the Red Sox than the Yankees .
Plainclothes officers shadow terror suspects all over the city , and additional detectives are stationed overseas .
Others work on Operation Nexus , reaching out to local and national businesses so they 'll notify police when someone tries to make suspicious bulk purchases of , say , fertilizer or hydrogen peroxide .
To show cops what to hunt for , the NYPD reportedly constructed a replica of the lab where Tanweer built his bombs .
All told , more than 1,000 officers now work directly on counterterrorism , while the remaining 37,000 are drilled constantly on how to respond to the type of chaos caused by terrorist incidents .
But technological deficits still hold city agencies back .
The 9/11 Commission famously criticized the city because Port Authority cops , who used a UHF radio system , and firefighters , who used weak radios that only other fire personnel carry , could n't share information inside the towers .
Though the police deny it was an issue that day , there 's no question that emergency communications are far from perfect even now , seven years after the September 11 attacks .
Proof can be found in the emergency - management trailer , which I visited while it was parked next to City Hall .
Inside , the trailer is lined with PCs and video screens , but Henry Jackson , deputy commissioner of New York 's Office of Emergency Management , has to wear three cell phones on his belt , each from a different carrier , while several brands of radio hang on the wall .
" You never know what 's going to work , what coverage you 're going to have , " he says .
Even relatively minor catastrophes — like when Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle crashed his plane into an Eastside apartment building — have snarled commercial voice and data traffic .
So the city is in the middle of a $ 500 million upgrade to create the NYCWiN ( New York City Wireless Network ) , a speedy , 3G - on - steroids private data network solely for government data — one that wo n't get swamped in emergency situations .
Incident commanders could use it to pull images from surveillance choppers or data from license plate readers .
Every ambulance and fire truck will be trackable on digital maps .
And LMSI video feeds could be pumped directly to mobile command centers .
Seventy percent of Manhattan should be online by this month .
In the trailer , Jackson 's assistants click through video feeds streaming over a version of the new network .
We see the Brooklyn Bridge , the Staten Island Ferry terminal , Canal Street .
" Before , this was painfully slow , " Jackson says .
" Now , not so bad . "
The plan to protect lower Manhattan sounds promising — on paper , at least .
Colgan says he 's confident it will work — though he refuses to demonstrate any of the new gear .
" There are many elements to the initiative that we 're not going to discuss publicly , " he says .
But , as the experience in other cities shows , all this new technology , once assembled , may not function as advertised .
In the summer of 2005 , not long after Tanweer and his companions bombed the London Tube , the New York subway system signed a deal with defense contractor Lockheed Martin to put in security cameras , motion sensors , perimeter sensors , and intelligent video .
So far , only three out of 16 components are in place .
The problem is wedging a modern security network into a 100 - year - old system .
Just getting the power and air - conditioning needed for the cameras ' servers has been a nightmare ; in many stations , there 's literally no place to put the things .
Plus , the ceilings in most of the subway stations are only 9 feet high , with columns every few yards .
That makes it hard to get a good look at passengers .
Add a sprawling bureaucracy — the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is really a combination of seven agencies — and costs are going to multiply .
Not surprisingly , the security upgrades , which are not even part of the LMSI , are already 70 percent overbudget and 15 months behind schedule .
Of course , the LMSI does n't have to deal with the logistical nightmare of operating entirely underground .
But it also does n't have the advantage of operating in a confined , well - lit space like a bank or a casino — the only places where video intelligence has worked in the past .
And no one has ever tried to create a system as big as the LMSI .
Even police commissioner Kelly does n't sound completely convinced .
" We 've got an eye toward prevention , " he says .
" I like cameras because they act as a deterrent . "
In other words , maybe the new video system does n't even have to work as advertised in order to have the desired effect .
Maybe the goal here is a kind of digital placebo effect :
Just say that the cameras are all linked up .
" The cameras become a great subject for conversation because they 'll all be in public areas , " Colgan says .
" And quite frankly , we want people to see them . "
In London , terrorists were undeterred by a system they knew was passive and dumb , but in New York they may think twice if they believe they are going up against a smart network .
" A big part of security is psychological warfare , " says RAND specialist Brian Jenkins .
A terrorist is going to successfully attack New York again .
Everyone knows that .
The point is to make sure it 's not a knockout blow .
And that means introducing a little fear into the mind of the attacker .
" Look , a stick of dynamite in a briefcase — there 's not a lot you can do .
But that 's not going to bring the financial district low , " Jenkins says .
" You 've got to make the threshold for a successful attack as high as possible , " he says .
" Hound them .
Make it hard for them to do their surveillance .
Deter them as much as possible .
Harden your sites so their attacks wo n't be as effective .
And make it clear that if they have n't blown themselves up along the way , you 're going to catch them .
With that combination of measures , that 's about as good as it gets . "
Flying at 1,000 feet , Brendan Galligan and I dart up Manhattan 's West Side — over the docks , past midtown and Central Park .
We soar over the Bronx and look down on Yankee Stadium .
Then , at the northern end of the city , he spins the camera back to Brooklyn .
On the screen , we can clearly see the radar ball at our heliport some 25 miles away .
" Awesome , right ? " he says , smiling .
From the air , when everything looks so calm , it 's easy to forget all the times the city has been targeted — and how much work goes into keeping the peace .
We circle back to Brooklyn , and the chopper lowers daintily onto the helipad at Dead Horse Bay .

Paper : Clinton campaign chair photographed holding Obama signs
Terry McAuliffe , former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and now - chairman of Senator Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign , has been mysteriously caught in three photographs smiling and holding an Obama for president sign with supporters in Washington state -- according to a blog at the Chicago Tribune .
The Clinton campaign has not contested their authenticity .
An email sent to Clinton 's spokesman Monday was not returned .
McAuliffe is said to be generous in posing for photographs .
The photos were acquired by the Chicago Tribune 's Swamp blog .
" What 's really interesting , as you can see from these photos , is that McAuliffe posed with supporters of Sen.
Barack Obama 's presidential campaign and that a beaming McAuliffe helped them hold up their large Obama signs for the camera , " Swamp author Frank James wrote Monday morning .
" McAuliffe is wearing his Clinton button but it's dwarfed by the Obama sign he 's holding .
" We do n't want to read too much into these photos , " he added .
" But it 's definitely striking to see the chairman of the Clinton campaign smiling broadly into the camera while holding up a campaign poster for Obama with whom Clinton is currently engaged in a fight to the death . "
LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) -
An unidentified man is in critical condition with suspected ricin poisoning after staying in a Las Vegas hotel room where the potentially deadly substance was found , police said on Friday .
The FBI said the incident was not thought to be terrorism related .
Police said the man , who they did not name , had last occupied the room two weeks ago and was taken to a local hospital on February 14 when he complained of breathing difficulties .
A suspicious substance , which tests have confirmed to be ricin , was found in the sick man ’s room on Thursday after a relative or friend went to the hotel to collect his possessions , Las Vegas deputy police chief Kathy Suey told a news conference .
No one else has reported symptoms and it was not clear where the ricin came from , or what is was doing in the room at the Extended Stay America Hotel in Las Vegas .
Suey said the sick man , in his 40s , “ is in critical condition and he is unable to speak with us right now .
We have no indication why the ricin was in that room . ”
Suey said castor beans , the basis for making ricin , were found in the hotel on Thursday and that the ricin was found in vials in the room .
There is no definitive test for ricin , which in proper doses can be used to treat cancer .
It can be in the form of a powder , a mist or a pellet and can be inhaled or ingested .
There is no known antidote and most victims die within 36 hours to 72 hours from exposure to as little as a pinhead amount of the substance .
Police said the investigation was still in its early stages and gave no details about the sick man , nor of the person who visited the hotel on Thursday .
They said the visitor was not a suspect .
Six other people , including police and hotel workers , were admitted to the hospital as a precaution on Thursday but no one else has symptoms , Suey said .
Ricin attacks cells , preventing them from making necessary proteins .
The most famous case of ricin poisoning was in 1978 when dissident Bulgarian writer Georgi Markov was killed after a passerby in London jabbed him with an umbrella that injected a tiny ricin - filled pellet .
Hundreds of homeless forcibly evicted from Southern California refuge
By Kevin Martinez and Dan Conway
7 April 2008
Dozens of police and state officials descended on the Ontario , California homeless encampment known as “ tent city ” on March 17 under the pretext of reducing crime and stopping the spread of disease .
Approximately 200 residents living at the encampment were forcibly removed .
Residents , many with severe physical and mental disabilities , had been given little notice of the planned eviction .
Requests for a 30 - day reprieve had been denied by local officials .
Officials acted with the ostensible intention of removing all non-Ontario residents from the area .
To that end , tent city residents were given color - coded arm bands which divided them into three categories ; Ontario residents , non-residents , and those who were given a short period of time to prove residence in Ontario .
Dogs and other pets were removed from the site along with motor homes and cars that were unable to start properly .
The police most likely kicked out many residents who were citizens of Ontario , but were unable to adequately prove it .
The evicted residents were then bused out of the encampment , leaving personal belongings behind in many cases .
Their ultimate fate remains unclear .
One volunteer interviewed by local news station KTLA 5 reported that he had conducted extensive interviews with camp residents and believed that only about 15 percent of the original 400 were not from the city of Ontario as opposed to the 50 percent actually evicted .
The encampment itself is located on a group of vacant , dust - covered house lots adjacent to the Ontario airport approximately 40 miles east of the city of Los Angeles .
Begun during the summer of 2007 with a group of approximately 30 residents , the camp swelled to an estimated 400 over the course of only a few months .
Despite the efforts of a large number of volunteers , who came to offer their help once the existence of “ tent city ” became more widely known , the residents continue to live in squalid and harsh conditions .
Those who do not have an RV or motor home have to live in either camping or improvised tents .
Many have only plastic tarps or cardboard boxes to protect them from the elements .
World Socialist Web Site reporters who visited “ tent city ” shortly after the eviction observed that sanitation has become a problem with garbage strewn right next to where people eat and sleep .
Only one portable shower for the entire encampment could be seen .
To step into the camp is like looking into a 21st century version of John Steinbeck ’s The Grapes of Wrath .
Indeed , some have dubbed the camp “ Bushville ” , a reference to “ Hoovervilles , ” shantytowns set up by the homeless during the Great Depression and whose names were a sarcastic reference to then President Herbert Hoover .
Those who live there represent only a tiny fraction of the approximately 131,000 homeless living in San Bernardino and neighboring Los Angeles , Riverside and Orange counties .
While local officials have used the occasion of the evictions to announce plans to improve portable bathrooms and install a food service area and fire rings , Brent Schultz , housing manager for the city of Ontario , has announced that the newly fenced in area will be secured between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , and expressed the hope that volunteers would largely defray maintenance costs that would otherwise be borne by the city .
In addition to the enforced curfew , remaining residents were also given ID cards that allow them a maximum stay of 90 days at the camp .
State officials and police , who will now maintain a permanent presence in the area , will also enforce a maximum occupancy of 170 residents .
Such measures seem to indicate that the city of Ontario ultimately intends to clear out the site ’s homeless population entirely rather than fulfill its stated goal of reducing disease and crime at the site .
The majority of “ tent city ’s ” residents suffer from mental illness , drug addiction , physical disability or a combination of all three .
However , a recent news story by the BBC revealed that a handful of people in the Ontario encampment were there as a result of the US housing crisis .
One individual told the British news agency that he had a choice between “ feeding [ his ] family or keeping the house . ”
“ So I got rid of the house , ” he said .
As the foreclosure crisis intensifies , this could directly or indirectly lead to an increase in the populations of this and other such encampments .
California has been particularly hard - hit by the meltdown of the US home market .
According to the web site DataQuick.com , which monitors housing and foreclosure activity in California , the county of San Bernardino , which contains the city of Ontario , experienced a 106 percent increase in mortgage loan default notices between the fourth quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2007 .
Similarly , the state of California experienced a 114 percent increase during that same period , and this number is expected to rise as home prices decline along with other economic indicators .
The DataQuick site also reports that while 71 percent of California homeowners so notified were able to safely emerge from the foreclosure process in 2006 either by refinancing , becoming current with their loan payments , or repaying their mortgages through the sale of their homes , this percentage dropped to 41 percent in 2007 .
While the majority of tent city residents are not as a direct result of the foreclosure crisis , they are victims of its indirect effects .
Mike Dunlap , a volunteer with a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center , spoke with WSWS reporters about some of the conditions that originally drove residents to tent city and about the evacuations which he had witnessed .
He responded to our question about the impact of foreclosures on homelessness and our observation that one of the many problems fueling the existence of “ tent city ” was the lack of affordable housing in the area .
He explained that he expected to see a “ trickle - down effect ” from the foreclosure crisis .
“ Normally , a lot of the homeless on SSI [ Supplemental Security Income , a benefit paid out to the elderly and the disabled ] in the beginning of the month , when they get paid , would be in hotels for a week , maybe two .
If they could afford it , they ’d double up .
“ But what you ’re going to see now is all the hotels are going to be full because all the people that have foreclosures that did n’t buy motor homes and trailers took all the spaces wherever they could go .
If they fill up all the hotels , where are all the homeless going to go that normally go [ to hotels ] for two weeks out of a month ?
They ’re going to go on the street .
And from that then you ’re going to be devastated .
“ Every community is going to start seeing that , ” Dunlap said .
“ We know there are more people here , caused by the economy , [ caused by there being ] no jobs , caused by foreclosures .
People run out of money and they ’re at the bottom . ”
He added that the Ontario authorities pushed many tent city residents into leaving , even those who legally had a right to stay by virtue of their residence , because they wanted to reduce the numbers at the encampment .
“ I think what really happened is that they intimidated [ the homeless ] so bad that they got down to 75 , maybe 80 people [ remaining ] , ” Dunlap explained .
“ I do n’t doubt that some will die out there , ” he continued , “ Because knock them down again and again and sooner or later , they ’re alone and what else do they do ?
They commit suicide . ”
The WSWS also spoke with Tina , a former nurse , and a homeless resident of Ontario ’s tent city who was able to stay at the encampment .
She explained that she ended up homeless after suffering a shoulder injury .
As a result , she could not perform CPR any longer , losing her nursing license and her livelihood .
“ I ’ve been renting an apartment since I was 18 and never had an eviction in my life [ until this ] , ” Tina told us .
“ Now my credit is screwed , ” she said , explaining her difficulty getting an apartment .
“ Rents out here [ i.e. in Ontario as opposed to the city of Los Angeles ] are more reasonable , but trying to get into a place .
They want a first month ’s rent , a last month ’s rent , and a deposit , and a perfect credit rating , ” she noted .
We also spoke with Tina about the precarious economic situation confronting working people in the US as a whole .
She lamented the impossibility of saving up the three months worth of living expenses that every person is “ supposed ” to have for an emergency situation “ especially if you ’re on a limited budget , if you ’re on a fixed income . ”
She added , “ 52 percent of working Americans are one paycheck away from being homeless . ”
As voters in 23 states head to polls or caucuses today to pick their party ’s presidential candidate , local election officials around the country are bracing for a long , exhausting night and an array of unpredictable factors that might prevent some states from reporting final tallies until early Wednesday morning .
Although no one is predicting serious problems , many voting officials acknowledge that they could happen .
Isolated problems were already cropping up as polls opened this morning .
In New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine was scheduled to vote shortly after 6 a.m. when his polling station in Hoboken opened , but he had to wait for nearly an hour because two of the voting machines were not working properly .
One machine was fixed after 45 minutes , but about a dozen voters were turned away in the meantime .
Voting officials there also did not have provisional ballots on hand as a backup .
By 7:15 a.m. , the governor was able to cast his ballot .
A spokeswoman for Sequoia Voting Systems , the maker of the machines used at the polling station , said that the problem was caused by errors made by poll workers , not by a machine malfunction .
Several states are expecting a higher than usual turnout , which could increase bottlenecks in precincts with too few voting machines .
The growing popularity of absentee voting is also contributing to possible delays because the ballots take more time to process and often arrive at the last minute .

The Clinton campaign woke up with a big case of the I - told - you - so’s .
A Michigan poll from Lansing - based polling outfit EPIC - MRA shows 78 percent of Michigan voters think the country is on the wrong track , 42 percent think the economy is the most important issue in the election , 75 of the country has a negative estimation of how the President has performed , and oh yeah , eight to ten percent plan to vote for Nader .
The polls shows these general election match - up results :
McCain 46 % , Clinton 37 % , Nader 10 %
Obama 43 % , McCain 41 % , Nader 8 %
Michigan is a battleground in November , and the Dems ca n’t afford to lose eight to ten percent to Nader .
In 2000 , Nader took two percent in Michigan .
In 2004 , it was one percent .
It ’s possible that voter dissatisfaction with the Democrats , who do not plan on using the results of the Michigan primary , will push McCain over the edge .
Especially if homestater Mitt Romney is his VP pick .
Michigan ’s 17 electoral votes are n’t a foregone conclusion , of course .
Obama beats McCain in the poll , and a lot of angry Democrats will “ come home ” to the Democratic nominee before election day .
But if the Democrats are n’t going to heed the Clinton campaign ’s ( admittedly self - serving ) advice to hold a do - over in Michigan , the nominee is going to have to do a lot of make - up work there .
I am not sure what was the worse part of this week .
Living in Lebanon ?
Or reading the outrageous words of George Bush ?
Several times , I have asked myself this question : have words lost their meaning ?
So let 's start with lunch at the Cocteau restaurant in Beirut .
Yes , it 's named after Jean Cocteau , and it is one of the chicest places in town .
Magnificent flowers on the table , impeccable service , wonderful food .
Yes , there was shooting at Sodeco – 20 yards away – the day before ; yes , we were already worried about the virtual collapse of the Lebanese government , the humiliation of Sunni Muslims ( and the Saudis ) in the face of what we must acknowledge as a Hizbollah victory ( do n't expect George Bush to understand this ) and the danger of more street shooting .
But I brought up the tiny matter of the little massacre in northern Lebanon in which 10 or 12 militiamen were captured and then murdered before being handed over to the Lebanese army .
Their bodies were – I fear this is correct – mutilated after death .
" They deserved it , " the elegant woman on my left said .
I was appalled , overwhelmed , disgusted , deeply saddened .
How could she say such a thing ?
But this is Lebanon and a huge number of people – 62 by my count – have been killed in the past few days and all the monsters buried in the mass graves of the civil war have been dug up .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
I chose escalope du veau at the Cocteau – I am sickened by how quickly I decided on it – and tried to explain to my dear Lebanese friends ( and they are all dear to me ) how much fury I have witnessed in Lebanon .
When Abed drove me up to the north of the country three days ago , bullets were spitting off the walls of Tripoli and one of the customs officials at the Syrian border asked me to stay with him and his friends because they were frightened .
I did .
They are OK .
But being from the wrong religion is suddenly crucial again .
Who your driver is , what is the religion of your landlord , is suddenly a matter of immense importance .
Yesterday morning ( and here I will spoil the story by telling the end of it ) , the schools reopened round my seafront apartment and I saw a woman in a hijab riding a bicycle down the Corniche and I took a call from my travel agent about my next trip to Europe – Beirut airport reopened – and I realised that Lebanon had " returned to normal " .
The roads were open again ; the hooded gunmen had disappeared ; the government had abandoned its confrontation with Hizbollah – the suspension of the Shia Muslim security chief at the airport ( who bought me a bottle of champagne a year ago , I seem to remember – some Hizbollah " agent " he ! ) and the abandonment of the government 's demand to dismantle Hizbollah 's secret telecommunication system was a final seal of its failure – and I opened my newspaper and what did I read ?
That George Bush declared in Jerusalem that " al - Qa'ida , Hizbollah and Hamas will be defeated , as Muslims across the region recognise the emptiness of the terrorists ' vision and the injustice of their cause " .
Where does the madness end ?
Where do words lose their meaning ?
Al - Qa'ida is not being defeated .
Hizbollah has just won a domestic war in Lebanon , as total as Hamas 's war in Gaza .
Afghanistan and Iraq and Lebanon and Gaza are hell disasters – I need no apology to quote Churchill 's description of 1948 Palestine yet again – and this foolish , stupid , vicious man is lying to the world yet again .
He holds a " closed door " meeting with Lord Blair of Kut al - Amara – a man stupendously unfit to run any Middle East " peace " , which is presumably why the meeting had to be " closed door " – but tells the world of the blessings of Israeli democracy .
As if the Palestinians benefit from a democracy which is continuing to take from them the land which they have owned for generations .
Do we really have to accept this ?
Bush tells us that " we consider it a source of shame that the United Nations routinely passes more human rights resolutions against the freest democracy in the Middle East than any other nation in the world " .
The truth is that it is a source of shame that the United States continues to give unfettered permission to Israel to steal Palestinian land – which is why it should be a source of shame ( to Washington ) that the UN passes human rights resolutions against America 's only real ally in the region .
And what is Washington doing in the country where I live ?
It has sent one of its top generals to see the Lebanese army commander , signalling – a growing Fisk suspicion , this – that it has abandoned its support for the Lebanese government .
The Americans promise more equipment for the Lebanese army .
Yes , always more equipment , more guns , more bullets to the Middle Eastern armies though – I have to say yet again ( and I repeat that I do not like armies ) – the Lebanese army saved us all this week .
Its commander - in - chief , General Michel Sleiman , will become the next president and the Americans will support him and feel safe , as they always do , with a general in charge .
" Chehabism " , as the Lebanese would say , has returned .
But I am not so sure .
Sleiman gets on well with Damascus .
He is not going to lead his soldiers into a pro-American war against Hizbollah .
And the Lebanese are not going to join Bush 's insane " jihad " against the " world terror " .
There was a lovely moment in northern Lebanon this week – and here a big cheer for my brave friend Abed – when a Lebanese soldier at a checkpoint spotted me in our car and ran into the road .
" You are Mr Robert ! " he shouted .
" I have seen you on television !
I read your book ! "
And he gave the thumbs - up sign .
And I had to like this man .
And I think he will fight for Lebanon .
But I do not think he will fight for the Americans .

All Power to the President Though little discussed on the campaign trail , a crucial issue to be decided in November is whether the United States will return to its traditions as a constitutional Republic respecting “ unalienable ” human rights or whether it will finish a transformation into a frightened nation governed by an all - powerful President who can do whatever he wants during the open - ended “ war on terror . ”

That reality was underscored on April 1 with the release of a five - year - old legal opinion from former Justice Department official John Yoo asserting that President George W. Bush possessed nearly unlimited authority as Commander in Chief , including the power to have military interrogators abuse terror suspects .
While most news coverage of Yoo ’s March 14 , 2003 , memo has focused on the legal gymnastics justifying harsh treatment of detainees – including possible use of mind - altering drugs – the centerpiece of Yoo ’s argument is that at a time of war the President ’s powers are essentially unfettered .
Yoo ’s memo fits with views expressed by Bush ( “ The Decider ” ) and many of his top legal advisers .
Yoo ’s opinion also appears to be shared by four conservative Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court – John Roberts , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – just one vote shy of a majority .
Yoo ’s military interrogation memo – and a similar one he penned for the CIA on torture – were withdrawn by Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith after he succeeded Yoo as the top official at the Justice Department ’s powerful Office of Legal Counsel later in 2003 .
Goldsmith considered
Yoo ’s legal reasoning flawed .
But Goldsmith subsequently was pushed out of the job , and Bush is seeking to fill the vacancy with Steven Bradbury , who signed off on Yoo ’s “ torture memos ” while holding a lower position in the Office of Legal Counsel .
In other words , Bush has not given up on his vision of grandiose presidential powers that let him act more like an English monarch before the Magna Carta , who could pick out anyone under his domain and throw the person into prison with no due process and no protection against torture or other abuse .
Under the Bush - Yoo theories , all Bush has to do is pronounce a detainee “ an unlawful enemy combatant ” – whether a U.S. citizen or not , whether there is any credible evidence or not – and the person loses all human rights .
As radical – and as shocking – as these theories may seem to many Americans , Bush is within one vote on the U.S. Supreme Court of having his vision enshrined as “ constitutional . ”
One More Vote
If one more vacancy occurs among the five “ non-imperial ” justices – and the replacement is in line with Roberts - Scalia - Thomas - and - Alito – the U.S. Constitution could be effectively altered to eliminate key individual liberties – from habeas corpus and other fair - trial rights to bans on “ cruel and unusual ” punishment to protections against self - incrimination and “ unreasonable searches and seizures . ”
Though civics books tell us that the Constitution can only be amended by two - thirds votes of the House and Senate and approval by three - quarters of the states , the reality is that five ideologues on the U.S. Supreme Court can alter the nation ’s founding document by simply voting as a bloc .
And since the “ war on terror ” is unlike other wars – in that the enemy is vaguely defined , the duration could be forever and the war 's location can be anywhere – the Bush - Yoo logic suggests that the de facto suspension of the American constitutional Republic is not just a short - term emergency measure .
Instead , the shift from a Republic , with legal protections of individual rights , to an Empire , led by an Executive who can operate without any constraints , would be permanent .
As long as the President says some danger lurks out there , he or she could assert “ plenary ” – or total – powers as commander in chief .
In his memo , Yoo argued that the 9/11 attacks “ triggered ” America ’s “ right to self - defense . ”
Therefore , he wrote : “ If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al - Qaeda terrorist network .
“ In that case , we believe that he could argue that the Executive Branch ’s constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . ”
Yoo further argued that even abuses that would “ shock the conscience ” – one of Bush ’s standards for what might be considered torture – could be mitigated by a subjective evaluation of the circumstances .
In other words , if the President or a subordinate judged the detainee to represent some imminent threat or to be particularly odious , they would have an even freer hand to act as they saw fit .
Those judgments about shocking the conscience would be left , again , to the Executive to decide unilaterally .
Yoo ’s two memos were the underpinnings of the Bush administration ’s treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Abu Ghraib and the CIA ’s secret detention facilities .
The memos gave legal protection to U.S. interrogators and guards who stripped detainees naked , hooded them , put ladies underpants on their heads , paraded them in the nude , beat them , subjected them to extremes of hot and cold , put them into painful stress positions , deprived them of sleep , threatened them with death and – in three acknowledged cases – flooded their covered faces with water in a simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
[ For more details , see Neck Deep : The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush . ]
Shielding Abuses
Yoo ’s memos shielded interrogators from U.S. military intelligence and the CIA , but did not spare the night guards at Abu Ghraib , who got stiff prison terms after they made the cardinal mistake of photographing the humiliation they inflicted on Iraqi detainees and letting the pictures reach the public .
In a comment to the Washington Post , Thomas J. Romig , who was the Army ’s judge advocate general in 2003 , said Yoo ’s military interrogation memo appears to argue that there are no rules in a time of war , a concept that Romig said he found “ downright offensive . ”
[ Washington Post , April 2 , 2008 ]
But the greater legacy from
Yoo – who is now a professor of law at the University of California in Berkeley – and his imperial legal theories is that they have been embraced by many Bush supporters and four right - wing Supreme Court justices .
Though Bush may not get another chance to further shape the Supreme Court with the appointment of another Roberts or Alito , his successor likely will .
For some Americans angered by Bush ’s assault on the Constitution , John McCain ’s past support for Bush ’s judicial appointments may represent one of the strongest reasons to vote against him .
The future of the American Republic may be at stake .
Besides undergirding the abuses at Guatanamo and Abu Ghraib , the Bush - Yoo theories have laid the groundwork for ending a noble experiment in human liberty that the Founders began more than 230 years ago – with their defiant declaration that no leader is above the law and that everyone possesses “ unalienable rights ” under the law .

Tonight on his show , Keith Olbermann eviscerated Hillary Clinton for a good ten minutes for promoting John McCain ’s presidency over her fellow Democrats .
He compared her to Joe Lieberman .
He asked “ is she equating her time in the East Wing with McCain ’s time in the Hanoi Hilton ? ”
You have got to watch these videos .
They ’re devastating in only the way that Keith can be .

T his article reviews two police state tools ( among many in use ) in America .
One is new , undiscussed and largely unknown to the public .
The other was covered in a December article by this writer called Police State America .
Here it ’s updated with new information .
The National Applications Office ( NAO )
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) established a new domestic spying operation in 2007 called the National Applications Office ( NOA ) and described it as “ the executive agent to facilitate the use of intelligence community technological assets for civil , homeland security and law enforcement purposes within the United States . ”
The office was to begin operating last fall to “ build on the long - standing work of the Civil Applications Committee ( CAC ) , which was created in 1974 to facilitate the use of the capabilities of the intelligence community for civil , non-defense uses in the United States . ”
With or without congressional authorization or oversight , the executive branch is in charge and will let NAO use state - of - the - art technology , including military satellite imagery , to spy on Americans without their knowledge .
Implementation is delayed , however , after Committee on Homeland Security Chairman , Bennie Thompson , and other committee members raised questions of “ very serious privacy and civil liberties concerns . ”
In response , DHS agreed to delay operating ( officially ) until all matters are addressed and resolved .
Given its track record post - 9/11 , expect little more than pro forma posturing before Congress signs off on what Kate Martin , the director of the Center for National Security Studies , calls “ Big Brother in the Sky ” and a “ police state ” in the offing .
DHS supplies this background information on NAO .
Post - 9/11 , the Director of National Intelligence appointed an Independent Study Group ( ISG ) in May , 2005 to “ review the current operation and future role of the ( 1974 ) Civil Applications Committee and study the current state of Intelligence Community support to homeland security and law enforcement entities . ”
In September 2005 , the Committee produced a “ Blue Ribbon Study , ” now declassified .
Its nine members were headed by and included three Booz Allen Hamilton officials because of the company ’s expertise in spying and intelligence gathering .
Its other members have similar experience .
They all have a vested interest in domestic spying because the business potential is huge for defense related industries and consultants .
ISG members included :
Keith Hall , Chairman
Vice President , Booz Allen Hamilton
Edward G. Anderson

The ISG ’s report produced 11 significant findings and 27 recommendations based on its conclusion that there ’s “ an urgent need for action because opportunities to better protect the nation are being missed . ”
It “ concluded a new management and process model ( is ) needed to effectively employ IC ( Intelligence Community ) capabilities for domestic uses . ”
In March 2006 , DHS unveiled the new agency to implement ISG ’s recommendations called the National Applications Office .
In May , 2007 , Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) , Michael McConnell , named DHS as its executive agent and functional manager .
At least in principle according to DHS , Congress agreed with this approach and to provide funding for it , beginning in the fall of 2007 .
The public knew nothing about this until a feature August 15 , 2007 Wall Street Journal story broke the news .
It was headlined “ US to Expand Use of Spy Satellites . ”
It noted that for the first time the nation ’s top intelligence official ( DNI ’s McConnell ) “ greatly expanded the range of federal and local ( civilian law enforcement agencies that ) can get access to ” military spy satellite collected information .
Until now , civilian use was restricted to agencies like NASA and the US Geological Survey , and only for scientific and environmental study .
The Journal explained that key objectives under new guidelines will be :
— border security ,
— securing critical infrastructure and helping emergency responders after natural disasters ,
— working with criminal and civil federal , state , and local law enforcement agencies , and
— unmentioned by the Journal , the ability to spy on anyone , anywhere , anytime domestically for any reason – an unprecedented act using state - of - the - art technology enabling real - time , high - resolution images and data from space .
NAO will also oversee classified information from the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) and other US agencies involved in dealing with all aspects of national security , including “ terrorism . ”
NSA was established in 1952 , is super - secret , and for many years was never revealed to exist .
Today , its capabilities are awesome and worrisome .
It eavesdrops globally , mines a vast amount of data , and does it through a network of spy satellites , listening posts , and surveillance planes to monitor virtually all electronic communications from landline and cell phones , telegrams , emails , faxes , radio and television , data bases of all kinds and the internet .
NGA is new and began operating in 2003 .
It lets military and intelligence analysts monitor virtually anything or anyone from state - of - the - art spy satellites .
Both NSA and NGA coordinate jointly with the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) that designs , builds and operates military spy satellites .
It also analyzes military and CIA - collected aircraft and satellite reconnaissance information .
Combined with warrantless wiretapping , pervasive spying of all kinds , the abandonment of the law and checks and balances , intense secrecy , and an array of repressive post - 9/11 legislation , Executive Orders and National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directives , NAO is another national security police state tool any despot would love .
It ’s now established and may be operating without congressional approval .
Using spy satellites domestically “ is largely uncharted territory , ” as the Wall Street Journal noted .
Even its architects admit there ’s no clarity on this , and the ISG ’s report stated “ There is little if any policy , guidance or procedures regarding the collection , exploitation and dissemination of domestic MASINT ( Measurement and Signatures Intelligence ) . ”
The Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) is the main DOD spy agency .
It manages MASINT that ’s ultra-secret and sophisticated .
It uses state - of - the - art radar , lasers , infrared sensors , electromagnetic data and other technologies that can detect chemicals , electro - magnetic activity , whether a nuclear power plant produces plutonium , and the type vehicle from its exhaust .
It can also see under bridges , through clouds , forest canopies and even concrete to create images and collect data .
In addition , it can detect people , activity and weapons that satellites and photo - reconnaissance aircraft miss , so it ’s an invaluable spy tool but highly intrusive and up to now only for military and foreign intelligence work .
Further , military spy satellites are state - of - the - art and superior to civilian ones .
They record in color as well as black and white , use different parts of the light spectrum to track human activities and ground movements and can detect chemical weapons traces and people - generated heat in buildings .
This much we know about them .
Their full potential is top secret and available only to the military and intelligence community .
The Journal quoted an alarmed Gregory Nojeim , senior counsel and director of the Project on Freedom , Security and Technology , that advocates for digital age privacy rights saying : “ Not only is the surveillance they are contemplating intrusive and omnipresent , it ’s also invisible .
And that ’s what makes this so dangerous . ”
Anyone for any reason may be watched at all times ( through walls ) with no way to know it , but a June 2001 ( before 9/11 ) Supreme Court decision offers hope .
In Kyllo v. United States , the Court ruled for petitioner 5 to 4 ( with Scalia and Thomas in the majority ) .
It voided a conviction based on police use of thermal imaging to detect heat in his triplex to determine if an illegal drug was being grown , in this case marijuana .
The Court held : “ Where , as here , the Government uses a device that is not in general public use , to explore details of a private home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion , the surveillance is a Fourth Amendment ‘ search , ” and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant … .
To withdraw protection of this minimum expectation would be to permit police technology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment ” protecting against “ unreasonable searches and seizures . ”
In 1981 , Ronald Reagan seemed to agree in Executive Order 12333 on United States Intelligence Activities .
It bars the intelligence community from most forms of home eavesdropping while providing wide latitude to all government agencies to “ provide the President and the National Security Council with the necessary information ( needed to ) conduct ….
foreign , defense and economic policy ( and protect US ) national interests from foreign security threats .
( Collecting this information is to be done , however , ) consistent with the Constitution and applicable law… . ”
That was then , and this is now .
It ’s hard imagining congressional concern or DHS meaning that NAO will “ prioritize the protection of privacy and civil liberties ” and citing the Reagan Executive Order and the 1974 Privacy Act .
That law mandates that no government agency “ shall disclose any record ( or ) system of records by any means of communication to any person , or to another agency , except pursuant to a written request , or with the prior written consent of , the individual to whom the record pertains . ”
The Privacy act requires the US government to maintain an administrative and physical security system to prevent the unauthorized release of personal records .
Post - 9/11 , the Patriot Act ended that protection , so DHS is shameless saying NAO must comply with civil liberties and privacy laws and be subject to “ oversight by the DHS Inspector General , Chief Privacy Officer , and the Officer for Civil Rights and Liberties ” plus additional oversight .
No longer post - 9/11 when the national security state got repressive new tools to erode the constitution , ignore democratic principles , and give the President unrestricted powers in the name of national security .
NAO is the latest one watching us as our “ Big Brother in the Sky . ”
Orwell would be proud .
Real ID Act Update – Another Intrusive Police State Tool
The Read ID Act of 2005 required states to meet federal ID standards by May , 2008 .
That ’s now changed because 29 states passed or introduced laws that refuse to comply .
They call the Act costly to administer , a bureaucratic nightmare , and New Hampshire said it ’s “ repugnant ” and violates the state and US Constitutions .
The federal law mandates that every US citizen and legal resident have a national ID card that in most cases is a driver ’s license meeting federal standards .
It requires it to contain an individual ’s personal information and makes one mandatory to open a bank account , board an airplane , be able to vote , get a job , enter a federal building , or conduct virtually all essential business requiring identification .
States balked , and that doomed the original version .
On January 11 , changes were unveiled when the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) issued binding new rules .
Under them , states have until 2011 to comply ( instead of 2008 ) , until 2014 to issue “ tamper - proof licenses ” to drivers born after 1964 , and until 2017 for those born before this date .
DHS said the original law would cost states $ 14 billion .
The new regulations with an extended phase - in cuts the amount to around $ 3.9 billion or $ 8 per license .
These numbers may be bogus , however , the true costs may be far higher , and that ’s why the Information Technology Association of America ( ITAA ) is lobbying for Real ID ’s passage .
Its members include high - tech card makers like Digimarc and Northrup Grumman and data brokers like Choicepoint and LexisNexis that profit by selling personal information to advertisers and the government .
Under new DHS rules , licenses must include a digital photo taken at the beginning of the application process and a filament or other security device to prevent counterfeiting .
They must also have three layers of security that states can select from a DHS menu .
In addition , states must begin checking license applicants ’ Social Security and immigration status over the next year .
As of now , a controversial radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology microchip is n’t required .
It may come later , however , and here ’s the problem .
It ’ll let cardholder movements and activities be tracked everywhere , at all times – in other words , a police state dream along with other pervasive spying tools .
Even worse would be mandating human RFID chip implants .
It ’s not planned so far ( but not ruled out ) , and three states ( California , Wisconsin and North Dakota ) preemptively banned the practice without recipients ’ consent .
Think it ca n’t happen ?
Consider a January 13 article in the London Independent headlined “ Prisoners ‘ to be chipped like dogs . ’ ” The article states that civil rights groups and probation officers are furious that “ hi - tech ‘ satellite ’ ….
machine - readable ( microchip ) tagging ( is ) planned ( for thousands of offenders ) to create more space in jails . ”
Unlike ankle bracelets now sometimes used , tiny RFID chips would be surgically implanted for monitoring the way they ’re currently used for dogs , cats , cattle and luggage .
They ’re more reliable , it ’s believed , as current devices can be tampered with or removed .
Ken Jones , president of the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) , was quoted saying : “ We have looked at …. the practicalities and the ethics ( and we concluded ) its time has come . ”
The UK currently has the largest prison population per capita in western Europe .
It sounds like authorities plan to expand it using fewer cells .
It also sounds like a scheme to tag everyone after testing them first on prisoners .
And consider the possibilities .
RFID technology is advancing , and one company plans deeper implants that can vibrate , emit electroshocks , broadcast a message to the implantee , and / or be a hidden microphone to transmit conversations .
It ’s not science fiction , and what ’s planned for the UK will likely come to America .
In fact , it ’s already here .
In 2004 , the FDA approved a grain - of - rice sized , antenna - containing VeriChip for human implantation that allows vital information to be read when a person ’s body is scanned .
The company states on its web site that it ’s “ the world ’s first and only patented , FDA - cleared , human - implantable RFID microchip …. with skin-sensing capabilities . ”
Reportedly , about 2000 test subjects now have them , but it may signal mandatory implantation ahead .
Consider for whom for starters – prisoners , military personnel and possibly anyone seeking employment .
After them , maybe everyone in a brave new global surveillance world .
It gets worse .
Katherine Albrecht authored a report called “ Microchip - Cancer Report – Microchip - Induced Tumors in Laboratory Rodents and Dogs : A Review of the Literature 1990 - 2006 . ”
After reading it , Dr. Robert Benezra , Director Cancer Biology , Genetics Program , Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center said : “ There ’s no way in the world , having read this information , that I would have one of those chips implanted in my skin , or in one of my family members .
Given the preliminary animal data , it looks to me that there ’s definitely cause for concern . ”
Albrecht ’s report evaluated 11 previously published toxicology and pathology studies .
In six of them , up to 10.2 % of rats and mice developed malignant tumors ( typically sarcomas ) where microchips were implanted .
Two others reported the same findings for dogs .
These tumors spread fast and “ often led to the death of the afflicted animals .
In many cases , the tumors metastasized and spread to other parts of the animals .
The implants were unequivocally identified as the cause of the cancers . ”
Report reviews , conclusions and recommendations were to immediately stop further human implantations , inform people with them of the dangers , offer a microchip removal procedure , and reverse all animal microchipping mandates .
Debate Ahead on New DHS ID Rules
DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff said new ID rules require states to verify each cardholder ’s personal information ( including a person ’s legal status in the country ) by matching it against federal Social Security and passport databases and / or comparable state ones .
States have time to adjust , but Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy wasted no time saying he ’ll recommend legislation to ban Real ID drivers ’ license provisions because “ so many Americans oppose ” them .
They ’re intrusive , burdensome , and federal databases are full of false or out - of - date information that ’s hard to disprove , but unless it is Americans will be denied their legal right to a driver ’s license .
The ACLU also strongly opposes Real ID because it violates privacy , lets government agencies share data , and its “ tortured remains ” represent an “ utterly unworkable ” system that will “ irreparably damage the fabric of American life . ”
An ACLU January 11 press release further states that DHS “ dumped the problems of the statute on future presidents like a rotting corpse left on ( its ) steps ( and ) whoever is president in 2018 . ”
Congress must “ recognize the situation and take action . ”
The Real ID Act and new DHS rules must be “ repealed and replaced with a clean , simple , and vigorous new driver ’s license security law that does not create a national ID ” or violate Americans ’ privacy .
Futuristic Hi-Tech Profiling
On January 14 , Computerworld online revealed more cause for concern in an article called “ Big Brother Really is Watching . ”
It ’s about DHS “ bankrolling futuristic profiling technology …. ” for its Project Hostile Intent .
It , in turn , is part of a broader initiative called the Future Attribute Screening Technologies Mobile Module .
It ’s to be a self - contained , automated screening system that ’s portable and easy to implement , and DHS hopes to test it at airports in 2010 and deploy it ( if it works ) by 2012 at airports , border checkpoints , other points of entry and other security - related areas .
Here ’s the problem .
If developed ( reliable or not ) , these devices will use video , audio , laser and infrared sensors to feed real - time data into a computer using “ specially developed algorithms ” to identify “ suspicious people . ”
It would work ( in theory ) by interpreting gestures , facial expressions and speech variations as well as measure body temperature , heart and respiration rate , blood pressure , skin moisture , and other physiological characteristics .
The idea would be detect deception and identify suspicious people for aggressive interrogation , searches and even arrest .
But consider what ’s coming .
If developed , the technology may be used anywhere by government or the private sector for airport or other checkpoint security , buildings , job interviews , employee screening , buying insurance or conducting any other type essential business .
Aside from Fourth Amendment issues , here ’s the problem according to Bruce Schneier , chief technology officer at security consultant BT Counterpane : “ It ’s a good idea fraught with difficulties …. do n’t hold your breath ” it will work , and a better idea is to focus on detecting suspicious objects .
Schneier further compares the technology to lie detectors that rely on “ fake technology ” and only work in films .
They ’re used because people want them although it ’s acknowledged , even when well - administered , their median accuracy percentage is 50 % at best .
This technology is worse , it may never be reliable , but may be deployed anyway in the age of “ terror . ”
Something to consider next time we blink going through airport security , and ACLU Technology and Liberty Project director Barry Steinhardt states the concern : “ We are not going to catch any terrorists ( with it ) , but a lot of innocent people , especially racial and ethnic minorities , are going to be trapped in a web of suspicion . ”
Even so , DHS spent billions on this and other screening tools post - 9/11 .
Expect lots more ahead , and here ’s the bottom line :
As things now stand , Washington , post - 9/11 , suspended constitutional protections in the name of national security and suppressed our civil liberties for our own good .
This article reviewed their newest tools and wonders what ’s next .
This writer called it Police State America in December that wo n’t change with a new White House occupant in 2009 unless organized resistance stops it .
Complacency is unthinkable , and unless we act , we ’ll deserve Aleksandr Herzen ’s curse of another era – to be the “ disease , ” not the “ doctors . ”
Hear John Gibson Mocking Heath Ledger 's Death ( Audio )
Fox News hostis at the center of a media storm after mocking actor 's death on his radio show .
Gibson started his show with funeral music and clips from Ledger 's movie " Brokeback Mountain , " including the famous quote " I wish I knew how to quit you , " to which he responded " Eh , well he found out how to quit you . "
The radio show host continued with more callous , insensitive remarks , including calling the actor a " weirdo , " playing another clip from the film in which Ledger said " We 're dead , " then following with " We 're dead " in a mocking tone .
Gibson jokingly brought up Ledger 's death while discussing current events , making comments such as " Maybe he had a serious position in the market , " and " I think he watched the Clinton - Obama debate last night .
I think he was an Edwards guy , cause he saw his Edwards guy was just completely irrelevant . "

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr threatened on Tuesday to end a truce he imposed on his militia last year , raising the prospect of worsening violence on a day when top U.S. officials testified on Iraq in Washington .
The U.S. commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , told a Senate panel he was recommending a 45 - day pause in troop cuts after July when an initial drawdown is completed .
He said he would then decide over time when to recommend more reductions .
His comments suggest Washington will still have some 140,000 troops in Iraq in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November , roughly the same number as before reinforcements were sent in early 2007 to halt Iraq ’s slide into civil war .
The Mehdi Army militia ceasefire had been credited with helping to sharply reduce violence across Iraq .
Scrapping the truce could trigger widespread fighting with security forces and plunge Iraq back into a deadly spiral of sectarian violence .
Sadr ’s warning came a day after Shi’ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki threatened to bar the cleric ’s movement from political life unless he disbanded the militia , which has fought fresh battles with Iraqi and U.S. forces in the past two weeks .
“ The Iraqi government should know that the Mehdi Army will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Iraqi people to provide all they need from security , stability and independence , ” Sadr said in a statement sent to his offices across Iraq .
“ If it is required to lift the freeze ( ceasefire ) in order to carry out our goals , objectives , doctrines and religious principles and patriotism , we will do that later . ”
American and Iraqi troops clashed with gunmen in the cleric ’s Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City for a third day running on Tuesday , part of an upsurge in fighting in the capital .
Hospital officials in the slum said 13 people had been killed and 140 wounded .
That takes the death toll in Sadr City from three days of clashes to nearly 50 .
Across Iraq , 11 U.S. soldiers have been killed since Sunday .
An Iraqi cameraman working for Reuters in Sadr City was lightly wounded by shrapnel in what witnesses said was a U.S. air strike in the slum on Tuesday .
Lieutenant - Colonel Steven Stover , a U.S. military spokesman , said four Hellfire missiles were fired at gunmen and mortar crews in Sadr City in three separate air strikes .
CURFEW ON BAGHDAD
The government imposed a one - day curfew on the capital for Wednesday -- the fifth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad -- but gave no reason .
Sadr , a fiery cleric who was once an ally of Maliki , had called for a big anti-U.S. march in Baghdad on that day but cancelled it for fear his followers would be attacked .

Sadr urged his Mehdi Army to “ continue your jihad and resistance ” against U.S. forces , although he did not spell out if this was an explicit call for attacks on American soldiers .
Despite the more than 7 - month - old ceasefire , Sadr ’s followers have clashed with Iraqi troops and U.S. forces in the south of the country and Baghdad in the past two weeks in the country ’s worst violence since the first half of 2007 .
Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih told CNN television the government was cracking down on “ armed gangs ” and was not specifically targeting Sadr ’s followers .
“ We do not want to get into a confrontation with the Sadr movement , ” Salih said .
In Washington , Petraeus said security gains in Iraq were “ fragile and reversible ” .
Petraeus said that after five extra combat brigades had left Iraq by July he would “ undertake a 45 - day period of consolidation and evaluation ” .
But he declined to estimate how many U.S. troops would be in Iraq at the end of 2008 .
Iraq ’s government had no objection to the pause , spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said .
“ The Iraqi government thinks Petraeus ’s decision is correct , ” he told Reuters .
The United States is withdrawing about 20,000 combat troops from Iraq through July .
It has 160,000 troops in Iraq now .
Maliki ordered a crackdown on militias two weeks ago in the southern city of Basra , provoking widespread clashes .
That fighting ebbed just over a week ago when Sadr ordered his Mehdi Army off the streets , but picked up again last Sunday with clashes around Sadr City .

Journalists were ( and still are ) embedded in the US military forces in Iraq .
But it was also the other way round : the Pentagon proves to be far more embedded in the US media than the public was to know .
How one thing lead to another :
In spring 2006 , several retired US generals started to speak up against the - then - US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld 's handling of the Iraq war , calling for his resignation .
In a desperate counteroffensive , the Pentagon called in the support of its " media embedded army " of military retirees hired by the US media as " analysts " .
This was done in such a flagrant way ignoring any sense for honesty and decency , that a number of the so - called analysts spoke up and opened up an even bigger can of worms :
They revealed just how much the Pentagon had a grip on the media , where retirees eating out of the Rumsfeld 's hand repeatedly used US government issued talking points as their own " expert " opinion , adding direct credibility to misinformation the Pentagon was spreading .

You have to see this New York Times video , which baffled me .
This all reminds me of what I wrote in this post :
" Even if you feel helpless in the power of people whose un - true intentions are obvious to you , trust that bad luck will turn against them , one day ... "
The sex meme is the ruler of the Internet .
It violates inboxes faster than a drunken Hasselhoff , makes the blog rounds faster than Brit - Brit 's latest upskirt shot , and goes viral faster than a new media marketer 's MySpace wet dream .
Sex memes are the ultimate in trendy , often sexually explicit and wrong - ironic — or just plain wrong .
You wo n't see them in Time 's top 10 lists , that 's for sure .
This year has been a crazed year for the sex meme , and while I 'm as supportive of animal - and cruelty - free dildos , harnesses , lubes and whips as the next San Franciscan , Vegansexuality 's wacky , tofu- licking babes and their PETA - approved new boobs are so two years ago .
Last year , I compiled a ribald list for Boing Boing but this year 's fresh batch of memes are ready for prime time , even though they 're mostly not safe for work ( NSFW ) and in at least one case , not safe for anyone seeking to avoid post - goatse PTSD .
Unsafe , yet as irresistible as slowing down to look at a car wreck ... the sex memes of 2007 :
1. Celebrity sex tapes that go straight to DVD .
I hate to ruin porn for you , because I know it 's so believable and realistic .
But those girls that get " picked up on the street " or solicited for " first time " on - camera sex are working for companies that have to abide by federal record - keeping laws surrounding documentation and contractual information .
But we can pretend it 's never , ever a planned setup — that 's cool .
I 'm also sure that celebrities like Paris Hilton and Colin Farrell never saw it coming and are just victims of a ruthless porn - hungry populace .
And I wo n't break the part to you about porn " lesbians " not ever celebrating Pride .
Because I care about you , really .
But this year 's C - list " leaked " celebrity sex videos got traffic even if they went straight to DVD , so on 2007 's scorecard of brokered " celeb " videos ( thanks to Fleshbot.
com 's reporting support , you can find stories on many of these memes and much more on its very NSFW site ) :
Winner for most obvious : one - time " American Idol " finalist Jessica Sierra making sandwiches with some dude ( her " leaked " video got its own Web site , jshardcore.com , on launch and had pre-publicity on TMZ ) .
Oh no !
Her career was so promising .
" Amy Fisher : Caught on Tape " was n't as deliberately marketed as Sierra 's — I can't remember whether the " Long Island Lolita " threatened legal action for real or just threatened to shoot someone in the face , but her porn dialogue and stock porn positions and posing suggest that she was the only one looking to get shot in the face when all was said and , er , done .
Kim Kardashian :
If C-listers had backup dancers , Kardashian would have been a contender — until she rode the " celeb sex tape " pony .
She never shot anyone in the face , that I know of , but her unforgettable , much blogged shrieking voice mail was the stuff of legend , suggesting she did not go gently into that C - list celebrity sex tape DVD night .
Deliberate or not , it made her straight - to - DVD humpfest the best selling " celebrity " porn vid of the year ( and it had its own pre-release Web site at kimksuperstar.com ) , after which she released an exercise video and landed an E !
Channel reality show , " Keeping Up With the Kardashians . "
2. Pussy shots : the G - shot and the HPV vaccine .
I do n't care what gender or orientation you are , the much - discussed G- Shot should just make you cross your legs and cry silent tears in vaginal sympathy for all the women who sought to enhance their sex drive with — you guessed it , a dubiously effective ( and dubiously safe ) injection right into that place you never want to think of getting a shot .
And I do n't mean your eye , snarky - pants .
It 's most discomforting to see that vaginal surgery continues to grow in popularity .
Girls , do n't cut the ladybits if you want them to work , m'kay ?
But , a magic shot for pussies one way or another was on everyone 's RSS this year :
The G - Shot , driven by vaginal cosmetic hyperbole proponents , and the still controversial and endlessly Internetted , yet hopeful HPV vaccine .
Sure , there 's Caverject ( shudder ) , but I think the only P - Shot I 'll be seeing will be served off some queen 's hotpants at Trannyshack , if you know what I mean .
3 . " Two girls , one cup . "
Do not Google this .
Do not think about this .
Everyone blogged it , and it became the new " tubgirl " and goatse all in one disgusting moment of choco - poo - love , spawning ( ugh ) parody videos , animated reactions , and even a mention on VH1 .
Can be substituted for Trimspa as a means to curb hunger for the rest of your life .
4. Geek Squad grossness .
" Peeping geeks " sounds like something I 'd be really into , except that this year the people from Best Buy 's tech - assist department proved themselves to be a bunch of techtards too lame to get their porn online via Fleshbot.com or torrent like everyone else , and did some majorly douchey things to women in real life .
In April , a Geek Squad dingleberry was arrested and sued for leaving his phone camera on " record " while a client 's 22 - year - old daughter was showering when he was supposed to be working on her computer during a house call — then , making a case for vigilante justice , allegedly did the same trick with his phone in the bedroom of the woman 's 13 - year - old sister .
Ew .
But wait — then tech blog Consumerist caught Best Buy employees stealing porn off customer 's computers , even conspiring to steal explicit content from tech - unsavvy porn performer Jasmine Grey 's hard drive .
Consumerist reported that Geek Squadders scoured her network for porn and passed her images around to team members and management .
The plotting was only fully discovered when she died in a car crash days later , and one employee felt remorse .
5. Some BDSM dot - com bought some building .
Did anyone hear about this ?
I know , it was easy to miss .
Except that all of a sudden it was like the whole teensy bubble of mainstream media suddenly heard of consensual , above - board BDSM dot -coms , and that they did normal things like move into bigger digs .
When Kink.com bought the Mission Armory , it was like the rubber bullet heard ' round the world , and many MSM news weenies had the bestest non-story of the year .
6. Republican tease and denial hotness : Haggard , Vitter and Craig .
Gay tap - dancing came back in style , and public sex was ruined for everyone for the rest of our natural lives when Sen.
Larry Craig got busted for using 30 - year - old cruising code in an airport restroom — though the best part was watching TV anchors freakishly " re-enact " the scene , most notably with a woman holding a literal wall of figurative heterosexuality between the ABC - TV pundits caught in the homoerotic headlights like desperate het deer .
The Republican Craig survived allegations about coke and young male pages in 1982 ; he called Bill Clinton , " a nasty , bad , naughty boy , " he is anti-gay marriage , wo n't back gay hate crime bills and the LGBT Human Rights Campaign gave him a rating of zero .
Republican Sen. David Vitter loves the ladies ( especially when he pays them to do , um , things ) , he loves abstinence education almost more than the statute of limitations , and hates same - sex unions so much he compares them to Hurricane Katrina .
Still a popular meme this year : Former preacher Ted Haggard , um , really wanted to help homos find the light ( or fountain ) of his own personal Jesus so much he actually visited gay bars to do outreach .
Then in fall 2006 , like the others in this year 's sexual hypocrisy shortlist , got waaay caught .
All of which proves that the fine men in assless chaps at Folsom have nothing on these high - placed anti-sex pundits who clearly have the art of tease - and - denial down .
We really have a lot to learn here in San Francisco from these very sophisticated , if sloppy , pervs .
7. Wal - Mart wanker rolls back prices on everything he touches .
This is one of many reasons I 'm glad we do n't have a Wal - Mart in San Francisco , except that if I were really crafty , I could pay iJustine to shop the — well , pretty much any — aisle and catch Mr. Blue Light Special with his pants around his ankles and his right hand looking for discounts , and crank up my Web site 's traffic stats .
Truly , he may be saying " f- you " to corporate America on the most basic of levels , but the many videos of his , er , excellent Wal - Mart jack - off adventures ( which you can find at boinkology.com ) became even more unsettling for me when I thought I saw someone 's grandma shopping for socks in the background .
8. Crime and punishment memes .
Teens who photographed their own sex acts busted for child porn ; Substitute teacher Julie Amero faces up to 40 years prison time for porn pop-ups ( this is why schools need savvy tech departments ) ;
Guy attempts sex with a fence ; Woman gets kicked off plane for miniskirt ; And Mr. " Girls Gone Wild , " Joe Francis , is still in jail .
9 . The hand job machine : hard with a vengeance .
It 's not a new sex meme by any means , but every year blogs act like they 've never seen the Frankensteinian monster of male masturbation sex toys that is pretty much a mashup of a Kitchen Aid mixer ( setting : " pummel " ) and a ... disembodied hand .
But what made it the most viral year yet for this toy was the demo video ( it 's the first result at Fleshbot.com if you enter " hand job machine " into the search bar ) that burned through the blogs ( sex and otherwise ) — most notably for starring a naughty French ( Japanese ) maid and a hillbilly in a pink unitard .
10 . Booby - trapped Japanese dental school dummies .
The " Simroid " certainly was n't popular for her name ( or its unappetizing rhyming connotations ) , though it was totally pervily Internet famous for being an extremely life - like dental school model , in female form .
But what got her passed around the Internets like a cheap bottle of mouthwash were the warning sensors thoughtfully placed in her breasts , ostensibly to avoid improper conduct .
Leaving the rest of us wondering where else she had sensors , and if there are any male dummies in need of , ahem , root canals .

The man , thought to be from Birmingham , collapsed at a Swansea nightclub during the event at the end of a party to raise funds for an art exhibition .
Police say there are no suspicious circumstances following the incident at the city 's Monkey Cafe and Bar early on Friday .
The coroner has been informed and the family has been told .
It is believed attempts were made by staff and customers at the nightclub to revive the man .
In a statement , club owners Amanda Davey and Paul Dyke said : " We are all devastated by this tragic accident .
" We are all in shock .
" It was a tragic accident and very sad and should serve as a cautionary tale .
" Our deepest sympathy goes out to his family . "
A South Wales Police spokesman said : " There are no suspicious circumstances and a file is being prepared for the coroner . "

Next to “ Buy a Link Here ” , there it is : “ Ben Stein : Win His Career ” .
After seeing a new non-fiction film starring Comedy Central�s Ben Stein , you may not only be able to win his money , but also his career .
Stein is that whiny little guy with the monotone voice that makes him seem funny and an unlikely “ character ” for TV appearances .
But that career may be over come April 18 when a movie he co-wrote , narrates and appears in , called “ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , ” is released .
Directed by one Nathan Frankowski , “ Expelled ” is a sloppy , all - over - the - place , poorly made ( and not just a little boring ) “ expose ” of the scientific community .
It �s not very exciting .
But it does show that Stein , who�s carved out a career selling eye drops in commercials and amusing us on sitcoms , is either completely nuts or so avaricious that he�s abandoned all good sense to make a buck .
To wit : Stein , Frankowski and pals say in “ Expelled ” that perfectly good scientists and educators are being stigmatized for wanting to teach their students creationism and “ intelligent design ” � in other words , junk science � in addition to or instead of conventionally accepted Darwinism .
You see , Stein , like some other celebrities , finally has shown his true colors and they aren�t so pretty .
Finally , iPhone owners no longer have to mope around with a feeling of shame and embarrassment in their hearts : AT&T has blessed them with an " unlimited " calling plan .
That 's right , if you so desire ( and you do so desire , do n't you ? ) , you can latch a $ 119.99 all - you - can - eat plan onto your super - device .
Sure , it looks peachy , until you notice that despite your " unlimited " status , you still only get a measly 200 text messages , which is like a three - course steak dinner with no dessert .
At least you 'll never again have to end a conversation with Mom because you 're worried about overages -- though you 'll want to keep a close watch on those SMSs , since the prices seem to be constantly heading skyward [ Thanks , impuLsive ]

The arrogance of them !
By calling the Democratic party the " Democrat " party they 're wearing their political bias right on their sleeve .

Gee Folks , A good old - fashioned white collar fascist mafia - style threat .
The analysis of these fucked up boxes have been effectively rigged before it even starts .
How could we make it so there 's nobody to sue ?
Perhaps anonymous analysis of their " rigged to elect more fascists advantage system . "
This whole thing stinks and just pisses me off .
But you knew that already .
It 's so depressing that I do n't even want to post a response to this .
But if everyone is as depressed as I am hearing this then nobody will fucking do something about it .
Fuck Sequoia they have no fucking rights .
It 's OUR fucking constitution and OUR fucking vote and OUR fucking elections .
Not theirs .
These fucking fascists want to make CRIMINALS out of the white hat computer hackers .
The only right Sequoia has is the right to have all their shit permanently de-certified and destroyed .
The simple fact they put out a threat is evidence of them attempting to bias the outcome of the results before the cover even comes off the fucking box .
Sequoia is a fascist company , spreading " fascist cancer " across America .
If I had the results of the test , I would drive by find an open WAP , fire up TOR and publish their shit world wide .
Really though , none of this shit matters .
The bottom line is this .
No Electronic System of Tabulating votes can have public oversight because the public can not see electronic signals , parts can be specially crafted , or burn up , or be programmed to bias an outcome and this FASCIST COMPANY SEQUOIA ( Along with any and all other electronic tabulation device manufactures ) can not prove otherwise .
But yet they have a brick wall of lawyers .
I think it 's time to become self sufficient from the US government .
Stop using their money , gas and bullshit and start making your own electricity , grow your own food .
We ain't gonna get no healthcare , so learn first aid .

I was so pissed off I did n't even see that .
What is the party called for citizens that are anti- PNAC / AIPAC / CFR ?

... David Jefferson said on 3/17/2008 @ 9:07 pm PT ...
Brad , I just want to correct one thing in the headline .
The study that Felten and / or Appel are conducting is not " NJ commissioned " as you state in the headline .
Yes , the NJ County Clerks voted to request an independent review , but they are not state officials .
The relevant state official , who currently holds certification authority comparable to the SoS in other states , is New Jersey Attorney General Ann Milgram .
She has not ordered any investigation and seems disinclined to .
She is apparently satisfied with Sequoia 's explanation .
If BradBlog readers want to help , they could write Ms. Milgram and politely impress upon her the seriousness of the problem ( almost certainly a simple bug in the Advantage firmware ) and ask her to support the Princeton review or commission her own independent technical review .
I might add that the Princeton scientists do not have access to the source code for the Advantage ( as far as I know ) .
They really should have that in order to do a quicker and more thorough review .
Since Sequoia is obviously not cooperating , it will require the AG 's leverage to get that .
One further complication :
It is my understanding that the powers of the Attorney General of NJ over voting systems will be transferred to the Secretary of State of NJ in April , so it is quite possible that AG Milgram will do nothing , and leave the problem to SoS Nina Mitchell Wells next month .
{ Ed Note :
Thanks for the details , David .
I 've added an update to point to your comment at the end of the original article above .
Milgram can be contacted here for those inclined to do so .
As to whether or not the study in question is " NJ commissioned " , I tried to be careful about my wording of that in the headline , since my understanding was that we were waiting on state officials to decide * if * they were going to commission such a study .
Even though Sequoia has gone on the offensive to let them know in advance that they will take action if that were to happen .
If , on the other hand , a study is commencing by Felten and / or Appel anyway , as commissioned by someone else , please let me know if you could .
My understanding is that question is still up for grabs , as you seemed to note in your comment above , and thus I * tried * to be careful with the headline to that effect .
If I need to clarify it , of course , I 'll be happy to .

I was there in 2006n when Shamos " accidentally " hacked a Sequoia Advantage and make about 5 votes for a test candidate jump to over 8000 .
It was BAD .
I was there this past January when Northampton County PA held a Voting System Fair that led to their spending several million of our PA tax dollars to purchase of 300 used ( yes , USED ! )
Sequoia Advantage machines to replace the decertified and now orphaned WINvote DREs .
This is WORSE than bad ; this is plain foolish .
We now have 737,043 registered Pennsylvania voters ( using 11/07 registration figures , given the increased registrations for the Primary here this number is probably a lot higher ) in two of our largest counties that will have to trust their votes next month to these junkpiles .
And in the event of trouble while voting , I guess these poor voters are not even allowed to discuss anything the machines do wrong .
Because according to Smith no one is allowed to " publish " anything about the " behavior " of Sequoia 's software as that would infringe on Sequoia 's intellectual property rights ???
Say WHAT ???

a 4 - word response is all that Sequoia need be given for their bullshit threat --- " See you in Court "
-- I doubt any judge , lib or con , would want to touch this , especially once the scientists show the machines failing under even rudimentary testing ... much less what the boxes do once you stray into NDA - land

Justadood --
With all due respect , the courts have a poor record in ruling on lawsuits regarding voting system failures , generally siding with election officials .
And besides , the courts are very slow .
We have only a matter of weeks before the Pennsylvania primary in which the same machines will be used in Philadelphia , and only a few months more until the general election .
This bug ( and any others discovered ) must be fixed .
It is a much more direct and expeditious strategy to educate the relevant public officials and incentivise them to do the right thing -- call for an independent technical review , and base subsequent corrective action on the results of that review .
That has worked much more consistently .

Let Sequoia sue .
Felton and Appel should perform their tests as soon as as possible .
Any lawsuit by Sequoia would just bring more public attention to how wretchedly inadequate and dangerous the machines actually are .
Any jury would throw the suit out , and if we were lucky , the public would scream for indictments .
That is , if there were any press at all .

The software most likely to steal elections is the BALLOT DEFINITION SOFTWARE loaded on optical ballot scanner and DRE touch - screen voting machines in county elections offices across the U.S. just before the machines are sealed with security tape and transported to election polling locations .
Ballot definition software is constructed for each election and defines the ballot positions for each candidate and proposition for each voting precinct .
Miami -Dade County in Florida , for example , has 750 voting precincts and usually requires several dozen unique ballot definitions for federal general elections .
Ballot definition software creates the ballot image that people see on the screens of every brand of touch - screen voting machine .
DRE touch - screen and optical ballot scan machines use ballot image coordinates , also coded in the software , to determine how finger touches on the touch - screen or marks on the paper ballot are mapped to candidate positions on the ballot .
The software tabulates finger touches and marks on paper ballots as candidate votes and then stores those tabulated vote counts in the machine ’s “ virtual ballot box ” data memory card .
Ballot definition software finally tallies final election results when the polls close on election day .
All DRE touch - screen and optical ballot scanner manufacturers and vendors hold that all software , including the ballot definition software , is proprietary and confidential ( secret ) and may not viewed by county election officers , election judges , candidates running for office or citizen election observers .
Moreover , Judges have accepted this proprietary and confidential argument .
Presiding Florida Circuit Court Judge William L. Gary denied plaintiff Christine Jennings ’ motion to allow review of the source code for the DRE touch - screen machines used in the contested 2006 U.S. House race between Democrat Christine Jennings and Republican Vern Buchanan for Florida 's 13th district .
Nearly every state still has within its election code a provision that allows public observers the right to inspect physical ballot box containers to make sure they are empty and to inspect paper ballots to make sure they are accurate and complete before the polls open on Election Day .
( Example : New Hampshire Election Code Section 658:36 Inspection of Ballot Box –
At the opening of the polls , the ballot box shall be publicly opened and shown to be empty ; and the election officers shall ascertain that fact by a personal examination of the box .
eff. July 1 , 1979 )
Nearly every state also still has within its election code a provision that allows public observers to watch election clerks open physical ballot box containers and count the paper ballots at the end of the Election Day .
Ballot and ballot box inspection laws are on the books of every state because of the numerous historical accounts that partisans are known to have stuffed ballot boxes in a wide variety of ways .
Activist Judicial rulings that ballot definition software is proprietary and confidential to machine vendors creates new law that runs contrary to laws already on the books of nearly every state .
Election law that affirm it is not only the right , but also the duty of election judges and clerks and election observers in every voting precinct to inspect paper ballots and each ballot box container to certify ballots are accurate and ballot boxes are empty !
In the November 2006 election there were 1,142 counties using DRE voting machines and 1,752 counties using optical scanners .
This tabulates to 2,894 counties and 161,111 voting precincts that depend on ballot definition software written in weeks and days just before the election last November .
That adds up to a lot programmers writing a lot of " last minute " ballot definition software that election officials never visually audited or comprehensively tested in the 2006 mid-term general election .
For the 2008 primary and general election season , the use of DRE touch - screen voting machines has decreased slightly while the use of optical scanners has increased over the U.S.
While the numbers have shifted slightly over the past two years , the total number election jurisdictions using some type of electronic machine running ballot definition software at polling places or the central elections office for ballot tabulation continues to increase .
The task of creating ballot definition and tallying software is so large and complex that many counties contract the work to voting machine vendors or consulting / programming companies .
Most vendor and consulting companies themselves do not maintain a staff of programmers large enough to write all the ballot definition software for all the voting precincts of all their county elections officer customers across the U.S.
Therefore , the work is often subcontracted to yet another layer of contract programmers .
These subcontractors may or may not be U.S. citizens .
Current law even allows large off - shore software consulting companies now operating in India , Israel , Saudi Arabia , China , or Russia to write ballot definition software .
Who checks the credentials of all these contract programmers writing " last minute " ballot software ?
Who asks if contract programmers work for a foreign government , other foreign interest , political party or candidate up for election or if they have criminal records ?
Who checks to make sure they do not have connections to a Carl Rove type political operative .
Who performs detailed audits or certification testing of the software they write ?
The frightening answer to all questions is - no one !
Local election officials are not computer scientists nor do they even understand how vulnerable any software , particularly ballot definition software , is to inadvertent bug malfunction or malicious perversion .
The frightening truth is , local election officials often make no effort verify that ballot definition software is bug free or that someone in the software chain of custody did not nefariously insert a few extra lines of software code that activates only on election day to flip votes or rig vote totals on a central tabulator and then self delete at the end of the election day .
The more that unchecked and untested software is used in the administration of elections , the more election officials hand control of elections over to unchecked and unseen computer programmers .
It is so easy for a political partisan or foreign government to entice or direct contract programmers writing or handling ballot definition software to stuff the software ballot box as they perform their legitimate duties .
Even just a few motivated partisan programmers each working independently could easily throw an election !!

First , thanks to Brad for staying on top of these issues .
And second , my compliments to Michael Dean on a cogent comment with regard to ballot design and the issue of conflict of laws ( e.g. , intellectual property rights vs. election process supervision and inspection rights ) .
Nicely done .
Would love to connect with you , Michael , off line from here .
You can find me at the OSDV Foundation .
My comment is simply that this is yet another example of how we must shift from " black box voting " to " glass box voting . "
It is the only way we can restore trust in the vote in an increasingly digital democracy .
To do so requires complete transparency in design , development , and production of the machinery that serves as a cornerstone of our democracy .
A mandate of open source methods in both hardware and software is an imperative start .
Such work must become a digital public works , and the results held in the public trust .

IT infrastructure veteran Mark Wilson asks :
It seems that , wherever you look , Windows Server 2008 is almost universally acclaimed .
And rightly so - I believe that it is a fantastic operating system release ( let 's face it , Windows Server 2003 and R2 were very good , too ) and is packed full of features that have the potential to add significant value to solutions .
So , tell me , why are the same journalists who think Windows Server 2008 is great , still berating Windows Vista - the client version of the same operating system codebase ?
The short answer is that Server 2008 delivers new features that customers wanted , whereas Vista delivers new features that Microsoft thought its customers should want .
However , it seems there may be more to it than that .
Maybe Server 2008 really does perform better than Vista .
According to this post from Windows performance project exo.performance .network , Server 2008 is 11 - 17 per cent faster than Vista SP1 , running a couple of benchmarks that test typical client applications .
Backoffice server and systems admistrator Christian Mohn concurs :
Windows Server 2008 performs better , even with the Aero features enabled , than Vista ever did on the same hardware .
To me , this a bit strange , even if a lot of services are still disabled , as the codebase is pretty much the same as Vista .
Mohn 's example is less scientific , though : he never ran Vista SP1 , and also moved from 32 - bit to 64 - bit .
Server 2008 has a " Desktop Experience " feature , which installs things like Windows Media Player , Aero GUI effects , and other fluff that does n't belong on a server .
My assumption had been that once you installed this , Server 2008 would perform in a similar manner to Vista .
Apparently this is not the case .
It seems to me there are a few possibilities .
One is that Microsoft is n't being straight with us about this " same codebase " stuff .
It would be interesting to analyze the core DLLs and work out which are the same , and which are different .
The second possibility is that there 's stuff in Vista that is not part of the core , nor part of the Desktop Experience , but that slugs performance .
If so , it would be great to identify it and turn it off .
The third explanation is that the testers are wrong , and that performance is actually similar .
For example , maybe Vista was running a background update or backup during tests .
Background processes make it hard to conduct truly rigorous performance comparisons .
I 'd like to see Microsoft platform and services division fellow Mark Russinovich get his teeth into this .
I 'm also tempted to try the Server 2008 desktop experiment myself .

Sunday saw widespread violence in Iraq
The number of United States military personnel killed in Iraq since the US - led invasion five years ago has passed the 4,000 mark .
The latest to die were four soldiers whose patrol vehicle was blown up by a bomb in southern Baghdad on Sunday .
President George W Bush offered his " deepest sympathies " to the families of US military personnel killed in Iraq .
Separately , the bodies of two US security contractors kidnapped in Iraq more than a year ago have been found .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had recovered the remains of Ronald Withrow , who was seized in January 2007 , and John Roy Young , abducted in November 2006 .
On Sunday , insurgent attacks and military operations left at least 47 people dead across Iraq .
The bloodshed comes despite an overall reduction in violence since last June , following the US deployment of an extra 30,000 troops in violence - hit areas - the so - called " troop surge " .
' Tragedies do happen '
According to an Associated Press breakdown of the 4,000 figure , 97 % of deaths occurred after President Bush declared on 1 May 2003 that major combat was over .
If you interviewed the 30,000 [ wounded ] , they would have no ill will
US Staff Sgt Jonathan Criss Roadside bombs accounted for 44 % of deaths last year and 55 % to date in 2008 , the agency adds .
US soldiers interviewed by AFP news agency in Iraq said they were saddened by the figure of 4,000 , but argued the conflict was justified .
US troop deaths and numbers in Iraq " Every one of those people signed up voluntarily and it's a shame that that happens , but tragedies do happen in war , " said Senior Airman Preston Reeves , 26 .
Staff Sgt Jonathan Criss , 37 , said the US could not " just walk away and leave the Iraqi people " .
" If you interviewed the 30,000 [ wounded ] , they would have no ill will , " he added .
Withdrawal options
The 4,000th death comes just days after Mr Bush marked the fifth anniversary of the invasion , saying that it had made the world a better place .
He said in his speech that the troop surge had " opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror " .
Reacting on Monday to the deaths of the four US soldiers , President Bush said : " I offer our deepest sympathies to their families . "
He vowed " to make sure that those lives were not lost in vain " on what he described as a " day of reflection " to honour US war dead .
President Bush has repeatedly rejected any possibility of a full withdrawal until Iraq is able to defend itself .
He has the backing of the expected Republican candidate in this November 's presidential election , Senator John McCain .
But Democratic hopefuls Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have both pledged to end the war .
Senator Clinton has said she will start to withdraw troops within 60 days of being elected .
Senator Obama also favours a phased withdrawal , and has frequently said he would like all but a small residual force out within 16 months .

What are these ?
Venezuela is to re-establish diplomatic links with Colombia as tensions ease after a military crisis which brought the region close to a border war .
The government in Caracas said yesterday it would immediately reinstate full ties with its southern neighbour , cut a week earlier when Colombia 's military launched a bombing raid on a rebel camp just inside Ecuadorean territory .
Ecuador withdrew its ambassador from Colombia in protest , with Venezuela following suit in support .
Venezuela 's foreign ministry said it would send diplomats , including a new ambassador , to Bogotá straight away and was ready to receive Colombian diplomats " as soon as possible " , Reuters reported .
Ecuador has yet to discuss a return to normal relations , calling for a guarantee first that Colombia will never again carry out a similar raid .
Both countries sent troops to their respective borders with Colombia last week , and exchanges of increasingly vehement and martial rhetoric prompted fears of military conflict .
The crisis developed into a test of regional strength between the leftwing governments in Caracas and Bogotá and the heavily US - supported Colombian presidency .
On Friday , at a regional summit in the Dominican Republic , the presidents of Ecuador and Venezuela , Rafael Correa and Hugo Chávez , shook hands with their Colombian counterpart , Alvaro Uribe , who apologised for the raid .
A summit statement committed all parties to jointly fight threats to national stability from " irregular or criminal groups " , a reference to rebel groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or Farc , targeted by Colombia 's bombing raid .
The attack on the Farc jungle hideout killed more than 20 people , including Raúl Reyes , a senior commander from the group and its chief negotiator with the outside world .
Battered by criticism from around the region , Colombia has sought to justify the raid through the release of information it claims was taken from computer files on a laptop belonging to Reyes and seized at the Farc base .
At the weekend , documents leaked by Colombia 's security forces gave new details of what the country says are close links between the rebel group and the presidents of Venezuela and Ecuador .
One of a series of documents reprinted in the Colombian news magazine Semana was a letter from October 2006 purporting to outline a discussion among Farc leaders about donating money to Correa 's successful election campaign later that year .
The Ecuadorean leader denies receiving money from the Marxist group , which makes most of its money from drug trafficking and kidnappping , and is considered to be a terrorist organisation by the US and the EU .
Another document printed by the magazine discusses " secret , confidential relations " with Chávez .
He denies any links with Farc , beyond negotiations over hostages .
Another letter supposed to have come from the laptop appears to be a request to Libya 's leader , Muammar Gadaffi , asking for $ 100 m ( £ 50 m ) in loans to buy surface - to - air missiles .
Another discusses an apparent effort by Democrats in the US to have the novelist Gabriel García Márquez mediate in talks with the insurgents , possibly with the involvement of former US president , Bill Clinton .
As with earlier claims supposedly coming from the documents - for example , Colombian suggestions last week that Farc wanted to obtain uranium to build a radioactive " dirty bomb " - there was no supporting evidence to back them up .
The aggressor heads to school , to show friends the video of his Billy moment , while Billy heads home , again .
It ’s not yet 8 in the morning .
Bullying is everywhere , including here in Fayetteville , a city of 60,000 with one of the country ’s better school systems .
A decade ago a Fayetteville student was mercilessly harassed and beaten for being gay .
After a complaint was filed with the Office of Civil Rights , the district adopted procedures to promote tolerance and respect  none of which seems to have been of much comfort to Billy Wolfe .
It remains unclear why Billy became a target at age 12 ; schoolyard anthropology can be so nuanced .
Maybe because he was so tall , or wore glasses then , or has a learning disability that affects his reading comprehension .
Or maybe some kids were just bored .
Or angry .
Whatever the reason , addressing the bullying of Billy has become a second job for his parents : Curt , a senior data analyst , and Penney , the owner of an office - supply company .
They have binders of school records and police reports , along with photos documenting the bruises and black eyes .
They are well known to school officials , perhaps even too well known , but they make no apologies for being vigilant .
They also reject any suggestion that they should move out of the district because of this .
The many incidents seem to blur together into one protracted assault .
When Billy attaches a bully ’s name to one beating , his mother corrects him .
“ That was Benny , sweetie , ” she says .
“ That was in the eighth grade . ”
A student stands up in the middle of a lecture and starts singing a Brodway style musical .

The launch of the ultra-violent Grand Theft Auto IV video game descended into real - life horror when a man was stabbed repeatedly in a queue of fans waiting to buy it .
Shoppers thought they were witnessing a promotional stunt for the launch when the blood - soaked victim staggered among them .
They realised the attack was genuine only when police arrived .

The GameStation shop in George Street , Croydon , where a 23 - year - old man was stabbed last night
It took place outside the Gamestation store in Croydon , South London , one of 40 stores which opened at midnight to sell the new game .
Elsewhere , two muggers shattered the jaw and nose of an 18 - year - old boy to steal his copy of the game just 30 minutes after he bought it in Leyland , Lancashire .
The violence intensified a chorus of criticism aimed at the British - designed game , the latest in a hugely controversial series .
Massive industry hype has surrounded its technological advances and stunning graphics and it is forecast to break records by selling six million copies in its first week .
But the content is unadulterated violence .
Players assume the identity of Niko Bellic , a shaven - headed veteran of the Bosnian conflict who arrives in ' Liberty City ' as a gangland novice .
He makes progress by killing people to order , robbing banks and dealing drugs with the help of an almost inexhaustible arsenal .
The game has been give an 18 certification from the British Board of Film Classification but critics fear it will inevitably be played by much younger people .
The series has sold an estimated 70 million copies since its launch in 1997 , but has been shrouded in controversy .

Eagerly awaited : The Grand Theft Auto IV game went on sale at midnight
Malcolm Critchell , queueing with his nephew Jordan , said : " The victim was covered from shoulder to belly in blood .
Everyone thought it was a show to promote the game . "
Despite his wounds , the 23 - year - old victim is believed to have gone home to arm himself with a kitchen knife to seek revenge , but police intercepted him .
He was treated in hospital for several stab wounds .
Another queuer , Marcus Henderson , 24 , said : " It was a scene straight from the game itself .
In Grand Theft Auto , when you attack someone but do n't finish them off they 'll come and get you .
We thought it was a stunt put on by the makers of the game . "
MP Keith Vaz said of the video game : " This kind of violence should be deplored .
It 's highly likely that younger children are going to get access to this game .
" A young person 's mind is impressionable and the interactive violence of Grand Theft Auto is going to have an impact on them . "
Human rights groups say water - boarding is torture
He said he rejected the intelligence bill , passed by Senate and Congress , as it took " away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror " .
The president said the CIA needed " specialised interrogation procedures " that the military did not .
Water - boarding is condemned as torture by rights groups and many governments .
It is an interrogation method that puts the detainee in fear of drowning .
Track record
Speaking in his weekly radio address , Mr Bush did not mention water - boarding specifically .
" The bill Congress sent me would not simply ban one particular interrogation method , as some have implied , " he said .
CIA 'ENHANCED INTERROGATION ' TECHNIQUES
Water - boarding : prisoner bound to a board with feet raised , and cellophane wrapped round his head .
Water is poured onto his face and is said to produce a fear of drowning Cold cell : prisoner made to stand naked in a cold , though not freezing , cell and doused with water Standing : Prisoners stand for 40 hours and more , shackled to the floor Belly slap : a hard slap to the stomach with an open hand .
This is designed to be painful but not to cause injury Source : Described to ABC News by un-named CIA agents in 2005
The water - boarding debate
" Instead , it would eliminate all the alternative procedures we 've developed to question the world 's most dangerous and violent terrorists . "
He added : " This is no time for Congress to abandon practices that have a proven track record of keeping America safe . "
Correspondents say the slim margin by which the bill was passed means it is unlikely that the Democratic - controlled Congress could gather enough votes to overturn Mr Bush 's veto .
The bill would have restricted Central Intelligence Agency officials to using the 19 interrogation techniques outlined by the US army field manual .
It would ban the CIA from using not only water - boarding , but sensory deprivation and other harsh coercive methods on prisoners .
The CIA recently publicly admitted using water - boarding on three people , including high - profile al - Qaeda detainee Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , but not for the past five years .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Federal employees charged millions of dollars for Internet dating , tailor - made suits , lingerie , lavish dinners and other questionable expenses to their government credit cards over 15 months , Congressional auditors say .
A report by the Government Accountability Office , obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press , examined spending controls across the federal government in 2005 and 2006 after reports of credit - card abuse at some departments .
The review found that nearly 41 percent of roughly $ 14 billion in purchases  legitimate or questionable  did not follow procedure , because they were unauthorized or improperly received .
In a sample of purchases totaling $ 2.7 million , the government could not account for hundreds of computers , iPods and cameras worth more than $ 1.8 million .
The Army could not locate computer items making up 16 server configurations , each of which cost nearly $ 100,000 .
ICANN is once again preparing to evaluate the possibility of creating a controversial top - level domain ( TLD ) specifically for pornography .
The initiative , which is based on a proposal authored by ICM Registry , has been rejected by ICANN twice in the past after considerable public debate .
The .xxx proposal is opposed by conservative religious groups , the American Civil Liberties Union , and a significant number of Internet pornographers .
ICANN initially rejected the .xxx proposal when it was first introduced in 2000 , arguing that it did n't serve a clearly defined need .
The proposal was tentatively approved in 2005 upon its second submission , but implementation was delayed and eventually canceled later that year as a result of a protest campaign orchestrated by the conservative Family Research Council , which inundated the Department of Commerce with thousands of e-mail messages arguing that the establishment of the .xxx TLD would legitimize Internet pornography and make it more accessible while " giving false hope to parents who want to protect their families from pornography . "
ICANN officially reversed its earlier approval of the .xxx TLD by a 9 - 5 vote .
Last year , some politicians who apparently did n't get the memo attempted to revive the .xxx TLD with the misguided Cyber Safety for Kids Act of 2006 .
ICM Registry also took additional action , filing a Freedom of Information suit against the Department of Commerce in an attempt to show that the government 's actions were manipulated by conservative religious groups .
In addition to arousing the wrath and ire of conservative religious groups , the .xxx TLD proposal has also received criticism from Internet pornographers who fear that it would compel governments to enact legislation intended to constrain the distribution of Internet pornography .
When ICANN discussed the proposal in 2005 , members of ICANN 's board of directors had expressed concern that governments would potentially place the burden of enforcing Internet pornography regulations on ICANN if the .xxx TLD is instituted .
Despite broad opposition , the .xxx TLD proposal is back again and ready for another vote .
To find an explanation for resilience of the .xxx TLD proposal , one need only follow the money .
The only organizations advocating the creation of the .xxx TLD at this point are the domain registrars , who would be able to generate considerable profits by selling .xxx domain names .
ICANN is also scheduled to discuss the handling of the RegisterFly fiasco , issues regarding TLDs for countries that no longer exist , and ways to protect the Internet infrastructure from root server attacks like the one perpetrated last month .
A nod of the head to Amit at Digital Inspiration for pointing me in the right direction for the Yahoo Media Player with his post “ How to embed mp3 audio files in web pages ” .
There are two versions to the Yahoo Media Player – a javascript based version and a Flash based version .
For the javascript version , first you need to link to the file .
For example :
< a href= ” http://techwhimsy.com/31_Ghosts_IV.mp3″>31_Ghosts_IV</a> which looks like :
31_Ghosts_IV
Then , you insert the javascript for the media player somewhere on the page :
< script src= " http://mediaplayer.yahoo.com/js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
After that , a little ‘ play ’ button should appear next to your media file link .
Click the button and the player launches .
This method has occasionally been reported to not work on self - hosted WordPress blogs like this one .
To get the Yahoo Media Player to work in WordPress if the above method has n’t worked , try inserting the script tag in your header file .
You will also notice that off to the left hand side is the miniaturised version of the player which you can also launch just by clicking on it .
Using Yahoo Media Flash Player
Yahoo also offer a Flash player with a handy Yahoo flash player configurator at next .

It 's a popular defensive strategy at the bottom of the ocean :
If you 're scared , just clone yourself .
The process will make you smaller and harder to find , as well as doubling the chance that your genes will survive .
Sand dollar larvae are rampant self - cloners , but they only do it when they sense danger .
That means there 's a kind of conscious intent behind their cloning — it 's not just an ordinary part of their reproductive cycle .
How easy would it be to port this trait to humans , so we could just pop out a new self when the old one is about to be offed ?

Probably pretty difficult , not least of which because we do n't go through an embryo stage outside the womb .
According to an article by Clara Moskowitz in Live Science :
Scientists exposed 4 - day - old sand dollar larvae to fish mucus , a sign that danger is close .
They found that the larvae created clones of themselves within 24 hours .
" It 's the first time we 've seen anything clone itself in response to cues that predators are near , " said researcher Dawn Vaughn , a biology doctoral student at the University of Washington 's Friday Harbor Laboratories .
After being exposed to fish mucus , the larvae formed embryo - like buds that eventually detached and developed into new , genetically - identical larvae that were much smaller than the originals .
The parent larvae were left smaller , too , measuring about half their beginning size . . .
The scientists think cloning may provide a double benefit to larvae facing danger .
By doubling themselves , they have a second chance to ensure their genetic information survives even if one larva gets eaten .
Additionally , being smaller may be beneficial to larvae trying to hide from fish .
" Fish are visual predators and often choose their prey based on size , " Vaughn told LiveScience .
" You 're apt to see something bigger .
Based on past research , we 're hypothesizing that small size protects larvae , but we have to test that . "

Still , I want my cloning powers .

“ This reflects the fear in Mexican society , the collective psychosis about kidnapping , ” said Adrienne Bard , an American radio journalist who has lived in Mexico for more than 20 years and who received a call in March from a crying young woman .
Shocked , she thought it was her own college - age daughter .
“ I totally fell into the trap , ” she said .
So have many others .
A new hot line set up to deal with the problem of kidnappings in which no one is actually kidnapped received more than 30,000 complaints from last December to the end of February , Joel Ortega , Mexico City ’s police chief , announced recently .
There have been eight arrests , and 3,415 telephone numbers have been identified as those used by extortionists , he said .
But identifying the phone numbers  they are now listed on a government Web site  has done little to slow the extortion calls .
Nearly all the calls are from cellphones , most of them stolen , authorities say .
On top of that , many extortionists are believed to be pulling off the scams from prisons .
Authorities say hundreds of different criminal gangs are engaged in various telephone scams .
Besides the false kidnappings , callers falsely tell people they have won cars or money .
Sometimes , people are told to turn off their cellphones for an hour so the service can be repaired ; then , relatives are called and told that the cellphone ’s owner has been kidnapped .
Ransom demands have even been made by text message .
Of the relatively few arrests made so far , three suspects were brothers , ages 19 , 31 and 34 , who were caught collecting money squeezed from a victim .
The two younger brothers blamed their older sibling , who has been in and out of prison for years , of putting them up to it .

This is the worst air travel security idea I 've heard of in a long time .
A Canadian company called Lamperd Less Lethal is promoting the EMD Safety Bracelet .
It 's equipped with electro muscular disruption technology , which effectively short - circuits the central nervous system .
Zap someone and they 'll be completely immobile for several minutes .
The technology is n't new – cops and security guards have been using it for years in tasers .
What 's new is the marketing approach .
Lamperd is hawking the EMD bracelet as the ideal tool for fighting terrorists intent on taking over an airplane .
And they 're doing so with a blatantly exploitive promotional video .
You can watch the five minute video , which has gotten more than 33,000 hits at YouTube , but I 'll spare you the trouble by recapping its most egregious claims .
The video starts with unnecessary footage of 9/11 , mugshots of terrorists and a deep - voiced , somber narrator explaining that current airport security equipment does n't work .
Why ?
Because it 's operated by TSA employees who make minimum wage – and you know what that means .
The narrator goes on to say that the next line of defense , armed Federal Air Marshals , also is no good because their aim is so bad that they 'll blow a hole in the fuselage before they actually hit a hijacker .
That leaves no choice but to equip pilots and cabin crew with EMD safety bracelets , which passengers would have to put on before boarding .
When threatened by a highjacker , a flight attendant would transmit an EMD pulse at the terrorist , reducing him to a trembling mass of Jello .
The terrorist gets tied up , the plane lands safely and the world is a better place .
Beyond preying on people 's fears and insulting our intelligence , Lamperd is selling a product that 's a horrible idea in the first place .
Do you really want those bracelets on your flight ?
If hijackers get their hands the transmitter , they 'll zap anyone standing in their way .
Who 's to say that in the chaos of an emergency a crew member will have time to identify the threat , activate the correct bracelet and fire the EMD pulse before the terrorist has control of the plane ?
And then there 's the possibility of random craziness .
What if a flight attendant loses her cookies and zaps a passenger who wants to keep the whole can of CranApple juice ?
What about drunk passengers ?
Do you want the lush in 36D getting his hands on what is essentially a bracelet - mounted stun gun ?
Lamperd claims on their website that the company is doing brisk business , so brisk that they 'll hire back all their laid - off employees .
But I do n't think it 's the safety bracelet that 's flying off the shelves – the airlines I spoke to claim to have never heard of the product , and Ann Davis of the TSA says the agency has no plans to deploy the bracelets .
The company 's CEO Barry Lamperd did n't want to talk the first time I called and was n't available the second time .
Lamperd Less Lethal 's tagline is " Keeping the Situation Under Control . "
I think " Exploiting People 's Fear and Making a Bad Situation Worse " might be more appropriate .

Simulation of the collapse of an interstellar gas cloud into a massive star .
The left side shows the whole cloud , and the right side shows a zoom - in around the massive star in the center .
Hollywood megastars need just right the rightconditions to explode onto the scene , a phenomenon shared by rare supermassivecelestial stars .
Twoscientists think they have decoded the gassy recipe to create stars as much as100 times bigger than the sun , perhaps solving the mysteryof their formation .
Mark Krumholz Princeton University in New Jersey and hiscolleague Christopher McKee of the University of California Berkeley usedmathematical models to show how small stars can primesuperstar formation .
" Gravitytends to break interstellar gas clouds into small pieces , preventing massivestar formation , " Krumholz said .
" But little stars heating up a gascloud can smooth it out , forcing gravity to create a hugestar . "
Krumholzand McKee detail their findings in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Nature .
Starpower
Althoughmassive stars are about a million times rarer than the most common stars — those about 80 percent smaller than the sun — they are the movers and shakersof the universe .
" They 'revery rare , but massive stars are the dominant players in galaxies , " Krumholz said .
" They 're the things that can push around and heat upinterstellar gas , which is essentially where all stars come from . "
He alsoexplained that big stars seed the cosmos with elements that are required for life .
" Theyenrich the universe with metals from theirsupernovae , " he said , noting that only enormous stars are powerfulenough to fuse together small atoms and create the heavy materials .
Hotinfluence
To form agalactic superpower , Krumholz said an interstellar gas cloud needs to bethousands of times more dense than average .
Problem is , gravity tends to breakdense gas clouds into pieces and thwart massive star formation .
" Thechallenge is n't getting enough gas , it 's getting the cloud into a small enoughregion and preventing its breakup , " he said .
If a fewsmall stars form within the cloud , Krumholz explained , they can heat up thecloud and increase its " column density , " or pressure .
The heatingprocess prevents gravity from taking control of the cloud , breaking it up andforming only small stars .
" Heatingup the gas helps pressure win over gravity 's influence , ultimately forcing thegas cloud to collapse in a massive star , " Krumholz said .
The newview of star formation highlights the rarity of massive stars — the only kindastronomers on Earth can seein distant galaxies — but leads to the possibility that more stars form ingalaxies than previously thought .
" Theremay be significant parts of galaxies where massive stars can't form , butlower - mass stars like the sun can , " Krumholz said .
" We estimate thenumber of stars in a galaxy on the amount of light we see , and if massive starsare missing , then it 's possible that we 've dramatically underestimated the rateof star formation in distant regions of the universe . "
I was asked by many to reply to a post by Doug Noland called Setting the Backdrop for Stage Two .
Before reviewing Noland 's post I would first like to comment on this statement made by Professor Lewis : " I have never been one to believe you can have a true deflation with a fiat currency . "
Before we can begin any discussion , it is imperative to agree on the meaning of terms .
I happen to believe in Austrian economics and the definition I use when I speak of inflation is a net increase in money supply and credit .
Deflation is the opposite , a net decrease in money supply and credit .
For more on those definitions as well as rationale for discarding seven other definitions , please see Inflation :
What the heck is it ?
Deflation In Japan
Assuming that there is agreement as to what inflation and deflation are , it is quite easy to refute the idea that deflation cannot occur in a fiat regime .
Japan was in deflation for a decade .
However , some still argue that Japan never went through deflation .
One basis for that argument is that " money supply " as measured by M1 or base money supply never contracted over a sustained period .
The other argument is that prices as measured by the CPI never fell much .
Those are flawed arguments ( at least from an Austrian economist point of view ) given the focus on consumer prices and money supply alone as opposed to money supply and credit .
Although Japan was rapidly printing money , a destruction of credit was happening at a far greater pace .
There was an overall contraction of credit in Japan for close to 5 consecutive years .
Property values plunged for 18 consecutive years .
The stock market plunged from 40,000 to 7,000 .
Cash was hoarded and the velocity of money collapsed .
Those are classic symptoms of deflation that a proper definition incorporating both money supply and credit would readily catch .
Those looking at consumer prices or monetary injections by the bank of Japan were far off the mark .
Yes , there was deflation in Japan .
Furthermore , if deflation can happen in Japan , then there is no reason why it cannot happen in the US as well .
Economist Paul Kasriel Weighs In
I discussed how a Japanese style deflation might occur in the US in an Interview with Paul Kasriel .
Mish :
Would you say that consumer debt in the US as opposed to the lack of consumer debt in Japan increases the deflationary pressures on the US economy ?
Kasriel : Yes , absolutely .
The latest figures that I have show that banks ' exposure to the mortgage market is at 62 % of their total earnings assets , an all time high .
If a prolonged housing bust ensues , banks could be in big trouble .
Mish :
What if Bernanke cuts interest rates to 1 percent ?
Kasriel :
In a sustained housing bust that causes banks to take a big hit to their capital it simply will not matter .
This is essentially what happened recently in Japan and also in the US during the great depression .
Mish : Can you elaborate ?
Kasriel : Most people are not aware of actions the Fed took during the great depression .
Bernanke claims that the Fed did not act strong enough during the great depression .
This is simply not true .
The Fed slashed interest rates and injected huge sums of base money but it did no good .
More recently , Japan did the same thing .
It also did no good .
If default rates get high enough , banks will simply be unwilling to lend which will severely limit money and credit creation .
Mish :
How does inflation start and end ?
Kasriel : Inflation starts with expansion of money and credit .
Inflation ends when the central bank is no longer able or willing to extend credit and / or when consumers and businesses are no longer willing to borrow because further expansion and / or speculation no longer makes any economic sense .
Mish :
So when does it all end ?
Kasriel :
That is extremely difficult to project .
If the current housing recession were to turn into a housing depression , leading to massive mortgage defaults , it could end .
Alternatively , if there were a run on the dollar in the foreign exchange market , price inflation could spike up and the Fed would have no choice but to raise interest rates aggressively .
Given the record leverage in the U.S. economy , the rise in interest rates would prompt large scale bankruptcies .
These are the two " checkmate " scenarios that come to mind .
Deflation Is Here Now
The interview with Kasriel was in December of 2006 .
On March 17,2008 in Now Presenting : Deflation !
I stated " Deflation is here and it is now . "
A followup post was called Why Do Oil Prices Keep Rising ?
The key idea from the latter article is as follows :
A Weak Dollar Is Masking Deflation !
Right now what we have is deflation with a weak dollar .
That weak dollar , in conjunction with peak oil , has caught nearly everyone off guard to the point they are screaming about oil prices and bond bubbles , while missing the far more important deflationary forces of foreclosures , bankruptcies , and massive writedowns in credit .
Setting the Backdrop for Stage Two
Week in and week out Noland writes a great column .
Stage Two made " Best of the Web " on Dollar Collapse .
I happen to agree with that " best of " designation because Noland took a viewpoint and argued it well .
However , let 's take a look on a point by point basis :
Noland : I hear pundits still referring to a “ deflationary Credit collapse . ”
Well , the U.S. Credit system implosion was largely stopped in its tracks last month .
The Fed bailed out Bear Stearns ; opened wide its discount window to Wall Street ; and implemented unprecedented liquidity facilities for the benefit of the marketplace overall .
Central banks around the globe executed unparalleled concerted market liquidity operations .
Mish : Technically the Fed bailed out JP Morgan ( JPM ) not Bear Stearns ( BSC ) .
The Fed was very afraid of a derivatives cascade , and the Fed made JP Morgan whole on swaps it was holding on Bear Stearns .
At $ 10 per share its pretty tough to argue Bear Stearns was bailed out .
Employees darn near lost everything .
However , Noland is correct that Central banks around the globe executed unparalleled concerted market liquidity operations .
In that regard , Noland has the key idea correct .
Noland :
Here at home , the GSEs ’ regulator spoke publicly about Fannie and Freddie having the capacity to add $ 200 billion of mortgages to their balances sheets , with the possibility of increasing their guarantee business as much as $ 2 TN this year ( certainly including “ jumbo ” mortgages ) .
Mish :
In practice there is little market for Jumbos .
Where there is a market , interest rates are sky high because of credit risk .
Jumbo rates are currently 2 points higher than conforming loans , and even higher in distressed areas .
Furthermore , jumbos often require a larger down payment to boot .
Liquidity on jumbos is more imaginary than real according to my contacts .
In addition to the problem in jumbos , there is practically no market for condos .
I discussed this situation in Condo Credit Squeeze .
That squeeze is going to cause a wave of bankruptcies at regional banks for reasons cited .
Noland : The Federal Home Loan Bank system was given the ok to continue aggressive liquidity injections and balloon its balance sheet in the process .
And now ( see “ GSE Watch ” above ) we see that the Federal Housing Administration ( with its new mandate and $ 729,550 loan limit ) is likely to increase federal government mortgage insurance by as much as $ 200 bn this year , while Washington ’s Ginnie Mae is in the midst of a securitization boom .
Mish :
It is likely to do no such thing .
The reason is the $ 729,550 loan limit is temporary .
And because it expires at the end of the year , and because Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE ) have provisions in distressed areas like California , few deals are getting done .
Banks are unwilling to do deals because they do not want to get stuck holding paper they cannot sell to Fannie after the end of the year .
I have discussed this situation with mortgage brokers and this upping the limit is more show than reality .
Perhaps Congress will remove that temporary restriction but as of now , not much is happening .
One final point about jumbos : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will not refinance loans that are underwater .
That alone will put a halt to GSEs rapidly expanding balance sheets on account of jumbos .
Noland :
It is , as well , worth noting that JPMorgan Chase expanded assets by $ 80.7 bn during the first quarter ( 20.7 % annualized ) to $ 1.642 TN , with six - month growth of $ 163.3 bn ( 22.1 % annualized ) .
Goldman Sachs expanded its balance sheets by $ 69.2 bn during Q1 ( 24.7 % annualized ) to $ 1.189 TN , with half - year growth of $ 143.2bn ( 27.4 % ) .
Even Wells
Fargo grew assets at an almost 14 % pace this past quarter .
And we know that Bank Credit overall has expanded at a 12.6 % rate over the past 38 weeks .
Meanwhile , GSE MBS issuance has been ramped up to a record pace .
And let ’s not forget the Credit intermediation function now being carried out by the money fund complex – with assets having increased an unprecedented $ 371bn y- t-d ( 41.3 % annualized ) and $ 900bn over the past 38 weeks ( 47.7 % annualized ) .
It is also worth noting the $ 184bn y- t -d increase ( 29 % annualized ) in foreign “ custody ” holdings held at the Fed .
Sure , the Credit system remains under significant stress , with additional mortgage and corporate Credit deterioration in the offing .
But , at least for now , policymakers have successfully stemmed systemic deleveraging .
The Credit system is simply not in deflationary collapse mode .
Mish : Technically Noland is correct .
However , I ask the question : at what pace did Wells Fargo ( WFC ) , Citigroup ( C ) , JPMorgan ( JPM ) etc , expand credit if that credit was marked to market ?
Is bank credit marked to market expanding or contracting ?
I suggest it is contracting .
One of the ways it is being masked is by hiding garbage in Level 3 assets that were Level 2 assets last quarter .
Another way it is being masked is by pretending that the collateral the Fed is swapping with banks and brokerages is somewhere close to full value .
I am quite certain that marked to market credit is contracting .
However , I can not prove it .
I talked about this in Night of the Living Fed .
" Several people have asked me recently if I have been changing my tune on a Fed bailout .
The answer is no .
I long ago predicted the Fed would try all sorts of things to stop a deflation threat .
But I also have also said , these measures would not work and indeed they have n't .
What is happening is the Zombification of Banks , that is exactly what happened to Japan as well . "
Zombification does not halt deflation , it prolongs it .
That is the main point I believe Noland misses .
Noland :
When the Fed and Washington radically altered the rules of U.S. finance last month , they placed in jeopardy huge positions that had been put in place to hedge against and profit from systemic crisis .
With the end of “ Stage one ” arises a major short squeeze in the Credit , equities , and derivatives markets .
And when it comes to contemplating the scope and ramifications of today ’s “ hedging ” activities , we ’re clearly in Uncharted Waters .
It is not beyond reason that a disorderly unwind of “ bearish ” Credit market positions could incite a mini bout of liquidity , speculation , and Credit excess that exacerbates Global Monetary Instability - while Setting the Backdrop for Stage Two of the Crisis .
Mish : I certainly can agree with the idea of Global Monetary Instability and one reason is counterparty risk on credit default swaps ..
Credit Default Swaps Soar
Bloomberg is reporting Credit Swaps Top $ 62 Trillion in Rush to Hedge Losses .
Credit - default swaps worldwide expanded to cover $ 62.2 trillion of debt in 2007 as investors rushed to protect against losses triggered by the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market .
Contracts outstanding rose 37 percent in the second half of 2007 from $ 45.5 trillion in the first half , the New York - based International Swaps and Derivatives Association said today .
Using data from the Bank for International Settlements , ISDA estimated the gross market value of all outstanding derivatives contracts is about $ 9.8 trillion .
That would be the amount owed to banks or investors if the contracts were liquidated .
Subtracting off - setting payments owed between trading partners , that number would fall to about $ 2.3 trillion , the group said .
Postponed Is Not Prevented
Too Big To Bail
When you add up all the Level II assets by just the eight largest holders in the U.S : JP Morgan ( JPM ) , Citibank ( C ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) , Merrill Lynch ( MER ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , Bear , Morgan Stanley ( MS ) and Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) , it comes to a staggering $ 5 trillion - nearly half the size of the economy .
Level III assets are nearly $ 600 billion .
Is the Fed big enough to bail out all these assets ?
My best guess is probably not , and more firms will fail .
If the loans and economy both do n’t start performing , these failures will happen more quickly , which is why my firm continues to avoid credit risk .
It 's not hard to envision an acceleration of this process if the market starts to believe the special loan facilities and other funding processes artificially created to deal with this mess cease to work .
The Fed is slowly becoming the dumping ground for dealers and banks - members of the ‘ Moral Hazard Club . ’
It 's is running out of capital , and quickly .
The problem assets ( at least the ones we know about ) are way too large for the Fed to completely absorb .
It 's waiting and hoping the economy and credit markets stabilize before it runs out of ammunition .
What Cannot Be Paid Back Will Default
To Scroll Thru My Recent Post List
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen .
John McCain moved to shore up his support among conservatives by pledging Tuesday to nominate strict constructionist , conservative judges to the federal bench .
" It will fall to the next president to nominate hundreds of qualified men and women to the federal courts , and the choices we make will reach far into the future , " the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said during a speech at Wake Forest University in North Carolina .
" My two prospective opponents and I have very different ideas about the nature and proper exercise of judicial power , " he said , referring to Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
" We would nominate judges of a different kind , a different caliber , a different understanding of judicial authority and its limits . "
Watch more of McCain 's comments »
Many conservative members are suspicious of McCain on the issue of judges because of his involvement in 2006 in the Senate " gang of 14 . "
That bipartisan group of senators sought to reach a consensus on President Bush 's judicial appointees , blocking some of the president 's most conservative nominations while promising to confirm others .
The group formed after the then - Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist threatened to remove the ability to filibuster judicial nominations after Democratic senators blocked a number of Bush nominees .
But many conservatives responded positively to McCain 's speech .
" [ It was a ] strong speech ...
Very encouraging .
McCain has drawn a clear line between his support for judicial restraint and Obama 's promise to appoint liberal judicial activists , " said Ed Whelan , president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a former law clerk for Justice Scalia .
" McCain has promised that his Supreme Court nominees will have 'a proven record of excellence in the law , and a proven commitment to judicial restraint ...
" McCain has embraced both John Roberts and Samuel Alito as model nominees .
McCain clearly recognizes that liberal judicial activism deprives Americans of their basic powers as citizens to establish policies through their legislators . "
McCain also criticized Obama for not voting to confirm Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito , saying the Illinois senator 's justification of that decision sounded like it was written by an " activist judge . "
" Apparently , nobody quite fits the bill except for an elite group of activist judges , lawyers and law professors who think they know wisdom when they see it -- and they see it only in each other , " McCain said of Obama .
Responding Tuesday to McCain 's claims , Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor said , " The Straight Talk Express took another sharp right turn today as John McCain promised his conservative base four more years of out - of - touch judges that would threaten a woman 's right to choose , gut the campaign finance reform that bears his own name , and trample the rights and interests of the American people .
" Barack Obama has always believed that our courts should stand up for social and economic justice , and what 's truly elitist is to appoint judges who will protect the powerful and leave ordinary Americans to fend for themselves . "
Meanwhile , Clinton campaign Policy Director Neera Tanden responded by saying , " We wo n't take lectures on the right way to approach the Constitution from Sen. McCain , who voted for extreme conservative judges like Justice [ Clarence ] Thomas .
" In an effort to pander to conservative voters , Sen. McCain has signaled his intention to appoint right - wing judges who are committed to rolling back women 's rights and civil rights , elevating the interests of big business over the rights of workers and consumers , affirming executive branch power grabs , and undermining our common core freedoms . "
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said McCain has a " radical , right - wing judicial philosophy . "
" It 's clear he 's the wrong choice to safeguard that future , " Dean said .
" No matter how far they have gone to restrict our fundamental rights or their clear records of gutting the reforms John McCain claims to care about , he has put loyalty to his party and a radical agenda ahead of the American people . "

Download and attempt to view the fake file , and you 'll be prompted to install PLAY_MP3.exe instead .
Ordinarily , this would be the point at which a hapless end - user would click " Yes , " and said trojan would install itself .
In this case , however , Play_MP3 actually prompts you to read and affirm your understanding of the malware 's EULA .
Yes , Virgina , malware authors now have EULAs — what 's next , corporate sponsorship ?
Read the EULA , click next , and the system installs two pieces of malware McAfee identifies as " FBrowsingAdvisor " and " SurfingEnhancer . "
Needless to say , neither piece of software functions as advertised , the system in question is now stuffed with adware applications that will undoubtedly " help " by downloading and installing more of their ilk — and the MP3 player does n't even work !
This particular trojan is more annoying than directly harmful , but the speed at which its spreading has McAfee concerned .
Users have obviously fallen for the trojan 's social engineering tactics , which implies we could see copycat attacks appearing in a very short amount of time .
Adware is n't necessarily all that difficult to neutralize , but botnet trojans , keyloggers , and downloaders are all capable of doing far more damage even if they only remain active for a short amount of time .
We know our readers are too tech savvy to fall for such attacks , but tell your friends and family to keep an eye out for this attack — or variations of it — and download safely .
Spore : Hands - on Preview
Spore is perhaps the most ambitious game ever
The Cell Stage is where the full game begins
PC , Nintendo DS , Mobile , Mac .
Games do n’t come any more ambitious thanand although the premise of the now in - famously delayed game and magnum opus of Will Wright is fairly simple , the actual realisation of that concept has proven incredibly difficult .
The idea behindis this ; you are God , the Alpha , Omega and Almighty .
You are omniscient , omnipresent and capable of creating a rock so big you ca n’t possibly lift it .
Then you can lift it .
You ’re God and that type of feat is your bread and butter .
Specifically , you are the God of a particular species that you will design , craft , sculpt and guide through from primordial ooze to inevitable extinction .
You start off small , designing a single cell and guiding it through the cesspool in which all life must begin .
As time passes you use evolution as the tool by which you will shape the destiny of your creature for better or worse .
A mouth here , a leg there , and a twist to the torso – you slowly create the creature you want .
You can do that .
You are God .
From there , the game expands ever outwards and you will move from guiding a single cell or creature to encouraging a small tribe , then a city .
In the climax to this universe in a box you ’ll be aiding your civilisation in spreading to other stars and planets .
Such game concepts are truly the things of dreams – open , sandbox worlds with almost limitless possibilities and completely open setting .
The game says to you ; “ Unfortunately , with such an impossibly complex design even getting the basics of the gameplay right can be a daunting task in and of itself and , even with the full might of Electronic Arts behind him , Will Wright has struggled to getworking .
The game , which he has reportedly been planning for the last decade at least , has suffered numerous delays .
At the start of this year we gave it an honourable mention as a game which we thought would definitely turn out to be vapourware Now though , it looks like we may have to admit that we were wrong .
Not only has EA confirmed thatwill be out in time for the holidays , but the game is now in a fully playable state .
All that is left to do is polish up a few glitches , test it and load it with content before release .
How do we know that , I hear you ask .
Simple ; we ’ve played it — nearly all of it .
There are five stages or levels toand we ’ve played them all on the PC , as well as playing on the DS and Mobile versions of the game – though the latter failed to make as much of an impression , to be frank .
The first level is a basic arcade type game where players guide their single cell about its existence , helping it eat other creatures and grow .
When it has grown enough it jumps into the Creature Stage , where players zoom their view out and manage the more complex needs of their creation .
Survival skills must be complemented by socialisation skills as players enable their creature to build a tribe .
In Tribe stage the game zooms out once more and players are no longer controlling a single alien .
In this stage it ’s more likeas you monitor the needs of a small tribe as they carve out a niche in the alien landscape .
The penultimate stage of the game is the Civilisation Stage where it transitions fromintoand you ’ll be controlling whole cities in cultures .
The last stage is the Space Stage where you hop off your polluted little rock and find new playgrounds to party in .

The man once regarded as the world 's most powerful banker has bluntly declared that the Iraq war was ' largely ' about oil .
Appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and retired last year after serving four presidents , Alan Greenspan has been the leading Republican economist for a generation and his utterings instantly moved world markets .
In his long - awaited memoir - out tomorrow in the US - Greenspan , 81 , who served as chairman of the US Federal Reserve for almost two decades , writes : ' I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . '
In The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World , he is also crystal clear on his opinion of his last two bosses , harshly criticising George W Bush for ' abandoning fiscal constraint ' and praising Bill Clinton 's anti-deficit policies during the Nineties as ' an act of political courage ' .
He also speaks of Clinton 's sharp and ' curious ' mind , and ' old - fashioned ' caution about the dangers of debt .
Greenspan 's damning comments about the war come as a survey of Iraqis , which was released last week , claims that up to 1.2 million people may have died because of the conflict in Iraq - lending weight to a 2006 survey in the Lancet that reported similarly high levels .
More than one million deaths were already being suggested by anti-war campaigners , but such high counts have consistently been rejected by US and UK officials .
The estimates , extrapolated from a sample of 1,461 adults around the country , were collected by a British polling agency , ORB , which asked a random selection of Iraqis how many people living in their household had died as a result of the violence rather than from natural causes .
Previous estimates gave a range between 390,000 and 940,000 , the most prominent of which - collected by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and reported in the Lancet in October 2006 - suggested 654,965 deaths .
Although the household survey was carried out by a polling organisation , rather than researchers , it has again raised the spectre that the 2003 invasion has caused a far more substantial death toll than officially acknowledged .
The ORB survey follows an earlier report by the organisation which suggested that one in four Iraqi adults had lost a family member to violence .
The latest survey suggests that in Baghdad that number is as high as one in two .
If true , these latest figures would suggest the death toll in Iraq now exceeds that of the Rwandan genocide in which about 800,000 died .
The Lancet survey was criticised by some experts and by George Bush and British officials .
In private , however , the Ministry of Defence 's chief scientific adviser Sir Roy Anderson described it as ' close to best practice ' .
