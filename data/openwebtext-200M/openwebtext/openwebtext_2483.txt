For farmers , this stinks : Belching and gaseous cows and hogs could start costing them money if the federal government decides to charge fees for air - polluting animals .
Farmers are turning their noses up at the notion , which they contend is a possible consequence of an Environmental Protection Agency report after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases from motor vehicles amount to air pollution .
“ This is one of the most ridiculous things the federal government has tried to do , ” said Alabama Agriculture & Industries Commissioner Ron Sparks .
EPA officials insisted Friday that the report , which mostly focuses on other sources of air pollution , does not include a proposal to tax livestock .

But the American Farm Bureau Federation said , based on federal agriculture department figures , it would require farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows , 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs to pay an annual fee of about $ 175 for each dairy cow , $ 87.50 per head of beef cattle and $ 20 for each hog .
The executive vice president of Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation , Ken Hamilton , estimated the fee would cost owners of a modest - size cattle ranch $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 a year .
He said he has talked to a number of livestock owners about the proposals , and “ all have said if the fees were carried out , it would bankrupt them . ”
Farm groups say the fee would apply to farms with livestock operations that emit more than 100 tons of carbon emissions in a year and fall under federal Clean Air Act provisions .
EPA officials said the agency has n’t taken a position on any of the matters discussed in its response to the Supreme Court ruling .
John Millett , spokesman for EPA ’s air and radiation division , said the EPA report was oversimplified “ to the point of distortion . ”

“ EPA is not proposing any type of tax on livestock , ” he said .
Farmers have expressed outrage over the EPA report , both on Internet sites and in opinions sent to EPA during a public comment period that ended last week .
“ It ’s something that really has a very big potential adverse impact for the livestock industry , ” said Rick Krause of the American Farm Bureau Federation .
Abu Dhabi announced at a summit of world leaders on renewable energy yesterday that it would become the first petro - driven economy to make a significant commitment to renewables – and it is partly thanks to Prince Charles .
Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan , crown prince of Abu Dhabi , has decreed that 7 % of power will come from green energy sources by 2020 .
The Middle East nation holds around 8 % of the world 's oil reserves and derives the vast bulk of its national income from fossil fuels , but while other OPEC oil cartel members see renewables as a threat , it has taken a different view .
Sultan Al Jaber , chief executive of the state - owned future energy company Masdar , which will oversee the green drive , said at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi that it was natural tomove into this new sector .
By doing so Masdar would " provide a comprehensive solution to the world 's energy challenges and maintain Abu Dhabi 's position as a leading supplier of energy to the world . "
The Gulf state , a part of the United Arab Emirates , also wants to differentiate itself from neighbour Dubai , and diversify its economy , believing a " green " infrastructure will help its image as a new tourist destination .
Abu Dhabi has already put itself forward as a possible location for the headquarters of a planned International Renewable Energy Agency being promoted by Germany .
" Many [ Opec members ] see renewables as a threat but the crown prince sees them as an opportunity , " said a source close to the Abu Dhabi state .
" He knows that the oil will eventually run out and he wants to ensure there is something left for future generations , " he added .
Prince Charles , who has close links to the Gulf royals , has been actively encouraging the green initiative behind the scenes , the source added , explaining that the Masdar executives had been invited to Buckingham Palace last year .
Prince Charles is already a patron of the Masdar City project which aims to build the world 's first carbon - neutral city in Abu Dhabi .
He made an appearance by holographic video link at the first World Future Energy Summit held in the Gulf state last year .
Prince Andrew has also become involved and was present at the meeting in the throne room at Buckingham Palace .
Masdar expects to mainly use solar energy to reach its 7 % targets but is also looking at wind and even geothermal power , where heat from the ground is used as a power source .
Masdar has already built links to Britain by investing with E.ON of Germany and DONG of Denmark in the London Array wind farm project of the coast of Kent which is tipped to be the biggest of its kind in the world .
The Abu Dhabi state stepped in when Shell pulled out of the £ 1bn project .
The Anglo - Dutch oil group said it was concentrating its wind investment in the US , a move followed by BP .
Masdar has $ 15 bn worth of state - funding and has already started to build up its solar power business through a joint venture with Germany , a leader in the photovoltaics field .
A new company , Masdar PV , will build manufacturing plants in both Germany and Abu Dhabi that will serve the growing demand for solar power , which is beginning to compete on a cost basis with traditional energy sources , even without subsidies .
Dutch solar firm Econcern claimed today at the summit that prices of solar panels would half in the next five to six years .
It claimed the global industry had already met the International Energy Agency 's target of 10 GW of installed power by 2020 .
The One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project , which develops low - cost education - oriented mobile computers to sell to governments in developing countries , has donated 5,000 units of its flagship XO laptop to Palestinian children in the Gaza strip .
According to the Journal of New England Technology , OLPC has given the Linux - based laptops to the United Nations Relief Workers Agency ( UNRWA ) so that they can be distributed to young refugees who are attending UNRWA schools .
The move is a generous one , especially since the OLPC group is currently facing serious financial challenges .
OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte announced a major change in direction this month when he revealed that the organization was downsizing half of its staff and significantly scaling back its software development efforts .
Along with these cuts , Negroponte said that the organization would be increasing its activity in the Middle East and renewing its focus on delivering its next - generation product .
The organization 's charitable move in the Gaza strip appears to be the first sign of its stronger emphasis on the Middle East .
The OLPC project is currently in a very weak position .
The organization has suffered numerous setbacks and has become mired in internal disputes that leave little hope for its future .
Despite its declining viability , OLPC is clearly still determined to do some good .
It is still unclear whether the latest reorganization attempt will ultimately be able to put OLPC back on track .

Faced with increasing broadcast fees and limited success with visual ads , Pandora , the streaming radio service that grew out of the Music Genome project , has begun including in - stream advertisements as a way to raise revenue .
Pandora previously experimented with in - stream ads , but scrapped the idea due to negative feedback .
Now , however , it would appear that Pandora is feeling the pinch ( the company also recently laid off staff ) enough to give the ads another try , despite the initial negative reaction .
The new ads , which Pandora acknowledged last night via its Twitter account , began running yesterday when users reported hearing an short , 15 - second ad for the Fox TV show Lie To Me .
The initial ad showed up after listening to about 10 songs .
For many the ad ran again about 20 songs later and then went away .
Naturally , listeners were not happy and number of Twitter posts were vehement in their objections , prompting Pandora to respond : " so you know , we did not take on audio ads lightly .
We try to be extremely respectful of your listening experience , & promise to be prudent . "
The ads will only be heard on Pandora 's free services , like the web - based application and the very popular iPhone app .
Those of you who have paid the $ 36 yearly subscription fee for Pandora 's premium service will not be subjected to ads .
While it was nice to be able to stream Pandora for free with no ads , like so many free services on the web , it appears those days are over .
Your options are to put up with the ads , pay the yearly fee ( which is significantly cheaper than XM or Sirius radio ) or move to another service like Slacker or Last. fm .
Although a number of users are up in arms about the change , with some promising to leave Pandora , most users seem to recognize that Pandora needs to make some money if it hopes to stay in business .
So how about it , Pandora listeners ?
Are the ads OK with you ?
Or will you be paying for premium , ad - free service ?
Or moving on to another free , streaming music service without ads ?

For China ’s notoriously conservative propaganda czars , the decision to allow President Obama ’s inauguration speech to be beamed live into the nation ’s homes was bold .
It backfired as soon as Mr. Obama said the C - word — communism .
Chinese who stayed up into the early hours to watch the historic swearing - in ceremony , looked on as the state - run China Central Television ( CCTV ) abruptly cut away from its coverage of Mr. Obama ’s address when he spoke of how “ earlier generations faced down fascism and communism . ”
The censors did n’t wait to hear the rest of the offending sentence — “ not just with missiles and tanks , but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions ” and proceeded to mute the Chinese interpreter , abandon the shot of the U.S. Capitol and seek refuge with a flustered studio anchor .
She in turn passed the buck to an unprepared analyst via video link , asking her to comment on the United States ’ economic woes .
What had begun as a promising exercise in openness degenerated into a familiar display of paranoia from the country ’s publicity department .
Chinese newspaper readers did n’t fare much better .
The official translation carried by the state news agency Xinhua omitted Mr. Obama ’s reference to communism and wiped out a whole paragraph : “ To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent , know that you are on the wrong side of history , but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . ”
The censored translation was published on the country ’s main Internet portals Sina and Sohu .
However , in another example of censorship struggling to cope with the power of the Internet , leading news portal Netease retained the reference to dissent , only removing the word “ communism . ”
Several Internet users posted their own undoctored translations of Mr. Obama ’s speech and left angry comments criticizing the censors ’ actions .
Some posted YouTube links of CCTV ’s hasty programming shift .
The English transcript of the speech , printed in the state - run China Daily newspaper , was unaltered .
This version was also posted on some Chinese - language Internet forums with one commenter suggesting users “ play spot the difference . ”
The decision by CCTV to suspend its live feed of Mr. Obama ’s inaugural address comes a week after the broadcaster was forced to defend its record in the face of a proposed boycott of its programs by more than 20 Chinese lawyers , writers and intellectuals .
An open letter published on the Chinese - language Web site Boxun.com titled “ Boycott CCTV , Resist Brainwashing , ” said the network had failed the Chinese people by bombarding them with propaganda .
Wang Jianhong , deputy director of the CCTV general editing department , told the Associated Press last week that “ CCTV in the future will respect the discipline of news , use the truth to speak and stick to the principle of reporting truth . ”
Yet the country ’s state media chose the day after the inauguration to express official concerns that U.S. - China relations could dip under a new U.S. president .
Some observers say that China ’s leaders will be sorry to see the back of George Bush , who has been heralded here for his free - trade policies and for not criticizing the Communist Party ’s human rights record when in Beijing for the Olympics last summer .
“ The guesswork here concentrates on how President Obama will position ties with China .
Given the popular American eagerness for a break from the Bush years , many wonder , or worry to be precise , whether the new president would ignore the hard - earned progress in bilateral ties , ” said a China Daily editorial .
After criticizing many of Mr. Bush ’s foreign policy decisions and calling the Iraq war an “ outstanding discredit to his country and himself , the editorial went on to praise Mr. Obama ’s predecessor : “ Let us be fair and honest — the Bush years were not devoid of merits .
Anchoring relationship between the world ’s single superpower and the largest developing country is no easy job .
But the Bush administration managed it . ”
Other Chinese are less nostalgic .
Wu Xinbo , vice president of the Shanghai Institute of American Studies , pointed out that the Bush administration ’s moves to strengthen its military presence in the Western Pacific were “ not in China ’s interests .
“ We are not really sorry to see Bush go , ” he said .
“ We have been able to develop stable and cooperative relations with Bush but we believe that Obama is a healthy force for China - U.S. relations . ”
He added , “ We know that Obama ’s priority will be the economy .
This could create frictions , but we also understand that Obama is a smart , sophisticated person who has a full picture of China - U.S. relations .
We understand he believes in globalization , and in these times of economic difficulty , globalization cannot flourish under protectionism . ”

OTTAWA
S tephen Harper 's decision to appoint the biggest one - time contingent of senators to the Upper House is first and foremost another case of the Prime Minister doing what is probably the right thing for the wrong partisan reasons .
Notwithstanding the government spin , it is not a move forced upon Harper by the unexpected threat that an opposition coalition could use its highly hypothetical time in power to fill the Upper House with opponents of Senate reform .
That 's just circumstantial sugar - coating to make the bitter pill of Harper 's latest unkept promise easier for the Conservative rank - and - file to swallow .
A tentative list of Senate appointees was actually in the works long before the current parliamentary crisis materialized .
Harper signalled his intention on the morning after the Oct. 14 election .
Would - be senators certainly took notice .
They have been lobbying the government hard every since .
But by the same token , the move is not just the blatant attempt to stack the Senate on the eve of a possible defeat of the government that the opposition is portraying .
Sending 18 Conservatives to partisan heaven will not shift the balance of power in favour of the government in the Upper House .
And 12 more vacancies will be opening up in 2009 , giving any incoming Liberal government ample opportunity to bolster an already healthy Senate majority .
In some ways , the Conservative appointments are actually overdue .
In the end , the Senate as an institution will be better off for them .
Like it or not , the Upper House is an essential part of the legislative apparatus .
And it is best able to acquit itself of its constitutionally mandated duty when there is adequate representation on both sides of its chamber .
That is not the case now .
For 15 years and with only one or two exceptions , Senate appointees have been Liberals .
The party holds a solid majority of 58 seats in the 105 - member house .
Their long exile from power , combined with the Prime Minister 's refusal to fill most vacancies over his first mandate , have reduced Conservative ranks to only 20 senators , less than one for every two of the opposition .
As a result , government resources are stretched beyond the limit .
For lack of Conservative members to sit on committees , the Senate is operating on half of its ancient cylinders .
Harper drove the Upper House to this dysfunction by holding out on appointments long after it became obvious that his plans for an elected senate were dead in the water .
On that score , the fact that there is not enough opposition support for the Conservative reform in the minority Parliament is a bit of a red herring .
Should Harper or one of his successors go ahead with a unilateral plan to reform the Senate , a number of provinces will head to the courts .
In the best - case scenario , a settlement of the issue could be years of constitutional litigation away , whether the Prime Minister asserts control of both houses of Parliament or not .
But meanwhile , Parliament needs to continue to function .
In the circumstances , the potential addition of extra Liberal senators that Stéphane Dion unwisely alluded to earlier this month would have amounted to compounding a wrong with another wrong .
Painting the Senate a deeper shade of red would have made it so one - sided as to trump the legislative dynamics for years to come .
Frankly , the last thing the Liberals need at this juncture is a caucus where senators outnumber MPs .

Opponents of the euro say the pound is a key part of British sovereignty A BBC poll has found that 71 % of people would vote against Britain joining the euro if it were put to a referendum .
The survey of 1,000 adults revealed that just 23 % would vote " yes " to joining the European single currency , while 6 % said they were unsure .
Only 15 % said the recent fall in the value of the pound against the euro made them more likely to vote " yes " , while 69 % said it made no difference .
Sixteen countries now use the euro , which was introduced 10 years ago .
Slovakia became the latest country to start using the currency on New Year 's Day .
Recently the pound has plummeted against the euro and some have suggested that it could be time for Britain to join the single currency .
While at the beginning of 2008 a pound was worth 1.34 euros , it now only buys just over one euro .
But the BBC poll , for Radio 4's The World at One , appears to show that recent developments have done little to improve the euro 's image in the eyes of ordinary voters .
' Not now '
The Europe minister , Caroline Flint , said a debate about joining the euro was a red herring , adding that changing currency would not solve the economic crisis .
" I actually agree with the people who took part in this opinion poll , " she said .
" It 's not surprising to me ... when people are facing problems with their housing , problems on the job front .
" Those are the first order issues we have to deal with , and changing the currency is not a solution to tackling the financial stability . "
Similar surveys carried out by the BBC in past years show how the pattern of support for the euro has changed .
It was least popular in November 2000 , when 71 % were opposed to it and just 18 % were in favour .
At its most popular in January 2002 , 31 % of people said they would vote " yes " to joining , while 56 % opted for " no " .
While all economies are suffering , some eurozone countries are now in an impossible position
Dr John Whittaker , UKIP
Market data Last month , European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said the UK was " closer than ever " to joining the euro and that the " people who matter " in British politics were contemplating giving up the pound .
But Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said that while joining was still the government 's long - term policy aim , such a move was " not for now " .
Meanwhile , the shadow foreign secretary reportedly told the Daily Mail newspaper that the Tories under David Cameron " would never join the euro " .
William Hague was quoted as saying : " A Conservative government under David Cameron would have no ministers telling Brussels we would be better off without the pound and no goal of joining the euro one day . "
The BBC 's political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said Tory sources insisted the party 's position on the single currency had not changed .
But our correspondent said that the Conservatives ' most recent election manifesto had not used the word " never " with respect to the euro .
' Euro weakness '
The UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) , which wants Britain to withdraw from the European Union , burned a bundle of euro notes outside the Bank of England of Thursday to mark the single currency 's 10th birthday .
Dr John Whittaker , UKIP MEP for the North West , said the credit crunch had now exposed the euro's " real weakness " .
" While all economies are suffering , some eurozone countries are now in an impossible position , " he said .
" What these countries need is lower interest rates and devaluation but , stuck in the euro , there is nothing they can do . "
The poll was carried out by ICM between 19 and 21 December 2008 .

Mr. Stevens ’s former aides are hardly the only Washington lobbyists to rise and fall with a single Congressional patron .
Representative John D. Dingell , the powerful Michigan Democrat first elected in 1955 , long sustained a coterie of lobbyists sometimes known as the Dingell Bar .
They , too , are feeling the pinch at the moment from his recent loss to Representative Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California , of the gavel as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
But Mr. Stevens  Alaska ’s “ Uncle Ted ”  is in a class by himself .
For most of the last decade he was a dominant voice on both the Senate appropriations and commerce committees , which govern federal spending and business regulation .
He had formed such a tight alliance with Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii , a Democratic counterpart on both panels  they called each other “ brother ” or sometimes “ co- chairman ”  that their influence barely waned when one or the other party lost power .
“ One of the things that made a Stevens lobbyist so valuable is that he could deliver , ” said Ross K. Baker , a political scientist at Rutgers who studies the Senate .
“ When somebody who had his ear said something would happen , it usually happened .
You could really trade on it .
It was the coin of the realm . ”
Mr. Stevens ’s preference for one lobbyist over another was big news in industry trade publications , and he did not hesitate to exert his influence .

When his friend and former aide Mitch Rose was angling for a job as president of the National Association of Broadcasters three years ago  one of the loftiest perches on K Street , which had paid its previous occupant more than $ 1 million a year  Mr. Stevens and his staff all but threatened to shut out any other hires .
“ Regardless of what the N.A.B. does or does n’t do , Senator Stevens ’s go - to guy on broadcasting issues will still be Mitch Rose , ” a top Stevens aide , Lisa Sutherland , told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call , warning that Mr. Rose ’s rival “ starts with a serious handicap , not knowing the issues and not knowing the people . ”
When the group passed over Mr. Rose nonetheless , Mr. Stevens toasted his protégé to a room of communications industry lobbyists at a start - up party for his new one - man lobbying shop .
Bolstered by the endorsement , Mr. Rose reaped more than $ 1.2 million in lobbying fees over the next nine months , according to his filings .
MONTREAL , Oct. 8 ( UPI ) -- A Canadian man is suing the Loto - Quebec corporation over a lottery ticket that took 7 seconds too long to print and lost him $ 13.5 million .
The suit is over a $ 27 million Super Seven drawing May 23 that would have been split two ways , The Gazette newspaper in Montreal reported .

Joel Ifergan said that on a whim he went into a convenience store and asked if he still had time to play before the 9 p.m. deadline , he told the Globe and Mail newspaper .
The clerk said " It 's 8:59 , " so he paid for two tickets .
The first one printed instantly , but the second one took 7 seconds to print , and showed it an entry for the following week 's draw , Ifergan said .
His suit claims Loto - Quebec technicians admitted to a delay of as long as 10 seconds in completing a ticket purchase , particularly when jackpots are high .
Ifergan told the Globe he had paid his money before the deadline .
" I played by their rules -- I purchased a ticket prior to 9 p.m .
It 's not my fault their technology is slow , " he said to the Globe and Mail .
Stalin continues to be popular with many Russians Former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was beaten by medieval prince Alexander Nevsky in a poll held by a TV station to find the greatest Russian .
Stalin came third , despite being responsible for the deaths of millions of Soviets in labour camps and purges .
Alexander Nevsky fought off European invaders in the 13th century to preserve a united Russia .
In second place was reformist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin , who was assassinated in 1911 .
More than 50 million people voted by phone , the internet or via text messages in the poll held by Rossiya , one of Russia 's biggest television stations .
The voting took place over six months as 500 original candidates were whittled down to a final 12 .
Rehabilitation campaign Stalin - an ethnic Georgian - was riding high for many months and was in the number one slot at one point until the show 's producer appealed to viewers to vote for someone else , says the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow .
Stalin sent millions of people to their deaths in the work camps of the Gulag .
Millions more perished in political purges or during the forced collectivisation of farms during his rule from the 1920s to his death in 1953 .
Many in Russia do still revere Stalin for his role during World War II when the Soviet Union defeated the forces of Nazi Germany .
The poll was conducted online and by phone and text message
But now there is a much broader campaign to rehabilitate Stalin and it seems to be coming from the highest levels of government , says our correspondent .
" We now have to think very seriously , why the nation chooses to put [ Joseph ] Stalin in third place , " said actor and film director Nikita Mikhalkov , one of the contest 's judges , after the results were released .
Nevsky fought off Swedish and Germanic invasions to preserve medieval Russia .
He also pursued a conciliatory policy with the powerful Mongol rulers to protect Russia 's eastern flank .
He was canonised as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church in the 16th century .
Stolypin is remembered for his attempts to modernise agriculture and stifle leftist revolutionaries as prime minister under Tsar Nicholas II .

Judicial Watch Announces Hillary Clinton Constitutionally Ineligible to Serve as Secretary of State
Judicial Watch , the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption , announced today that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is constitutionally ineligible to serve as Secretary of State in the Obama administration .
According to the Ineligibility Clause of the United States Constitution , no member of Congress can be appointed to an office that has benefited from a salary increase during the time that Senator or Representative served in Congress .
A January 2008 Executive Order signed by President Bush during Hillary Clinton ’s current Senate term increased the salary for Secretary of State , thereby rendering Senator Clinton ineligible for the position .
Specifically , Article I , section 6 of the U.S. Constitution provides " No Senator or Representative shall , during the Time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time . "
The provision is seen by most as designed by our Founding Fathers to protect against corruption .
Former President Richard Nixon circumvented this constitutional provision after appointing former Ohio Senator William Saxbe to the position of Attorney General .
The Nixon administration managed to force legislation through Congress to reduce the salary for the position of Attorney General to the level that existed prior to Senator Saxbe ’s appointment .
This scheme , known thereafter as " The Saxbe Fix , " was also used to allow Senator Lloyd Bentsen to assume the position of Treasury Secretary under President Clinton .
" The Saxbe Fix " may reduce the salary of Secretary of State to previous levels , but it does not affect what is a clear constitutional prohibition .
It cannot change the fact that the salary had been increased while Senator Clinton served in Congress .
( President Ronald Reagan reportedly did not appoint Senator Orrin Hatch to the Supreme Court because of this provision . )
Simply put , the Constitution does not provide for a legislative remedy for the Ineligibility Clause .
" There ’s no getting around the Constitution ’s Ineligibility Clause , so Hillary Clinton is prohibited from serving in the Cabinet until at least 2013 , when her current term expires , " said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton .
" Barack Obama should select someone who is eligible for the position of Secretary of State and save the country from a constitutional battle over Hillary Clinton ’s confirmation .
No public official who has taken the oath to support and defend the Constitution should support this appointment .
And aside from the constitutional issue , Hillary Clinton ’s long track record of corruption makes her a terrible choice to serve as the nation ’s top diplomat . "

Among these fetishes is the prohibition against “ split verbs , ” in which an adverb comes between an infinitive marker like “ to , ” or an auxiliary like “ will , ” and the main verb of the sentence .
According to this superstition , Captain Kirk made a grammatical error when he declared that the five - year mission of the starship Enterprise was “ to boldly go where no man has gone before ” ; it should have been “ to go boldly . ”
Likewise , Dolly Parton should not have declared that “ I will always love you ” but “ I always will love you ” or “ I will love you always . ”
Any speaker who has not been brainwashed by the split - verb myth can sense that these corrections go against the rhythm and logic of English phrasing .
The myth originated centuries ago in a thick - witted analogy to Latin , in which it is impossible to split an infinitive because it consists of a single word , like dicere , “ to say . ”
But in English , infinitives like “ to go ” and future - tense forms like “ will go ” are two words , not one , and there is not the slightest reason to interdict adverbs from the position between them .
Though the ungrammaticality of split verbs is an urban legend , it found its way into The Texas Law Review Manual on Style , which is the arbiter of usage for many law review journals .
James Lindgren , a critic of the manual , has found that many lawyers have “ internalized the bogus rule so that they actually believe that a split verb should be avoided , ” adding , “ The Invasion of the Body Snatchers has succeeded so well that many can no longer distinguish alien speech from native speech . ”
In his legal opinions , Chief Justice Roberts has altered quotations to conform to his notions of grammaticality , as when he excised the “ ain ’t ” from Bob Dylan ’s line “ When you ai n’t got nothing , you got nothing to lose . ”
On Tuesday his inner copy editor overrode any instincts toward strict constructionism and unilaterally amended the Constitution by moving the adverb “ faithfully ” away from the verb .
President Obama , whose attention to language is obvious in his speeches and writings , smiled at the chief justice ’s hypercorrection , then gamely repeated it .
Let ’s hope that during the next four years he will always challenge dogma and boldly lead the nation in new directions .

What is it about some baby monkey 's that make them look like tiny , adorable , old men ?
Clearly baby langurs provided the inspiration for Benjamin Button .
On a serious note , Francois ' langurs are an endangered species and this little fellow born at the Lincoln Park Zoo will contribute to a Species Survival Plan , aiding conservation efforts .
Chicago , IL -- Lincoln Park Zoo is celebrating the birth of an endangered primate on Jan. 12 .
A female Francois ' langur named Pumpkin gave birth overnight to the infant .
The sex is currently unknown , and the baby has not yet been named .
This is Pumpkin ’s second offspring .
The langur group can be seen at the zoo ’s Helen Brach Primate House .
Francois ’ langurs are an endangered species from Southeast Asia .
The infants are born bright orange .
Scientists speculate the orange coloration may serve to attract other female langurs to help with the infant care process , a behavior known as allomothering .
Pumpkin has the aid of two other adult females to help care for this newborn .
Eventually the baby ’s color will gradually change from orange to black , like adult langurs , between 6 and 8 months of age .
Lincoln Park Zoo participates in the Francois ’ langur Species Survival Plan which is a cooperative effort among accredited zoos to save this species through scientifically managed breeding programs and conservation strategies .
The once hot display technology of OLED seems to have died down a little bit at this year ’s CES .
While there were still small instances of the OLED from the usual suspects , the trumpeting of the technology for common television viewing was absent .
In its place , however , were more interesting and alternative uses for the OLED .
Sony showed a flexible OLED display that could be worked into things such as a folding laptop screen or a bracelet .
Another OLED use that caught our eye was the transparent AMOLED , which could prove one day be used for high - resolution , full color heads - up displays .
See the image below for what we saw .
Will OLED eventually become just the main technology for our HDTVs and computer displays , or will it be for special use devices such as the one above ?
Discuss !
Dozens of Gazan smugglers were back on the border with Egypt today openly repairing and restarting tunnels between the two territories after three weeks of intense Israeli air strikes .
There were deep impact craters in the soil just a few hundred yards from the border , but many of the tunnels appeared to be at least partly intact .
Several tents covering tunnel entrances were still standing , though most were pockmarked by shrapnel .
Bulldozers were clearing away sand as men dug for the wood - reinforced wells that descend around 15 metres from the surface into the tunnels .
Israel set as one of its war aims in Gaza the destruction hundreds of tunnels that have brought goods in from Egypt for several years .
Most of what arrived was food , cigarettes , fuel , even farm animals - all intended to break Israel 's tough economic blockade - but some of the tunnels were used to bring in cash and weaponry for armed groups , including the Islamist movement Hamas , which runs Gaza .
On Saturday , the last day of the conflict , the Israeli military said it bombed more than 100 tunnels in southern Gaza .
Israel 's foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , is due to fly to Brussels later today in the hope of signing a deal under which the EU would provide forces to prevent border smuggling .
A similar deal was signed with the US .
However , none of that seemed to deter smugglers who returned to work within days of Israel 's ceasefire .
At one tent today , a labourer lowered himself down by an electric winch to the floor of a tunnel .
A generator was running outside , piping air in so he could breathe .
The owner , who refused to give his name , said his tunnel was around 300 metres long and had been built three months ago - during the previous ceasefire between Hamas and Israel .
It had cost him around $ 70,000 ( £ 50,000 ) - a cost usually shared between several people .
" I do n't know why they did n't bomb my tent , " he said . "
The bombs might target me at home or in the tunnels , wherever we are .
What can we do ? "
He said the bombing had caused some damage underground but it was minor and goods were already being brought through from Egypt .
Forty or so white sacks stacked up inside the tent had taken about 20 hours to bring through from the Egyptian side .
Each contained a box of 12 kerosene heaters .
The owner used to work in Israel but for several years work permits have been refused for most Palestinians and so , he said , he had turned to smuggling milk , chocolate , gas and kerosene .
Like many others , he believed the Egyptians were unlikely to stop the flow of commercial goods under the border because it offered a good business to those on both sides .
" I will try to buy them with money , " he said .
" I 'm not afraid of the Egyptians , just of the Israeli planes . "
Although commercial smuggling is restarting , there is likely to be heavy international pressure on Egypt to prevent weapons smuggling .
So far Egypt has resisted calls for an international force to be deployed on its side of the border .
Ever since Hamas won the Palestinian elections three years ago , Israel has imposed ever tighter economic pressure on the Gaza Strip , which for the past year and a half has amounted to a punitive blockade under which all exports were banned and only a restricted list of humanitarian goods were allowed in .
Even concrete is excluded .
Egypt has kept its Rafah crossing largely closed as well .
One of the main demands of Hamas has been that the crossings into Gaza should be allowed to reopen fully .
Israel is allowing in a number of lorries each day , but at a level far below what aid agencies and the UN say is the basic requirement .
Even before the war , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the blockade amounted to collective punishment of the civilian population .
The blockade is likely to remain for now .
Israel wants guarantees that no UN projects benefit Hamas and , diplomats say , it has asked the UN and other aid groups to give a detailed list of goods , equipment and staff they want to bring into Gaza .
Mark Regev , an Israeli government spokesman , said its ceasefire rested on not being attacked by Hamas but that did not mean it would deal directly with extremist Islamic group .
" Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire of offensive activities against Hamas , " he said .
" If Hamas does not attack Israel and does not provoke Israel , we will honour the ceasefire . "

Graphic Pictures of Aborted Babies !
Warning - Parental Consent Advised !
1. Graphic pictures of aborted babies ( click here ) .
These pictures are very graphic , but if you 're 18 years or older , we recommend you take a look so you can fully understand the impact of abortion .
Until you 've seen this link , it 's hard to understand how horrifying abortion really is .
Words alone can be deceiving .
Abortion is hard to debate , or even comprehend , until you 've seen the reality of what abortion really does to tiny , innocent babies before they are born .
That 's why you need to see these pictures .
Each photo speaks a thousand words about the horrors of abortion .
These are not ' blobs of tissue ' or ' products of conception . '
They are babies — and their mother 's ' choice ' ended their lives .
If you have the courage to look at these pictures , you 'll see the real consequences of abortion and the ' pro- choice ' movement .
There 's no question — these are babies .
How can anyone in their right mind say they are personally opposed to this brutal killing and then stand by and let it happen ?
As you look at these pictures , realize that you once lived in your mother 's womb for nine safe months .
Thank goodness your mother did n't abort you , otherwise . . .

A RARE piece of good news from the world of conservation : the global extinction crisis may have been overstated .
The world is unlikely to lose 100 species a day , or half of all species in the lifetime of people now alive , as some have claimed .
The bad news , though , is that the lucky survivors are tiny tropical insects that few people care about .
The species that are being lost rapidly are the large vertebrates that conservationists were worried about in the first place .
This new view of the prospects for biodiversity emerged from a symposium held this week at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC , but the controversy over how bad things really are has been brewing since 2006 .
That was when Joseph Wright of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and Helene Muller - Landau of the University of Minnesota first suggested that the damage might not be as grim as some feared .
They reasoned that because population growth is slowing in many tropical countries , and people are moving to cities , the pressure to cut down primary rainforest is falling and agriculturally marginal land is being abandoned , allowing trees to grow .
This regrown “ secondary ” forest is crucial to the pair 's analysis .
Within a few decades of land being abandoned , half of the original biomass has returned .
Depending on what else is nearby , these new forests may then be colonised by animals and additional plants , and thus support many of the species found in the original forest .
Dr Wright and Dr Muller - Landau therefore reckon that in 2030 reasonably unbroken tropical forest will still cover more than a third of its natural range , and after that date its area — at least in Latin America and Asia — could increase .
Much of this woodland will be secondary forest , but even so they suggest that in Africa only 16 - 35 % of tropical - forest species will become extinct by 2030 , in Asia , 21 - 24 % and , in Latin America , fewer still .
Once forest cover does start increasing , the rate of extinction should dwindle .
There are , however , two criticisms of this analysis .
The first questions whether the raw data about forest cover are a good indicator of biodiversity , at least for big animals .
William Laurance , a colleague of Dr Wright 's , pointed out to the symposium that birds and mammals are more vulnerable to alterations in their habitat than are insects and other small animals .
His data suggest that even in some of the world 's best - protected primary forests , these species face severe pressures .
Elizabeth Bennett , of the Wildlife Conservation Society , an American conservation group , agreed and mentioned that for large birds and mammals , uncontrolled hunting for food and for trade is causing a phenomenon known as “ empty - forest syndrome ” .
She said that although many forests look healthy when viewed from a satellite , they are actually falling silent because many of their large animals have been removed for subsistence or profit .
Nonetheless , the symposium 's participants agreed that the number of species of large animals may no longer be reliable indicators of the status of the millions of other species that live in a forest , and about which far less is known .
Most species , as Nigel Stork of the University of Melbourne pointed out , are insects — and these are more resilient and much less threatened .
A diversity of opinion
The second criticism of Dr Wright 's and Dr Muller - Landau 's view questions their interpretation of the link between a country 's population and its rate of deforestation .
Dr Laurance suggested this link may not be as strong in the future as it once was .
In the past two decades , he said , many parts of the tropics have seen a rise in industrial forms of land use such soya - bean farming , oil - palm plantations , and oil and gas development , together with the road - building and other construction projects that these bring in their wake .
Such activities vary with the demands of international markets , not the size of the local population .
In particular , Dr Laurance is worried that the liberalisation of agricultural trade and the rise of biofuels could lead to a huge increase in demand for land in the tropics .
What everyone agreed , though , was that climate change is a threat .
Even the optimistic Dr Wright is worried .
He warned the meeting that because many tropical species evolved in an environment that has very little temperature variation , they are not equipped to cope with an increase of as little as 3 ºC , which is the sort of change that many climate scientists predict .
Such species may thus have to migrate long distances if they are to survive .
He said that by the end of the century , 75 % of tropical forests will be warmer than today , and what will remain in these hot , wet places is unknown .

Mr Obama 's position on the Middle East differs little from President Bush 's " There is one president at a time . "
That is the mantra from the Obama transition team whenever it is confronted with an issue on which it would rather not comment .
It annoys senior Democrats like Representative Barney Frank , who said " that seriously overstates the number of presidents we have " .
And Mr Obama 's refusal to make any substantive comment on the situation in Gaza has also threatened to lose him support in the Arab world .
But the US constitution makes it pretty clear who is in charge at the moment and until 20 January , that person is George W Bush .
Power vacuum Mr Obama does not have the legal authority to back his words with actions ; he does not have an administration in place and he risks complicating what has otherwise been a smooth transition process if he decides to take on the presidential mantle before he is sworn in .
Yet it is not quite as simple as that , of course .
There is a power vacuum in Washington at the moment - as there always is in the waning weeks of any administration .
We can't have two voices coming out of the United States when you have so much at stake
Barack Obama
But so profound is this one that the Obama team decided to raise the president - elect 's profile in the weeks after his election .
He reassured financial markets that he was working behind the scenes on a far - reaching economic stimulus package .
When Mr Obama arrived in Washington , his first appointment was with the House Speaker , Nancy Pelosi , because as he said " the business of the people cannot wait " .
He has made statements on the economy , the carmakers ' bail - out , and the attacks in Mumbai - so why so little on Gaza ?
Well , with the exception of Mumbai , he has spoken only about domestic issues - seen as fair game for an incoming president .
The attacks in India were far more clear - cut than the turmoil in Gaza .
They were an unusual event which presented no lingering policy issues and required no continuing diplomacy .
And that is key .
Mr Obama has reiterated that it is President Bush who is responsible for American diplomacy .
" When it comes to foreign affairs it is particularly important to adhere to the principle of one president at a time , " he said .
" There are delicate negotiations taking place right now and we can't have two voices coming out of the United States when you have so much at stake . "
Changing landscape Gaza is a political minefield for Mr Obama .
If he makes a statement that suggests he would pursue a different Middle East policy from that of the Bush team , it would pull the rug from under the current administration 's diplomatic efforts in the region .
It would also cost him Republican goodwill at home if he were to undermine President Bush in that way .
If he issues a statement which puts him in lock step with the Bush team 's approach , then he loses flexibility when the issue arrives in his in - tray in two weeks time .
Whatever he says now will be regarded as policy , but the political landscape in the Middle East could be quite different when he is sworn in .
It may be that events on the ground create overwhelming pressure on Mr Obama to make a more substantive statement .
If so , he will have to weigh up the diplomatic and political damage done by saying little , against the damage done by saying something which will inevitably be condemned by one of the players in the region - and could come back to haunt him .
In fact , nothing he has said on the Middle East in the past has been significantly out of step with President Bush 's policies .
Visiting the Israeli town of Sderot in July , he suggested that he too would respond if rockets were being fired at his house .
He has also spoken about the problem of negotiating with Hamas when it is " not representative of a nation state , does not recognise [ Israel 's ] right to exist , has consistently used terror as a weapon and is deeply influenced by other countries " .
However , he has always been careful to avoid definitive statements which lock him into a particular course of action .
All recent presidents have made some kind of policy shift in their efforts to find peace in the Middle East - President Bush was the first to call openly for a two - state solution , for example .
But there is very little political advantage for Barack Obama in revealing his hand before he sits at the table for real .

Variable Electric Generator Improves Wind Power Efficiency
An interesting article in MIT 's Technology Review reports on a generator for wind turbines that can harvest electric power over a wider range of wind speeds .
ExRo Technologies , a startup based in Vancouver , BC , has developed a new kind of generator that 's well suited to harvesting energy from wind .
It could lower the cost of wind turbines while increasing their power output by 50 percent .
The new generator runs efficiently over a wider range of conditions than conventional generators do .
When the shaft running through an ordinary generator is turning at the optimal rate , more than 90 percent of its energy can be converted into electricity .
But if it speeds up or slows down , the generator 's efficiency drops dramatically .
If the cost delta for this generator design is small enough then the 50 % boost in electric power could greatly improve the economics of wind electric power .
The generator works by switching in more magnetic coils as turbine speed increases .
ExRo's new design replaces a mechanical transmission with what amounts to an electronic one .
That increases the range of wind speeds at which it can operate efficiently and makes it more responsive to sudden gusts and lulls .
Here 's the company 's description of their Variable Input Electric Generator ( VIEG ) :
Rather than layering individual legacy machines one on top of the next , the VIEG uses a series of coils , configured in " balanced stages " .
The magnetic balancing allows the use of permanent magnets , yet still reduces cogging torque to a bare minimum , which allows the VIEG to operate at extremely low wind speeds ( near zero ) .
As available energy increases , the VIEG matches generator resistance to source energy by electronically adding generator stages .
Conversely , the VIEG is able to drop stages as available energy ( wind speed ) drops , cycling up and down without hesitation and without mechanical friction .
The need for a gearbox is eliminated , and a single VIEG generator scales up and down with available energy in a way that would take almost 70 individual generators to match .
My guess is that wipespread deployment of this generator would also reduce the problem of wind intermittency since wind power would n't drop off suddenly below a threshold .
The power supplied would decay more slowly .
This would tend to make load balancing easier I would think .
Anyone know if this intuition is correct ?

Following the release of X18 - M and X25 - M solid state drives for general consumers late last year , and later on an X25 - E Extreme variant for the enterprise market , a recently leaked roadmap suggests Intel has plans to broaden its SSD line with higher - capacity models in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
According to the roadmap , Intel will double the size of its current X25 - E drives to 64GB and 128GB , while introducing a new 320 GB model in its mainstream X18 - M and X25 - M series on top of the current 80 GB and 160 GB capacities .
VR - Zone notes that the upcoming drives will all use 34nm flash memory chips – which is a sizeable shrink compared to the current 55nm process technology – and updated controllers to improve performance .
There is no mention of an actual release date or pricing for the drives nor has Intel offered any comment as to what performance improvements we can expect .

( CNN ) --
The U.S. military said it is investigating claims from Syria that U.S. helicopters based in Iraq killed eight people and wounded another Sunday in an attack inside Syria 's territory Sunday .
A U.S. army Apache helicopter flies over southern Baghdad , Iraq .
Syria 's state news agency SANA said four U.S. helicopters crossed the border and struck a farm about 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) inside Syria before returning to Iraqi airspace .
The raid occurred about 4:45 p.m. ( 1345 GMT ) .
The helicopters hit a civilian building under construction on the farm , killing a father and his four sons , a married couple and another man , SANA said .
Syria 's deputy foreign minister contacted the U.S. embassies in Damascus and Baghdad , SANA said .
Military officials are investigating the claims , Sgt. Brooke Murphy , a U.S. military spokeswoman , told CNN .
" Unfortunately , we cannot confirm anything at the moment , " she said .
The attack occurred near the town of Al - Bukamal , which is home to a Red Crescent camp for Iraqi refugees .
The town is across the border from the Iraqi city of Qaim , which has been a major route for Sunni Arab fighters battling U.S. troops in Iraq .
Watch CNN 's Cal Perry explain the implications of the possible attack »
Syria has said it has made efforts to secure the 600 - km desert border , which is marked largely by a sand wall .
But Maj. Gen. John Kelly , the U.S. commander in western Iraq 's sprawling Anbar province , told reporters last week that much of the border remains " uncontrolled . "
" We still have a certain level of foreign fighter movement , not much , through Anbar , because of our activities out there , " Kelly said .
But he said Iraqi intelligence believes al Qaeda operatives and others " live pretty openly on the Syrian side , and periodically we know that they try to come across . "
Syria demanded Iraq 's government " immediately investigate this serious violation " and bar U.S. forces from striking Syria from its territory .
The Syrian government summoned U.S. and Iraqi diplomats to the Foreign Ministry in Damascus to condemn the attack , SANA reported .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report , Nada Husseini , Mike Mount and Cal Perry contributed to this report .

[ Edit : no children were harmed in the making nor consumption of this cake .
People seemed to miss the point that I am a 25 - year - old woman on a diet with no kids .
Since kids do n't really need fat - free anything , there 's no need to use the soda recipe if you do n't like the idea , and if you do n't like dye , do n't make this for dinner for them every night for a month .
Okay , folks , thanks for the allowance to disclaim . ]
Aaannnndddd , she 's back !
So I did mention something about health and / or diet food in my last post , and while this recipe is the latter , it is most certainly not to be confused with the former .
I posted about my rainbow cake here , and it got a lot of traffic on over to my livejournal , and everyone wanted the " recipe . "
The cool thing is that if you 're making something so distractingly colourful , people will think it 's delicious no matter what .
This presents me with the option to use an old Weight Watchers trick — the one - point cupcake .
Except I 'm making a cake and I created my own frosting .
Kinda .
I 've seen it done before , but I swear I made it up first !
This cake is suitable for many occasions :
A child 's birthday
Your mom 's birthday
Coming out to your conservative parents
If you 're a lesbian , they 'll be thrilled that you wo n't be forgoing your feminine kitchen duties .
If you 're the kind of gay dude who makes cakes for your parents , they were probably on to you anyway .
Coming out to your conservative parents on your mother 's birthday
Your friend 's jam band CD release party
a can of soda ( 12 oz )
cake mix
30 oz
3/4 c
1/4 c
1 box
8 oz
usually it'll need an extra 5 or 10 minutes because of the density of the soda method
. . . so I 'm sure you 'll find a use for this recipe soon .
And of course , you can use any white cake recipe you 'd like .
This is just how I make it because I have delusions of wearing size 2 someday .
Oh yes , and do me a favour : DOUBLE THE RECIPE AS PHOTOGRAPHED HERE !!
The recipe at the bottom is accurate , but this made for a really REALLY small cake , and there was not nearly enough frosting , especially considering its lightness .
Okay , on with the ingredients .
That 's all .
Notice the lack of fat in here ?
Mmmmmm . . . chemicals .
Though I do n't need to defend my method thanks to the double - dub ( WW ) aspect , even when I make a " real " cake I usually use box mix because let 's face it : Betty 's been doing it way longer than I have , and has pretty much perfected the art .
Pour2 - 12 oz cans of soda into thetwo boxes of cake mix .
No eggs , no oil , no water , no sweat .
The action shots were n't too thrilling .
Now we measure it .
I 'm going to round to60 oz because I have six colours and is n't that just too convenient ?
It worked out to1.5 c per colour , measurementwise .
So I divvied that up and used my gel colours . ( the gel colours , while not as good as pigment dye , are much bolder than the very liquidy food colouring you probably grew up with )
The first colour you drop into the pan , use about 2/3 of the mix for that colour .
Otherwise , the top ( last ) colour will really dominate .
I used a heaping1 cup of each colour .
Drop the colours , one by one , into the middle of the pan , in neat concentric - ish gobs .
Remember the cake is going to be sliced in the side there , so mixing it around on top is n't going to make your slices any more psychedelic ( trust me , I did the three - dimensional thinking for you already ) .
When you 're three colours in , start doing the reverse with the other pan .
Since I 'm going in rainbow order : red , orange , yellow , green , blue , purple , I got from red to yellow in the first pan , then purple , blue , green in the second .
This is so that your two pans are equal if your measurements are n't exact ( and they 're not likely to be ) .
Now finish up .
Follow the box 's baking instructions and do your dishes .
Such lovely dishes !
Now for the frosting : 2 boxes of fat free sugar free pudding mix , and 16 oz ( two of the 8 oz tubs pictured ) of fat - free whipped topping .
Or sugar - free .
Or light .
Or regular .
They 're all pretty much the same .
But that 's it .
Holy shit , the cake 's done !
Toothpick clean and everything !
Get that shit out of the oven !!!
The purple top kind of made a little turkey silhouette .
The frosting will be a little tough to spread , so treat it like a buttercream ( I guess , I 've never frosted a cake with buttercream ) .
Putting gobs all over , then smoothing in worked well for me .
And look at that thing !
It 's so pretty - lookin .
Here 's what this particular cake looked like .
See how it 's tiny and too rounded and it kind of is n't all that great ?
That 's because I did n't double the recipe .
It 's a mistake I 'll only make once .
Here 's what that really should look like : same process , twice the batter .
Mmmmm.2 boxes white cake mix24 oz of clear diet soda ( 2 cans , ginger ale and sprite work well ) gel food colouring16 oz whipped topping2 oz instant fat - free sugar - free pudding mix ( 2 smallish boxes ) Mix the cake mix with the soda according to regular instructions on box .
It will be lumpy afterward .
Again , you can use any white cake recipe you want , this is just how I do it .
Measure the total volume ( by my estimate , 64 oz ) , then divide by 6 and measure into separate bowls .
There are 8 oz in a cup , so 64/6 = 10 to 11 oz , or 1 cup + 2 tbsp .
Stir colour into each bowl with its own spoon .
For the first colour into the pan , measure out 2/3 to 3 / 4 of your mix ( in this case about 1 c ) as close to the middle as you can .
Drop in your first three colours , then work on the other pan with the last three colours .
So if you 're doing rainbow order , the first pan should have red , then orange , then yellow , and now the purple , blue and green go into the second pan .
As a recap , this is so both layers are roughly the same size .
Bake the cake as instructed on the box .
Check it when the box says to , but .
Just keep baking , checking back every 5 minutes or so until a toothpick to the center comes out clean .
Let cool completely before moving to a wire rack .
Meanwhile , make your frosting .
Just mix the pudding mix in with the whipped topping for a few minutes .
Dye if you 're into that .
Frost your fat - free cake with your fat - free whipped frosting .
Eat .WW has long advertised 1/12 of a cake mix with diet soda to be a " one point cupcake . "
I have no idea why they insist this is the case when according to the " as packaged " nutrition information , this much cupcake has 170 calories , 3g fat and no fiber . . . by my calculation , that 's 4 points .
That said , 1/12 of this recipe , ( 2 box mixes + 16 oz whipped topping + 2 oz or so pudding mix ) works out to 10 points a slice .
Not bad considering that a comparable cake would be 14 points .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Laid - off workers whose sit-in at their closed factory came to symbolize Main Street ’s resentment of the Wall Street bailout accepted a settlement on Wednesday that provides them the severance they asked for and two months health care coverage , the parties involved said .
The workers occupying Republic Windows and Doors agreed to the deal worked out after days of negotiations that would provide each with about $ 7,000 , putting an end to the sit - in that began on Friday .
The total cost of $ 1.75 million was covered by a loan of $ 1.35 million provided by Bank of America Corp and $ 400,000 from JPMorgan Chase & Co , both creditors of Republic , said U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez , who helped mediate the negotiations .
Each of the more than 200 workers will be paid eight weeks salary , all accrued vacation and receive two months paid healthcare , Gutierrez said .
The workers , given just three days notice of the plant ’s closing last week , had demanded severance covering the legally mandated two - month notice period plus the vacation pay .
“ This money will only be used to pay the workers the benefits they are owed under the law , and it will not , under any circumstance , be used for corporate bonuses , luxury cars or any other perk for the owners of the plant , ” Gutierrez , an Illinois Democrat , said in a statement .
The workers ’ plight became a media sensation , with food donations pouring in and hundreds of protesters gathering outside Bank of America ’s Chicago headquarters , where negotiations among the parties were held this week .
Bank of America , which bore the brunt of the criticism , said Republic was unable to operate profitably and had lost $ 10 million over the past two years , during which time the bank said it had lent the company the maximum amount it could .
In July , JPMorgan wrote off $ 5 million in loans and a $ 7 million investment that gave it a 40 percent stake in Republic , and resigned its seat on the company ’s board , a spokesman said .
President - elect Barack Obama and other politicians have voiced support for the workers ’ cause , arguing the Wall Street bailout was not serving its purpose of loosening credit for Main Street businesses .
Bank of America has tapped the bailout for $ 15 billion and JPMorgan for $ 25 billion .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Banks getting money from the government 's $ 700 billion bailout fund will have to explain in detail what they are doing with the money , the incoming head of the Treasury Department said Thursday in written responses to questions from the Senate Finance Committee .
Timothy Geithner 's nomination to be Treasury Secretary was approved by the committee on an 18 - 5 vote on Thursday .
The full Senate will now take up Geithner 's nomination , probably not before next week .
The ranking Republican on the committee , Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa , voted against Geithner in the committee because he had n't paid all of his income taxes until reminded to do so by IRS auditors and the Obama transition team .
" The Treasury Secretary is in charge of the IRS , and must set a good example , " Grassley said .
In a 102 - page letter responding to questions from the panel , Geithner said would require banks to report quarterly on their overall lending activity in a " detailed and timely " manner as a condition for receiving the capital infusions from the government . '
The Treasury will issue a new quarterly report on lending and credit conditions in the United States , Geithner said .
Geithner said Treasury will require that banks provide information publicly about the value of each government investment , all of which is expected to be posted on the Treasury Department 's website .
The agency is also looking at other possible proposals to stabilize the economy , including one that would employ Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offer new mortgages with subsidized rates as low as 4.5 % .
He sidestepped questions about whether the Treasury Department would consider creating a government - backed institution that would buy and hold banks ' bad mortgage securities , a prospect many regulatory onlookers have speculated he is contemplating .
" I am considering a range of ideas and initiatives to restore stability to the financial system , " Geithner said .
He also rejected the idea that the Treasury Department would consider nationalization of financial institutions .
" Encouraging private investment in our banks and drawing private capital that is now on the sidelines is critical to ensuring that our financial institutions are stable and that our capital markets can return to more normal and healthy functioning , " Geithner said .
In addition to monitoring banks ' activities , Geithner said the Treasury Department will require banks to increase lending above baseline levels , but he did not provide details about what that minimum threshold might be .
" I intend to make sure that the ... funds are used to promote new lending activity , to implement aggressive measures to address the foreclosure crisis , in addition to stabilizing financial institutions , " he wrote .
However , Neil Barofsky , the bank bailout fund 's inspector general , said in a letter Thursday that he is requesting that participating banks provide his office details about how they are using the funds from documents that have been certified by senior executives .
Barofsky also said he is requesting in writing a description of plans executives have for complying with new CEO pay package restrictions .
Geithner also said he was committed to using between $ 50 billion and $ 100 billion of the remaining bank bailout funds in programs set up to alter mortgages of troubled homeowners in an attempt to mitigate foreclosure .
He also said he supports " reforming our bankruptcy laws , " indicating that he is endorsing legislation in Congress that would give bankruptcy judges the authority to alter mortgages in an attempt to stave off foreclosure .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she would give high priority to the bankruptcy measure and could include it as part of a fiscal stimulus package expected to be approved within weeks .
Sen . Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , said in his comments that he was disappointed with the level of disclosure regarding the government 's involvement in both the Bear Stearns deal in March and its $ 150 billion taxpayer bailout of American International Group AIG , - 1.23 % .
" It appears that the reported valuation of those assets may be overstated , " Grassley said .
Grassley also said he was concerned about a section of AIG 's marketing material that says the " actual debt to be repaid , " is $ 39 billion with the federal government removing any obligation for the company to repay about $ 110 billion .
Geithner said he and the New York Fed would need to " look more carefully " at AIG 's marketing material before responding .
China 's currency policy
President Barack Obama believes that China is manipulating its currency , Geithner said , which would be sharp change from previous administration 's China policy .
" President Obama has pledged as president to use aggressively all the diplomatic avenues open to him to seek change in China 's currency practices , " Geithner said in response to a written question from Sen.
Charles Schumer , D - N.Y .
As a senator from Illinois , Obama co-sponsored legislation that would overhaul the U.S. process for determining currency manipulation .
The legislation would authorize new enforcement measures against manipulators .
Geithner said Obama 's economic team is working on a strategy to achieve currency realignment .
" China can not continue to get a free pass for undermining fair - trade principles , " Geithner added .
Win Thin , a currency strategist at New York - based financial services company Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. said that Geithner 's comment " appears to be a step away from the policy of the previous administration . "
Thin says that even though " manipulation " does not meet the legal criteria required by Treasury to cite China for currency manipulation , it is seen as a step in that direction .
Geithner also said an immediate goal for the Obama administration 's China policy will be to convince China to adopt a more aggressive domestic stimulus package .

Fantasy and Science Fiction Books :
WASHINGTON  Former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , often mentioned as someone who could shepherd the GOP out of the political wilderness , says Republicans neglected religious conservatives this year and need to maintain their support as the party regroups .
" They were welcomed to the family table two days a year , and that was the primary and Election Day , " the former Arkansas governor said at a press conference Wednesday .
" I think there 's a point of frustration and exasperation where people are saying .
' You know what ?
If you do n't want us , just say so . "
Out with a new book , Do the Right Thing : Inside the Movement That 's Bringing Common Sense Back to America , Huckabee spoke about the past and future of the Republican Party .
" There should not be the disconnect between value voters and those who consider themselves the fiscal conservatives , " he said .
" The truth is , most value voters are fiscal conservatives , but not all fiscal conservatives are value voters . "
Huckabee said he has no immediate plans for a second White House run or for any other office and that the GOP would be " insane " if they tried to move away from issues like abortion or marriage that are key to religious conservatives .
" It 's been an important part of our overall message , which is that traditional values still reach many people in this country , " he said of the marriage issue .
" And I think the sanctity of life issue is still an issue that draws people to the Republican Party who otherwise might not necessarily feel that much of a loyalty .
It 's not that it 's the only issue , but it 's an issue that we have to be faithful to . "
But Huckabee also was critical of conservative religious leaders including Texas megachurch pastor John Hagee , religious broadcaster Pat Robertson , Bob Jones University Chancellor Bob Jones III and former GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer , who passed him over and endorsed other GOP candidates .
" I came to the conclusion that political expediency and pragmatism had supplanted prophetic principles among those who aspired to influence the process but unwittingly had become influenced by the process and , in fact , were held captive by it , " Huckabee wrote .
Bauer , chairman of the Campaign for Working Families , issued a statement Tuesday saying he was disappointed in Huckabee 's book .
" It is unfortunate ... at a time when the GOP needs to close ranks and seek unity , that Governor Huckabee in his new book has aimed his fire at his fellow Republicans , " Bauer said .
Huckabee said he expected his words would anger some readers .
" I 'm telling the honest facts of the story , " he said .
" I do n't think I 'm unfair or unkind , but I 'm honest . "
Huckabee said he thinks former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has " a great future ahead of her " after rallying the Republican base , but he was noncommittal about his own political future .
" I 'm not ruling anything out for the future but I 'm not making any specific plans to do something in the future politically , " he said .
A rocket fired from the Gaza Strip has hit southern Israel , exploding near the city of Ashkelon , the Israeli military has said .
No casualties were reported from the rocket , which landed in a field .
It is one of several rocket attacks from the territory since Israel and Hamas , which controls Gaza , declared ceasefires on 18 January .
The ceasefires ended Israel 's three - week offensive in Gaza , which was aimed at stopping rocket attacks on Israel .
The ceasefires , independently declared by each side , have been violated several times .
An Israeli soldier was killed in a bomb attack on the Gaza border on Tuesday .
Israel responded with air raids and a brief ground incursion by soldiers and tanks .
US envoy
About 1,300 Palestinians and 10 Israeli soldiers were killed in the three weeks of Gaza fighting .
Three Israeli citizens died in rocket attacks .
Israel wants the rocket attacks to end and wants to prevent militants in Gaza from being able to rearm .
Hamas wants the border crossings into Gaza to be fully opened to end a 18 - month blockade of Gaza which has wrecked its economy .
US President Barack Obama has sent his Middle East envoy George Mitchell to the region to " vigorously " pursue Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
He has arrived in Jordan after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
He has no plans to meet leaders of Hamas , which Israel , the US and the European Union consider a terrorist group .
The Egyptians have been leading efforts to broker a permanent ceasefire by holding separate talks with officials from Israel and Hamas .

Lord Carter is expected to publish his full report later in the year Communications Minister Lord Carter was expected to publish interim findings on the UK 's digital economy on 24 January .
But a spokeswoman for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport said the report would now appear " before the end of the month " .
The Digital Britain report examines a range of issues affecting internet users such as security and and safety and " promoting content standards " .
The full report and action plan will be unveiled in late spring 2009 .
In the run-up to the interim report being revealed Culture Secretary Andy Burnham said the government was looking at regulating the internet to " even up " the imbalance with television .
The report is examining a number of different areas , including broadband development , public service broadcasting and digital radio .
It is thought the report may set minimum broadband speeds and impose obligations on telecom suppliers to provide universal coverage .
Currently , communication providers are only enjoined to provide a functional internet connection that can run at a minimum speed of 28.8 kilobits per second .
The report is also expected to examine illegal file - sharing of movies , music and TV and appraise ways of tackling it .
Digital divide Speaking before a House of Commons ' committee last month , Lord Carter outlined the government 's commitment to providing broadband for all .
" We do not yet get universal coverage and in my view we should have it , " he said .
In late September 2008 , the EU said it was considering bringing forward its review of the basic telecoms services that European citizens should expect .
The report is also expected to show that the digital divide is no longer a geographical issue with towns connected and rural areas cut off .
Instead areas of digital exclusion are likely to mirror those of social deprivation .
However , broadband experts have warned that any moves to create next generation networks that run at very high speeds may only serve to deepen the digital divides in the UK .

[ edited 2009.01.15 to add link to DDJ ’s announcement ]
2008 was quite a year , full of landmark events that were certainly historic , if not always welcome .
If I had to pick one technology - related highlight from the past year , it would be this : A notable inflection point in the ongoing shift from traditional media to the web .
Given that that tide is still in progress , why single out 2008 ?
I think we ’ll look back at 2008 , especially the fourth quarter , as a turning point when the web became an A - list media outlet and first started to beat up , and even replace , major legacy competitors in newspapers , technical magazines , movies , and TV .
An inflection point , if you will , where the web clearly stopped being the pencil - necked upstart , and visibly emerged as the new gorilla flexing its advertising - revenue - pumped - up muscles and kicking sand on the others .
In 2008 , and particularly in the last month , the web began to outright replace some existing newspapers and technology and programming magazines .
December 2008 : The first two major city newspapers go web - only or web - mostly .
The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press announced truncated print editions and reduced print delivery .
Newspapers in several other cities seem likely to follow fairly soon .
The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press announced truncated print editions and reduced print delivery .

As of January 2009 : PC Magazine is going “ digital only . ”
After the January issue , the print magazine will disappear .
Instead , the content will appear exclusively on the web .
After the January issue , the print magazine will disappear .
Instead , the content will appear exclusively on the web .
As of January 2009 : Dr. Dobb ’s Journal is permanently suspending print publication and going web - only .
Some of the content will be available as a new “ Dr. Dobb ’s Report ” section of InformationWeek .
My Effective Concurrency column will continue , and I ’ll continue to blog when new columns go live on the web , so if you ’re reading the column via this blog nothing will significantly change for you .
As of next month , the only major technical programmer ’s trade magazines still available in print , that I know of , are platform - and technology - specific ones like asp.netPRO and MSDN Magazine — and even those increasingly feature online - only content .
For example , from MSDN Mag ’s January 2009 editor ’s note :
As we continue to grow our coverage to keep pace with the rapidly expanding set of technologies , we will often offer content exclusively online at msdn.microsoft.com / magazine .
So please check in frequently !
Gotta love RSS ( and Atom etc. ) :
Every text feed is like a magazine or newspaper column , every blogger a columnist .
Every audio / video podcast feed is like a radio or TV series , or a radio station or TV channel .
And our feed reader is the new magazine / newspaper , as we subscribe to columnists to make our personal custom newsmagazine .
But RSS readers , along with RSS - consuming clients like iTunes , are more — they ’re our personal selection , not only of the columns we want to read ( on whatever topics we want , including the funnies section ) , but also of the media we want to hear and watch .
It ’s increasingly our way to choose the text , audio , and video we want all together .
Who knew that a large chunk of the coming media convergence would come in the shape of RSS readers ?
And other media are feeling the pressure from Dr. Web , the new gorilla :
This week ( late December 2008 ) , even cable operator Time Warner pushed web delivery for TV .
Time Warner has had various contract disputes with Viacom and some local stations .
But as part of the dispute : Time Warner will respond to Viacom ’s advertisement , [ Time Warner spokesman ] Mr. Dudley said , by highlighting the availability of television content on the Internet .
“ We will be telling our customers exactly where they can go to see these programs online , ” Mr. Dudley said .
“ We ’ll also be telling them how they can hook up their PCs to a television set . ”
Time Warner has had various contract disputes with Viacom and some local stations .
But as part of the dispute : During October - December 2008 , Netflix ’s Watch Instantly has started to turn into a juggernaut .
It ’s interesting enough that you can watch 12,000 + movies and TV shows streamed over the net to your PC at high quality .
As of October 2008 , you can get them on your Mac .
As of November 2008 , on your Xbox .
As of December 2008 , on your TiVo .
As noted in one recent article : “ It ’s a good strategic move , ” said Andy Hargreaves , an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities .
“ Netflix sees the world will go digital , no matter what they do .
They realize there is more to be lost by waiting than doing it early . ”
And I wo n’t even get started on SaaS : hosted rich GUI apps served up on the web , for example the December 2008 ( again ) announcement about Office Online .
Yes , do n’t forget 2008 , especially December 2008 :
The month the first major newspapers moved mostly to the web and abandoned print at least partly ; the month that PC Magazine and Dr. Dobb ’s suspended print publication and went web - only ; the month Netflix Watch Instantly arrived in the living room on TiVos after hitting Xboxes a fortnight before ; the month cable provider Time Warner threatened to tell people to watch TV on the net ; and the month even Microsoft announced their intent to deliver significant Office web applications .
I for one welcome Dr. Web , our new Gorilla and media overlord !
Besides , what choice do I have ?
Various transportation specialists are worrying that persistently depressed fuel prices could threaten environmental components of the emerging bailout for Detroit , in which Congress appears to be demanding an aggressive push on fuel efficiency .
What if consumers spurn all those fancy new fuel - sipping cars ?
But some see a way out , particularly if the federal government and states add incentives — some of which have come and gone in the past — that encourage people to choose efficient vehicles .
A new report co-authored by John D. Graham , a former senior regulatory official under the Bush administration who is now at Indiana University , lays out a menu of policies that could sustain the move to higher fuel efficiency :
From “ Preventing Bankruptcy After Bailout : The Future of Green Vehicles , ” ( pdf )
by John D. Graham , dean of the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs , and Laura Cavagnaro , a graduate student in public administration there :
1. Re-Offer Income Tax Credits
In 2005 Congress authorized generous income tax credits ( $ 1,000 to $ 3,500 per vehicle ) for consumers who purchased new fuel - efficient vehicles with hybrid and clean - diesel engines .
These credits are scheduled to expire soon .
Congress should consider reoffering these credits .
Congress has recently offered large tax credits ( up to $ 7,500 per vehicle ) for plug - in hybrids and electric cars , but these credits will have little practical effect until engineers accomplish breakthroughs in battery technology , and recharging stations are built throughout the country .
2. Enact “ Feebates ” *
A more promising approach would be a new “ feebate ” system that offers a rebate to consumers who purchase green vehicles and extracts a fee from consumers who purchase fuel - hungry vehicles .
In order to protect the taxpayer , the formula for rebates and fees can be set to ensure revenue neutrality ( i.e. , no net increase in taxation ) .
If policy makers make no adjustment for vehicle size or weight , the smallest , most fuel - efficient vehicles will be favored .
But an adjustment for size and weight will better protect safety and align the tax credits with the federal government ’s size - based system for regulating the mileage of new cars and SUVs .
Some parents with large families and some small businesses need a large passenger vehicle .
Tax policy should encourage them to purchase vehicles that achieve above - average fuel economy in their preferred size class … .
3. Expand Non-Monetary Rewards
Consumers will respond to non-monetary as well as monetary signals , but some states and localities are actually removing non-monetary incentives to purchase green vehicles .
In some regions of the country , vehicles with hybrid engines are permitted on HOV lanes in urban areas , even if the vehicle has only one occupant .
This practice should be extended rather than curbed .
If this policy creates too much congestion on HOV lanes ( as has been suggested in Northern Virginia ) , the proper solution is not to eliminate the privilege but to focus it on a more limited class of vehicles that achieve the highest fuel economy within size or weight class .
Click for the summary :
Summary
A bailout of the Big Three will not work if companies must offer green vehicles at a time when fuel prices and household income levels do not support the sale of these more expensive vehicles .
If market conditions are not favorable , companies will be forced to sell green vehicles with large discounts or cash - back offers , which will create the financial losses that heighten the risk of bankruptcy after a temporary bailout .
Thus , since Congress has decided to pursue a bailout with stipulations – implicit and explicit – that force production of green vehicles , it would be wise for policy makers to accompany this policy with a series of monetary and non-monetary incentives that encourage consumers to purchase green vehicles , especially if fuel prices and income levels remain low in the foreseeable future .
Many libertarians insist that the market must rule and that cumbersome incentives and disincentives are bound to fail .
In a world where the long - term trend is toward higher oil prices , how does a government and society avoid the “ shock and trance ” response to short - term wiggles in energy costs ?
Joe Romm of Climateprogress.org recently told me that he feels we ’ve left an era of cheap oil punctuated by price spikes and entered a time of ever - rising petroleum prices with occasional dips .
What ’s your take on his thesis , the Indiana University prescription , and on policies that could lead to a more energy - efficient future ?

Cliff Arnebeck , lead attorney in the growing federal election conspiracy case tells
The BRAD BLOG that the loss of a key witness will not deter his pursuit of justice
U.S. Dept. of Justice ignored months - long effort to protect GOP ' IT guru ' following reported threats from Karl Rove ...
Brad Friedman Byon
12/22/2008 , 1:52 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman , The BRAD BLOG
The lead attorney in the widening 2004 federal election fraud conspiracy case which began in Ohio --- but is rapidly growing to other states and other elections --- says that the stunning death of a key witness last Friday is a blow to the case , but not the end of it by a long shot .
" Michael Connell was a critically important witness .
His loss hurts our case , " Cliff Arnebeck , the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the King - Lincoln Bronzeville v. OH Sec. of State lawsuit , told The BRAD BLOG in an email responding to questions about Connell 's death .
The Republican ' IT guru , ' a top IT consultant to Karl Rove , George W. Bush , John McCain , and a bevy of congressional Republicans , had been in the nation 's capital on still - unknown business before his single engine plane crashed Friday night on the way home , just three miles short of the runway in Akron , Ohio .
The cause of the crash remains similarly unknown as of today .
" We will have to adjust , " Arnebeck told us in response to queries about where the case may necessarily need to go from here .
" The kind of organized criminal enterprise we are addressing requires the resources of the very best that the investigative press corps and law enforcement , at all levels , can muster . "
As posted on the New York Times website in full on Saturday , the last line of a press release from VelvetRevolution.us , who has retained Arnebeck as counsel in the case , reads " Our prior request to have Mr. Connell protected went unheeded and now he is dead . "
[ DISCLOSURE : The BRAD BLOG is a co-founder of VR . ]
However , despite Connell 's elite status as a top-rung Republican consultant for years --- he reportedly received some $ 800,000 from the Bush / Cheney campaign in 2004 alone --- the NYTimes , the nation 's paper of record , has yet to run anything else on the death of the man who , Arnebeck notes , he had intended to both further depose , as well as call to testify as a key trial witness in the federal conspiracy case .
Coverage from the UK's Telegraph , however , is published here .
Connell had been compelled by the federal district judge in the case , on the Friday prior to last month 's Presidential Election , to give a deposition to plaintiff attorneys on the Monday before the general election .
The order for that deposition came after the OH attorneys had sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey , seeking protection for Connell and his wife .
While Connell had expressed a willingness to testify about what he knew concerning the ' 04 election , and the election website network he had created for Ohio's then - Sec. of State J. Kenneth Blackwell , he had become reticent after Rove had sent threats to Connell and his wife , according to tipsters ...
" We have been confidentially informed by a source we believe to be credible that Karl Rove has threatened Michael Connell , a principal witness we have identified in our King Lincoln case in federal court in Columbus , Ohio , that if he does not agree to ' take the fall ' for election fraud in Ohio , his wife Heather will be prosecuted for supposed lobby law violations , " the attorneys ' letter to Mukasey read .
( The full letter was posted by The BRAD BLOG here in July . )
Arnebeck says that , despite the letter sent nearly five months ago to the DoJ " seeking protection for Mr. Connell and his family from this reported attempt to intimidate a witness , " as well as several messages sent to highly - placed DoJ officials , he has yet to receive a reply from the nation 's top law enforcement agency .
Over the weekend , he sent another email " expressing the hope that the very best resources will be applied to the airplane crash investigation . "
In response to questions about how Connell 's death on Friday might affect his lawsuit going forward , Arnebeck told us , " I thought that by getting all of this to the top career organized crime guy at Justice , we had established a protective spotlight around Connell .
Connell 's death , however it was caused , is tragic . "
" Connell was a man of conscience , " the attorney says , " I was very much looking forward to continuing our conversation that began with the Friday hearing in Cleveland just before the election . "
But , Arnebeck adds , the information that they were able to get from the Republican " IT guru " in that court - ordered deposition , will be useful nonetheless .
" Everything we have learned about Mike Connell , including his cooperation in personally attending the motion hearing on Friday , and the deposition on Monday , before the election , gave us information we can build upon . "
The transcript of the deposition , however , may still not be made publicly available for some time .
During that Friday hearing on Connell 's attempt to quash his subpoena to testify , US District Judge Solomon Oliver compelled that the deposition go forward , but required certain material remain sealed .
" The transcript of Mike Connell 's deposition is before the court for in camera review , " Arnebeck says .
" James Ervin , Mr. Connell 's trial attorney , has requested that portions of the transcript be sealed on the basis that they discuss trade secrets .
If accorded protection by the court on that basis , the protected interest would be held by [ Connell 's corporation . ] "
As to what may have happened to Connell 's plane , which a report from a local Cleveland CBS affiliate noted " might [ have been ] sabotaged , " the attorney demured .
" I have a number of opinions , " he said , " but more important are the opinions of the experts in this field .
There are criminals who are very concerned about our case . "
When asked to elucidate on that comment , Arnebeck replied : " We have highly reliable information but it was communicated to me in a way that should be preserved in confidence . "
The 19 Action News report noted , without additional detail ( video at end of this article ) , that " twice in the last two months Connell , who is an experienced pilot , cancelled two flights because of suspicious problems with his plane . "
Despite the bad news , Arnebeck remains undeterred and seems encouraged by President - elect Barack Obama 's nomination of Eric Holder to be the next U.S. Attorney General .
" The fact that Rove is leading the effort to derail Obama 's AG appointment , suggests that we may be getting the right man to proceed with the necessary work [ and ] that Justice has already begun to hold Rove accountable . "
" We intend to continue to do our job as citizens , " Arnebeck concluded , " and very much appreciate your continuing work as a journalist . "
NOTE : We will be making a special appearance this evening on the syndicated Peter B. Collins radio show from 5 p - 6 p PT ( 8 p - 9 p ET ) to discuss the death of Connell .
Arnebeck is scheduled to join us during that hour .

UPDATE : 12/23/08 Raw video footage , taped by eye and ear - witness at the crash site , is now posted here , along with the audio of the live interview we did last night with Arnebeck and RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna on a special edition of the Peter B. Collins Show ...
GeoEye - 1 , the powerful imagery satellite that is perhaps best known as the “ Google satellite ” ( because Google has a deal to use its pictures for its Google Maps and Google Earth products ) , will be focusing its lens on the Inauguration of President Obama next week .
The company notes that while there will be plenty of cameras covering the event on the ground , and some in the air , GeoEye - 1 will be the only one offering a perspective from space .
The satellite will be 423 miles above Washington , D.C. on January 20 at 11:19 AM EDT .
While it will be moving 17,000 miles per hour , it will still be able to look down at the Earth and see objects about a half meter in size .
The image above ( which I actually had to shrink due to upload size limits ) is one the satellite took a few weeks ago of the area .
Last month , we posted a picture that the satellite took of Google ’s campus .
It ’s not Google who is requesting these images , and it ’s not the government either .
Instead , it ’s a company initiative by GeoEye .
“ An image of the Inauguration has been requested by many news organizations , ” a GeoEye spokesperson tells us .
“ So , if the weather cooperates , the image will be distributed to news organizations and bloggers around the world .
The image will be available about three hours after it ’s taken . ”
If you ’d like some to see some footage a bit closer up on the action , you may want to check out one of the live streams .
Update :
Here are the pictures from President Obama ’s inaugrual , as seen from space .

Will Federal Female Employees Be Safe from Cross - Dressing Men Using Ladies ' Restrooms in the Obama Administration
' The Obama - Biden Transition Project does not discriminate on the basis of race , color , religion , sex , age , national origin , veteran status , sexual orientation , gender identity , disability , or any other basis of discrimination prohibited by law . ' --
Application for non-career federal jobs in an Obama Administration , http://change.gov/page/s/application
Contact : Peter LaBarbera , 630-717-7631 ; americansfortruth@comcast.net
CHICAGO , November 10 / Christian Newswire / -- Americans For Truth reacted to the news that an Obama Administration will likely enact " gender identity " as a nondiscrimination category by questioning whether federal female employees will be protected from transsexual men wearing dresses who demand to use ladies ' restrooms on the basis of their self - perceived " female identity . "
" Men who believe they are women , and vice versa , will be officially protected based under Obama on the basis of their ' gender identity ' ( read : gender confusion ) , " said Peter LaBarbera , president of Americans For Truth about Homosexuality .
" Cross - dressing , ' male - to - female ' activists already demand the right to use female restrooms on the basis of this same notion of ' gender identity ' - based rights .
So will an Obama Administration allow these big - boned men in female clothing to use ladies ' restrooms in federal buildings ?
" What will a President Obama do to protect the right to privacy of female federal workers who do n't want men wearing dresses – with male genitalia – sharing their women 's restroom ? "
LaBarbera said .
" Will a President Obama request funds from Congress to embark on an ambitious ' Transgender Restroom Construction Project ' to build special " trans " bathrooms in government buildings – so as not to subject female employees to sexual harassment and violations of their privacy ? "
The ACLU is commending the Obama for including " gender identity " in its hiring criteria , calling it a " bold departure from the past . "
The news is circulating on homosexual - oriented websites and e-mail discussion groups , increasing the likelihood that many men and woman embracing gender - confused " identities " will be applying for jobs in an Obama Administration .
The online Obama - Biden job application site stipulates that the presidential transition agency " does no discriminate " on the basis of " gender identity , " among other categories .
President - elect Obama has boasted not only of his strong support for homosexual activist policy goals , but also transsexual rights ( " gender identity " nondiscrimination ) .
Obama supported a pro-transgender homosexual rights bill as an Illinois state senator , and backs the more liberal , transgender - inclusive version of the federal Employment Nondiscrimination Act ( ENDA ) .
What makes us feel spiritual ?
It could be the quieting of a small area in our brains , a new study suggests .
The area in question — the right parietal lobe — is responsible for defining " Me , " said researcher Brick Johnstone of Missouri University .
It generates self - criticism , he said , and guides us through physical and social terrains by constantly updating our self - knowledge : my hand , my cocktail , my witty conversation skills , my new love interest …
People with less active Me-Definers are more likely to lead spiritual lives , reports the study in the current issue of the journal Zygon .
Most previous research on neuro - spirituality has been based on brain scans of actively practicing adherents ( i.e. meditating monks , praying nuns ) and has resulted in broad and inconclusive findings .
( Is the brain area lighting up in response to verse or spiritual experience ? )
So Johnstone and colleague Bret Glass turned to the tried - and - true techniques of neuroscience ’s early days — studying brain - injured patients .
The researchers tested brain regions implicated in the previous imaging studies with exams tailored to each area ’s expertise — similar to studying the prowess of an ear with a hearing test .
They then looked for correlations between brain region performance and the subjects ' self - reported spirituality .
Among the more spiritual of the 26 subjects , the researchers pinpointed a less functional right parietal lobe , a physical state which may translate psychologically as decreased self - awareness and self - focus .
The finding suggests that one core tenant of spiritual experience is selflessness , said Johnstone , adding that he hopes the study " will help people think about spirituality in more specific ways . "
Spiritual outlooks have long been associated with better mental and physical health .
These benefits , Johnstone speculated , may stem from being focused less on one ’s self and more on others — a natural consequence of turning down the volume on the Me-Definer .
In addition to religious practices , other behaviors and experiences are known to hush the Definer of Me. Appreciation of art or nature can quiet it , Johnstone said , pointing out that people talk of " losing themselves " in a particularly beautiful song .
Love , and even charity work , can also soften the boundaries of " Me , " he said .
The greatest silencing of the Me-Definer likely happens in the deepest states of meditation or prayer , said Johnstone , when practitioners describe feeling seamless with the entire universe .
That is , the highest point of spiritual experience occurs when " Me " completely loses its definition .
" If you look in the Torah , the Old Testament , the New Testament , in the Koran , a lot of Sufi writings , Buddhist writings , and Hindu writings , they all talk about selflessness , " said Johnstone .
We may be finding the neurological underpinnings of these writings , he said .
Ken Mink , 73 , is a Roane State ' Senior ' Basketball Player ( Photos )
, at the age of 73 , will be 50 years older than his teammates when they begin the 2008 - 2009 basketball season on November 3rd in Harriman , Tennessee .
Roane State Community College is 50 miles from Knoxville and is giving septuagenarian
Mink an opportunity to play as a member of their junior college team .
The 6 foot , 190 pounder will be listed on the weekly roster as a Senior - which seems fitting to be sure .
He played high school basketball until 1956 when he was kicked off the team for a shaving cream prank .
He went on to play college ball at Lees Junior College in Kentucky .
Mink has stayed in shape over the years by engaging in golf , skiing , hang gliding , hiking and his beloved basketball .
He has played on three senior teams and landed in three state tournaments .
In other words , the guy 's got game .
He was so certain of that fact that he started a letter writing campaign to find a school that would give him an opportunity to play collegiate ball .
Roane 's coach Randy Nesbit decided to give him a shot .
Turns out the old fella wo n't play more than five or six minutes per outing because he is n't totally keyed in on the complicated offensive and defensive strategies .
The season opener is November 3 .
Rumor has it that a representative of Guiness Book of Records will be on hand to record Ken 's debut .

Ubuntu 9.04
Alpha 2 was originally scheduled to be released yesterday , December 18th , but I guess the developers encountered some issues with it .
Anyway , this second alpha version of the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04 ( codename Jaunty Jackalope ) , which is scheduled for release in late April next year , was uploaded a couple of hours ago on the official mirrors and , as usual , we 've downloaded a copy of it in order to keep you up - to - date with the latest changes in the Ubuntu 9.04 development .
Surprise , surprise !
The developers have prepared a Live CD for this second alpha version of Ubuntu 9.04 , which will allow anyone to give it a try without installing anything on the hard drive .
But do n't get too excited , because , as you can see from the screenshots below , there 's nothing new on the surface .
It still has the same wallpaper and applications as Ubuntu 8.10 .
Under the hood , it appears that the GNOME desktop environment has been updated to version 2.25.3 ( latest development release ) , but many of its components are still at version 2.24.2 , the kernel packages are based on the latest release candidate of Linux kernel 2.6.28 and the X.
Org server is now at version 1.6 .
Among other updated applications , we can notice : The GIMP 2.6.3 , Brasero 0.8.3 , Transmission 1.40 or Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 .
And ... no , there 's still no OpenOffice.org 3.0 .
What else is new ?
Well , it appears that the team implemented a small GUI to change the position and theme of the pop-up notifications .
This little tool can be found under Preferences ->
Pop - Up Notifications ( take a look at the last three screenshots ) .
However , it appears that it's in an alpha state , because it jammed every time we changed some options and pressed the " Preview " button .
However , probably starting with the latest alpha or the beta , which will be available next year , we will see some big changes , like that professional theme everyone is waiting for .
Do n't forget that Mark wants your screenshots , so go ahead and send him yours if you want a redesigned desktop environment in April !
Ubuntu 9.04 or , should I say , " The Jackalope , " will be the tenth release of the Ubuntu operating system .
However , until then , we have another version that should attract our attention and invade our computers , Ubuntu 8.10 ( Intrepid Ibex ) .
Here 's the release schedule for Jaunty Jackalope :
November 22th , 2008 - Alpha 1 release December 19th , 2008 - Alpha 2 release January 15th , 2009 - Alpha 3 release February 5th , 2009 - Alpha 4 release February 26th , 2009 - Alpha 5 release March 12th , 2009 - Alpha 6 release March 26th , 2009 - Beta release April 16th , 2009 - Release Candidate April 23rd , 2009 - Final release of Ubuntu 9.04

Talk about unintended consequences .
The following is significant insight from the street level .
This is especially important for those of you thinking that these low mortgage rates will lead housing and the consumer to the Promised Land .
Everyone wants to refinance right now – that ’s a fact .
Home owners and loan officers around the nation have not been this excited in years over the low rates .
Purchases are far and few in between and require solid relationships , so most loan officers love a good refi boom – they are the easy pickens ( until now ) .
The media are actually quoting mortgage rates non-stop , which is a complete story in and of itself .
Loan officers and banks are very busy taking loan applications , as reflected in the faulty MBA loan application survey data ( Mr Mortgage story out next week ) .
Loan approval times at some banks is at three to four weeks making for a two month start to finish process .
Fall - out will be extreme over the near - term as brokers and borrowers switch banks three and four times trying to get the lowest rate available .
Trying to hedge this chaotic mess is a mortgage secondary marketing manager ’s worst nightmare and can lead to significant losses .
Along side of being one of the biggest consumer ‘ bait and switches ’ of all time , this drop in rates should set the stage for a significant leg - up in mortgage loan defaults and leg down in house values and consumer / homeowner sentiment .
In my opinion , the government artificially pushing rates down this quickly not only will cost the originators plenty but quickens the pace at which the Alt - A , Jumbo Prime , and ‘ Prime ’ implosions could begin in earnest .
Please note that 4.5 % never really existed unless the borrower wanted to pay thousands of dollars to buy that rate through points , which is rare .
For a perfect borrower with a 740 credit score , 80 % loan to value and no second mortgage attached the lowest that rates got were roughly 4.875 % .
Since then they are hovering around 5.25 % to 5.50 % .
This , from 6 % before rates took their dive .
I am not a believer that rates can sustain these low levels without .gov permanently ‘ fixing ’ them somehow .
Left up to the mortgage bond market and there are just too many sellers over the past several months , especially on well bid days .
In the past the mortgage process involved getting a completed loan application , ordering the credit report and appraisal and processing the loan .
In a couple of weeks when the appraisal came back from the appraiser , the loan was submitted into underwriting for approval .
Everything went smoothly because the appraisal always came at or above borrower ’s estimates .
These days the process has changed a bit .
Now the first thing done after the loan application is taken is to call the appraiser for a comparable sale check to see if the value at which the home owner states the house is worth is on target .
Therein lays the rub .
From early reports since rates fell sharply in early December , 80 % of the loan applications are not getting out of the starting gate easily .
Loan officers are all saying the same thing — that appraisals are not coming at value due because ‘ all of the foreclosures and REO sales have taken the value down ’ .
In the majority of these cases , this kills the loan .
The loan officer then notifies the borrower of the news and they are in disbelief .
All home owners think that their home is worth the most on the block and I have been told that this is a tough pill to swallow .
This brings the crisis home instantly .
Everyone trying to refinance into lower rates at once should hasten the national reality that the largest portion of the home owner ’s net worth has evaporated in the past year .
One loan officer I spoke with equated this call to a Doctor notifying a patient that they had a terminal illness .
The other three top reasons that loans are not making it out of the application phase are because of credit scores coming in too low , interest rates not really being what the borrowers are hearing hyped and Jumbo money is near all - time highs .
With respect to scores , many have been negatively affected by creditors bringing revolving lines down sharply over the past several months .
If the outstanding balance is over the 30 % and / or 50 % threshold of the available credit it negatively affects the score .
Lately , banks have been dropping available credit to just above the outstanding balance , which is over 50 % and a large credit score hit .
With respect to rates , most borrowers do not have a perfect 740 + score and 80 % and below loan - to - value meaning they do not get the rates being advertised .
Even a small deviation in borrower profile such as a subordinated second mortgage , 700 credit score or 90 % loan - to - value can result in a 100 bps rate spike at least .
Only a year ago the latter profile would have been considered ‘ Prime ’ — their 90 % loan - to - value today would have been 50 % equity back then .
Lastly , Jumbo money both Agency Jumbo from $ 417 k to $ 625 k and bank portfolio over $ 625 k are priced terribly in the 6.5 % to 7 % and 7.5 % to 9 % ranges respectively .
That is if they can even get the loan made .
The problem with this is once you get out of the Subprime universe , a large percentage of Alt - A and Prime loans are over $ 417 k .
The Alt - A , Jumbo Prime and Prime universes are on very shaky ground right now and these are the borrowers who could really benefit from a low fixed rate right now .
This harsh reality could spur a new wave of defaults and walk - aways from borrowers that were not considered at - risk before .
This takes the crisis into the ’ Prime ’ universe very quickly because Prime borrowers represent the majority of new refi applicants .
This new wrinkle brings the Prime Implosion to the forefront much quicker than my original , more linear time - line of Subprime to Alt - A to Jumbo Prime then Prime with some overlap .
Additionally , when borrowers with Jumbo loan amounts over $ 417 k find out that 30 - year fixed rates are anywhere from 6.5 % to ‘ unavailable ’ the reality that that they are stuck in that loan and likely that home indefinitely will set in .
The macro-economic effects of this are unknowable .
With underwater or ‘ near ’ underwater home owners that are unable to sell or refi totaling 42 % nationally and about 65 % to 70 % in the bubble states , this news is not surprising .
However , it likely will be surprising to the media , analysts and markets when the facts get out in a couple of months .
In a nutshell those that do n’t need the credit can get it and those that do can’t .
This is the perfect credit crisis storm – one which low rates ca n’t fix .
The only thing that can be done to get money into borrower ’s hands quickly is to waive appraisals for Agency and FHA loans as Lockhart has suggested .
That is of course if the borrowers are ignorant enough to consider this option .
“ James Lockhart , Fannie and Freddie ’s regulator , said last week they were considering waiving the requirement to get new home price appraisals before refinancing loans they hold – a move that could greatly increase the scope for refinancing . ”
I see ‘ no - appraisal ’ refi’s as devastating as the Fannie / Freddie loan mod push going on right now , which I wrote about a couple of weeks ago .
Fannie / Freddie : Come Get Your Loan Mod and Pay For Life
‘ No appraisal ’ refi’s are a disaster that takes the housing crisis to an entirely different level because now the tax payer will be on the hook for trillions in mortgages that are essentially very risky , underwater , unsecured credit lines .
Nobody will ever buy these loans or securities derived from them .
That being said , given all of the reasons above why no major refi-boom will ensue as rates drop and how panicked the politicians , banks and regulators are over housing my money is on them seriously considering this radically destructive move out of sheer panic .
At this point in time , I see little chance of a permanent solution being brought forth , which I outline in ‘ My Case for Principal Balance Reductions ’ .

U.S. Intelligence official " breaks silence " on Israel situation "
31 December 2008 : Northeast Intelligence Network director Doug Hagmann interviewed a highly - placed U.S. intelligence official late yesterday who not only confirmed rumors about escalated and more intensive Israeli military operations against the Muslim terrorists in Gaza , warned of the increasing probability of abandonment of Israel by the U.S. and other Western countries based on what he termed âmalicious intelligence .â 
â Remember that term , â advised this well - placed intelligence official , â youâll be hearing it again .â 
â This is just the beginning , â stated this intelligence official , who wished to remain anonymous .
This official stated that the possibility for a much more protracted ground war is more likely today than at any other time in the past , adding that Israel is exercising her right to protect herself from her enemies in Gaza .
But there is a catch , noted this official , and a big one at that : Israel could be about to lose the support of the United States .
â I have every reason to believe , based on what Iâve seen at my level of [ security ] clearance especially over the last several years , that Israel will soon be completely on their ownâ¦ or worse .â 
When asked what could be worse than losing the support of the United States , he stated : â when our administration provides more support to Arab countries [ with ] financial and military aid , undercutting Israelâs defense efforts all while pushing Israel to succumb to the pressure of unreasonable demands designed to end with their political annihilation as a nation .â 
According to this official , the U.S. has been slowly proceeding down this road .
He cited the 2005 surrender of Gush Katif to the Palestinian Authority as one critical example of the slow dismantlement of Israel as a viable nation .
â Despite critical intelligence outlining in every possible manner imaginable that this would be a disastrous move leading to the events we are seeing today , it was done anyway , â  he stated .
â We are seeing the very scenario play out today that was outlined in intelligence briefs three and four years ago .
Knowing that , there is something very wrong with this picture , â he stated .
He added that Western media is also playing a very big role in the current war in the Middle East , thanks , in part , to carefully worded statements prepared by political officials in Washington .
Officials in the current administration , like some previous administrations , submit carefully crafted informational releases to a media that is controlled by those having special interests that are contrary to a legitimate peace in the Middle East .
â The game is rigged .
At the highest levels of power in the U.S. and even by some in power in Israel , the game is rigged , â he emphasized .
The next obvious question in this interview was , of course , â how is it rigged ? â followed by âhow are you in a position to know ?â 
This official responded by stating that he has spent the last two decades serving in âan unfortunate position where intelligence and politics meet and often collide .â 
Now , merely days away from retirement , he stated that he is looking forward to leaving his position after conducting over 20 years of intelligence work â that has been molded and massaged to advance the agendas of a select few.â 
He continued : â When an intelligence work product that has been thoroughly and properly vetted is submitted to those in Washington , and I see a completely different and entirely inaccurate product intentionally submitted and aired in the media , only to be told â that is the way it must be , â then I know itâs time for me to leave.â 
â It is obvious to me that most Americans donât understand or donât care what is actually happening in the Middle East relative to Israel .
People donât understand history , or have been subjected to revisionist history based on lies and more lies .
Add to that a media that fails to provide an accurate assessment of what is taking place in Israel , in Gaza , and you end up with a very bad situation for Israel , â stated this source .
He added that the disinformation coming and going to and from Washington is getting worse , as is the media bias against Israel .
The events currently taking place in Israel are extremely perilous for Israel and especially perilous for the national security of the United States , according to this source .
Contrary to the accepted assessments of â Middle East expertsâ in the news , our intelligence services have âample evidence to prove active collusion and support between HAMAS and other terrorist organizations , both Sunni and Shite .
Further , there is a level of Iranian complicity in this war that is not being talked about , or being dismissed out of hand because of the schism between the Sunni and Shia sects , â stated this source .
Coming next :
More from this interview , in addition to an interview arranged by this intelligence official with a high - ranking Israeli IDF official conducted on 31 December 2008 .
DETROIT , Jan 5 ( Reuters ) - Hyundai Motor Co 005380 .KS has rolled out a new incentive program for U.S. consumers that allows them to return vehicles within the first year of purchase if they lose income .
Hyundai ’s plan comes at a time when industry - wide U.S. auto sales remain at their lowest in at least two decades under the pressure of tight credit and weak consumer confidence .
“ In this uncertain economy , we are looking for ways to reassure shoppers that Hyundai still represents the best value in the auto industry , ” said John Krafcik , Hyundai Motor America ’s acting chief executive .
The 12 - month vehicle return program , which took effect over the past weekend , is provided on every new Hyundai that is financed or leased at participating dealers , the South Korean automaker said in a statement .
Earlier this decade , Hyundai saw sharp growth in the U.S. market driven by an attention - grabbing 10 - year warranty .
That strategy allowed Hyundai to claim the mantle as the fastest - growing major automaker earlier this decade , but it fell short of ambitious U.S. sales targets in 2007 and 2008 , hit by the industry - wide slowdown in sales .
Hyundai’s U.S. sales were down 10 percent through the end of November .
It is scheduled to report sales for December later on Monday .

Last updated on 4/24/11 .
Tina Brown , the newly - minted British expatriot Newsweek editor - in - chief , certainly is n’t wasting any time promoting her agenda .
By now it ’s pretty old news that the anti-gun / anti-Second Amendment crowd ( i.e. the political left ) has been trying to use the Tucson active shooter situation to get new gun control laws passed , like a high - capacity magazine ( not “ clip ” ) ban and a new federal assault weapons ban ( AWB ) .
It ’s par for the course , really , and to be expected .
However , Newsweek just did something sneaky .
In a call - to - arms ( excuse the pun ) - style pro-gun - control opinion piece , two of its writers , Andrew Romano and Pat Wingert , attempted to rebrand gun control as “ gun safety ” in their not - so - subtly ( or pleasantly ) titled article 2,405 Shot Dead Since Tucson .
Here are the relevant excerpts , all from the Newsweek piece :
– By outspending , out - organizing , and out - politicking its opponents , the NRA persuaded Democrats , who can control Congress only if they control red districts , to abandon gun safety in the 1980s and 1990s , and since then it has successfully pressed for ever - looser local laws .
– Few politicians are eager to paddle against such a powerful tide , which is why so many of them called for “ a new era of civility ” after one of their colleagues was shot in the head — as opposed to , say , a new era of gun safety .
– It ’s hard not to wonder whether Obama ’s plan is to pacify liberal critics by continuing to mention some vague dream of addressing gun safety at some wispy future date — then to cross his fingers and hope they forget .
– Gun-safety advocates would argue that Obama has a moral duty to stanch the bleeding , and that may be true .
– Look beyond the hoary Washington logic , and it ’s clear that the present moment may be peculiar enough , and the forces at work potent enough , to produce real movement on gun safety — provided Obama proceeds carefully .
– Tucson was the first mass shooting or assassination plot in years in which neither the shooter nor his target died in the melee — an outcome that will shape the media coverage in ways that may benefit the gun-safety cause .
So , now it ’s the “ gun safety ” cause , not gun control , i.e , people control .
They must figure “ control ” sounds too , well , controlling and threatening , like you ’re trying to control people .
“ Safety ” sounds much nicer and less threatening , giving the impression that “ we just want you to be safe ” .
Is n’t that nice ?
They just want us to be safe .
Our safety is their singular concern .
Nothing to fear , folks !
Where I come from , gun safety means proper gun handling : keeping your finger off the trigger until you ’re ready to fire ; always keeping the weapon pointed in a safe direction , unless you ’re purposely pointing it at an attacker in defense your life or someone else ’s life ; not pointing the weapon at anything you ’re not either willing or intending to destroy ; things like that .
When the gun grabbers think about gun control , they think about controlling people .
When I think about gun control , I think of about hitting what I ’m aiming at .
Perhaps us pro-gunners should rebrand “ gun control ” as “ people control ” , and see how they like it .
After all , our term is the more accurate one , since controlling people is precisely what “ gun control ” is all about .
We , the lowly law - abiding proletariat must be controlled , after all , since we ’re so incapable of controlling ourselves .
We therefore need the Paul Helmke ’s of the world to take charge of things and look of all of us , since he ’s so much more thoughtful and enlightened than we are .
And , yes , that was sarcastic .
Now , a paranoid person might say that this whole gun - control - morphed - into - gun - safety rebranding stunt has a guy like self - proclaimed marketing maven Donny Deutsch written all over it , since this is just the kind of lame idea Deutsch , bombastic host of The Big Idea and Morning Joe ’s resident goofball and impromptu massage master , might come up with to try to sell a sinister concept or agenda that ’s otherwise unsellable , and he also just happens to be a “ Morning Joe ” co-contributor along with Miss Brown on MSNBC .
However , I ’m willing to give Mr. Romano and Ms. Wingert the benefit of the doubt and the credit for it .
Calling the gun control fringe / fanatics “ gun control forces ” , as if they represent the forces of good , while denigrating the pro-Second Amendment forces as the “ pro-gun lobby ” represents old - school , retread anti-gun nomenclature / tactics , so I ’m not giving them any credit whatsoever on that one .
It ’s just annoying , at this point .
Frankly , I do n’t blame Romano and Wingert for trying to rebrand the gun control agenda .
What choice do they have ?
The “ gun control ” / people control movement has been , by all accounts , a colossal , unmitigated failure over the last 15 years or so , since 1 ) we Americans love our guns and simply do n’t like being controlled , 2 ) we now have rock - solid empirical data that proves that more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens equals less crime , and vice versa , less guns in the hands of law abiding citizens means more crime , and 3 ) in recent years , the Second Amendment has been both confirmed as an individual right and incorporated under the 14th Amendment by the Supreme Court .
Unlike Miss Brown ’s countrymen , we , the people of the United States , are citizens , not subjects .
We like to control the government rather than the other way around .
Since World War II , the British Parliament has strapped an ever - expanding yoke of tyranny onto the necks of the British people that ’s grown so heavy , it would most likely require an actual revolutionary war to shake off .
Call me pessimistic , but I do n’t think the post - War British people have it in them .
But back to the article .
Romano ’s and Wingert ’s piece is almost illogically hopeful and an over - the - top exercise in liberal socialist wishful thinking .
In order for the high - capacity magazine ban they so vehemently argue for Congress to pass to actually pass , it would take a dark miracle and the political seppuku of many Republican congressmen , who would then all fall like dominoes in 2012 , either in primaries or the general election .
Even President Obama , a devout liberal / leftist , is wisely treading very softly and carrying a rather small stick on the gun control issue .
Even if the Democratic will were there ( and it is n’t , at present ) , the hi-cap mag ban is very wishful thinking ( and borderline delusional ) on the part of the authors , and it ai n’t gonna ’ happen anytime in the near future , particularly while conservatives control the House .
To quote the character Elaine Benes , speaking to the “ Soup Nazi ” on the hit show Seinfeld , “ Next ! ” .
What ’s great about the Newsweek liberal battle cry piece from a pro-2nd Amendment / pro-freedom perspective is that it puts it all out there .
It lays it all right there on the table .
It exposes not only the “ latest and greatest ” gun control strategy regarding the political left ’s utilization of the Tucson shooting to try to jumpstart new gun control measures , but offers gun owners and pro-Second Amendment voters a window into the left ’s true nature , into its anti-gun / anti- freedom , people - controlling political soul , so to speak .
Even better , the Newsweek article is severely and fatally flawed .
First , the Newsweek writers predictably followed the gun-grabbing playbook and blame the object (s ) , the firearm and its high - capacity magazine , rather than blaming the perpetrator himself ( Jared Lee Loughner ) and the pre-event systemic failures allowing said perpetrator to continue to walk around freely and purchase a firearm , not to mention the aforementioned law enforcement / security failures at the event , itself .
Many people at Mr. Loughner ’s school observed his bizarre , anti-social , and obviously mentally - disturbed behavior that was severe enough to get him pulled from the college class in which he was enrolled .
Apparently , there ’s no system in place in America to keep people who display socially aberrant and / or psychotic behavior witnessed by multiple people from continuing to walk around freely and purchase firearms .
That needs to change , and right quick .
Putting a system in place that would cause someone like Loughner to either fail the required federal background check , or better yet , be locked up in a secure psychiatric facility , would be efffective , unlike a high - capacity magazine ban , as is currently being proposed ( more on that farther down ) by Democrats .
The Newsweek piece also completely glosses over the obvious , that in a supposedly free country of 300 million people , chaos and evil can and will rear their respective ugly heads from time to time , somewhere , somehow .
Sorry , but that ’s the cost of freedom combined with a very large population .
If Miss Brown does n’t like that , she can go back to her mother country ( England ) where a much smaller number of law abiding subjects are forcibly disarmed like good little sheep , while agents of the government ( law enforcement and military personnel ) AND violent criminals remain armed to the teeth , so the law abiding population is simultaneously subjected to the watchful eye and iron fist of an increasingly - oppressive police state and predated upon by armed violent criminals , not exactly a healthy environment for freedom .
Pervasive ownership of the latest and greatest tactical firearms by the law - abiding populace is what frees us from that double - headed monster ( police state and criminal predation ) here in the United States of America .
AMERICA .
At this point , everyone understands and agrees that Rep. Gabrielle Giffords should have had at least a modicum of police protection , especially since she ’d been recently threatened and her district office had been vandalized .
Perhaps instead of becoming a self - appointed news commentator and politicizing the event in front of the cameras after the fact , Pima County Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik would have better served Rep.
Giffords and the country at large by providing her with a security detail of at least 2 - 4 Sheriff ’s deputies .
In other words , perhaps it would have been a better idea to do the job the people of Pima County elected him to do instead of blaming America ’s toxic political culture , which , Dupnik would have us believe is primarily caused by conservatives .
Where was Rep. Giffords ’ security detail , Mr. Dupnik ?
Did n’t she deserve one ?
Did n’t she merit it ?
The fact is Mr. Dupnik displayed utter incompetence both in the lead - up to and aftermath of the shooting , and everyone knows it .
Since she obviously was n’t receiving any help from local law enforcement , why did n’t someone as visible as Rep.
Giffords , whom had already been recently threatened , have a private security detail ?
Law enforcement veteran and executive protection instructor Ricky Tucker put it this way : “ When you are allowing anyone in that close , there are a lot of threats that are there . ”
Tucker contends that while a private security detail ( PSD ) / executive protection team would have been intrusive to Rep. Giffords ’ daily life , and the shooting would have been difficult to predict and / or prepare for , it could have helped prevent the tragedy .
Just like the rest of the national news media , the Newsweek piece also failed to point out that the rally being a Democratic one was very likely the main reason not one person in the crowd ( an Arizona crowd ) was armed , so there was no one who could immediately fire back at the active shooter ( Loughner ) , once he opened up .
If just one trained , legally - armed person ( or , ideally , two or three ) had been in the crowd ( the most likely scenario in a conservative Republican Arizona crowd ) and in close proximity to Loughner , it ’s likely that they could have neutralized him quickly , resulting in less people being shot and killed .
They would have at least had a better chance of survival .
Remember , in an active shooter scenario , the rule is that you can lose up to one victim per second , so every second counts , and you have to respond to the threat immediately .
According to reports , the closest armed person ( armed with a firearm on his actual person ) , hero Joe Zamudio , was in a nearby Walgreen ’s buying cigarettes at the time , so he was n’t able to get to Loughner before Loughner was able to shoot a lot of people and completely empty his magazine .
The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) reported that his being armed aided him in his decision to get involved and run towards the trouble .
The Newsweek writers might not even realize that the previous high - capacity magazine ban , a component of the ridiculous 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban , did n’t effectively prevent anyone from purchasing or owning high - capacity magazines ( greater than 10 rounds ) .
It simply prohibited manufacturers from selling hi-cap mags that were manufactured after the law took effect directly to the public .
Any / all existing hi-cap mags in circulation were still readily available to anyone and everyone that could afford to purchase them .
Prices went up , but that ’s it .
So , even if the old Assault Weapons Ban ( with accompanying high - capacity magazine ban ) were still in place , Jared Loughner , the Tucson shooter , still would have been able to obtain all the high - capacity magazines he needed , provided he had the money to buy them .
Even if Loughner could n’t have obtained magazines with capacities higher than 10 rounds , he could have prepared differently and / or improvised .
For example , he could have easily just used multiple pistols , obviating the need to reload .
When one gun runs out of ammo , just grab the next one off the belt .
Three guns , each with 10 rounds , equals 30 shots , roughly the same number of shots he fired .
Or , he could have used a scoped ( or optical gunsighted ) 5.56 mm NATO /.223 Rem. or 7.62 mm NATO /.308 Win. semi-auto rifle to easily snipe Rep. Giffords and other people in the crowd from longer range , like 100 - 200 yards out , for example .
There are so many 30 - round 5.56 mm and 20 - round 7.62 mm mags on the market , he would have had no trouble obtaining either .
Even if were were only limited to 10 round mags , being further away , he could have taken his sweet time reloading without harrassment .
With a properly - scoped semi-auto 5.56 mm or 7.62 mm carbine or rifle , precise , lethal shots are fairly easy to accomplish within 300 yards with a minimum of training .
It should perhaps be noted at this point that the Second Amendment ’s core purpose is to ensure and protect an armed citizenry as a counteracting force to potential government tyranny .
It ’s my understanding at present that U.S. Sen .
Frank Lautenberg ’s proposed high - capacity magazine ban bill would conveniently exempt law enforcement officers ( LEOs ) and military personnel ( unconfirmed / unverified ) .
Well , who exactly does he think the American people will have to fight if we have to fight a tyrannical government ( perhaps one day lead by him ) hell - bent on our collective oppression ?
See where I ’m goin ’ with this ?
Law enforcement and military personnel , as great as they may be and as much as I support them , are , ultimately , agents of the government , and are both elements of the government ’s “ muscle ” and instruments of force over us , the citizenry .
The whole point of the Second Amendment is to ensure and protect the ownership of military infantry - grade tactical firearms and ammunition by private citizens .
Allowing U.S. law enforcement and military soldiers to have weapons with significantly higher magazine capacities than us , the law - abiding citizenry , would put us at a distinct disadvantage in a fight if , God forbid , it ever came to that .
In order to remain a free people , the law - abiding citizens of the United States need to have access to tactical firearms that are absolutely commensurate technologically and capabilities - wise with the standing army ’s infantry firearms and police force ’s tactical firearms in order for the spirit and purpose of the Second Amendment to live , and in order for government to continue to operate by the consent of the governed .
That ’s government by the people , not over the people .
And what about all the violent criminals ( felons ) out there that already have illegally - obtained tactical firearms with high - capacity magazines in their possession ?
What are law - abiding citizens supposed to do about them ?
Should we be limited to 10 - round magazines while the bad guys have access to 15 - 30 - round , or even 100 - round mags ?
What happens if a family has to go up against a team of 3 - 6 armed home invaders , which is n’t all that uncommon these days ?
That family may need more than 10 rounds at their immediate disposal to repel the invaders from their home .
In that situation , a 30 - round magazine capacity becomes not only advisable , but even necessary .
Ask yourself this question :
If a criminal home invasion team were trying to break into your home while you were in it , would you rather have 10 rounds of ammo at your immediate disposal , or 30 rounds ?
Do you think you should be limited to 10 rounds in the magazine by the government , the very government the Second Amendment was specifically designed to protect you against ?
Kind of a conflict of interest , do n’t you think ?
What about civilian competitive shooters who need high - capacity magazines for both practice / training and competition ?
The trend in 3 - Gun competition is now towards 5.56x45 mm NATO ( 5.56 mm NATO ) /.223 Rem. AR ( AR - 15 ) rifle magazines ( 4179 STANAG ) with greater capacity than 30 rounds .
The new Sure Fire MAG5 - 60 60 - shot HCM ( High Capacity Magazine ) is a perfect example of this , as it was a big hit with the competitors at Fort Benning 3 - Gun ( FB3G ) Challenge 2010 .
Should they not have access to the SureFire mag ?
Are they not trustworthy ?
And why 10 rounds ?
Why are the anti-gunners trying to limit us all the way down to 10 round magazines from 30 - round mags ?
That ’s roughly a 67 % ammo capacity reduction .
What happened to 20 rounds ?
How did they determine that 10 rounds is enough ammo for law abiding people to have , and what ’s their expertise in martial matters ?
Do they have educational or experiential credentials that prove some kind of expert knowledge in the area of ammo capacity for various tactical / defensive situations ?
Have they conducted any studies ?
If so , who ran the studies , and what ’s their background and expertise ?
Why should ANY law - abiding U.S. citizens pay any freedom price whatsoever because the the U.S. mental health system and Tucson Arizona law enforcement , the latter run by the aforementioned grossly incompetent Sheriff Dupnik , failed all of us ?
Why look at guns and magazines , first , instead of fixing the real failure points and removing Dupnik from public office ?
It ’s nice to read that under Miss Brown ’s recent stewardship , Newsweek has changed its typefaces and is now making “ much more dramatic use of photography . ”
I ’m relieved .
After all , everyone knows that Newsweek ’s core problem under Jon Meacham ’s leadership was typeface and photo - based .
A little too sarcastic ?
Tina Brown seems like an intelligent woman , but she ’s a European - model socialist , and I have yet to see any evidence of her being a genius–and it will take the combination of a genius - level intellect and a significantly more conservative mindset than Miss Brown ’s to save Newsweek from oblivion .
In the immortal words of Admiral Bates from the movie Under Siege , “ they ’ve got a lot of trouble on that ship ” .

This image of a threatening snowman is from a 1927 postcard .
It was reproduced in a Smithsonian magazine feature about the history of the snowman in pop culture .
From Smithsonian :
While no one knows for sure when exactly the snowman began smoking a pipe and drinking hard liquor , it may have started as early as 1890 , based on a label from a bottle of whiskey from that year .
An 1898 postcard shows a snowman carrying two bottles of champagne off to an office party .
On holiday greeting cards from the 1900s through and on ( up to the 1930s ) , the snowman often has a drink in one hand and a pipe in the other , mirroring our society 's changes and America 's fascination with smoking and drinking .
This would eventually escalate to the snowman cavorting with women and offering drinks to minors .
One could argue that these depictions were , in a way , humanizing , but seeing a tipsy snowman chasing a girl with a stick is disturbing at best .
By 1908 , there was clear evidence of his partying ways were out of control .
In the silent movie The Snowman by Wallace McCutcheon , a chain - smoking snowman is swigging whiskey and appears in the rest of the film sloshed , inspiring a flogging by the townspeople .
This behavior would continue on film and media through magazines and postcards as a pickled , skirt - chasing , under - the - table lush .
In other words , he had become a frozen W.C. Fields .
By the '30s and ' 40s , there is no question , the two started to look alike , both wearing straw hats , putting on more weight and looking more round and sporting crimson noses .
And both enjoyed prolific silent movie careers based on their reputations as charming drunks .
It 's hard to say if either had copied from the other but they were both enhanced by the other 's notoriety .
Ironically , W.C. Fields hated the holidays and passed away on Christmas Day , 1946 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Members of the Senate Finance Committee met Tuesday with Treasury Secretary nominee Tim Geithner over concerns involving his personal taxes and the immigration status of a former housekeeper , transition officials said .
The Geithners employed for about a year a housekeeper whose employment authorization document expired about three months before she stopped working for them in October 2005 , according to a written statement from the Senate Finance Committee .
Later , the housekeeper , who is married to a U.S. citizen , was granted a green card , transition officials said .
The second concern involves Geithner 's taxes while he worked for the International Monetary Fund .
According to a statement released by the committee , Geithner failed to pay self - employment taxes while IMF paid him from 2001 to 2004 .
In 2006 , the Internal Revenue Service audited Geithner for tax years 2003 and 2004 , and he paid $ 16,732 for the taxes and interest for those years , the statement said .
After Obama nominated him for treasury secretary , Geithner voluntarily amended his taxes for 2001 and 2002 , paying $ 25,970 for those taxes and interest , the committee said .
The presidential transition team told Finance Committee staff about Geithner 's taxes early last month , the committee said .
As an international organization , the IMF does not withhold money from employees ' paychecks to pay Social Security and Medicare .
U.S. employees are required to pay them on their own .
Robert Gibbs , the incoming White House spokesman , called Geithner 's tax issue a " common mistake . "
" The President - elect chose Tim Geithner to be his Treasury Secretary because he's the right person to help lead our economic recovery during these challenging times , " Gibbs said in a written statement .
" He 's dedicated his career to our country and served with honor , intelligence and distinction .
That service should not be tarnished by honest mistakes , which , upon learning of them , he quickly addressed . "
The Finance Committee said it would continue to review Geithner 's tax returns and other information ahead of a nomination hearing .
" When errors or issues of concern are discovered , transparency is vital to allow members of the Committee and the entire Senate to fully review and assess the relevant information before hearings and votes occur , " the committee said in a written statement .
" I believe that these errors , although serious , do not rise to the level of disqualification .
He is an extremely competent man , " said Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont .
" The errors were , in my judgment , honest mistakes .
He did not in any way intentionally make those mistakes . "
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , also said the mistakes were " not at all disqualifying . "
" Tim came to the committee , admitted he had made some mistakes , and was very contrite , " he said in a written statement .
" I continue to strongly support his nomination and given the tough economic conditions , hope we can confirm him as quickly as possible . "

The Home Office has quietly adopted a new plan to allow police across Britain routinely to hack into people ’s personal computers without a warrant .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The move , which follows a decision by the European Union ’s council of ministers in Brussels , has angered civil liberties groups and opposition MPs .
They described it as a sinister extension of the surveillance state which drives “ a coach and horses ” through privacy laws .
The hacking is known as “ remote searching ” .
It allows police or MI5 officers who may be hundreds of miles away to examine covertly the hard drive of someone ’s PC at his home , office or hotel room .
Material gathered in this way includes the content of all e-mails , web - browsing habits and instant messaging .
Under the Brussels edict , police across the EU have been given the green light to expand the implementation of a rarely used power involving warrantless intrusive surveillance of private property .
The strategy will allow French , German and other EU forces to ask British officers to hack into someone ’s UK computer and pass over any material gleaned .

Each brain image shows the change in brain metabolism when subjects were asked to inhibit their response to food during food stimulation compared with when they were not told to inhibit their response .
Two brain sections at different levels of the brain are shown for each group ( women , men , and women vs. men ) .
Top row , women :
No color indicates that women had no significant differences in brain activity between the two conditions .
Middle row , men : Blue colored areas were significantly less active when men were told to inhibit their response to food than they were without inhibition .
Third row , women vs. men : Orange color indicates areas where men showed greater decrements with inhibition than women .
These brain regions are involved in emotional regulation , conditioning , and the motivation to eat .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A ground - breaking brain - imaging study at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Brookhaven National Laboratory shows that men , but not women , are able to control their brain ’s response to their own favorite foods .
The study , which will be published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of January 19 , 2009 , may help explain why rates of obesity and eating disorders are higher among women than men , and why women typically have more difficulty losing weight .
“ Our findings may help us understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the ability to control food intake , and suggest new pharmacological methods or other interventions to help people regulate eating behavior and maintain a healthy weight , ” said Gene - Jack Wang , lead author on the study .
“ The surprising finding of a difference between genders in the ability to inhibit the brain ’s response to food and hunger will certainly merit further study . ”
The scientists used positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning to monitor brain activity in 13 female and 10 male volunteers .
In this method , a form of glucose “ tagged ” with a radioactive tracer molecule is injected into the blood stream while subjects lie in the PET scanner .
The scanner tracks the tracer ’s signal to monitor the uptake and use of the glucose by various regions of the brain .
All study subjects were of normal body weight and had fasted for nearly 20 hours before each of three separate scans , performed in random order .
On one scan day , subjects were presented with their favorite foods — from bacon - egg - and - cheese sandwiches to pizza , cinnamon buns , barbecue ribs , and chocolate cake — warmed , if appropriate , to enhance the enticing aromas and taste .
During the scan , subjects were asked to smell , taste , observe , and react to the food , but not eat it .
On another day , they were instructed to inhibit their desire for food prior to being tempted with the same foods .
A control scan with no food was performed on another day .
The volunteers were also asked to rate the foods and describe their feelings of hunger and their desire to eat during the scans when food was presented .
In both men and women , a variety of brain areas associated with emotional regulation , conditioning , and motivation “ lit up , ” indicating increased metabolic activity in those regions , in response to the tempting foods when compared with the no-food scans — a finding consistent with earlier work using the same setup at Brookhaven Lab .
When asked to inhibit their response to food , both men and women described themselves as less hungry and less interested in eating than when they were n’t trying to inhibit their response .
But only the men showed a relative decrease in activity in the food - activated brain regions during the scan when they were asked to inhibit their response .
“ Even though the women said they were less hungry when trying to inhibit their response to the food , their brains were still firing away in the regions that control the drive to eat , ” Wang said .
“ In contrast , men ’s brain activity decreased along with their self - reports of hunger during the scan when they were asked to keep their hunger in check . ”
The researchers believe this is the first study to document such a gender - specific disconnect between subjective reports of an emotional or motivational state and the associated pattern of brain activity .
“ This may indicate a difference between the genders in the ability to perceive and respond to internal body signals , ” Wang said .
“ The finding of a lack of response to inhibition in women is consistent with behavioral studies showing that women have a higher tendency than men to overeat when presented with palatable food or under emotional distress , ” Wang said .
“ This decreased inhibitory control in women could be a major factor contributing to the observed differences in the prevalence rates of obesity and eating disorders such as binge eating between the genders , and may also underlie women ’s lower success in losing weight while dieting when compared with men . ”
Differences in sex hormones , such as estrogen , may underlie these gender differences and merit further exploration .
Sex hormones are known to directly influence food intake , body weight , and fat distribution , as well as the signaling of other molecules involved in regulating eating behavior , the researchers said .
This study did not control for variations in the menstrual cycle of the female research subjects .
“ A woman ’s menstrual cycle can be an important factor in responsiveness to reward and in successful quit attempts for smoking , ” said National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) Director Nora Volkow , who was a collaborator on this study .
“ Its role in inhibiting food - related brain activation will be important to address in future studies . ”
This study was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse , the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , and by the General Clinical Research Center of Stony Brook University .

Hillary Clinton is reported to have said yes to an offer from President - elect Barack Obama to become the next United States Secretary of State .
Clinton flew to Chicago last last week to discuss the possibility with Obama , although New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson was also said to be in the running .
The Guardian broke the story , and said Obama ’s advisers have begun looking into Bill Clinton ’s foundation , which distributes millions of dollars to Africa to help with development , to ensure that there is no conflict of interest , but Democrats do not believe that the vetting is likely to be a problem .
Donklephant notes that although it ’s not a great path to the White House , “ Biden wo n’t be running in 2016 , so this keeps Hillary on the world stage , keeps Bill in a cage and therefore helps Obama keep everybody in check .

GOP tradition fades in New England ( They were always Rats in Republican disguise )
Posted on by tobyhill
A generation ago the Republican Party was the dominant political force in New England , populating the region 's congressional delegations with moderates like Connecticut 's Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Rhode Island 's John Chafee .
But today 's GOP , led by a more socially conservative wing of the party , is finding votes harder to come by .
Voters on Tuesday cast out Connecticut 's veteran Rep. Chris Shays , the last New England Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives .
Sen .
John Sununu was voted out in New Hampshire , leaving that state 's Judd Gregg and Maine 's Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe as the only Republicans among the region 's 12 senators .

I 'm not completely sure why NH voters have embraced socialism .

Are We in a Recession or a Depression ?
There seems to be a lot of confusion as to whether we are in a recession or a depression , so I decided to do some investigating .
Here is what I found out .
According to Merriam - Webster 's Dictionary , the official definition of a recession is " a period of reduced economic activity . "
Furthermore , some economists have an even more strict definition for a recession requiring a contracting economy of either 2 or 4 consecutive quarters ( either 6 or 12 months ) .
Using any of these definitions , the United States of America as well as the rest of the world is in a recession as of December 2008 .
Even the National Bureau of Economic Research has officially declared that we are in a recession too .
On the other hand , according to Merriam - Webster 's Dictionary , the official definition of a depression is " a period of low general economic activity marked especially by rising levels of unemployment . "
Unfortunately , I was not able find a more technical definition for a depression anywhere .
Therefore with the mass unemployment throughout the world and with the economy shrinking , I can only conclude that we are in a depression too .
As a result , the world is in both a recession and a depression .
Apparently , these two economic descriptions are not mutually exclusive as I was led to believe .

Today , the Canwest - owned Vancouver Sun published an editorial that claimed “ no good would come from bringing down the Conservative government this early in its renewed mandate ” .
It was typical balderdash from the Vancouver Sun , which has always endorsed Harper and even endorsed Stockwell Day when he ran for prime minister in 2000 .
As the Georgia Straight pointed out in its pre-election issue — which carried the cover line “ Stop Harper ” — a great deal of good would come from replacing Harper as prime minister and tossing the Conservatives out .
Here are just a few positive things that might happen :
” ¢ A Liberal - NDP coalition government would stop the senseless appeal of B.C. Supreme Court Justice Ian Pitfield ’s decision that allowed Vancouver ’s supervised - injection site to remain open .
”¢ Canada might get a prime minister who wo n’t boycott an international AIDS conference in his own country and who does n't reject the wisdom of scientists on issues ranging from climate change to drug treatment .
”¢ Canada would have a prime minister who recognizes the urgency of climate change and who would give responsible instructions to Canada ’s negotiating team at the crucial UN climate conference that begins in Copenhagen this November .
” ¢
There would be less spending on the military and more spending on the arts , which would n't be treated as a " niche issue " by the government .
”¢ Canadians could feel confident that the military mission in Afghanistan would n’t continue after 2011 .
” ¢ A Liberal - NDP coalition government would appoint more progressive judges to the Supreme Court of Canada and to superior courts in the provinces .
” ¢
There would be a reduced chance of the Canadian government extraditing Marc Emery to the United States , where he would rot in jail for the rest of his life for selling marijuana seeds over the Internet .
” ¢
The court challenges program would be reinstated , resulting in a more level playing field for disadvantaged groups .
Canada might even get a national daycare program if Harper is bounced out of office .
” ¢ A federal stem - cell advisory panel would n’t be stacked with opponents of embryonic stem - cell research , which would be a relief to those who suffer from Type 1 diabetes , Parkinson ’s disease , and other debilitating conditions .
”¢ Stockwell Day would no longer be a senior cabinet minister , and whoever is in cabinet will no longer be muzzled and have their communications and speeches vetted by the prime minister 's office .
”¢ Canada might finally approve a UN resolution regarding indigenous rights .
”¢ Canada would no longer be ruled by a control freak who has exerted greater political control over the RCMP , which poses a threat to Canadian civil liberties .
Mr. anonymous Vancouver Sun editorial writer , you got it wrong when you claimed that no good would come from bringing down the Conservative government .
In the eyes of many people who live in Metro Vancouver , Canada would enjoy many benefits if Harper was forced into opposition .
We might even get more cabinet ministers out of the deal .
CHICAGO  President - elect Barack Obama pledged Thursday to disclose any interaction between his transition team and the office of besieged Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois , while declaring again that he and his staff had no involvement in deal - making over an appointment to his vacated Senate seat .
Federal officials also acknowledged that a grand jury was weighing evidence in the case against Mr. Blagojevich , though the timing of any indictment was unclear .
Mr. Blagojevich was arrested Tuesday on charges of conspiracy and soliciting bribes in a case that involved , among other things , accusations that he had sought to put Mr. Obama ’s seat in the Senate up for sale .
In a rare firsthand account of how Mr. Blagojevich , a two - term Democrat , went about the selection process , an Illinois state senator said in an interview that he had felt pressured to respond to the governor ’s interest in him with a quid pro quo agreement and has withdrawn his name because of increasing wariness about the process .
The state senator , Kwame Raoul , who represents the South Side of Chicago , offered few details of his interaction with the governor ’s office but said he received a call about a month ago confirming that he was under consideration .
Soon afterward , however , Mr. Raoul said he ran head - on into another message : that the governor was looking for a candidate who offered something of tangible value to him .
EDEN PRAIRIE , Minn . --
The NFL has given the Minnesota Vikings one last chance to sell out the Metrodome for Sunday 's playoff game against Philadelphia .
The Vikings have until 4:30 p.m. EST on Saturday to sell the remaining 3,100 tickets to avoid a television blackout in local markets .
The task is n't as daunting as it appeared earlier in the week .
The Vikings were granted their first extension on Thursday and still had a whopping 8,000 tickets to unload to avoid the first blackout since 1997 .
But the team made big strides , selling nearly 5,000 tickets as of Friday afternoon .
The remaining tickets are priced $ 80 , $ 120 and $ 160 a piece .
It 's the first time the Vikings have been in the playoffs since the 2004 season .
Meanwhile , the Arizona Cardinals have sold enough tickets to Saturday 's game against the Atlanta Falcons for it to be televised in the Phoenix area .
The NFL gave the team two 24 - hour extensions , the last expiring Friday afternoon .
About 2,400 tickets remained Friday morning .
Tickets returned from the visiting team allotment and club seats remain available for purchase .
Neither counts against the blackout rules .
A rare condition , in which some women can be allergic to sex with men , can occur .
The compounds in the semen that appear to trigger this allergy seem to be proteins from the prostate gland .
Women can be allergic to sex
Allergic women produce an antibody to the proteins .
This disorder is termed as " human seminal plasma hypersensitivity . "
If left untreated , this problem is a sure marriage and relationship wrecker .
It could also be a source of frustration for the couple who wants to have children but must always use a condom .
The first case of an allergy to human seminal fluid was documented in 1958 .
Since then , the disorder has been diagnosed in a small number of cases .
However , allergists believe the disorder is not readily recognized by gynaecologists .
Clinical presentation during sex allergy
For many women , a sexual allergy is as serious as a heart attack .
Most sufferers complain of symptoms that include wheezing , itching , swelling and hives elsewhere on the body , chest tightness , vomiting , or diarrhoea .
Semen allergy symptoms include localized reactions such as itching , burning and swelling in the genitals .
Some women even report blisters in and near their genitalia .
Severe reactions include choking sensation , loss of consciousness , drop in blood pressure or complete circulatory collapse .
These distressed women could also die if anaphylactic shock causes the air pathways to swell up and block completely .
Typically symptoms occur within 30 minutes of intercourse , but in rare cases it may be hours or even days late .
In some women , the reaction occurs only with one partner while others are allergic to all partners .
Also , women are not in all cases allergic to semen itself , but to chemicals in the semen from food , beverages or medications that the man has had , ranging from penicillin to compounds in walnuts .
In an annual meeting of the American College of Allergy , a researcher put forth that about half of all women with semen allergy have other allergies as well , such as skin allergy or hay fever .
Most women with the allergy are between age 20 and 30 , and 41 percent experience symptoms the first time they have sex .
In most cases , symptoms gradually worsen and occur sooner with subsequent exposures .
Diagnosis of sex allergy
Seminal fluid hypersensitivity can be anticipated when a female has zero symptoms after sex with a condom but shows clear symptoms of human seminal plasma hypersensitivity in case of unprotected intercourse .
For the initial diagnostic screening , a single sample of the male 's ejaculate is needed .
But then the allergist needs 5 to 7 days worth of ejaculate to have the volume to formulate enough vaccine for regular injections .
A skin reactivity test can confirm if a woman is allergic to seminal fluid .

HOPING YOUR MAN IS A MIND - READER
It may be a feminine game , but it wo n’t get you what you want .
Men just do n’t think that way , and it ’s disrespectful to later blame them for something they could never figure out from such indirect communication .
Drop the games and be direct .
Effective communication is what will hold you in good stead .
If you ’re embarrassed to ask what you want , use language which makes your meaning clear .
Though you may find it difficult to express your emotions , he ’ll need feedback to make sure he carries on enthusiastically .
Losing your self in your bliss and not saying anything will make him wonder if you ’re asleep , dead or uninterested , at which point he is most likely to stop .
RESENTING HIM WHEN HE DOESN ’T GET IT RIGHT
If you want more foreplay , then you need to say so .
If he charges straight into your erogenous zones after a few minutes ’ of petting and kissing , then you need to educate him about what you want .
Men are much more quickly aroused than women on the whole , and they simply need slowing down .
As a woman you ’re likely to be more creative than a man , so maybe you can apply your creative skills to sex , and improve it for both of you !
NOT REALISING THAT ‘WOMEN COME FIRST ’!
Well , maybe not in everything , but it ’s not a bad rule to follow during sex .
Men lose interest after a while : like it or not , that ’s how they are biologically built ( in fact they are programmed to sleep after sex ) and unless they ’re especially sensitive , they wo n’t be much interested in your satisfaction .
The best way to deal with this is to have extended foreplay .
This way he ’ll be very turned on and he will enjoy the act .
BEING CRITICAL OF YOUR BODY
It ’s hard for women to believe , but it ’s true .
In general , men are much less critical of your body than you are .
When you start hiding it during sex , or refusing to enjoy certain sexual positions because you fear what he might think of your body , he ’s likely to get very disenchanted , very quickly .
If you need reassurance that your body is OK , remember rule number 1 : ask him for it .
Say , for example , “ Do you find me attractive ? ”
NOT BEING ASSERTIVE DURING SEX
It ’s an old , old stereotype : men lead , women follow .
Well , that certainly should n’t be true all the time in sex .
Even if you like him to be masculine and dominant during sex , or even if you like to feel as if you ’re being “ taken ” sometimes , it ’s just as nice for him to see your assertive side .
Take the lead from time to time .
BEING CRITICAL OF HIS PERFORMANCE
Nothing but nothing will turn a man off faster than being critical .
Instead , find a way of gently expressing your feelings .
BEING TOO INSECURE
You want the lights off , you have to be under the covers and you never want to take off your shirt .
Yeah , that sounds like some really exciting sex .
If he ’s with you , it ’s because he likes you .
So it ’s time you got over your insecurities and gave in to your flaws .
You can do so with baby steps by lighting candles .
You are all set , go with the flow

The full scale of devastation in Gaza following Israel 's three - week offensive is becoming clear , after both Israel and Hamas declared ceasefires .
UN official John Ging said half a million people had been without water since the conflict began , and huge numbers of people were without power .
Four thousand homes are ruined and tens of thousands of people are homeless .
Israeli spokesman Mark Regev said he expected border crossings to open for aid later on Monday .
" We are going to see a massive volume of aid entering the Gaza Strip , " he told the BBC .

Middle East conflict : History in maps " Medicines , foodstuffs , energy , all will be reaching the Gaza Strip in the volume that is required and in an expeditious manner . "
Speaking at an Arab League summit in Kuwait , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for the formation of a national unity government in the Palestinian territories , along with simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections .
Correspondents say Mr Abbas is facing challenges to his legitimacy , with Hamas claiming his term is over and many of his supporters angered by criticisms he made of the militant group while it was under fire from Israel .
Previous talks on a unity government have broken down , and the two sides remain divided over the timing of possible elections .
The league is expected to discuss a proposal for a $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) fund for reconstruction in Gaza .
Saudi King Abdullah said his country would donate $ 1bn .
Correspondents say the summit was supposed to focus on economic reform , but has been overshadowed by the Gaza crisis and the divided political response of Arab leaders .
Israel says it is not interested in staying in Gaza Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak accused Hamas of inviting the Israeli offensive by not extending a six - month ceasefire - brokered by Egypt - when it expired last month .
Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he wanted troops to leave as quickly as possible , and some have already left .
The BBC's Christian Fraser , on the road from Rafah in the south to Gaza City in the north , says the troops are pulling out fast .
Traffic jams are building up , as people try to get to Gaza City to reunite with friends and relatives , he says , while Hamas fighters stride confidently down the road with rifles slung across their shoulders .
Big questions Israel called a ceasefire on Saturday , saying it had met its war aims .
Hamas later declared its own truce with one of its leaders claiming a " great victory " over Israel and saying its ability to fire rockets had not been affected by the Israeli strikes .

The BBC's Bethany Bell in Jerusalem says many people face shortages of food , medicine and fuel .
Mr Ging , director of operations for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees ( Unrwa ) , said most important was how to get basic supplies into Gaza .
" We have a big recovery operation ahead of us , reconstruction - none of it will be possible of course , on any scale , until we get crossing points open , " he told the BBC .

Big questions remain , our correspondent says , such as who will police Gaza 's southern border with Egypt and how much power Hamas still has .
At least 1,300 Palestinians , according to Palestinian sources , and 13 Israelis have been killed since Israel launched its offensive on 27 December .
Palestinian medical sources say at least 95 bodies have been pulled from the rubble since Israel halted its assault .
Correspondents say the ceasefire in Gaza remains fragile , although no air strikes , rocket attacks or major clashes were reported overnight .
Palestinian militants fired about 20 rockets over the border after the Israeli ceasefire announcement , and Israel responded with an air attack .
' Israeli failure ' Surrounded by an array of European political leaders , some of whom were highly critical of Israel 's tactics in the conflict with Hamas , the Israeli prime minister said his country was not interested in staying in the Gaza Strip .
" We did n't set out to control Gaza , we do n't want to remain in Gaza and we intend on leaving Gaza as quickly as possible , " he said .
Israelis and Palestinians give their views on Israel 's ceasefire announcement

Anonymous Israeli officials , quoted by AP news agency , said the withdrawal would be completed before US President - elect Barack Obama 's inauguration on Tuesday .
Correspondents say Israeli leaders want to get off to a smooth start with the new administration in Washington .
The European leaders had travelled to Israel to lend their support to the ceasefires .
The top Hamas leader in Gaza , Ismail Haniya , said Israel had " failed to achieve its goals " .
In a speech broadcast on Hamas TV , he said : " God has granted us a great victory , not for one faction , or party , or area , but for our entire people . "
Hamas said it would hold fire for a week to give Israel time to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip .
A spokesman for Hamas ' military wing , Abu Ubaida , said its rocket capabilities had not been affected by the conflict .
" We hereby stress that our rockets are being developed and are piling up , and that the enemy will receive more rockets and God willing , our rockets will hit more targets , " he said in a news conference broadcast live on Hamas ' al - Aqsa TV .

Bolivia 's President Evo Morales is likely to see his reforms approved
By James Painter
BBC Latin America analyst
Bolivians go to the polls on Sunday to vote in a referendum on a new constitution , which would make permanent a number of radical changes promoted by left - wing President Evo Morales .
It is the second time in six months that Bolivia has voted .
Last August , Mr Morales won 67 % of the popular vote in a recall referendum on his presidency , up from the 54 % he won in the December 2005 presidential elections .
His continuing popularity , and divisions within the opposition , mean that the Yes vote is very likely to win this latest poll .
But there is plenty of room for disagreement over the implementation of the new constitution , and disputes between the government and the right - wing opposition look set to continue regardless .
Rocky path Bolivia 's Congress approved holding a referendum only after Mr Morales agreed to make a number of concessions .
Crucially , Mr Morales agreed to restrict his candidature as president to a single five - year term .
Under the current 1967 constitution , no president is allowed to have two consecutive terms .
This was due to be changed under the original draft text , prompting fears from the opposition that Mr Morales could stay in office until 2019 .
Under the new constitution , Catholicism would no longer be the official religion
But in a key concession , the president promised to stand just once more in elections due in December this year if the new constitution is approved .
This means that he is still likely to stay in power until 2014 , but he says no longer .
He also made other concessions on autonomy , land reform and Congressional voting procedures .
Nonetheless , in his view , the key changes - extending the rights of Bolivia 's 36 indigenous groups and strengthening state control over the country 's natural resources - remain broadly intact .
When agreement was reached on the concessions back in October , Mr Morales wept in front of a huge crowd of supporters in La Paz 's Central Plaza , where Indians were not allowed to set foot until the 1950s .
" We have made history , " he said .
" I can now go to the cemetery a happy man . "
Key provisions
Among the 411 articles of the new constitution , some of the key changes provide for : • A mixed economy which recognises public , private and communitarian ownership .
However , the state will control natural resources such as oil , gas and minerals •
The state as unitary and pluri-national , designed to stress the importance of ethnicity in Bolivia 's make - up .
A whole chapter of the draft text is devoted to indigenous rights •
Power will be decentralised , creating four levels of autonomy - departmental , regional , municipal and indigenous • Indigenous systems of justice will be given the same status as the official existing system .
Judges will be elected , and no longer appointed by Congress .
In a further concession , Mr Morales agreed that new limits on land ownership will not be retroactive - a parallel referendum on Sunday will determine whether this limit should be set at 5,000 ( 12,355 acres ) or 10,000 hectares ( 24,700 acres ) .
Battles are looming over how [ the constitution 's ] provisions are finally applied
John Crabtree
Analyst
But even if the vote is in favour of 5,000 hectares - and there are many farms in the east larger than this - landowners will not be affected if they can show that their land is not idle and fulfils a social and economic function .
However , Mr Morales ' opponents say that since it will be up to central government to decide if landowners are complying , the system could be open to abuse .
Another controversial change to the constitution is that Catholicism would no longer be the official state religion - there would be no state religion .
The Church has also criticised the new draft text for not recognising the right to life from conception ( possibly opening the way to legalising abortion ) , although the existing constitution does not either .
Some bishops have joined with the opposition in campaigning against the constitution .
One of their slogans says " Choose God , Vote for No " .
Conflict remains
Most analysts say that despite making a number of concessions , Mr Morales remains in a strong position .
They point out that the opposition is split between more moderate members of the Congress and the more confrontational governors of the four , mainly eastern , departments known as the media luna , or half - crescent .
" The balance of power shifted , " says George Gray Molina , a research fellow at Oxford University in the UK .
Protests against the government have sometimes turned violent " Evo has already won the referendum vote .
The opposition will probably retrench for a while with an eye on providing a unitary candidate for the December [ presidential ] elections , " he says .
However , there is plenty of room for continuing opposition from the four media luna departments , which tend to be wealthier and more ethnically mixed than the mainly indigenous departments of the western highlands .
They want more autonomy from the central state .
They also contain most of Bolivia 's natural gas production and agribusiness , such as soya .
There are two main issues over which opposition civic organisations can continue to fight .
The first is whether their departments will have priority over the other three levels of autonomous organisation envisaged in the new constitution .
Another is how the taxes on gas exports will be divided up between the state and the four levels of autonomous organisations .
" The civic groups in Santa Cruz and Tarija , in particular , will continue to demand a bigger share of the proceeds of gas exports , " says John Crabtree , an analyst at the Oxford Centre for Latin American Studies in the UK .
" While the new constitution may now be legally enacted , " he says , " battles are looming over how its provisions are finally applied . "

I always feel more lonely when it 's cold .
The cold outside my window reminds me of the cold emanating from my own body .
I 'm being attacked from two directions .
But I 'm constantly resisting .
That 's why I cut a hole in the ice every morning .
If anyone were to stand with a telescope on the ice in the frozen bay and saw what I was doing , he would think that I was crazy and was about to arrange my own death .
A naked man in the freezing cold , with an axe in his hand , opening up a hole in the ice ?
I suppose , really , that I hope there will be somebody out there one of these days , a black shadow against all the white – somebody who sees me and wonders if he'd be able to stop me before it was too late .
But it 's not necessary to stop me because I have no intention of committing suicide .
Earlier in my life , in connection with the big catastrophe , my fury and despair were sometimes so overwhelming that I did consider doing away with myself .
But I never actually tried .
Cowardice has been a faithful companion throughout my life .
Like now , I thought then that life is all about never losing your grip .
Life is a flimsy branch over an abyss .
I 'm hanging on to it for as long as I have the strength .
Eventually I shall fall , like everybody else , and I do n't know what will lie in store .
Is there somebody down there to catch me ?
Or will there be nothing but cold , harsh blackness rushing towards me ?

The ice is here to stay .
It 's a hard winter this year , at the beginning of the new millennium .
This morning , when I woke up in the December darkness , I thought I could hear the ice singing .
I do n't know where I 've got the idea from that ice can sing .
Perhaps my grandfather , who was born here on this little island , told me about it when I was a small boy .
But I was woken up this morning , while it was still dark , by a sound .
It was n't the cat or the dog .
I have two pets who sleep more soundly than I do .
My cat is old and stiff , and my dog is stone deaf in his right ear and can't hear much in his left .
I can creep past him without him knowing .
But that noise ?
I tried to get my bearings in the darkness .
It was some time before I realised that it must be the ice moving , although it 's a foot or more deep here in the bay .
Last week , one day when I was more troubled than usual , I walked out towards the edge of the ice , where it meets the open sea , now stretching for a mile beyond the outermost skerry .
That means that the ice here in the bay ought not to have been moving at all .
But , in fact , it was rising and falling , creaking and singing .
I listened to this sound , and it occurred to me that my life has passed very fast .
Now I 'm here .
A man aged 66 , financially independent , burdened with a memory that plagues me constantly .
I grew up in desperate circumstances that are impossible to imagine nowadays in Sweden .
My father was a browbeaten and overweight waiter , and my mother spent all her time trying to make ends meet .
I succeeded in clambering out of that pit of poverty .
As a child , I used to play out here in the archipelago every summer , and had no concept of time passing .
In those days my grandfather and grandmother were still active , they had n't yet aged to a point where they were unable to move and merely waited for death .
He smelled of fish , and she had no teeth left .
Although she was always kind to me , there was something frightening about her smile , the way her mouth opened to reveal a black hole .
It seems not so long ago since I was in the first act .
Now the epilogue has already started .
The ice was singing out there in the darkness , and I wondered if I was about to suffer a heart attack .
I got up and took my blood pressure .
There was nothing wrong with me , the reading was 155/90 , my pulse was normal at 64 beats per minute .
I felt to see if I had a pain anywhere .
My left leg ached slightly , but it always does and it's not something I worry about .
But the sound of the ice out there was influencing my mood .
Like an eerie choir made up of strange voices .
I sat down in the kitchen and waited for dawn .
The timbers of the cottage were creaking and squeaking .
Either the cold was causing the timber to contract , or perhaps a mouse was scurrying along one of its secret passages .
111
The thermometer attached to the outside of the kitchen window indicated minus 19 degrees Celsius .
I decide that today I shall do exactly what I do every other winter day .
I put on my dressing gown , thrust my feet into a pair of cut - down wellington boots , collect my axe and walk down to the jetty .
It does n't take long to open up my hole in the ice – the area I usually chip away has n't had time to freeze hard again .
Then I undress and jump into the slushy water .
It hurts , but when I clamber out , it feels as if the cold has been transformed into intensive heat .
Every day I jump down into my black hole in order to get the feeling that I 'm still alive .
Afterwards , it 's as if my loneliness slowly fades away .
One day , perhaps , I shall die of the shock from plunging into freezing cold water .
As my feet reach the bottom I can stand up in the water ; I shan't disappear under the ice .
I shall remain standing there as the ice quickly freezes up again .
That 's where Jansson , the man who delivers post to the islands in the archipelago , will find me .
No matter how long he lives , he will never understand what happened .
But I do n't worry about that .
I 've arranged my home out here on the little island I inherited as an impregnable fortress .
When I climb the hill behind my house , I can see directly out to sea .
There 's nothing there but tiny islands and rocks , their low backs just about visible over the surface of the water , or the ice .
If I look in the other direction , I can see the more substantial and less inhospitable islands of the inner archipelago .
But nowhere is there any other dwelling to be seen .
Needless to say , this is n't how I 'd envisaged it .
This house was going to be my summer cottage .
Not my final redoubt .
Every morning , when I 've cut my hole in the ice or lowered myself down into the warm waters of summer , I am again amazed by what has happened to my life .
I made a mistake .
And I refused to accept the consequences .
If I 'd known then what I know now , what would I have done ?
I 'm not sure .
But I know I would n't have needed to spend my life out here like a prisoner , on a deserted island at the edge of the open sea .
I should have followed my plan .
I made up my mind to become a doctor on my fifteenth birthday .
To my amazement my father had taken me out for a meal .
He worked as a waiter , but in a stubborn attempt to preserve his dignity he worked only during the day , never in the evening .
If he was instructed to work evenings , he would resign .
I can still recall my mother 's tears when he came home and announced that he had resigned again .
But now , out of the blue , he was going to take me to a restaurant for a meal .
I had heard my parents quarrelling about whether or not I should be given this " present " , and it ended with my mother locking herself away in the bedroom .
That was normal when something went against her wishes .
Those were especially difficult periods when she spent most of her time locked away in the bedroom .
The room always smelled of lavender and tears .
I always slept on the kitchen sofa , and my father would sigh deeply as he made his bed on a mattress on the floor .
In my life I have come across many people who weep .
During my years as a doctor , I frequently met people who were dying , and others who had been forced to accept that a loved one was dying .
But their tears never emitted a perfume reminiscent of my mother's .
On the way to the restaurant , my father explained to me that she was oversensitive .
I still can't recall what my response was .
What could I say ?
My earliest memories are of my mother crying hour after hour , lamenting the shortage of money , the poverty that undermined our lives .
My father did n't seem to hear her weeping .
If she was in a good mood when he came home , all was well .
If she was in bed , surrounded by the scent of lavender , that was also good .
My father used to devote his evenings to sorting out his large collection of tin soldiers , and reconstructing famous battles .
Before I fell asleep , he would often lie down beside me on my bed , stroke my head , and express his regret at the fact that my mother was so sensitive that , unfortunately , it was not possible to present me with any brothers or sisters .
I grew up in a no - man 's - land between tears and tin soldiers .
And with a father who insisted that , as with an opera singer , a waiter required decent shoes if he was to be able to do his job properly .
It turned out in accordance with his wish .
We went to the restaurant .
A waiter came to take our order .
My father asked all kinds of complicated and detailed questions about the veal he eventually ordered .
I had plumped for herring .
My summers spent in the archipelago had taught me to appreciate fish .
The waiter left us in peace .
This was the first time I had ever drunk a glass of wine .
I was intoxicated almost with the first sip .
After the meal , my father smiled and asked me what career I intended to take up .
I did n't know .
He 'd invested a lot of money enabling me to stay on at school .
The depressing atmosphere and shabbily dressed teachers patrolling the evil - smelling corridors had not inspired me to think about the future .
It was a matter of surviving from day to day , preferably avoiding being exposed as one of those who had n't done their homework , and not collecting a black mark .
Each day was always very pressing , and it was impossible to envisage a horizon beyond the end of term .
Even today , I can't remember a single occasion when I spoke to my classmates about the future .
" You 're 15 now , " my father said .
" It 's time for you to think about what you 're going to do in life .
Are you interested in the culinary trade ?
When you 've passed your exams you could earn enough washing dishes to fund a passage to America .
It 's a good idea to see the world .
Just make sure that you have a decent pair of shoes . "
" I do n't want to be a waiter . "
I was very firm about that .
I was n't sure if my father was disappointed or relieved .
He took a sip of wine , stroked his nose , then asked if I had any definite plans for my life .
" No . "
" But you must have had a thought or two .
What 's your favourite subject ? "
" Music . "
" Can you sing ?
That would be news to me . "
" No , I ca n't sing . "
" Have you learnt to play an instrument , without my knowing ? "
" No . "
" Then why do you like music best ? "
" Because Ramberg , the music teacher , pays no attention to me . "
" What do you mean by that ? "
" He 's only interested in pupils who can sing .
He does n't even know the rest of us are there . "
" So your favourite subject is the one that you do n't really attend , is that it ? "
" Chemistry 's good as well . "
My father was obviously surprised by this .
For a brief moment he seemed to be searching through his memory for his own inadequate schooldays , and wondering if there had even been a subject called chemistry .
As I looked at him , he seemed bewitched .
He was transformed before my very eyes .
Until now the only things about him that had changed over the years were his clothes , his shoes and the colour of his hair ( which had become greyer and greyer ) .
But now something unexpected was happening .
He seemed to be afflicted by a sort of helplessness that I 'd never noticed before .
Although he'd often sat on the edge of my bed or swum with me out here in the bay , he was always distant .
Now , when he was exhibiting his helplessness , he seemed to come much closer to me .
I was stronger than the man sitting opposite me , on the other side of the white tablecloth , in a restaurant where an ensemble was playing music that nobody listened to , where cigarette smoke mixed with pungent perfumes , and the wine was ebbing away from his glass .
That was when I made up my mind what I would say .
That was the very moment at which I discovered , or perhaps devised , my future .
My father fixed me with his greyish - blue eyes .
He seemed to have recovered from the feeling of helplessness that had overcome him .
But I had seen it , and would never forget it .
" You say you think that chemistry is good .
Why ? "
" Because I 'm going to be a doctor .
So you have to know a bit about chemical substances .
I want to do operations . "
He looked at me with obvious disgust .
" You mean you want to cut people up ? "
" Yes . "
" But you can't be a doctor unless you stay on at school longer . "
" That 's what I intend doing . "
" So that you can poke your fingers around people 's insides ? "
" I want to be a surgeon . "
I 'd never thought about the possibility of becoming a doctor .
I did n't faint at the sight of blood , or when I had an injection ; but I 'd never thought about life in hospital wards and operating theatres .
As we walked home that April evening , my father a bit tipsy and me a 15 - year - old suffering from his first taste of wine , I realised that I had n't only answered my father 's questions .
I 'd given myself something to live up to .
I was going to become a doctor .
I was going to spend my life cutting into people 's bodies .
Chapter 2
There was no post today .
There was no post yesterday either .
But Jansson , the postman , does come to my island .
He does n't bring me junk mail .
I 've forbidden him to do so .
Twelve years ago I told him not to bother making the journey if he was only bringing junk mail .
I was tired of all the special offers on computers and knuckles of pork .
I told him I did n't need it – people who were trying to control my life by pestering me with special offers .
Life is not about cut prices , I tried to explain to him .
Life is basically about something more important .
I do n't know what exactly but , nevertheless , one must believe that it is important , and that the hidden meaning is something more substantial than discount coupons and scratch cards .
We quarrelled .
It was not the last time .
I sometimes think it is our anger that binds us together .
But he never came with junk mail after that .
The last time he had a letter for me , it was a communication from the local council .
That was over seven years ago , an autumn day with a fresh gale blowing from the north - east , and low tide .
The letter informed me that I had been allocated a plot in the cemetery .
Jansson claimed that all local residents had received a similar letter .
It was a new service : all tax - paying residents should know the location of their eventual grave , in case they wished to go to the cemetery and find out who they would have as neighbours .
It was the only real letter I have received in the last 12 years , apart V C from dreary pension documents , tax forms and bank statements .
Jansson always appears at around two in the afternoon .
I suspect he has to come out this far in order to be able to claim full travel expenses from the Post Office for his boat or his hydrocopter .
I 've tried to ask him about that , but he never answers .
It could even be that I 'm the one who makes it practical for him to continue as postman .
That the authorities would have cancelled deliveries altogether but for the fact that he heaves to at my jetty three times a week in the winter months , and five times a week in the summer .
Fifteen years ago , there were about 50 permanent residents out here in the archipelago .
There was a boat ferrying four youngsters to and from the village school .
This year there are only seven of us left , and only one is under the age of 60 .
That 's Jansson .
As the youngest , he is dependent on the rest of us keeping going , and insisting on living out here on the remote islands .
Otherwise there 'll be no job for him .
But that 's irrelevant to me .
I do n't like Jansson .
He 's one of the most difficult patients I 've ever had .
He belongs to a group of extremely recalcitrant hypochondriacs .
On one occasion a few years ago , when I 'd examined his throat and checked his blood pressure , he suddenly said he thought he had a brain tumour that was affecting his eyesight .
I said I did n't have time to listen to his imaginings .
But he insisted .
Something was happening inside his brain .
I asked him why he thought that .
Did he have headaches ?
Did he have dizzy spells ?
Any other symptoms ?
He did n't give up until I 'd dragged him into the boathouse , where it was darker , and shone my special torch into his pupils , and told him that everything seemed to be normal .
I 'm convinced that Jansson is basically as sound as a bell .
His father is 97 and lives in a care home , but his mind is clear .
Jansson and his father fell out in 1970 , and then Jansson stopped helping his father to fish for eels and went to work at a sawmill in Småland instead .
I 've never understood why he chose a sawmill .
Naturally , I can understand his failing to put up with his tyrannical father any longer .
But a sawmill ?
I really have no idea .
However , since that trouble in 1970 , they 've not spoken to each other .
Jansson did n't return from Småland until his father was so old that he'd been taken into a home .
Jansson has an older sister called Linnea who lives on the mainland .
She was married and used to run a café in the summer – but then her husband died .
He collapsed on the hill down to the Co-op , whereupon she closed the café and found Jesus .
She acts as messenger between father and son .
Jansson 's mother died many years ago .
I met her once .
She was already on her way into the shadows of senility , and was convinced I was her father , who had died in the 1920s .
It was a horrible experience .
I would n't have reacted so strongly now , but I was different in those days .
I do n't really know anything more about Jansson , apart from the fact that his first name is Ture and he 's a postman .
I do n't know him , and he does n't know me .
But whenever he sails round the headland , I 'm generally standing on the jetty , waiting for him .
I stand there wondering why , but I know I 'll never get an answer .
It 's like waiting for God , or for Godot ; but instead , it 's Jansson who comes .
I sit down at the kitchen table and open the logbook I 've been keeping for the past 12 years .
I have nothing to say , and there 's nobody who might one day be interested in anything I write .
But I write even so .
Every day , all the year round , just a few lines .
About the weather , the number of birds in the trees outside my window , my health .
Nothing else .
If I want , I can look up a particular date 10 years ago and establish that there was a blue tit or an oystercatcher on the jetty when I went down there to wait for Jansson .
I keep a diary of a life that has lost its way .
The morning had passed .
It was time to pull my fur hat down over my ears , venture out into the bitter cold , stand on the jetty and wait for the arrival of Jansson .
He must be frozen stiff in his hydrocopter when the weather 's as cold as this .
I sometimes think I can detect a whiff of strong drink when he clambers on to the jetty .
I do n't blame him .
When I stood up from the kitchen table , the animals came to life .
The cat was the first to the door , the dog a long way behind .
I let them out , put on an old , moth - eaten fur coat that belonged to my grandfather , wrapped a scarf round my neck and reached for the thick fur hat with earflaps that dated back to military service during the Second World War .
Then I set off for the jetty .
It really was extremely cold .
There was still not a sound to be heard .
No birds , not even Jansson 's hydrocopter .
I could just picture him .
He always looked as if he were driving an old - fashioned tram in the days when the driver had to stand outside at the mercy of the elements .
His winter clothes were almost beyond description .
Coats , overcoats , the ragged remains of a fur coat , even an old dressing gown , layer upon layer , on days as cold as this .
I would ask him why he did n't buy one of those special winter overalls I 'd seen in a shop on the mainland .
He 'd say he did n't trust them .
The real reason was that he was too mean .
He wore a fur hat similar to mine .
His face was covered by a balaclava that made him look like a bank robber , and he wore an old pair of motorcycle goggles .
I often asked him if it was n't the Post Office 's responsibility to equip him with warm winter clothing .
He mumbled something incomprehensible .
Jansson wanted as little to do with the Post Office as possible , despite the fact that they were his employers .
There was a seagull frozen into the ice next to the jetty .
Its wings were folded , its stiff legs sticking up straight out of the ice .
Its eyes were like two glittering crystals .
I released it and laid it on a stone on the shore .
As I did so , I heard the sound of the hydrocopter 's engine .
I did n't need to check my watch , Jansson was on time .
His previous stop would have been at Vesselsö .
An old lady by the name of Asta Karolina Åkerblom lives there .
She is 88 years of age , has severe pains in her arms , but stubbornly refuses to move away from the island on which she was born .
Jansson tells me her eyesight is poor , but even so she still knits jumpers and socks for her many grandchildren scattered all over the country .
I wondered what the jumpers looked like .
Is it really possible to knit and follow various patterns if one is half blind ?
The hydrocopter came into view as it rounded the headland reaching out towards Lindsholmen .
It is a remarkable sight as the insect - like vessel approaches and you can make out the muffled - up man at the wheel .
Jansson switched off the engine , the big propeller fell silent , and he glided in towards the jetty , pulling off his goggles and balaclava .
His face was red and sweaty .
" I 've got toothache , " he said as he hauled himself up on to the jetty with considerable difficulty .
" What am I supposed to do about that ? "
" You 're a doctor , are n't you ? "
" I 'm not a dentist . "
" The pain is down here to the left . "
Jansson opened his mouth wide , as if he'd just caught sight of something horrific behind my back .
My own teeth are in relatively good shape .
I do n't normally need to visit the dentist more than once a year .
" I can't do anything .
You need to see a dentist . "
" You could take a look at least . "
Jansson was not going to give up .
I went into the boathouse and fetched a torch and a spatula .
" Open your mouth ! "
" It is open . "
" Open wider . "
" I can 't . "
" I can't see a thing .
Turn your face this way ! "
I shone the torch into Jansson 's mouth , and poked his tongue out of the way .
His teeth were yellow and covered in tartar .
He had a lot of fillings .
But his gums seemed healthy , and I could n't see any holes .
" I can't see anything wrong . "
" But it hurts . "
" You 'll have to go to a dentist .
Take a painkiller ! "
" I 've run out . "
I produced a pack of painkillers from my medicine chest .
He put it in his pocket .
As usual , it never occurred to him to ask what he owed me .
Neither for the consultation nor the painkillers .
He takes my generosity for granted .
That 's probably why I dislike him .
It 's not easy when your closest friend is somebody you dislike .
" I 've got a parcel for you .
It 's a present from the Post Office . "
" Since when have they started giving away presents ? "
" It 's a Christmas present .
Everybody 's getting a parcel from the Post Office . "
" Why ? "
" I do n't know . "
" I do n't want it . "
Jansson dug down into one of his sacks and handed over a thin little packet .
A label wished me A Merry Christmas from the Chief Executive Officer of the Post Office .
" It 's free .
Throw it away if you do n't want it . "
" You 're not going to convince me that anybody gets anything free from the Post Office . "
" I 'm not trying to convince you of anything at all .
Everybody gets the same parcel .
And it 's free . "
Jansson 's intractability sometimes gets the better of me .
I did n't have the strength to stand in the bitter cold and argue with him .
I ripped open the parcel .
It contained two reflectors and a message :
Be careful on the roads !
Christmas greetings from the Post Office .
" What the hell do I need reflectors for ?
There are no cars here , and I'm the only pedestrian . "
" One of these days you might get fed up with living out here .
Then you might find a couple of reflectors useful .
Can you give me a glass of water ?
I need to take a tablet . "
I have never allowed Jansson to set foot in my house , and I had no intention of doing do now .
" I 'll give you a mug and you can melt some snow by placing it next to the engine . "
I went back into the boathouse and found the cap of an old Thermos flask that doubled as a mug , filled it with snow and handed it over .
Jansson added one of his tablets .
While the snow melted next to the hot engine , we stood and waited in silence .
He emptied the mug .
" I 'll be back on Friday .
Then it's the Christmas holidays . "
" I know . "
" How are you going to celebrate Christmas ? "
" I 'm not going to celebrate Christmas . "
Jansson gestured towards my red house .
I was afraid that all the clothes he was wearing might make him fall over , like a defeated knight wearing armour that was far too heavy for him .
" You ought to hang some fairy lights around your house .
It would liven things up . "
" No thank you .
I prefer it to be dark . "
" Why ca n't you make your surroundings a bit more pleasant ? "
" This is exactly how I want it . "
I turned my back on him and started walking up the slope towards the house .
I threw the reflectors into the snow .
As I reached the woodshed , I heard the roar as the hydrocopter engine sprang into life .
It sounded like an animal in extreme pain .
The dog was sitting on the steps , waiting for me .
He could think himself lucky that he 's deaf .
The cat was lurking around the apple tree , eyeing the waxwings pecking at the bacon rind I 'd hung up .
I sometimes miss not having anybody to talk to .
Banter with Jansson can't really be called conversation .
Just gossip .
Local gossip .
He goes on about things I have no interest in .
He asks me to diagnose his imagined illnesses .
My jetty and boathouse have become a sort of private clinic for just him .
Over the years I have transferred into the boathouse – in among the old fishing nets and other equipment – blood pressure cuffs and instruments for removing earwax .
My stethoscope hangs from a wooden hook together with a decoy eider my grandfather made a very long time ago .
I have a special drawer in which I keep medicines that Jansson might well need .
The bench on the jetty , where my grandfather used to sit and smoke his pipe after gutting the flounders he'd caught , is now used as an examination couch when Jansson needs to lie down .
As blizzards raged , I have kneaded his abdomen when he suspected he had stomach cancer , and I have examined his legs when he was convinced he was suffering from some insidious muscle problem .
I have often thought about the fact that my hands , once used in complicated operations , are now used exclusively to frisk Jansson 's enviably healthy body .
But conversation ?
No .
Every day I examine my own boat which has been beached .
It 's now three years since I took it out of the water in order to make it seaworthy again .
But I never got round to it .
It 's a splendid old clinker - built wooden boat that is now being destroyed by a combination of weather and neglect .
That should n't be allowed to happen .
This spring I shall get down to sorting it out .
But I wonder if I really will .
I went back indoors and returned to my jigsaw puzzle .
The theme is one of Rembrandt 's paintings , Night Watch .
I won it a long time ago in a raffle organised by the hospital in Luleå in the far north of Sweden , where I was a newly appointed surgeon who concealed his insecurity behind a large dose of self - satisfaction .
As the painting is dark , the puzzle is very difficult to solve ; I only managed to place one single piece today .
I prepared the evening meal and listened to the radio as I ate .
The thermometer was now showing minus 21 degrees .
The sky was cloudless , and the forecast was that it would become even colder before dawn .
It looked as if records for low temperatures were about to be broken .
Had it ever been as cold as this here ?
During one of the war years , perhaps ?
I decided to ask Jansson about that – he usually knows about such things .
Something was nagging at me .
I tried lying down on the bed and reading .
A book about how the potato came to Sweden .
I had read it several times before .
Presumably because it did n't raise any questions .
I could turn page after page and know that I was n't going to be faced with something unpleasant and unexpected .
I switched off the light at midnight .
My two animals had already gone to sleep .
The wooden walls crackled and creaked .
I tried to come to a decision .
Should I continue to man the defences of my island fortress ?
Or should I accept defeat , and try to make something of the life that was left to me ?
I could not decide .
I stared out into the darkness , and suspected that my life would continue as it had done hitherto .
There would be no significant change .
It was the winter solstice .
The longest night and the shortest day .
Looking back , it would become clear to me that it had a significance I had never suspected .
It had been an ordinary day .
It had been very cold , and in the snow around my frozen - in jetty were a couple of reflectors from the Post Office , and a dead seagull .

When writing multithreaded programs that work with sockets , a common pattern is to have two threads per socket one thread writes the data to the socket , another one reads the data .
Obviously , the socket library used for this should be threadsafe to start with and support a read from a socket in one thread and a write to the socket in the other thread without corrupting the library 's socket state .
The raw system calls read ( ) and write ( ) support this .
Your experience with the more sophisticated libraries may vary .
The write thread may be implicit :
It may be just a mutex that allows any thread to write into a socket without interference from other threads .
But reading is different .
It 's asynchronous , with data supplied by the other side .
It 's impossible to predict when the data will come in .
Even if the remote side never sends any data , having a reading thread is still useful to detect a dropped connection .
Otherwise , if only the return codes of writing are checked , the connection drop wo n't be detected until the next write , and that might be a while .
It might never be detected if the application has no new data to send to the socket .
Such sloppy implementations are surprisingly common you can identify these applications by lots of half - closed sockets sitting around in the operating system .
This approach is not limited to sockets .
It 's just as applicable to named pipes , serial ports , or any other communication with an independent source of data .
For sockets there is also a variation when a thread is listening for incoming connections , and for all practical purposes , it can also be considered a reading thread , with no writing thread .
All of this works well as long as the remote side cooperates nicely .
But sometimes there are emergencies .
Sometimes the application needs to just drop the connection and be done with it .
Maybe the application was requested to exit , and now it needs to drop all the clients .
Maybe just a subsystem of the application needs to be shut down .
Or perhaps a single client has violated the protocol and its connection has to be dropped .
This means that this reading thread must be stopped .
How ?
Turns out , the answer is not that simple .
Even as the widespread libraries go , lots and lots of them get it wrong .
I 'm going to describe how to get it at least reasonably right and how to fix it in the existing libraries .
The first obvious option is by using a kill thread call .
But many thread libraries do n't support this call , and the libraries supporting it often advise against using it ( for example , Posix has it only as a compatibility call and advises against using it in the new programs ) .
So it would have portability issues .
Even if your library supports it , the related synchronization may be tricky .
All this means that this is n't a very good option .
The next option is to use a select ( ) call .
But a simple select ( ) on a single file descriptor is not going to fix anything .
It would get blocked just as easily as the simple read ( ) .
So the further option is to make a select ( ) with a timeout .
Maybe every second the timeout would expire , the thread would wake up and check the state of the control block , and if asked to stop , it would stop .
Not exactly an optimal solution , either .
On one hand , there is a noticeable delay .
One second may not seem like much but it quickly accumulates .
If you 're closing 100 files , it would take quite a while .
On the other hand , every second there are a bunch of threads that wake up , check their states , and go back to sleep this accumulates , too .
The accumulation of a delay can be dealt with by splitting the stopping of the thread into two library calls :
One call to set the exit indication , another call to wait for the read thread to exit .
Then the first call can be applied to all the sockets first , the read threads would " time out in parallel , " and the second calls will quickly collect them .
This splitting is useful even with the other approaches .
A better solution is to call select ( ) on two file descriptors : the socket and the indicator .
The indicator can be the read side of a pipe .
When the reader thread needs to be stopped , write some data into the pipe , and it will wake up select ( ) .
The downside is that now you need three times the number of file descriptors : one for the original socket , one for the read side of the pipe , and one for the write side of the pipe .
If you 're trying to be portable to Windows , you may have issues with the pipes .
On the other hand , Windows has an analog of select ( ) that can work on both files and synchronization primitives ( such as semaphores ) , so you can avoid the overhead of extra file descriptors .
If you need to stop a thread that is listening for the new connections , you may not even need the extra file descriptor .
Just have this thread check a flag after each accepted connection , whether it 's requested to exit .
Then at exit time , set this flag and connect a new socket from your own program to the listening socket , and immediately close the new connection .
Accepting this connection makes the listening thread wake up , and it would then check the exit flag and exit .
This select ( ) solution is pretty robust and should be used whenever the extra overhead is acceptable .
But what about another obvious option :
What if we just close the file descriptor ?
It is not that different from the socket being closed from the other side by the peer , and the application should already be able to handle that !
Yes , it 's a pretty efficient way .
And it limits the intrusion into the library .
You will need to get direct access to the OS file descriptor , but the other changes are smaller .
Still , it 's not entirely simple .
The trouble is with the synchronization .
There is an inherent race .
The reader thread works generally as in Listing One .
// " state " contains the library - level socket state while ( true ) { int len = read ( state.fd , inbuf , sizeof ( inbuf ) ) ; if ( len <= 0 ) if ( len < 0 ) { // ... report the error ... } state.open = false ; close ( state.fd ) ; break ; } processInput ( inbuf , len ) ; }
The close ( ) call not only stops communications but also frees the OS - level file descriptor .
When the reader thread makes a call to read ( ) or close ( ) , it 's using the value of state .
fd that is no longer valid .
In the best case , this value would still be invalid and the calls would return an error , with the only consequence being a spurious error message .
In the worst case , another thread might open some file in the meantime , and the OS would reuse this value for its file descriptor .
Then the reader thread would read or close the wrong file !
For the socket connections , a solution is to use the shutdown ( ) system call .
It stops the communication without freeing the file descriptor .
The logic for stopping the reader thread is shown in Listing Two .
On some operating systems , this is also the only working solution : On FreeBSD , a close ( ) without shutdown ( ) does not wake up the processes waiting in a read ( ) or select ( ) .
shutdown ( fd , SHUT_RDWR ) ; joinReaderThread ( ) ; // wait for it to exit destroyState ( state ) ;
The reader thread would receive the shutdown indication and close the socket before exiting , so afterwards it 's safe to destroy the state without causing races .
Another issue to consider is that closing by shutdown ( ) or by close ( ) may not be considered a read event in the OS .
If a library does select ( ) or its more modern analog poll ( ) waiting for read events only , then it would not be woken up .
Closing a socket always counts as an error event and as a write event , but somehow not as a read event .
So the select ( ) waiting for a read - ready event just continues sitting there and waiting .
Check the library you use , and if needed , modify it to check for the error events , too .
However , shutdown ( ) works only on the sockets with established connections , not on the ones listening for new connections nor on the other kinds of file descriptors .
If you can change the code of the library ( which is thankfully an option for open source libraries ) , can we still make it work without the shutdown ( ) call ?
Yes :
We need to add a mutex for accessing the state ; see Listing Three .
// reader thread : // " state " contains the library - level socket state while ( true ) { int fd ; lock ( state. mutex ) ; fd = state.open ?
state.fd : - 1 ; unlock ( state.mutex ) ; if ( fd < 0 ) break ; int len = read ( fd , inbuf , sizeof ( inbuf ) ) ; if ( len <= 0 ) if ( state.open && len < 0 ) { // ... report the error ... } lock ( state.mutex ) ; if ( state.open ) { state.open = false ; close ( state.fd ) ; } unlock ( state.mutex ) ; break ; } processInput ( inbuf , len ) ; } // stopping code : lock ( state.mutex ) ; if ( state.open ) { state.open = false ; close ( state.fd ) ; } unlock ( state.mutex ) ;
Now the reader thread checks the state before doing its system calls and avoids doing any more calls on the closed socket .
But not always !
Note that there is still a little time between unlock ( ) and read ( ) , which becomes a race window .
And there is no way to close it reliably .
It would be very nice if the OS allowed the release of locks atomically when entering sleep on the read ( ) system call .
But it does n't .
So the best attempt to fix this is by adding a little sleep in the revocation code , as in Listing Four .
It 's not pretty , but it works okay in practice .
// stopping code : lock ( state.mutex ) ; if ( state.open ) { state.open = false ; usleep ( 20000 ) ; // 20 msec close ( state.fd ) ; } unlock ( state.mutex ) ;
The same approach can be used even without access to the source code of the library ( other than to get the file descriptor , and even that can be worked around with dirty tricks ) .
To do it , create a wrapper API .
In the C++ code , you can define a wrapper class over the library class .
This wrapper class would have a mutex and wrap the underlying calls safely .
Listing Five is the skeleton of such a class .
class WrapSocket : protected LibSocket { protected : mutex mutex_ ; bool open_ ; // flag : this socket is open public : ... int read ( char * buf , int blen ) { bool ok ; mutex_.lock ( ) ; // LibSocket : : fd accesses the field in the parent class ok = open_ && LibSocket : : fd >= 0 ; mutex_.unlock ( ) ; if ( ! ok ) return 0 ; // EOF return LibSocket : : read ( buf , blen ) ; } void stop_reader ( ) { mutex_.lock ( ) ; if ( open_ ) { int workfd = LibSocket : : fd ; // prevent LibSocket from messing up things LibSocket : : fd = - 1 ; open_ = false ; usleep ( 20000 ) ; // 20 msec ::close ( workfd ) ; } mutex_.unlock ( ) ; } .... }
The only extra trick is that when you take away the socket , you need to set the library 's idea of it to a known invalid value " - 1 " , preventing the underlying library from doing unsafe things .
A better solution has been suggested to me by Robert Watson of the FreeBSD Project .
The dup2 ( ) system call takes a file descriptor and copies it to another file descriptor , in the process closing the file that used to be referred to from the new file descriptor .
So it 's a perfect atomic operation to avoid the race .
The stopping code is shown in Listing Six .
// stopping code : lock ( state.mutex ) ; if ( state.open ) { int nullfd ; nullfd = open ( " / dev/null " , O_RDONLY ) ; if ( nullfd < 0 ) { state .
fd = false ; // should not happen but just in case usleep ( 20000 ) ; // 20 msec close ( state.fd ) ; } else { dup2 ( nullfd , state.fd ) ; close ( nullfd ) ; } } unlock ( state.mutex ) ;
Opening the device / dev/ null provides a file descriptor that returns EOF all the time .
And opening it with a read - only flag makes sure that it can't be written - to either .
It 's a perfect placeholder descriptor that does nothing .
Many UNIX implementations support similar functionality directly in the kernel .
It 's called " revocation . "
When a filesystem gets forced - unmounted , all the file descriptors of the open files on it are revoked :
They return an error on any future calls , yet the descriptors themselves are n't closed .
A similar thing is done when the controlling TTY process exits revoke ( ) causes the file descriptors of this TTY in all the other processes to be revoked .
But the programs waiting for input from this TTY would not necessarily wake up until this TTY gets actually closed .
What the dup2 ( ) call gives us is a sort of application - level revocation .
It 's not hard to tell that the looming elevation of Al Franken to the U.S. Senate is making Republicans crazy .
Last week Bill O'Reilly -- whose feud with Franken is now the stuff of legend -- had to resort to running one of Franken 's old comedy videos ( his hilarious parody of Mick Jagger ) so he could call him a " pinhead . "
O'Reilly : Pinhead ?
You have no idea , ladies and gentlemen .
Now Politico reports that Franken is feeling the love from all kinds of right - wingers :
“ I do n’t know if we ’ve ever had an opponent who is so disliked by Republicans as Al Franken , ” said Minnesota Republican Party Chair Ron Carey , who cautioned that Coleman ’s election challenge could still turn the results back his way .
“ It ’s one thing to lose to an honorable opponent , but Al Franken is not considered an honorable opponent by Minnesota Republicans . ”
Marty Seifert , the Republican leader in the Minnesota House of Representatives , said Franken ’s long record of antagonizing conservatives would make it difficult for him to connect with voters who supported Coleman .
“ It ’s going to be hard for Franken to be very effective with any Republicans , in terms of having any credibility with us , just because he ’s been so nasty in the past , ” Seifert said .
“ He certainly has callous and very partisan behavior in the past that is beyond the pale . ”
According to Carleton College political scientist Steven Schier , Franken ’s record as a “ flamboyant and aggressive partisan ” would make him ripe for criticism back home .
“ I think it ’s impossible to overstate the hostility Minnesota Republicans feel toward Al Franken , ” Schier said .
“ He will be a very useful fundraising tool . ”
Republicans outside Minnesota are equally apoplectic when it comes to Franken .
Prominent conservative Rush Limbaugh , who Franken mocked in the title of one of his books , has already jabbed Franken on his radio show , telling listeners in December that Franken “ wo n’t quit [ the Senate race ] because he does n’t know how to get a real job …
He ’s a pathetic figure . ”
Ah , nothing like inchoate nature of impotent rage .

A planned tax hike on imported cars is roiling Russia , whose government is caught between the populist demands of middle - class protesters and a crumbling automobile industry .
The dozens of demonstrations that have cropped up across Russia in recent weeks have n’t been particularly big .
However , they have been significant as the first notable show of widespread dissent in the near - decade since Prime Minister Vladimir Putin cemented his hold on power .
Organizers say they will keep up the pressure unless the government reverses its decision to raise taxes on imported automobiles .
The tariff , which takes effect in January , has pitted an ailing domestic auto industry against working people , especially in Russia ’s eastern flank , who have come to rely upon the import of inexpensive Japanese cars for transportation and employment .

Underscoring the depth of the problem , the country ’s biggest carmaker on Monday announced plans to suspend production until early February .
All three of Russia ’s largest auto companies have turned to the state for help in recent months as car sales plummeted .
AvtoVAZ , maker of Lada cars , was forced to temporarily halt production because the supply of parts had been interrupted , Russian media reported .
The company did not answer questions sent Monday by e-mail .
In the past , the country was flush enough with oil revenue that the government could avoid this kind of disruption .
But with unemployment rising rapidly and car sales plunging , the country ’s leaders have been forced to prioritize .
So far , Putin appears determined to save the domestic auto industry .
Over the weekend , amid the protests , he promised subsidized loans to motorists willing to buy Russian .
He also floated the idea of offering “ state support ” to foreign carmakers operating plants in Russia .

Jobs in the balance
Infuriated drivers say it ’s not enough .
In Russia ’s eastern lands , an influx of cheap cars from Japan has spawned an explosion in car ownership -- and created jobs for importers , car parts wholesalers and mechanics who helped shore up the region as industry slumped .
The tax hike , which will be determined for each vehicle based on a complicated formula , will drastically increase the cost of foreign cars and trucks .
Vehicles older than 5 years will be slapped with a duty of at least 70 % , making their importation unprofitable .

“ The dissatisfaction of the people has almost reached its limit , ” said Viktor Cherepkov , former mayor of the far eastern city of Vladivostok and president of the Assn. for the Protection of Motorists .
“ Today these are purely economic actions , but if the president does n’t heed the voice of the people , the protest will become political in character . ”
As oil prices climbed in recent years , then - President Putin rode a wave of popularity .
Steady raises in salaries and pensions won over the middle class , and creeping state control over the media kept criticism to a minimum as civil rights and democratic reforms were carefully rolled back .
When term limits forced Putin to leave the presidency in May after eight years in office , he easily installed a handpicked successor , Dmitry Medvedev , and took on the job of prime minister .
The financial crisis poses the first serious challenge to Putin ’s rule , and the government appears worried .
Riot police from other parts of Russia were reportedly sent to quell demonstrations in Vladivostok on Sunday , where protesters and journalists said they were beaten and arrested .
As winter has set in , a relentless stream of gloomy economic news has rattled many Russians .
Moscow ’s Levada Center , an independent polling agency , recently found that pessimism about the future had grown by 21 percentage points in just a few months .
It ’s the sharpest shift the pollsters have documented since financial instability racked Russia in the late 1990s .

“ We are not at the bottom of the crisis , ” said Marina Krasilnikova , an analyst with the center .
“ People think they have good reason to believe that the situation will be even harder in the near future . ”
More than a quarter of respondents reported that a member of their family had received a salary cut , had been unpaid altogether or worked in a place where layoffs were occurring , Krasilnikova said .
But despite the buildup of anxiety , analysts say the great majority of Russians have n’t turned against the government -- at least not enough to voice their opposition .

‘ Still a great hope ’

“ People are very pessimistic right now , but there is still a great hope that the government will be able to improve the situation or at least make it less dramatic , ” Krasilnikova said .
Alexander Pikulenko , an auto industry analyst with the independent radio station Echo of Moscow , downplayed the protests .
The discontent was centered in the far reaches of Russia , he pointed out , and a demonstration in Moscow drew relatively few people .
“ The government is tasked not to support the far east but to support the national auto industry , and that ’s what they ’re doing , ” he said .
“ As we know , revolutions never happen in the suburbs .
They always happen in the capital . ”

With a mere 64 minutes left in its last full day in office , the Bush administration asked a federal judge to stay enforcement of a ruling that would keep alive a lawsuit which tests whether the president can bypass the Congress and eavesdrop on Americans without warrants .
The request was lodged with U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker of San Francisco at 10:56 p.m. EST on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday – about 13 hours before the inauguration of President Barack Obama .
The filing was among now former President George W. Bush 's final legal acts in office .
The Bush administration asked Walker 's permission to appeal his Jan. 5 decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
Walker had ruled that " sufficient facts " exist that two U.S. - based lawyers for an Islamic charity might have been spied upon for the case to proceed to the next stage .
The case seeks the courts to rule on the constitutionality of the Bush administration 's warrantless eavesdropping program the president approved in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
Congress authorized the spy program last year as part of legislation immunizing participating telecommunication companies from lawsuits accusing them of violating their customers ' civil liberties , but the spying in this case allegedly happened in 2004 .
Eric Holder , the incoming U.S. attorney , said the Obama administration supported the spy legislation and would defend it in a separate challenge .
On Monday , the Bush administration sought to prevent the disclosure of a Top Secret document at the center of a closely watched spy case , a document Walker ruled could be admitted .
The suit involves two American lawyers who the Treasury Department accidentally gave a Top Secret document in 2004 showing they were illegally eavesdropped on by the government when working for a now - defunct Islamic charity that year .
Their suit looked all but dead in July when they were initially blocked from using the document to prove they were spied on .
They were forced to return it to the government .
But two weeks ago , Walker said the document could be used in the case because there was sufficient , anecdotal evidence unrelated to the document that suggests the lawyers for the Al - Haramain charity were spied upon .
Without the document , the lawyers — Wendell Belew and Asim Ghafoo — do n't likely have a case .
In its Monday filling , ( .pdf ) the government repeated its assertion that the use of the document in the case would jeopardize national security .
The administration said the document was protected by the so - called state secrets privilege and objected to even Walker reviewing it — yet alone the lawyers for Belew and Ghafoo — who Walker said could see it in private .
" If the court were to find … that none of the plaintiffs are aggrieved parties , the case obviously could not proceed , but such a holding would reveal to plaintiffs and the public at large information that is protected by the state secrets privilege — namely , that certain individuals were not subject to alleged surveillance , " the administration wrote .
By the same token , the administration argued , if Walker allowed the case to proceed after reviewing the document , it " would confirm that a plaintiff was subject to surveillance . "
The government continued : " Indeed , if the actual facts were that just one of the plaintiffs had been subject to alleged surveillance , any such differentiation likewise could not be disclosed because it would inherently reveal intelligence information as to who was and was not a subject of interest , which communications were and were not of intelligence interest , and which modes of communication were and were not of intelligence interest , and which modes of communication may or may not have been subject to surveillance . "
A hearing is scheduled in Walker 's courtroom on Friday .
" We filed this lawsuit to establish a judicial precedent that the president cannot disregard Congress in the name of national security , " said Jon Eisenberg , the lawyer for Belew and Ghafoo .
" Plaintiffs have a right to litigate the legality of the surveillance . "

Trends for 2009 : The Web Dismantles Old Media ( Print , Music , Broadcast and Hollywood ) ( December 31 , 2008 )
The World Wide Web and peer - to - peer networking have effectively dismantled the business models of Old Media : newspapers , magazines , publishing , music , network TV and Hollywood .
As all media becomes either free , shared or low - cost , there is no way high fixed - cost Old Media can survive .
I received an education in the Web 's dismantling of Old Media " in conversation with Richard Metzger . "
Richard and his partner started and operated a very successful book publishing and music distribution business in the late 90s .
As peer - to - peer networks and the Web took hold , Richard noted that music CDs which had sold in the 10,000 - unit range were now selling less than a 1,000 units .
Similar drop - offs were observed in books .
Here is one of Richard 's fascinating books : Disinformation : The Interviews These trends are accelerating .
Newspaper circulations are plummeting ; few citizens under the age of 40 subscribe to a " dead tree " newspaper .
Why pay $ 250 + a year for a subscription when all the valuable content is on the paper 's website for free ?
( Here is the S.F .
Chronicle 's standard offer for home delivery : 8 weeks for $ 46 or $ 299 / year . )
Magazine circulations are falling , as are ad pages and the sums advertisers are willing to pay for an advert .
The news is old and the pundits often less insightful than those found for free in the blogosphere .
( Most magazine content can be found on their websites for free as well . )
Network television continues to lose market share to the cable channels and TV as a whole is losing " mindshare " to the Web .
The much - anticipated " convergence " is indeed occuring : everything is converging for free on the Web .
In the music industry , CDs which would have sold hundreds of thousands of units are now selling in the tens of thousands .
The reason is painfully obvious : why pay $ 16 for a CD with one decent song and 12 mediocre tunes when you can buy the one good song for 99 cents on iTunes or download all the songs for free ?
The same mechanisms are at play in the film industry .
Why pay $ 10 to watch multiple ads in a theater when you can buy the pirated DVD for a few bucks from a street vendor anywhere in the world , or rent it from Netflix ( and make a copy for friends ) for $ 2 , or download the film for free off peer - to - peer networks based in non-U.S. locales ?
Richard has related many other telltale signs of revolution in the media : book advances are dwindling to zero for unknown authors , film studios are making far fewer costly " Hollywood features , " etc .
Richard recently recommended this entry from a music industry insider 's blog : Bob Lefsetz :
You know physical retail is on its last legs when Bruce Springsteen creates a special product for Wal - Mart .
It 's like there 's a flood and everyone has retreated to high ground .
In this case , the one location that seems able to sell physical product .
But it 's really more like a drought .
The consumer is no longer raining money .
And it 's even worse , there 's not enough food at Wal - Mart.
Bryan Adams ' album did n't sell there .
Not everything moves in the big box store .
Not everything is moving period .
As for Web - craziness , Soulja Boy 's album debuted at number 43 , selling less than half of his previous effort , a measly 46,000 in total .
AND THIS IS CHRISTMAS WEEK !
This is the end my friend .
This is the last hurrah .
And the record business does not employ enough people to warrant a government bailout .
Sure , GM has been mismanaged for even a longer period of time , but by digital standards , the record companies were exposed to the canary in the coal mine first .
But they 'd listened to too many hard rock records to realize the chirping was gone , they only heard the tinnitus in their ears .
But musicians think they 're immune .
Very few remember the pre-Beatle days .
When stardom did not mean vast riches , diamond selling albums , private jet lifestyles .
They just can't believe they 're not entitled to wealth .
So , when record sales tanked , they just raised ticket prices , as if the public did n't notice .
But it 's interesting , people only want to pay a lot to see the legendary , classic acts .
Or maybe the new ones once .
We 're not building any infrastructure .
We 're just throwing crap against the wall .
And now our cupboards are bare .
The audience has moved on .
They 'd rather buy wiis .
They deliver more entertainment value .
Sales last week were off THIRTY THREE PERCENT from the equivalent week last year .
It 's a new day .
The future paradigm is how does one get people to listen to your tracks from the vast assembled multitude of music they pay very little for .
It 's a heyday for listeners , everything 's at their fingertips .
The labels could have monetized this acquisition , if only they 'd owned up to reality .
But if you never used Napster , how could you realize how great it was ?
What 's true of pop music idols is also true of movie stars .
How can a studio pay an actor / actress $ 40 million when the film may not even net that much ?
I take no joy in addressing the demise of industries , be it the auto industry or the newspaper industry .
The jobs lost mean real pain and suffering .
I have earned a bit of money off the print media ( newspaper and magazine ) from 1988 to the present as a free - lancer .
The pay was almost always abysmal because there is always a fresh horde of newly minted English grads / writers / artists etc . who will work for near - free for the byline or credit to " build their career . "
Um , what career ?
When everything is free , how do you make money ?
Well , the standard answer is you sell ads , and a few sites and blogs actually make a decent living off adverts -- those with 1,000,000 visits a month or more .
( Alas , not this site , which receives 120,000 - 150,000 visits a month . )
Newspapers and magazines also derive ad revenues from their sites , but it's on the order of 20 % of their print ad revenues -- not anywhere enough to fund their high fixed - cost business model .
The same can be said of broadcast TV , the music industry and Hollywood .
Now comes the really bad news : standard advertising / marketing no longer works very well .
I address this at some depth in my 73 - page book Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis :
The two basic reasons are : 1 . people with little disposable income can no longer respond to print / broadcast adverts
2. the entire reductionist edifice of Standard Model of Marketing ( SMOM ) has run its course .
My longtime friend G.F.B. and I were discussing these new realities recently ( he makes his livelihood in broadcast / video / advertising ) and he suggested that the new model is to sell 10,000 copies ( of anything ) at 99 cents rather than 400 copies at $ 25 .
He proposed that if the cost is below the threshold of " impulse buy " then consumers will purchase the digital item without making a complex internal assessment as to the value .
In other words , " Hey , for $ 1.29 , I 'll give this a look / listen / read , and if it 's no good , oh well , no big deal . "
G.F.B. reckoned the " impulse buy " threshold is somewhere in the neighborhood of $ .99 to $ 1.29 .
With this concept in mind , I recently made my novels available on Amazon 's Kindle reader for the price of two iTunes , i.e. $ 1.98 .
The Amazon Kindle store helpfully discounted this modest sum down to a grand total of $ 1.58 : Of Two Minds and Kama Sutra Cadillac
Is this insane ?
I do n't think so .
There will always be a place for print books and media , but the assessment of value when digital resources are free has shifted .
Is there value in a beautifully illustrated 400 - page cookbook ?
If you actually cook and enjoy gazing at the photos and studying the recipes , then $ 30 is a fair price for the value you receive from the book .
A good softbound plumbing guide is still worth $ 15 to me , as the online resources are cumbersome to assemble .
For someone lazy like myself , the book is actually more portable onsite than digital resources , even though they are free .
Plumbing does n't change much and the book will last decades , so $ 15 is a good value to people like me .
I also like autographed books , and prefer to pay money for a pocketbook when traveling over staring at a laptop .
So yes , there will continue to be markets for books , films , music and even newspapers .
But the days of people paying $ 300 / year for a newspaper subscription , $ 25 for a hardbound novel that offers two hours of distraction , $ 15 for mostly mediocre music on a CD or $ 16 for a film DVD are passing .
Is it fair that I charge $ 14 for a print book when I 'm willing to sell the digital version for $ 1.98 ?
It seems to me G.F.B. is correct , and there are two markets for all media in the digital world : a " value assessment market " ( VAM ) in which consumers carefully weigh the relative value of $ 14 or $ 28 in terms of lasting utility or enjoyment , and the " impulse buy " of around a dollar or two for the more modest utility of paying the creator / distributor a small " rental fee " for the use of their creation on a computer or digital device .
To bemoan the emergence of this " impulse buy / small rental fee " market as a replacement of existing costly media is to miss three paradigmatic realities : 1 . everything is free on the Web ( other than the cost of the electricity and Web access ) 2 . the Web is a giant copying machine Is the Web a Giant Copy Machine ?
( March 4 , 2006 ) 3 . the market for books , CDs , DVDs , newspapers , TV networks , etc. will still exist , but only as a " value assessment market " ( VAM ) in which consumers will carefully weigh the value of the purchase against its free competitors and other sources of the same information / entertainment .
So it 's not an either / or proposition : you can still try to sell 400 copies at $ 25 , and also try to sell 10,000 copies for 99 cents .
The markets are priced according to the costs of manufacture , distribution and size of the markets .
Downloading an entire 100,000 word novel takes only a few moments and a few pennies of electricity and disk storage ; it is as close to " free " as is possible .
Printing and shipping a book ( or DVD , CD , Sunday newspaper , ad - larded magazine , etc. ) costs much more and hence it must cost more .
No one knows exactly how the digital / web revolution will play out , but who 's holding the buggy whips and who 's producing the Model T's is already painfully visible .
NOTE : I will be visiting family until 1/4/09 .
Have a safe and Happy New Year !

Part of the story about the Madoff Ponzi scheme was that Madoff created this elusive , difficult - to - become - a - member club .
The exclusivity and rejections made membership all the more desirable to greedy investors .
That actually is turning out to be somewhat of a myth .
There is much more to his canny trick of rejecting investors than initially meets the eye .
In reality , he did not really turn away money from investors .
What actually occurred was that he refused to take cash from people whose participation would have easily revealed the fraud .
Allow me to explain :
As we noted earlier this week ( Why Might a Madoff Plea Deal Take Place ? ) there are lots of other parties who might get pulled into this story .
But the one that intrigued me most came from Credit Suisse , when that firm and its analysts looked into Madoff ’s investments , and came away skeptical or convinced there was a fraud occurring .
In particular , there was something the execs who had met with Madoff said to Bloomberg that got me thinking :
They noted his little - known auditor who had just one client , his refusal to reveal AUM , his refusal to charge asset management fees .
But what was especially noteworthy was the issue of why Madoff served as the custodian of his clients ’ assets .
That turned out to be , IMO , the key to his “ turning away investors . ”
This was the scam within the overall fraud , one that made his Ponzi scheme irresistible to gullible investors .
Why ?
Consider how Custodial accounts work :
Your institutional firm , endowment or trust fund is held at a major bank ( as the Prudent Man rule requires ) .
That means outside managers use DVP trades ( delivery versus payment ) , with the clients ’ monies staying in their custodial account , and the outside firm trading it .
Here ’s how that looks int he real world .
Let ’s say the XYZ Foundation – 10 billion in assets , held ( custodial agent ) at Goldman Sachs .
XYZ wants to give the Ima Scammer Fund 10 million in assets to trade .
Ima Scammer trades the $ 10 million of the account , but the cash and shares all stay at GS on behalf of XYZ .
That ’s how a custodial account works .
The outside fund manager has control over the money only so far as handling that portion of it .
But the assets stay with the custodian .
And all of those clients turned away by Madoff ?
How much do you want to bet me that the vast majority were custodial accounts ?
Given the alleged scam , Madoff could n’t do that , because the ruse would have been revealed almost immediately .
The custodial accounts could not have generated his alleged returns .
These monies were n’t turned away by Madoff ; they were run away from — by him .

UPDATE : January 15 , 2009 , 11:47 am
Even more amazing , the Boston Globe is reporting Madoff might not have made any trades

Welcome to the English Medieval Legal Documents Database : A Compilation of Published Sources from 600 to 1535 .
This database was first compiled in 2008 by Hazel Lord , retired Senior Law Librarian - Head of Access Services at the University of Southern California School of Law .
It originally began as a wiki , where scholars could sign up and update it with new sources , however , due to technical problems with the wiki , in 2010 it was converted to a standard website .
After Hazel Lord 's retirement in 2009 , Paul Moorman , Senior Law Librarian - Research Services / Foreign & International Law , took charge of the database and in 2019 he updated the records with hyperlinks to relevant sources and migrated it to this LibGuides platform for longer term platform stability .
This database covers the medieval period up to 1535 .
This date seemed a convenient cut off point , since that year marks the end of production of the year books .
As can be seen in the outline , the material has been divided into broad categories , such as court records , statutory records , etc .
Within these categories , wherever it seemed appropriate , the entries have been arranged first by material type , plea rolls , courts reports , calendars , etc. , and then chronologically by regnal year .
When the resource covers the reigns of several monarchs , or even the entire period , it is listed separately under each monarch .
Titles are given in the language in which they appear on the title page of the volume , with an additional English title if the item has been translated .
Some items are known by several variant titles , and these have been included wherever possible .
Emphasis in this guide has been placed on sources published since 1950 .
Only the most important titles from the exhaustive earlier bibliographies have been included here , in order to maintain the stand - alone usefulness of this present guide .
References are made throughout the guide to the earlier bibliographies for those who wish to delve more deeply into the topic .
The publication of medieval source material has been fragmented over the years , relying to a large extent on the scholarly work of learned societies , such as the Selden Society , the Ames Foundation , and the Pipe Roll Society , and of numerous local historical societies , whose output can be of varying quality .
E. L. C. Mullins , Texts and Calendars : An Analytical Guide to Serial Publications ( 1958 - 83 ) gives an excellent , if now dated guide to the texts and calendars of source materials issued by the many learned and local societies , as well as by various government entities .
Many of these local societies and government agencies now have lists of their publications online and any additional links others can provide would be very useful .
We would like to express our appreciation to Daniel Klerman , Professor of Law at the University of Southern California , Gould School of Law , who first suggested this guide , and whose encouragement and advice made it possible .
This website is a resource of the USC Gould School of Law and the Asa V. Call Law Library .

One key source of aging — oxidative damage — comes form the very air that we breathe .
Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is essential for cellular ATP production , but inevitably results in the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which in turn oxidize macromolecules including DNA .
We recently learned that mitochondrial uncouplers — compounds that cause proton leakage across the mitochondrial membrane and thereby separate oxidative phosphorylation from the electron transport chain — can reduce the production of ROS .
Indeed , treatment with uncouplers reproduces many of the other hallmarks of calorie restriction ( CR ) , including decreased steady - state oxidative damage to DNA and protein , lower blood sugar and triglycerides , and — crucially — extended lifespan .
Chemicals are n’t the only way to uncouple ox / phos from electron transport .
Mammalian genomes encode uncoupling proteins ( UCP ) , generally expressed in tissues involved in thermogenesis , such as the mitochondria - rich “ brown fat ” that maintains body temperature during rodent hibernation and proteins the brainstem of human infants .
( When electron transport is uncoupled from the proton gradient , the lost energy is dissipated as heat . )
A new study has shown that expression of one specific UCP is associated with enhanced longevity and decreased oxidative stress in the mouse .
From Andrews & Horvath :
Uncoupling Protein 2 regulates lifespan in mice
The long - term effects of uncoupled mitochondrial respiration by uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2 ) in mammalian physiology remains controversial .
Here we show that increased mitochondrial uncoupling activity of different tissues predicts longer lifespan of rats compared to mice .
UCP2 reduces reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and oxidative stress throughout the aging process in different tissues in mice .
The absence of UCP2 shortens life span in wild type mice , and , the level of UCP2 positively correlates with the postnatal survival of superoxide dismutase 2 mutant animals .
Thus , UCP2 has a beneficial influence on cell and tissue function leading to increased lifespan .
The most surprising result is that UCP2 mutants have shorter lives , implying that mitochondrial uncoupling is a key mechanism for controlling oxidative stress throughout the lifespan .
The results from the genetic cross with the Sod2 mutant is consistent with what we already know about mitochondrial uncoupling : Without Sod2 ( encoding mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ) , ROS production and oxidative damage increase , causing premature aging ) .
Higher levels of UCP2 ( resulting from overexpression ) would cause uncoupling , which decreases the production of ROS , and in turn presumably decreases the oxidative load on the Sod2 mutant .

The Problem
I need to distribute pre-compiled buildouts because some projects do n’t allow us to have gcc installed on the production system for security reasons .
Fair enough , we need to provide a pre-compiled buildout .
If you want to distribute your buildout - based Plone application in a binary form , so it can be installed without requiring any compiler on the platform , you need to compile all .c modules before you provide a tarball of your buildout folder .
This is easy : just run your buildout and all . so files will be created in the zope 2 installation .
( . pyd under windows )
But this will work only if you compile in a directory that is located within the same path on the target machine , because zc. buildout uses absolute paths when it builds scripts .
Furthermore , if the python interpreter is not located in the same place , your buildout script itself is screwed .
Last but not least , plone.recipe.zope2install is not clever enough .
It will remove your zope2 installation when it detects that the path has changed .
This is pretty annoying even if you have gcc : what is the point of compiling the c extension again since they
are statically compiled in - place ?
The solution
I have changed plone.recipe.zope2install and added a new option called `smart - recompile` ( in trunk right now , not released ) .
If you use it , the recipe will check for . so or .pyd files before trying to ditch your zope 2 installation and recompile it .
Even if you do n’t use it to build binary distributions , it will make your buildout build faster if you already have zope compiled in there .
Next , I have created a special bootstrap.py , who is clever enough to rebuild the buildout script with the right path to the used interpreter , and with offline - mode capabilities .
To make it short : boostrap.py works no matter if you have an internet connection or not .
Grab it here : http://ziade.org/bootstrap.py
So now , basically you can compile your buildout and deploy it on any system , on any path , without any internet connection , like this :
$ python bootstrap .py # will rebuild the buildout script $ bin/ buildout
Of course this does n’t work if you have dynamically compiled extensions like python - ldap .
For theses , the best pick is to rely on the system ones .
It 's not over .
The strike at York University will continue after 63 per cent of the Canadian Union of Public Employees 3903 members rejected the school 's latest offer in a forced vote that ended last night .
It is now either up to Queen 's Park to take the unusual step of ordering strikers back or both sides to reach a bargaining breakthrough that has eluded them for months .
" All we can ask is that the government step in .
There is no other option now for students , " said kinesiology major Catherine Divaris , co-founder of a student anti-strike Facebook group .
" This strike has already gone on 76 days and I 'm afraid this strike could go till the end of the year , " Divaris said last night .
Sixty - nine per cent of union members turned out for the two - day vote , which was requested by the university and conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Labour .
" This is a clear indication across all three units that the offer from the university was inadequate , " said CUPE spokesperson Tyler Shipley .
" We expect the university to meet us back at the bargaining table at 1 p.m .
Wednesday , so we can bargain a settlement that is fair for our members and secondary education . "
Progressive Conservative Party Leader John
Tory last night demanded the Liberals immediately step in and end the strike .
" If Mr. McGuinty had one minute of consideration for the students and their families he would be convening the legislature immediately and making sure that classes were back on stream on Monday , not later . "
The offer was rejected by 61 per cent of teaching assistants , as well as 59.3 per cent of contract faculty and 70 per cent of graduate assistants .
York president Mamdouh Shoukri said last night the union vote almost certainly means the academic year will stretch into June or July .
Tension broke out when union members tried to force themselves into his press conference following the vote .
Police were called in , but no charges were laid .
Shoukri called the vote " a major disappointment that only prolongs the uncertainty for our students and their families . "
He said the university will not return to the bargaining table today , despite the union 's invitation to do so .
" I believe we are at an impass , " said Shoukri in his first public statement since the strike began Nov. 6 , " and the full summer term is in jeopardy now and fall and winter terms likely will extend into June and even July .
" I realize this will have a negative impact on the ability of our students to earn summer income . "
Shoukri insisted the university 's offer of a 9.25 per cent wage increase over three years and improved benefits and job security is " our best offer . "
He called upon union members to " step back from the brink and settle matters responsibly , " by making significant changes to their demands .

The 3,340 teaching assistants , contract faculty and graduate assistants walked off the job over wages , benefits , job security and the quest for a two - year contract that would coincide with locals at other Ontario universities and bolster the union 's bargaining clout province - wide .
The university 's latest offer would also have enriched benefits and created a new category of teachers who would have a five - year contract , rather than having to apply for their jobs each year .
However , the union said there remained too little job security and too few full - time job opportunities for the 900 members who are part - time or " contract faculty . "
A correspondent recently informed me about the Global Poverty Act of 2007 .
This bill did not pass Congress .
It can be re-introduced in the current Congress .
Obama favors this bill .
I have a negative opinion of this bill .
I could explain why my opinion is negative .
I ’ve done that before with other laws that have been passed by the federal government .
Instead , I will go to the root of the political matter .
Dozens of these bills are introduced into Congress and many get passed .
Along the way , there are hundreds of groups that favor and oppose these bills .
One can be fighting these fights 24 hours a day .
This is not my idea of living .
In my remaining years , I ’d like to do a few other things .
Still , I have to protect myself and my life from the impositions of others .
One course is to fight with the pen .
This has certain non-monetary benefits that I shall not go into .
Either that or I find a way to go underground , insulate myself from all this nonsense , and become invisible .
That too has benefits .
At some point , I may do that .
I may become a dropout .
Then I ’ll take up painting .
I ’ll have a machine shop and make myself a grease gun and fire it off out of anyone ’s hearing .
I ’ll raise a few chickens or pheasants and ducks as my father once did as a pastime .
I will not raise geese , however .
They seemed to like to attack at will .
I find that I have no need for the federal government or the other governments for that matter .
What do they do for me ?
They do negative for me .
They take from me .
They impose on me .
They impose on my neighbors and prevent me from dealing with them as I might and they from dealing with me .
Who needs the grief that governments bring ?
Every so often I must get my car inspected .
I must kowtow to the state ’s insurance regulations .
I must get it registered every two years .
God forbid I should ever have to get involved with a case in court and have to deal with the state ’s justice system .
I ’ve never used marijuana , but maybe I ’d like to try it sometime for medicinal purposes .
I ’m not about to hit the mean streets looking for sources who supply me with a product of unknown quality .
I ’d like to have my dad ’s old Mauser pistol .
In Maine , I could shoot it .
In New York , I am a felon if I have it in the house .
Who needs this grief ?
I spurn countless products in the supermarket because they contain high - fructose corn syrup .
I do n’t like it .
I ’d rather have sugar .
If it were not for the government , they might have sugar .
I will have to pay extra at some point for the privilege of having something with sugar in it .
I will bake my own cookies .
If you want your government to ban marijuana , make you go through a lot of rigamarole to carry a pistol , tax sugar , and subsidize corn or ethanol , be my guest .
But I get nothing out of it .
I do n’t see why I have to be made to do what you ( I speak of the nameless others here , not you , my sympathetic reader ) want .
What claim do these governments have over me ?
Why am I their toady ?
Why must I persuade everyone else not to pass a law that harms me ?
Why is the burden of stopping this placed on me ?
I am fighting off additional chains .
Obviously I am unable to do so .
My success rate at this is zero .
Why am I a slave ?
Why are we all fish enclosed in the same barrel ?
I did n’t ask to be inside this barrel .
So , let others pass the laws that they want for themselves and their own clique .
Count me out .
I am not your slave .
You go your way and I will go mine .
Tax yourselves all you want to .
That is your right .
My right is to bow out of your impositions on me .
Let me out of the barrel .
Let everyone out of the barrel .
Let them find other barrels to be in if they wish , or no barrel at all .
Let those who want to stay in this barrel stay .
I wo n’t stop them .
Just let me out .
I believe that others are deluding themselves to want a government such as we have today that has the power to pass so many laws .
They are making themselves into slaves .
It ’s their choice .
I also know that others have been making the case for liberty for decades without measurable success .
Some people want to be imposed on for whatever reasons at certain times in history and at other times they do not .
Some people want to be in the barrel .
My problem is not so much that they are self - chosen slaves but that they have made me into their slave .
They have no guilty conscience about this .
They seem to think it is perfectly all right to confine me to their barrel .
They regard this as the natural state of affairs .
I am expected ( by them ) to kowtow to various governments .
Why ?
Why am I expected to bow down before others ?
Why should anyone bow down who does not want to ?
Why should I be ruled by others ?
Why should anyone be ruled by others who does not want to be so ruled ?
If you ever hear a good answer , let me know .
I have not yet heard a good answer .
The force and power to make me bow down is not an answer .
The proposal that we each go our own ways and choose our own methods of being governed while living in America and other states of this world is the novel proposal of panarchy .
It is really the proposal that we each have complete liberty .
And if some of you wish to dispose of that liberty and choose a group of others to govern you , that is your business .
It is your right .
But it is not your right to include me unwillingly into your group .
I am fighting you now and forever on that score .
I am fighting you the best way I know how , which , at the moment , is with the pen .
This is not an antagonistic variety of fighting , however , not at this time .
I urge you to give up your urge to dominate me and others .
Let us be .
Let us go .
Wherever my message is heard , if any government officials should happen to read it , I urge you only to let us go .
Stop imposing on us .
Impose on those who want to be imposed on , not on me .
The end game if you do not accede is something I cannot foresee or imagine .
Perhaps there will be multiple declarations of independence .
Perhaps the number of dropouts will rise .
Perhaps you will bring about your own demise .
Perhaps we will band together and ignore you .
We will stop paying taxes .
We will hunt for your weak spot .
We will embarrass you perhaps , jeer at you , and make fun of you .
A political joke book may bring you down .
Maybe we will parade you around naked .
Maybe we will run you out of town or tar and feather you .
I do not know .
I have no idea how to get from here to there .
Such a social and political change is beyond my ken .
People ask me how to get to panarchy .
I do n’t know .
Turn your creativity loose .
You will devise the ways and means .
These things are works - in - progress .
The loss of liberty under monopoly governments has been a work - in - progress occupying decades .
Liberty might return in a flash , or it might be something that is built up step by step over time as we learn and as attitudes change and experience accumulates .
I do not know .
I have no game plan .
I am not that smart or wise .
I do n’t know enough to say .
I rely on many others who will carry this forward in the future and have carried it forward in the past before I ever heard of anarchy or panarchy .
Why expect someone to give you a plan anyway ?
Think for yourselves .
Plan for yourselves as best you can .
All I know is that fighting the government , bill by bill , is exhausting and does not get at the heart of the matter .
It is not a matter of individual bills in Congress , bad as each one may be .
It is a matter of there existing a government that has the power to pass these bills in the first place and to impose them on all of us , willy - nilly .
That is why I am a panarchist ( and anarchist ) .
I personally do not want to live under such a power and such impositions , which is why I am anarchist .
But I also recognize that others of you might wish to do so , which is one reason why I am panarchist .
I do not want to abolish your government that you may want for yourselves , but I want to have my own means of governance for myself .
This too is why I am panarchist .
I have no greater purpose than these expressions today .
They are crude .
They are personalistic .
That is how I feel today .
I speak from my stomach as much as from my brain .
Yet a thoughtful person has asked me about how defense will work or can work if there is panarchy ; and I have an extended ( but still incomplete ) response because defense is always a major issue whenever the question of altering our political system comes up .
His e-mail read :
" If I actually am able to opt out of government protection ( thereby paying no taxes ) and yet can stay in my place described in your u2018 thought experiment ’ below , am I myself not u2018looting ’?
What I mean by this is simply that I will be enjoying the protection of the army ( provided by my taxed neighbors who opt - in for state protection ) which goes to battle ( say a defensive war against a foreign entity ) and emerges victorious from this war .
My liberty , freedom , and property remain intact , yet I foot no part of the war bill .
Thus I still envision coercion for tax payments by my neighbors regardless of any previous understandings we might have had previously .
Am I missing something here ? "
This is the argument that defense is a public good , or that there is a positive externality in the provision of defense that necessitates joint action imposed by force on all .
Defense is not a uniform good .
It is not a pack of Camel cigarettes .
Even to say that defense is a public good is a meaningless statement .
What someone in Harlingen wants for defense may be vastly different than what someone in Boise wants .
Nothing in the idea of several governments on the same territory prevents people in their own panarchies from associating and federating to produce joint defense .
That is what the colonies did in pre-Revolutionary days .
They did not have a national government but they constructed a common defense .
History provides other examples .
If your neighbors defend themselves and you happen to benefit , does that give them a right to force you to pay ?
If your neighbors benefit you by any number of their actions , does that give them a right to force you to pay them ?
If so , they control your agenda and you .
How do they justify that ?
If they cannot build a tank without your contributions , does that justify their forcing you to contribute ?
They will then have to know that they are helping you and by how much .
They will have to know that better than you do .
Can they ever know that ?
What if the shoe is on the other foot and you demand that they pay for building your Maginot line ?
That preference reflects your idea of knowledge of defense , and it differs from that of your neighbors .
When you and your neighbors disagree over the worth of your respective defense products , they have no argument that can persuade you and vice versa .
Either you agree to buy your own defenses , or else you will fight until one of you wins and enslaves the other .
That basic choice is the issue here .
If we choose no force in such matters , it creates a certain set of societal incentives .
If we choose force , it creates a very different set of incentives .
The state forces its method of defense on many of us and makes us pay for it .
We are the conquered .
It makes our property less secure and defenseless because it can force us to pay for its product that we may not want .
How can the state be defending us when it is attacking us ?
Suppose I refuse the state ’s defense .
Suppose I tell the state that its evaluation of the defense benefit it claims to be providing me is not worth the price I have to pay .
The state does not listen to me .
It claims its judgment is superior to my own .
That is propaganda to keep the conquered docile .
Does the state know better than I do what is good for me ?
If we allow that conclusion for defense , then will we allow it for my education , my health affairs , my management of my wealth , my entertainment , my speech , my choice of mate , my guns , and my consumption of marijuana and alcohol and tobacco ?
These controls are already here .
The slippery slope to a totalitarian society is already evident .
The state talks people into their own slavery .
I value liberty for its own sake , because I am human and I conceive of being human as making one ’s own decisions over one ’s life while conceding the right of others to make theirs .
Those who do not value liberty take other stances on what to be human means .
In one case , they view the human being as a creature like a dog that they ( in the state ) train and keep in its place , that can do a number of things on its own , but that is actually contained and kept within the bounds that they , the superior beings in the state , set for it .
They are dividing human beings into the superior rulers and those ruled .
In another case , there are those who view the human being as a creature that is nothing without the state .
Others view the state as inherently superior to the human being .
There are many philosophies that support statism as against liberty .
Shall we protect ourselves by forcing others to pay tribute for what we conceive of as protecting them ?
Then we must logically accord others the same right of action .
This means that we decide to rule them , and they decide to rule us by force of arms .
We can not make someone pay without force .
We cannot take their property without force .
If we choose that route , we will increase the costs of protection of our property because we will have to defend against everyone else who has a right of action against us for any reason that comes into their heads .
If they purify their air and we breathe some of it , they will force us to pay .
Which scenario do you prefer , uncertain and perpetual war in which property is insecure because everyone can trench on everyone else ’s property at their own evaluation of external benefit and harm ?
Or a measure of peace in which we define property boundaries and use a criterion of not using force to extract resources from others ?
The nations achieve uneasy peace , often broken by warfare , in which on an inter-national basis , there are defined territorial boundaries .
The gains from war on an inter-nation basis often give way to the prospect of even greater losses , in which case peace occurs .
Quite often , for a variety of reasons , wars break out .
One reason is that states under -estimate war costs and rulers gain by wars even if the people ruled do not .
On an intra-nation basis , within each nation , the predation and looting go on unabated within the nation ’s political system .
There is scarcely ever peace within a nation .
Among nations there is anarchy , and there are periods of peace .
Peace may even be the norm among nations .
Within nations , where there is no anarchy but centralized rule , there is not peace .
There is constant economic warfare and looting of property , one group by another .
Quite often civil war breaks out to end intra-nation oppression .
Anarchy and panarchy within the boundaries of existing nations look to reduce the problem of civil war and reduce the problem of internal economic looting , which gains the greater part of its strength from the existence of that nation ’s monopoly government .
Panarchy envisions non-territorial governance .
Society would discard government as we know it today in its territorial form for many and maybe all of its functions .
Defense might be retained along the same lines as today , if that is what people in different panarchies want .
It can be done through confederations .
But defense as it looks today in the U.S. is highly unlikely if Americans were free to choose their own defenses .
The U.S. went beyond federation to amalgamation under the Constitution .
The idea that was propagated was that a central government was needed to defend against European powers .
This political solution had a big downside that was overlooked by the framers :
The central power ( the U.S.A. ) could make bigger and more expensive wars by taxing the entire people under its territorial jurisdiction .
All it needed was a majority in Congress .
The Union lowered the cost of one or two regions combining to impose the costs of war on all the other regions .
The result was an expensive military and more wars .
This could never have happened under the Articles of Confederation .
( The same process happens for all our political programs .
Defense is just another program . )
With panarchy , if there happened to be regions ( who knows ? ) , each region might have its own defense and combine in a common defense only when it really paid to combine .
Defense would become much more competitively supplied as a good , so it would become cheaper and more effective .
The kinds of defenses used would be far different than the armed forces we now have .
Offense would diminish because a given region would have to bear all the costs .
In the year 2008 , we are living with an arrangement ( the Constitution ) that may have been a good idea for 1787 for defense , but has become very costly and downright bad for our times .
The proof is the constant U.S. involvement in wars all over the world .
Ever since U.S. government got big , starting at the outset of the twentieth century with roots going back to earlier days , the country has faced one large difficulty after another .
If it has n’t been wars , it has been economic and financial problems .
If it has n’t been those , it has been social and family decay .
The problems are getting worse .
The roots of them are political .
We are not governing ourselves properly , and this is why we keep having these problems .
We badly need to get out from under the monopoly federal government .
This is another powerful reason why I am a panarchist .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
Woman motorist banned after police catch her drink - driving ... on a 2.4mph mobility scooter
A woman has been given a driving ban after being caught more than twice the legal alcohol limit - while riding a 2.4mph mobility scooter .
Amanda Leaff , 46 , said she had taken the buggy from an Asda supermarket to save herself the taxi fare for her trip home .
A court was told yesterday how it would have taken Leaff , of Stretford , Manchester , more than four hours to complete the ten - mile journey , had she not been spotted ' driving erratically ' by an off - duty police officer .
A drunk woman travelled two - and - a - half miles on a mobility scooter before police stopped her .
She was given a 20 - month driving ban for being twice the legal limit
Magistrates in Oldham heard she had been drinking for several hours and became abusive when police stopped her at around 10.45 pm on November 12 .
Her solicitor Stephen Krebbs told the court : ' She managed to get two - and - a - half miles until she was stopped .
It was a surprise she got as far as she did . '
He added : ' She planned to return the scooter to her local Asda the following day . '
Leaff admitted taking without consent and driving a mobility scooter while unfit through drink .
She was given a 20 - month driving ban and £ 240 fine .
An Asda spokesman said after the hearing : ' The scooters , although very practical and robust , are not really designed for road use .
' They are best suited to flat surfaces as in supermarkets , due to the very low wheelbase .
Every scooter missing from our premises is a vehicle fewer for our disabled shoppers to use . '
I thought I would blog about this , because I ’ve tried and failed in the past , and it just took a lot of tinkering to figure out .
The problem is this : I have a git repository with a game in it , and a long time ago thought it would be a good idea to add the game ’s music to the repository .
But it turns out that was a bad decision , because it made the repository too large to easily transfer around / host on free sites / etc .
So , how do I get those pesky music files out of there , and once I do , how do I convince the repository to actually shrink ( this latter bit was the trickiest part ) .
So , first , I go into the git directory and prune out all the music :
% cd mygame % git filter - branch -- index - filter \ ' find - name '' *.mp3 ' ' - or - name '' *.ogg ' ' | xargs - d ''
'' rm -f '
And wait a while while it does its thing .
Now we would like to run gc and get rid of all the old objects .
Unfortunately , the old objects are still stored in “ refs/ original / ” , so gc will mark them and not clean them up , and I do n’t know how to delete them .
So here ’s the hack .
Clone the repository , which will not clone the original refs , and then gc that one .
% cd .. % git clone mygame mygame2 % cd mygame2 % git gc -- aggressive -- prune
And at this point , the mygame2 repository will have forgotten all about those music files , and is much smaller .
WARNING : This will rename all the objects in the repository , so pushing and pulling from repositories which have n’t been filtered wo n’t work .
After this process is done , everyone has to clone anew .
A less hacky way to do this would be appreciated , if anyone knows it .
UPDATE : Check out this article mentioned by @spuder in the comments for a better way .
Want to know how to use Social Media in Business … Follow an Airline .
I am extremely impressed with how the following four airlines are using Social Media .
So much so that I will go as far to say that Business Owners confused with how to use Social Media activities in their business should look towards the following four airlines for examples .
Four Airlines using Social Media Productively
These airlines are using Social Media sites such as Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , Flickr and some are Blogging .
These all are great ways to get the online community involved … to get them motivated to travel , to get them talking about the airlines ….
what they love and what they hate .
To get them spreading the word of what airline they should be traveling .
Airlines are using Facebook
Facebook is an excellent way to engage customers .
And , Virgin America is doing it well .
Check out Virgin America ’s amazing Facebook Page :
Their Facebook page reminds me very much of a website .
Upon first getting to their facebook page you will first notice the amazing color .
Which I feel keeps people there for a while checking things out .
But , more than that there is a lot to do once you arrive .
Even right there on their facebook page visitors can click links to search flights and check flight statuses .
Plus , they can do a bunch of fun Facebook interactions .
On their Facebook Profile you will find :
Their Facebook Profile also offers :
What makes their Facebook Profile stand out to me is the fact that they are encouraging their customers to engage with one another .
They make it easy to not only build relationships with other customers , but with the airline themselves .
Happy customers mean returning customers and it appears Virgin America gets that .
Airlines are using Flickr
Another great way these airlines are using Social Media to help their business is with Flickr .
Let ’s face it when people travel they take pictures .
Traveling is very personal .
Many people are traveling with family or traveling to visit family .
Either way they are making memories and they are counting on every moment of their excursion to be part of it ….
including their travels there and back .
So , because of this reason it just makes sense for Flickr , a photo sharing community , to be part of the social media activities being used .
And , it certainly is .
Let ’s look at JetBlue ’s Flickr Group as an example …
JetBlue has a nice Flickr Group .
In their group there are already 3,777 items …. both photos and videos .
Members of this Flickr group can comment on each other photos and can add each other as friends ….
encouraging relationship building .
These members appear to be customers , fans and employees of JetBlue and from the comments are totally connecting .
The JetBlue Flickr group also has active discussion boards .
This is a great place to start discussions in the same format as other message boards and forums .
Ask questions , give opinions and even offer suggestions to the airlines or members of the community .
So , as you can see the memories do n’t just sit in a photo album in a cabinet at home , but instead are being shared and enjoyed with others .
Plus , around these wonderful photos relationships are being made ….
it does n’t get much better than that .
Airlines are using YouTube
Many people are very visual …
I ’m a very visual person .
I love to look at videos when things are being explained to really get a feel of what they are talking about .
And , there is no exception when it comes to traveling .
If I ’m going to be spending hours in the air I want to make sure I ’m as comfortable as possible .
I want to know exactly what I ’m paying for ….
video is a great way to do this .
Plus , videos are very engaging and entertaining ….
they truly hold the viewers attention .
The airlines are using YouTube splendidly .
Let ’s take Delta for example …
Apparently , Delta ’s New In - Flight Safety Video caused a huge buzz in the YouTube world .
FoxNews had posted ,
“ The safety video generated such a buzz after being posted on the Atlanta - based airline ’s corporate blog and on the video Web site YouTube that admirers dubbed the 33 - year - old Atlanta woman “ Deltalina , ” a combination of the airline ’s name and Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie , who they say she resembles . ”
DeltaAirLines on YouTube have tons of other videos to choose from as well .
Including , Travel Guides where Delta employees showcase their favorite destinations around the globe .
Airlines are Using Twitter
If you spend any amount of time on Twitter it is hard to not notice somebody talking to or about airlines .
Traveling takes a lot of planning and people will ask for suggestions and recommendations when it comes to something important like booking a flight .
Also , when people are waiting on a flight or are in an airport during a long lay - over they do n’t have much to do so instead they are spending time on Twitter commenting on what they are doing , eating , seeing .
If they are happy … they Tweet that .
If they are unhappy or disappointed … they will tweet that .
Some Airlines are listening .
Let ’s use Southwest Air as an example …
SouthWestAir does a nice job at using Twitter to help their business .
They use it in a number of ways …
Travel Advisories
Customer Service
Points followers to interesting posts …. even if they are not SouthWest Air posts .
…. even if they are not SouthWest Air posts .
Regular fun Chit Chat
Informs SouthWest Customers of great places to eat at during lay - overs or delays .
Airlines are Blogging
And two of the airlines are blogging very well .
You should check out both the Delta Blog and SouthWest ’s Blog .
They both are doing an excellent job .
They blog regularly about everything from airline news to airport food to new airplanes to new airports .
They are also making sure to list all of their other social profiles oin their blogs ….
helping their fans and customers stay in contact with them all over the internet .
Very Cool !!!
Let ’s take a look at SouthWest ’s Blog … .
truly , their blog is exceptional .
Not only is it extremely user - friendly and very easy to follow … .
It is set up so wonderfully .
Check it out …
Tell me this blog is n’t nice !!
On the left you have little summaries of posts … and they post very regularly .
And on the right hand side they have pictures from the Flickr Group and beneath that you have their video portion of their blog .
Lower down on the blog you will see that you are able to listen to their podcasts … yes , SouthWest does podcasting too !!
And , the bottom half of their blog is just as good as the top part .
Check this out ….
The one area all Airlines need to work on …..
Using Twitter consistently as a Customer Service Tool .
Airlines have a chance to get personal with their customers and potential customers .
They can calm down the lost traveler , entertain them when they are delayed , feed them when they are hungry .
They can use their customer service skills to make an ornery traveler happy again .
I ’m not sure they are doing this .
Even SouthWest that I used as an example above is n’t twittering enough .
Sometimes they go days without a tweet and I ’m sure there are people tweeting them and about them 24/7 , so they are missing a lot ….
a lot of good Customer Service via Twitter .
Even the other airlines that are using Twitter are n’t posting enough to be using it effectively .
As much as the airlines are being talked about via Twitter they do n’t respond nearly enough .
I understand that they have a huge mass of customers and responding to all would be extremely difficult .
But , in my mind they need to hire more people to cover this and to treat Twitter as a Customer Service Platform .
The more happy customers the more returning customers .
Even a question posted directly at some airlines go unanswered .
As of the writing of this post my question has been unanswered 3 days later …
For the most part Airlines are using Social Media effectively
Even with the Twitter area that needs improving …
I am totally impressed with how these four Airlines are using Social Media .
They are keeping their customer ’s engaged which keeps the Internet talking about them .
As long as there is a talk about these airlines it keeps them on the mind of travelers and future travelers .
Grant it , the talk should be good .
But , if it is not all positive this is the Airline ’s chance to step up …. to help the traveler , to make the traveler happy , to help them become content and satisfied .
If the airlines are n’t responding they are n’t making the impression they should on their customers .
If they wo n’t step up ….. another airline will .

I would be a liar if I said that I spent the past day thinking of about anything but the inauguration of President Barack Obama .
One one level I was just overjoyed to hear Obama publicly re-embrace the ideas of science and ecology , which in a way strikes me as sad as being something that “ we have to return to ” in the first place .
And of course the two central issues at hand today are the economy ( or rather the lack there of ) and ongoing asymmetrical warfare — yet underneath all of that chaos was a very positive echo of the civil rights struggle of the 1960s .
And in a sense part of the triumph of that struggle was an indirect result of a few bold visionaries who embraced the then very odd notion of the world growing smaller was a damn good thing .
My journey started a few days ago with the recent passing away of Patrick McGoohan .
Thanks to looking at those old episodes of The Prisoner I found myself revisiting the larger idea of the global village which was first popularized by Marshall McLuhan in 1962 .
To make a long story short the telecommunication satellites of that era became the first steps to breaking down national boundaries in real time — in fact you could say that it was the cultural forerunner of the internet today ( and in fact the internet starts with ARPANET in the early 70s at almost the same time ) .
During the same era we as humans started to take our first steps into outer space and as a result we started to look back at Earth as a single planet instead of a traditional school room globe with national boundaries drawn all over it .
The credit for that vision goes to Stewart Brand who campaigned in 1966 to have NASA take a photo of the earth ( which they did from Apollo 17 in 1972 ) .
And this brings me back to one of my personal favorite subjects : Star Trek and to a broader extent the science fiction and futurism of from the 1960s .
Now if you go back just a few years earlier to 1956 and look at the film Forbidden Planet it represents a very monocultural view of the future — in fact the crew of the C - 57D starship could have been identical to an Elizabethan naval vessel from the 1600s .
While the film looks good the cultural setup of it feels like its trapped in the 50s .
But then just ten years later with Star Trek we see an international and multicultural crew — and to me this was a direct result of both the civil rights struggle and the world itself becoming a smaller place .
And this shift did n’t happen by accident :
In the case of Star Trek it was because Gene Roddenberry stuck to his vision of an inclusive future even if it put his show at risk :
One of my favorite Alan Kay quotes is “ the best way to predict the future is to invent it ” and while techies embrace this notion as their own , in a wider sense creative people do the same thing when they come up with a positive larger vision of society .
In many ways we owe part of this particular moment of time to folks like Gene Roddenberry , Marshall McLuhan and Stewart Brand to prototyped their vision of a future society in the books and yes even in a sci fi television show from the 60s .

Ants given a specific job to do are not necessarily the best at it – suggesting that social insects are not as organised as thought
Marked ants reveal that ants with a job to do are not necessarily the best at it ( Image : Alex Wild )
It ’s tempting to regard an ant colony as the model of an efficient society – everyone has her own specific job to do , and this specialisation keeps the colony running efficiently .
Not so : success is down to hard work , not specialisation , new research suggests .
Anna Dornhaus of the University of Arizona , Tucson , videotaped 1142 colour - coded rock ants ( Temnothorax albipennis ) from 11 colonies as they performed four different tasks , such as foraging for food and nest building .
Unlike leaf - cutter ants or army ants , rock ants – in common with 85 % of all ant species – do not have specialisations in body size or shape that would make one individual more suited to a job than another .

No experts
Dornhaus ’s team measured the efficiency of each ant by recording the time taken to pick up an object and deposit it somewhere else .
They found that the more efficient ants were those that completed the task quickly , so they could move onto the next one .
They also measured how specialised the ants were , by noting how many times each ant performed a certain task .
For example , an ant that made 10 trips carrying food back and forth , but only one carrying stones was denoted a food specialist , whereas those ants that carried out the tasks equally frequently were generalists .
It turned out there was no connection between how frequently an ant performs a task and how well it does it .
“ What is surprising is that a specialist is actually not necessarily very good at what they are doing , ” Dornhaus says .
Also , it turns out that ants are not very good at recognising who is the best for the job .
“ There are individuals who are consistently better than others at specific tasks , but they are not the ones doing the task . ”
So if the specialists are not experts , why bother having them at all ?
Dornhaus thinks it could be beneficial for the colony to avoid the confusion that arises when switching from one task to another .
Time wasting
Mike Kaspari , an ant expert from the University of Oklahoma agrees .
“ Multitasking is a myth , ” he says .
“ It is inefficient , not because folks ca n’t learn to do individual tasks better , but because of the constant confrontation with the question ‘ what do I do next ? ’ , followed by the gearing up to switch to that task . ”
“ This wastes time .
It is better to be locked in a room to do one thing and one thing only , even if you never get better at it , ” he says .
It has long been thought that the success of social insect species , such as bees , termites and ants , stems from the organisation of labour within the group .
Dornhaus ’ study is the largest so far into the purported benefits of the division of labour .
She thinks that the fact that none were found will prompt people to start questioning whether this assumption is valid .
“ When we look at animals living in societies it is too easy to think of them in human terms , ” she says .
“ We need to fight that urge .
Ants may do things that are non-intuitive to us . ”
There could be other reasons why ant species are so successful that are nothing to do with labour organisation , such as an ability one species has to produce a chemical that prevents vegetation from growing on their nest sites .

Bush used to dissuade Putin from hanging Georgian president ' by the balls '
RAW STORY
Published : Saturday November 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin allegedly threatened to hang Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili " by the balls " during the August war in Georgia , according to a report later denied by Putin 's spokesman .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's diplomatic aide Jean - David Levitte earlier told Le Nouvel Observateur magazine that Putin had told Sarkozy in a meeting : " Saakashvili , I 'm going to make him hang by the balls . "
According to the Financial Times , French President Nicholas Sarkozy used US President George W. Bush as a cautionary tale for the Russian leader .
 Hang him ?  asked Sarkozy .
 Why not ,  Putin replied .
 The Americans hanged Saddam Hussein . 
 But do you want to end up like Bush ?  asked Sarkozy .
 Ah , there you have a point ,  resigned Putin .
The Russian leader is known for his colorful and often very crude turns of phrase .
Referring to Chechen separatist rebels , he once threatened to " waste them in the outhouse . "
He also once extended an ironic invitation to a journalist to " become an Islamic radical " and get circumcised in Moscow .

The government called in mediators from Acas last night in an urgent attempt to end the dispute over the exclusion of British workers from construction contracts which led to a wave of wildcat strikes across the country yesterday .
The attempt to halt the protest came as it emerged that hundreds more workers were ready to join the nationwide strike action .
Bosses at Sellafield nuclear power plant confirmed that 900 contractors will vote on a walkout on Monday morning in solidarity with oil industry contractors in Lincolnshire which is at the heart of the dispute after around 300 new jobs were taken by Italian and Portuguese workers .
The conciliation service was called in after around 3,000 workers at oil and power plants across the UK staged unofficial strikes in support of workers at the Lindsey refinery at North Killingholme .
The TUC claimed the refinery owner , Total , had made an " apparent attempt to undercut the wages , conditions and union representation of existing staff " .
In angry scenes outside plants from Scotland to south Wales , union leaders spoke out against European workers taking construction jobs in the oil and energy industry ahead of British workers .
Outside the Lindsey refinery , some protesters called on their colleagues to march on Downing Street .
Shop steward Kenny Ward told the crowd they had to stand together and take on the " greedy employer " .
He said : " I 'm a victim , you are a victim , there are thousands in this country that are victims to this discrimination , this victimisation of the British worker . "
Total had put a contract out to tender for a £ 200 m construction project with five UK firms and two European contractors .
The Italian company IREM won the contract and supplied its own permanent workforce .
It is understood 100 Italian and Portuguese workers are already on site and 300 more are expected next month .
In apparently co-ordinated action , 700 workers at the Grangemouth oil refinery near Falkirk walked out , and 400 more downed tools at the Wilton chemical site in Cleveland .
Early morning protests flared at at least eight other facilities in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .
In Downing Street and Davos , where Gordon Brown had been speaking against protectionism at the World Economic Forum , the government came under pressure to respond to the crisis .
There was criticism that the award of the contract at the Lindsey refinery appeared to cast into doubt the prime minister 's pledge in 2007 to deliver " British jobs for British people " .
" I understand people 's worries about their jobs , " Brown said .
A Downing Street spokesman said the contract taken by the foreign workers had been agreed " some time ago when there was a shortage of skilled labour in the construction sector in the UK " .
Pat McFadden , minister for employment relations , said he understood the strikers ' concern about employment but could not condone their unofficial walkouts .
" What is important in a sensitive situation where tempers are running high is to take an independent and dispassionate look at what is going on , " he said .
Union leaders were furious that with unemployment rates soaring , British workers had been overlooked .
The TUC accused employers of attempting to undercut the wages , conditions and union representation of existing staff .
Bobby Buirds , a regional officer for the union Unite in Scotland , said : " The argument is not against foreign workers , it 's against foreign companies discriminating against British labour .
This is a fight for work .
It is a fight for the right to work in our own country .
It is not a racist argument at all . "
Nevertheless , there were indications that far right politicians were eager to seize on the dispute .
The British National party , which is hoping to make a breakthrough in this year 's European parliament elections , said it had sent a team of supporters to join the 800 workers gathered outside the north Lincolnshire plant .
Brendan Barber , secretary general of the TUC , said workers were " rightly angry " at employers who have not given British based workers the opportunity to apply for new jobs but added : " The anger should be directed at employers , not the Italian workers . "
\ " I agree with you , Mr. Chairman , waterboarding is torture , \ " Holder said at his confirmation hearing Thursday .
' Waterboarding is torture , ' says Holder
Signaling sharp breaks from the Bush administration , Barack Obama ’s attorney general nominee declared Thursday that waterboarding is torture and that the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay will be closed as quickly as possible .
Testifying at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Eric Holder made it clear that the new administration is prepared to roll back several of the most controversial practices of the Bush administration ’s prosecution of the war on terrorism .

Through a grueling day - long session , Republicans grilled Holder on a wide range of issues , but none of the questions – and none of Holder ’s answers – were compelling enough to derail his nomination at this point .
Holder ’s unambiguous answers on torture stood in contrast those given by Michael Mukasey – then President Bush ’s attorney general nominee — a year ago , when he repeatedly dodged questions about the legality of waterboarding .
Holder did not .
When Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said Thursday that he considered the practice to be torture , Holder did not equivocate .
" I agree with you , Mr. Chairman , waterboarding is torture . ”
Holder also rejected the argument made by Bush administration officials that the president 's power in a national emergency overrode constitutional restrictions .
" No one is above the law , " Holder said .
Holder did agree with the Bush administration on one key spying issue – he supports the retroactive lawsuit immunity granted to telecom firms that participated in the warrantless wiretapping program .
Holder says he does not believe that the military commissions process for trying Guantanamo detainees is adequate .
And he believes the United States should end the practice of “ rendition , ” turning over detainees to other countries for interrogation and imprisonment .
" That should not be the policy or practice of our great nation , " Holder said .
Holder is also prepared to overhaul the military tribunals currently in place to handle Guantanamo prisoners .
And Holder says he does not believe that the military commissions process for trying Guantanamo detainees is adequate .
" I do n't think that the military commissions have in place all the due process requirements that I would like to see them have , " Holder said .
" They would have to be , I think , substantially revised to provide all the due process that we have as Americans . "
Holder ’s confirmation hearing was expected to have fireworks because Republicans were gearing up to attack him over his involvement in the 2001 pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich .
Over the course of his nine - hour hearing , Holder was even keeled , but his temper flared when he was challenged by Sen.
Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , Holder ’s top critic and the leading Republican on the Judiciary Panel .
Specter questioned Holder on why he objected to the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate alleged fundraising violations by former Vice President Al Gore during the 1990s .
“ I think it 's so clear that it raises questions about your fitness for the job , " Specter said .
Holder finally snapped back .
" You 're getting close to the line .
You 're getting close to questioning my integrity , " Holder said .
" That is not appropriate .
That is not fair . "
Specter knew he had scored a point , and Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) stepped in to defuse the situation .
For the most part , however , Holder confidently echoed Obama ’s positions on key justice issues .
He said that Obama intends to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , but he would not commit to a timetable for doing so .
" Guantanamo will be closed , " Holder said in response to a question from Sen. Herb Kohl ( D - Wis . ) .
" Steps are being taken as we speak . "
Holder , though , warned , " this will not be an easy task . "
Roughly 250 detainees remain incarcerated at Guantanamo , and Holder said some of them will be sent to other countries while others will be tried in U.S. courts .
Holder also expressed concerns over " enhanced interrogation techniques " used on detainees , and he committed to resigning from office if he were ever asked to approve a presidential action that , in his view , violated the Constitution .
He also said he believes the Army Field Manual guide for interrogations should be applied to all operations — the CIA does not have to follow the more stringent Army interrogation rules .
When Specter got around to discussing the Rich pardon , Holder played down his involvement but admitted some errors .
" My conduct , my actions , in the Rich matter is a place where I made mistakes , " Holder said .
Holder called the controversy over the Rich pardon " the most intense , most searing experience I 've ever had as a lawyer . "
Holder then argued , " as perverse as this sounds , that I will be a better attorney general because I had the Marc Rich experience . "
Holder admitted under questioning from Sen. Arlen Specter that he was not fully aware of Rich 's record , including allegations of arms dealing , before recommending a pardon to former President Clinton .
After several hours of testimony , the Obama transition team was " very pleased " following the morning session , according to one source .
Specter did little damage to Holder with his questions over the Rich pardon , and no other GOP senator went after the nominee .
Sen. Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) also pushed Holder on work his firm did for now indicted Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ( D ) .
Holder failed to include the information on his original disclosure form submitted to the committee , and Grassley is expected to focus on this issue when he questions President - elect Obama 's pick for attorney general .
And while liberals may be cheering Holder already , he ’s not about to make war criminals out of Bush officials .
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) asked whether Holder would authorize criminal prosecutions of Bush Justice Department lawyers who approved " extraordinary redition " and the warrantless wiretapping of U.S. citizens .
" We do n't want to criminalize policy differences that may exist between the outgoing administration " and the incoming Obama administration , Holder said .
Holder 's view echoes that expressed by President - elect Barack Obama , who has so far indicated that he is not interested in pursuing such investigations .

Welcome to my blog .
Hi this is my blog , there are many like it but this one is mine .
The Mi-24 helicopter was developed by the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant .
The Mi-24P has four underwing pylons for up to 12 anti-tank missiles .
The Mi-35 is equipped with the Shturm anti-tank guided missile system .
The Mi-24 attack / transport helicopter was developed by the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant , a subsidiary of Russian Helicopters .
The Mi-24 entered service with the Soviet Union in the late 1970s and has been deployed by 40 countries .
More than 3,500 Mi-24 helicopters have been produced .
It has been deployed in more than 40 wars and conflicts including Afghanistan and in Chechnya .
The original model ( Nato codename Hind - A ) , designed to carry eight combat troops , was later reconfigured to take on the gunship role ( Hind - D ) .
Later versions , Mi-24P ( Hind - F ) and the export Mi-35P , are also armed with anti-tank missile systems for the engagement of moving armoured targets , weapon emplacements and slow - moving air targets .
All versions retain the troop transport capability .
The Mi-35P version entered into the serial production in August 2020 .
Hind helicopter international sales
The Mi-24 is in service with Russia and countries of the ex-Soviet Union and has been exported to Afghanistan , Algeria , Angola , Bulgaria , Cuba , Czech Republic , East Germany , Hungary , India , Indonesia , Iraq , the Ivory Coast , Libya , Mozambique , Nicaragua , North Korea , Peru , Poland , Vietnam and South Yemen .
Ten Mi-35 helicopters were delivered by Russia to the Czech Republic in 2005 / 2006 as part of a debt repayment .
The Mi-35 M model entered into serial production by Rostvertol since 2005 .
In 2005 , ten Mi-35 M helicopters were ordered by Venezuela .
The first batch of four was delivered in July 2006 , the second four in December 2006 , and the deliveries of remaining helicopters were completed by 2007 .
Indonesia placed an order for six additional Mi-35s in late 2006 and the deliveries were completed by 2008 .
Another batch of three Mi-35s out of five was delivered in 2010 .
Brazil ordered 12 Mi-35 M attack helicopters in October 2008 , with deliveries completed by 2014 .
Iraq took delivery of the first four Mi-35s in 2013 as part of a deal for 40 Mi-35 and Mi-28NE attack helicopters .
Another batch of Mi-35Ms was delivered in 2015 .
The Mali Air Force took delivery of two Mi-35 Ms in 2017 .
Pakistan received four Mi-35 Ms from Russian Helicopters in 2017 , while Nigeria placed an order for 12 Mi-35s in 2019 .
India delivered four refurbished Mi-24Vs to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces ( ANDSF ) by 2019 as a replacement for the four attack helicopters earlier gifted to Afghanistan .
The Kazakh Armed Forces procured four Mi-35 Ms in June 2020 .
The Mi-35 M helicopter is currently being delivered to the Russian Armed Forces .
Mi-24 Hind upgrades
The Russian Army Mi-24s were upgraded with new avionics including thermal imagers .
Other upgrade packages are available , including that of Denel / Kentron of South Africa which includes Eloptro infrared sighting systems and Kentron Mokopa anti-tank missiles , and IAI Tamam which has HMOSP ( helicopter multi-mission optronic stabilised payload ) with FLIR , TV and autotracker , embedded GPS ( global positioning system ) and cockpit multi-function displays .
The ‘ Visegrad Four ’ – Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland and Slovakia – signed an agreement in February 2003 to jointly upgrade up to 105 Mi-24D / V helicopters to Nato standards .
This agreement was later abandoned .
However , two Polish Mi-24s were upgraded to Nato standard as prototypes .
In February 2004 , BAE Systems was selected as integrator for the avionics systems , which include an integrated electronic warfare suite .
In December 2005 , Bulgaria signed a contract for the upgrade of 12 Mi-24 helicopters to a team led by Lockheed Martin and Elbit .
However , the contract was subsequently cancelled in February 2007 .
Mi-24 Hind helicopter design
The design of the Mi-24 is based on a conventional pod and boom , with a five - blade main rotor and three - blade tail rotor .
It has retractable tricycle nose - wheel landing gear .
The two crew ( pilot and weapons operator ) are accommodated in tandem armoured cockpits with individual canopies and flat , bulletproof glass windscreens .
The main cabin can accommodate eight troops or four stretchers .
Weapons aboard Mi-24 helicopter
The helicopter has six suspension weapon units on the wingtips .
The Mi24D ( Mi-25 ) and the Mi-24V ( Mi-35 ) are equipped with a YakB four - barrelled , 12.7 mm , built - in , flexibly mounted machine gun , which has a firing rate of 4,000 - 4,500 rounds a minute and a muzzle velocity of 860m / s.
The Mi-24P is fitted with a 30 mm , built - in , fixed gun mount ; the Mi-24VP with a 23 mm , built - in , flexibly mounted gun .
The Mi-24P and Mi-24V have four underwing pylons for up to 12 anti-tank missiles .
The Mi-24V ( Mi-35 ) is armed with the Shturm anti-tank guided missile system .
Shturm ( Nato designation AT - 6 Spiral ) is a short - range missile with semi-automatic radio command guidance .
The 5.4kg high - explosive fragmentation warhead is capable of penetrating up to 650 mm of armour .
Maximum range is 5 km .
The Mi-24V can also carry the longer - range Ataka anti-tank missile system ( Nato designation AT - 9 ) , as can the Mi-24P .
The Ataka missile ’s guidance is by narrow radar beam , and the maximum range of the missile is 8 km .
The average target range is between 3 km - 6 km .
The target hit probability of the Ataka missile is higher than 0.96 at ranges 3 km - 6 km .
The missile has a shaped - charge 7.4kg warhead , with a tandem charge for penetration of 800 mm - thick explosive reactive armour .
All Mi-24 helicopters can also be armed with rockets and grenade launchers .
Avionics
The Mi-24D is equipped with the KPS - 53A electro - optical sighting pod .
The most recent Mi-24V and P variants have a digital PNK - 24 avionics suite and multifunction LCD cockpit displays , and Geofizika ONV1 night - vision goggles , along with NVG - compatible cockpit lighting .
They are fitted with the Urals Optical and Mechanical Plant GOES - 342 TV / FLIR sighting system and a laser rangefinder .

Getting Things Done When You ’re Getting Things Done October 30 , 2008
I have nothing against GTD ;
It ’s a great system for getting organized .
Well I lied .
I do have something against it .
GTD is perfect if you ’re already an organized person .
In which case , you learn to become super - organized .
But if you ’re like me , a superslob , then GTD fails because it does n’t address the most important issue of being organized – Motivation .
I ’ve tried to follow GTD , as I ’m confident you have too .
But after one or two days , I ’m back to being my old slob of a self .
I Could Be So Organized If I Were Organized
For the me the key to staying organized is seething to be organized .
That ’s not a typo .
I did write “ seething ” .
Many people want to be organized .
Many people even need to be organized .
But few seethe to be organized .
“ Seething to be organized ” means hating how pathetic your life is because you ’re unorganized .
“ Seething to be organized ” stems from the belief that you could be so much more , if only you could get your act together .
To seethe , you really have to call upon that deep down envy of all the people you went to school with , who are now more successful than you are .
Or you have to think about all the losers you ’ve met who have :
1. more money than you
2. have a bigger house than you
3. have a nicer car than you
4. have everything better than you
and for the life of you , you ca n’t figure out why .
The most important thing however , is to ball up your anger and let it out slowly .
Use it .
Keep the rage bottled and let out just enough each day to allow you to stick with any organizational system you choose : GTD for example .
The more reasons you can find to be angry , the better you ’ll do .
And if you need a name for this method of motivation , call it GTDWYGTD – Getting Things Done When You ’re Getting Things Done .
Under the elaborate plan , ballerinas and circus acrobats were armed with grenades and pistols and ordered to assassinate German generals if they attempted to organise concerts and other celebrations upon taking the city .
The composer Lev Knipper was charged with the responsibility of killing Hitler if he got the opportunity .
President - elect Obama has said that he would promote " wind farms " as one way to create more jobs .
This idea is consistent with popular wisdom about wind energy and , therefore , sounded good while Mr. Obama was in the Senate and during his presidential campaign .
The problem for Mr. Obama now is that this popular wisdom is wrong .
Contrary to reports issued by various wind energy advocates , " wind farms " provide few energy , environmental , or economic benefits and create very few jobs - far fewer than could be achieved if the money were used for other investments .
Also , wind energy has adverse impacts that advocates like to ignore .
Difference between campaigning and governing
" Good ideas , " even if costly , can be useful during a presidential campaign .
Once elected , however , presidents typically find that they have many more " good ideas " thrust upon them by staffers , campaign contributors , special interest groups , and heads of departments and agencies than their Presidential budget can accommodate , or that have benefits outweighing true costs .
Therefore , all presidents need effective procedures and trusted staff with discernment skills near at hand who can tell them whether the claims made by proponents of various " good ideas " are really true and whether a proposal will be cost - effective in meeting his goals .
The question now is whether Mr. Obama 's White House and Executive Office staff will have the capability and " clout " to protect him from being pressured to adopt unworthy proposals .
This will be a test for NEC Director Larry Summers , Domestic Policy Director Melody Barnes , ERAB Staff Director Austan Goolsbee , and OMB Director Peter Orszag and their staffs .
Clearly , President Bush did not have effective procedures or staff in place to protect him from bad proposals , including those from his Department of Energy ( DOE ) and its constituents .
DOE demonstrated that it could not be relied on to provide objective analysis -- or to put the public interest ahead of special interests .
A recent , relevant example is the highly misleading report -- prepared by DOE , the National Renewable Energy " Laboratory " ( NREL ) , and the wind industry - that suggested that the US could get 20 % of its electricity from wind energy .
False Popular Wisdom about wind energy
The wind industry , its lobbyists , and other wind advocates have , for more than a decade , greatly overstated the environmental , energy and economic benefits of wind energy and understated or ignored the very high true cost of electricity from wind energy as well as its adverse environmental , ecological , economic , scenic and property value impacts .
With assistance from DOE and NREL ( using tax dollars ) , the industry has misled the public , media , and government officials .
They have secured federal and state policies , tax breaks and subsidies that have :
Shifted billions of dollars in tax burden and other costs from " wind farm " owners to ordinary taxpayers and electric customers , and
Misdirected billions in capital investment dollars to energy projects ( " wind farms " ) that produce very little electricity - which electricity is low in value because it is intermittent , volatile , unreliable with little of it , if any , available on hot weekday afternoons in July and August when electricity is most needed and has high value .
During the last 4 years , the facts about wind energy 's true costs and benefits have begun to emerge , even in the media , but they have yet to be understood by most government officials who continue to parrot wind energy advocates .
False claims that " wind farms " provide large economic and job benefits
Quite likely , Mr. Obama 's campaign statements about potential economic benefits and jobs from building " wind farms " were based on some of the misleading " reports , " " analyses , " or " studies " produced during the past year by the wind industry , other renewable energy advocacy groups , and DOE and NREL .
Such documents are a real disservice to sound government policy making because they are based on unrealistic assumptions and faulty economic analysis .
They greatly overstate local and state job and other economic benefits .
In the case of wind energy , they typically employ one or more of the following basic flaws and faulty assumptions :
1. Ignoring the fact that much of the capital cost of " wind farms " is for equipment purchased elsewhere , often imported from other countries .
About 75 % of the capital cost of " wind farms " is for turbines , towers and blades - many of which are imported and add to the outflow of wealth from the US .
2 . Assuming that employment during project construction results in new jobs for local workers -- when most " wind farm " construction jobs are short term ( 6 months or less ) and the overwhelming share of them are filled by specialized workers who are brought in temporarily .
3 . Assuming that the very few permanent " wind farm " jobs are new jobs filled by local workers - when , in fact , these few permanent jobs are often filled by people brought in for short periods .
Some " wind farm " owners contracts with suppliers of wind turbines and other equipment for maintenance work with the result that no " new " jobs for local workers are added .
4 . Assuming that temporary workers who are brought in for short periods live and spend their pay checks -- and pay taxes -- locally when , in fact , these workers spend most of their wages where they and their families have permanent residences -- where the workers spend most of their weekends and where they pay nearly all of their taxes .
5 . Assuming that the full purchase price of the goods and services purchased locally ( often minimal in any case ) has a local economic benefit .
In fact , only the local value added may have a local economic benefit .
This truth is illustrated by the purchase of a gallon of gasoline -- let 's say for $ 2.00 .
Only the wages of the service station employees , the dealer 's margin , and the taxes paid locally or to the state will have a local or state economic benefit .
Economic benefits from the share of the $ 2.00 that pays for the crude oil ( much of it imported ) , refining , wholesaling , and transportation generally flows elsewhere .
6 . Assuming that land rental payments to land owners for allowing wind turbines all have local economic benefit .
In fact , these payments will have little or no local economic benefit when the payments are to absentee landowners OR if the money is spent or invested elsewhere or is used to pay income taxes that flow to Washington DC or state capitals .
7. Using " input - output " models that spit out " indirect " job and other economic benefits that , in effect , magnify ( a ) all of the overestimates identified above , and ( b ) use unproven formula and data to calculate alleged " multiplier " effects .
8. Ignoring the environmental and economic costs imposed by " wind farm " development , which include but are not limited to ( a ) the environmental and ecological costs associated with the production of the equipment , ( b ) constructing and operating the " wind farm " ( e.g. , site and road clearing , wildlife habitat destruction , noise , bird and bat kills and interference with migration and refuges ) , c ) scenic impairment , ( d ) neighboring property value impairment , and ( e ) local infrastructure costs .
9 . Ignoring the fact that electricity produced from wind turbines , has less real value than electricity from reliable generating units -- because that output is intermittent , volatile and unreliable .
Also , the electricity is most likely to be produced at night in colder months , not on hot weekday late afternoons in July and August when demand is high and the economic value of electricity is high .
10 . Ignoring the " backup power " costs ; i.e. , the added cost resulting from having to keep reliable generating units immediately available ( often running at less than peak efficiency ) to keep electric grids in balance when those grids have to accept intermittent , volatile and unreliable output from " wind farms . "
11 . Ignoring the fact that electricity from " wind farms " located in remote areas generally results in high unit costs of transmission due to ( a ) the need to add transmission capacity , ( b ) the environmental , scenic and property value costs associated with transmission lines , ( c ) the electric transmission " line losses " ( i.e. , the electricity that is produced by generating units but is lost during transmission and never reaches customers or serves a useful purpose ) , and ( d ) inefficient use of transmission capacity because " wind farms " output is intermittent and unpredictable and seldom at the capacity of the transmission line that must be built to serve the " wind farm . "
12 . Ignoring the fact that the higher true cost of the electricity from wind is passed along to ordinary electric customers and taxpayers via electric bills and tax bills which means that people who bear the costs have less money to spend on other needs ( food , clothing , shelter , education , medical care -- or hundreds of other things normally purchased in local stores ) , thus reducing the jobs associated with that spending and undermining local economies that would benefit from supplying these needs .
13 . Perhaps most important , ignoring the fact that the investment dollars going to " renewable " energy sources would otherwise be available for investment for other purposes that would produce greater economic benefits .
" Wind farms " have very high capital costs and relatively low operating costs compared to generating units using traditional energy sources .
They also create far fewer jobs , particularly long - term jobs , and far fewer local economic benefits .
" Wind farms " are simply a poor choice if the goals are to create jobs , add local economic benefits , or hold down electric bills .
Unfortunately , many of the faulty assumptions and incorrect economic analyses described above are present in an " economic model " called JEDI ( for Jobs and Economic Development Impact model ) that was developed for NREL by a wind industry consultant - lobbyist .
This " model , " paid for with tax dollars flowing through DOE , has been widely promoted by NREL and DOE .
Outputs from the model are being used by developers to mislead citizens and local governments in areas where developers wish to build " wind farms . "
The upcoming test
In summary , the facts about wind energy - yet to be acknowledged by many DOE and other government officials -- demonstrate that " wind farms " with their huge ( 40 + story ) wind turbines produce relatively little electricity ; the electricity that is produced is intermittent , volatile , unreliable and low in value ; and the true economic and environmental costs of electricity from wind is high .
Because wind turbines cannot be counted on to produce electricity at the time of peak electricity demand , areas experiencing growth in peak demand or needing to replace old generating units will have no choice but to add reliable generating units - whether or not they add wind turbines .
If wind turbines are built , electric customers will end up paying twice ; once for wind turbines and again for reliable generating capacity .
In fact , " wind farms " are being built primarily because of extraordinarily generous federal and state tax breaks and subsidies available to their owners - not because of their environmental , energy or economic benefits .
Wind industry spokesmen have indicated that two - thirds of the economic value of " wind farms " is derived from just two federal tax breaks ( i.e. , wind Production Tax Credit and 5 - year double declining balance accelerated depreciation ) .
Other federal and state tax breaks and subsidies add to benefits enjoyed by " wind farm " owners - all with the costs borne by taxpayers and electric customers .
Almost fifty years ago , the beat poet Brion Gysin ( 1916 - 1986 ) , described a visual hallucination that he experienced while riding a bus :
... Had a transcendental storm of colour visions today in the bus going to Marseille .
We ran through a long avenue of trees and I closed my eyes against the setting sun .
An overwhelming flood of intensely bright patterns in supernatural colours exploded behind my eyelids : a multidimensional kaleidoscope whirling out through space .
I was swept out of time .
I was in a world of infinite number .
The vision stopped abruptly as we left the trees .
Was that a vision ?
What happened to me ?
( Brion Gysin , 21 December 1958 )
Gysin , a writer and performance artist , though known for his discovery of the cut - up technique , which inspired writers like William S. Burroughs , was also the co-inventor ( along with scientist Ian Sommerville ) of the Dreamachine , a stroboscopic flicker device designed to be viewed with the eyes closed and produces visual stimuli .
At the end of his documentation , Gysin asks , " Was that a vision ?
What happened to me ? "
PURKINJE PATTERNS
According to Dominic ffytche of the Institute of Psychiatry in London , and author of ' The Hodology of Hallucinations , ' a study recently published in an issue of Cortex , " Fifty years on we are able to answer Gysin 's question . "
Gysin 's hallucinations were quite similar to what Jan Purkinje ( 1787 - 1869 ) , the father of contemporary neuroscience , experienced as a child .
" I stand in the bright sunlight with closed eyes and face the sun .
Then I move my outstretched , somewhat separated , fingers up and down in front of the eyes , so that they are alternately illuminated and shaded .
In addition to the uniform yellow - red that one expects with closed eyes , there appear beautiful regular figures that are initially difficult to define but slowly become clearer .
When we continue to move the fingers , the figure becomes more complex and fills the whole visual field .
( Purkinje , 1819 )
When Purkinje moved his fingers , he simulated an effect similar to that of Gysin 's Dreamachine .
Because of the brevity and unpredictability of hallucinations , up until now , surprisingly little is known about brain changes that occur during hallucinations — one cannot anticipate when a hallucination will occur .
The chances of capturing a hallucination during a brain scanning are small .
However , it has long been recognized that flashes of light at particular frequencies , like those experience by Gysin and Purkinje , produce hallucinations of intricate patterns and vivid colors .
Indeed , these stimulated visual patterns are described as Purkinje patterns .
For anyone who 's confused out there , the Purkinje patterns ffytche describes in his paper are much more complicated than the stuff everyone sees after a camera flash or when we stare at the sun too long without protective eyewear .
They 're actually much more than that .
" They are more complex …entirely unexpected the first time you encounter them .
At slow rates of flashing through closed lids you experience exactly what you might expect , a dull red light pulsing with each flash .
At the critical frequency the whole thing changes and colours , patterns and forms appear .
The Beat poet Brion Gysin 's description puts it better than I can . "
Most people have a rough idea of what a hallucination experience might be like , but when it comes to defining a hallucination , that 's more difficult .
If a hallucination is defined as ' seeing or hearing something that is not actually there , ' then dreams and imagery would be considered hallucinations .
According to ffytche , visual hallucinations , ( people do hallucinate with other senses ) , " are located in the world around us , not in the mind 's eye .
They are not under our control , in the sense that we cannot bring them on or change them as they occur .
They also look real and vivid , although the things one sees may be bizarre and impossible .
Purkinje phenomena meet all these criteria and can thus be considered true hallucinations .
However , Purkinje phenomena are induced by experiment rather than occurring spontaneously as in the Charles Bonnet Syndrome , an eye disease that causes patients to have complex hallucinations .
ffytche points out :
" We are only beginning to understand just how common this Syndrome is , partly because patients have been unwilling to admit their hallucinations for fear of being labeled as having serious mental illness .
Charles Bonnet Syndrome patients almost all hallucinate patterns and geometrical forms identical to Purkinje phenomena .
Many also see figures , objects and faces , the types of experience we generally associate with hallucinations .
The hope is that what we learn from the Purkinje phenomena will also apply to these other hallucination experiences . "
ffytche also adds that " most people will experience Purkinje hallucinations under appropriate conditions of visual stimulation , although their clarity and ease of induction varies from subject to subject .
I have only encountered a few subjects who do not seem to have the experiences for reasons I do not fully understand .
I assume the visual systems of such ' immune ' subjects are wired up in a slightly different way . "
THE HODOLOGY OF HALLUCINATIONS
In ffytche 's study , he uses a combination of brain imaging methods , harnessing the technique to examine localized changes in brain activity and changes in brain connections during hallucinations .
ffytche reviews what we do know about hallucinations and moves the field forward , by introducing a new experimental approach to studying hallucinations as they occur .
In the study , six male subjects with no history of epilepsy took part in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) and Electroencephalography experiments ( EEG ) , which measured the electrical activity produced by the brain as recorded from electrodes placed on the scalp , and were exposed to High intensity repetitive light .
The subjects were trained to push a button whether they experienced a hallucination or not and then drew the hallucinations immediately after completion of the fMRI .
" We also needed to stimulate the visual system without causing hallucinations to be able to determine which aspects of brain activity specifically related to hallucinations and which were just due to stimulation , " ffytche says .
" This was done in two ways , one controlling for the amount of light in the stimulus and one controlling for the frequency of stimulation .
The EEG and fMRI results were examined both from a topological perspective , to identify the cortical regions activated , and a hodological perspective , to identify changes in connections between regions . "
" We observed increases in activity in visual brain regions " , says ffytche , " increases in visual connection strength and an alteration in relationship between visual relay and receiving stations , together suggesting that hallucinations were caused by a transient form of ' blindness ' " .
The work highlights the need to consider the hallucinating brain from a wider perspective than previously thought .
Changes in both localized brain activity and in connections between brain areas occur during hallucinations , raising further questions as to how these changes interact with pre-existing abnormalities in patients susceptible to hallucinations .
TOPOLOGICAL VS .
HODOLOGICAL METHODS
Topological Method
The brain is a series of specialized regions each performing different functions and is connected by specific nerve cell pathways to form functional networks .
In topological methodology , the regions or ' places ' of the brain involved in a specific function are revealed by techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , a type of specialized MRI scan which measures the haemodynamic response related to neural activity in the brain or spinal cord .
fMRI has come to dominate the brain mapping field due to its low invasiveness , lack of radiation exposure , and relatively wide availability .
Hodological / Hodotopical Method
ffytche 's research implements the Hodology , ( also referred to as hodotopic ) framework studies , which revisits Alfred Walter Campbell 's forgotten 1905 project : to infer function from hodology , the physiology and pathology of cortex and white matter .
It includes not only the study of ' places ' of the brain , but also , the connections or ' pathways ' of the brain .
These ' pathways ' are revealed by techniques such as diffusion tensor tractography , a procedure to demonstrate the neural tracts .
It utilizes special techniques of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and computer - based image analysis .
The results are presented in two - and three - dimensional images .
The combined study of both the ' pathways ' and the ' places ' is what ffytche refers to as the hodotopic approach , ' topos ' meaning place and ' hodos ' meaning path .
In simpler terms , the ' places ' of the brain are ' gray matter ' and the ' pathways ' are ' white matter . '
The hodotopic approach studies both gray and white matter , rather than gray alone .
ffytche explains the benefits of taking a hodological approach to hallucinations and neuroscience :
" The dual perspective of brain places and pathways helps us remember that the brain is an integrated system and focuses research attention on specific anatomically constrained networks .
For hallucinations , we have known something of the cortical ' places ' involved for some time and have some idea of how the connections between these ' places ' differ in patients with a predisposition to hallucinations .
However , we have very little understanding of if , or how , connections change during a hallucination .
It is possible that these connection changes are the key to understanding what precipitates a given hallucination episode . "
His study outlines the need for answers and suggests ways in which the questions might be addressed .
Although current hodological techniques for studying connections in life are virtual , and do not necessarily reveal real nerve fibers , ffytche points out , " So far the virtual findings are entirely consistent with real anatomy , but we do not yet know how far we can push the technique . "
Better understanding of the connections within the relevant brain networks during hallucinations , whether they get stronger or weaker , may help design new treatments for hallucinations .
When asked what of his results most surprised him , ffytche replied :
We expected the brain regions specialised for colour , motion and patterns to be activated during Purkinje phenomena from our previous work .
We also suspected there would be changes in connections in visual circuits .
What we did not expect was how complex these connection changes seemed to be .
Some of the connections changed over time tracking the evolution of Purkinje phenomena .
Others were more fixed , changing as soon as visual stimulation started and preceding the onset of Purkinje phenomena .
Most surprising of all was the finding that the flashing light stimulus seemed to cut off inputs to the brain , transiently ' blinding ' subjects and giving them the experience of what it is like to have Charles Bonnet Syndrome .

This is hardly surprising , but still .
The Baltic Business News is reporting that Indrek Neivelt , chairperson of the Estonian Development Fund is saying that Estonia isnâ€™t competitive with its current cost base , and the only option that faces the country is lowering prices and cutting salaries .
â€ œOur main problem after this consumption party is competitiveness .
The money has been devalued in many export markets .
With our expense base and prices we are no longer competitive .
Polish food is going to Lithuania and itâ€™ll be here soon .
Soon we might not be able to produce food competitively , â€  Neivelt said .
â€ œToday is the situation that shopping in the UK is cheaper , sitting into the taxi is cheaper than in Tallinn , eating out is cheaper than in Tallinn â€ “ with our prices we arenâ€™t competitive , â€ 
Estonian PM
Andrus Ansip also acknowledged in a press conference today that one of the reasons for the deterioration of the current crisis in the country is that some the governments in some export markets such as Ukraine , Russia , Sweden and UK had gone for allowing their currencies to weaken against the euro .
The number of unemployed is also on the rise in Estonia , and increased by 4155 or 15.8 pct in December month on month , according to the local Labour Market Board .
Compared to December 2007 the unemployment rate has risen by 115.3 pct .
And local stock market analyst TÃµnis Oja has come to the conclusion that the Baltic economic crisis may have affected Sweden more even than the Baltics themselves .
Oja wrote in the magazine Ã„ ripÃ¤ev that concerns that Swedish banks were overexposed on the Baltic loan and real estate market not only caused the banksâ€™ share prices to plummet , but it was also partly responsible for the value of the Swedish krona falling from 1.67 SEK per Estonian kroon in the summer to 1.43 kroons ( and by an equivalent percentage against the euro ) .
He added : “ It would be nice to have this kind information on every patient we treat . ”
Dr. Nimer also predicted that oncologists would quickly want to start looking for these mutations in their patients or in stored samples from former patients , to see if they could help in predicting the course of the disease or selecting treatments .
Studying cancer genomes has become a major thrust of research .
In the past few years the government has spent $ 100 million dollars for genome studies in lung and ovarian cancers and glioblastoma multiforme , a type of brain tumor .
But that project , The Cancer Genome Atlas , has not decoded an entire genome .
So far , it has identified mutations in brain and lung cancers , also reported in Nature in September and October .
One discovery is expected to affect medical practice  a mutation that can cause some patients with the brain cancer to get worse instead of better if they are given a common chemotherapy .
The person who gave her cells for the study at Washington University became not only the first cancer patient , but also the first woman to have her entire genome decoded .
Her information will be available only to scientists and not posted publicly , to protect her privacy and that of her family .
The only other complete human genomes open to researchers so far have come from men , two scientists known for ego as well as intellect , who ran decoding projects and chose to bare their own DNA to the world : James D. Watson and J. Craig Venter .
Their genomes are available for all to inspect .
The woman at Washington University had acute myelogenous leukemia , a fast - growing cancer that affects about 13,000 people a year in the United States and kills 8,800 .
Its cause is not well understood .
Like most cancers , it is thought to begin in a single cell , with a mutation that is not present at birth but that occurs later for some unknown reason .
Generally , one mutation is not enough to cause cancer ; the disease does not develop until other mutations occur .
“ Most of them are just these random events in the universe that add up to something horrible , ” said Dr. Timothy J. Ley , a hematologist at Washington University and the director of the study .
The researchers chose to study this disease because it is severe and the treatment has not improved in decades .
“ It ’s one of the nastiest forms of leukemia , ” Dr. Wilson said .
“ It ’s very aggressive .
It affects mostly adults , and there ’s really no good treatment for it .
A very large fraction of the patients eventually will die from their disease . ”
The Israeli High Court of Justice today overturned the Knesset ( Israeli Parliament ) ’s attempt to ban the two Arab political parties with Knesset representation from contesting next month ’s elections .
The decision was unanimous in favor of lifting the ban on the United Arab List - Ta’al and 8 - 1 in favor of lifting the ban on Balad .
Balad Chairman Jamal Zahaika declared the decision “ a blow to ( Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor ) Lieberman and the fascist Right , as well as to Kadima , the Likud and Labor , which stood by the disqualification . ”
As popular as the effort to ban them was in the Knesset , the court ’s decision hardly came as a surprise after Attorney General Menachem Mazuz filed a brief saying he saw no legal grounds to bar the parties from the election .
Lieberman condemned the decision , saying the court “ virtually gave the Arab parties permission to kill Israel as a Jewish and democratic state . ”
He promised to “ make sure to pass the citizenship bill ” when the next Knesset takes power , promising “ that will put an end to the disloyalty shown by some of Israel ’s Arabs . ”
The citizenship bill , which Lieberman ’s party has been advocating for years , would compel all Arabs to take a loyalty oath to the current government and its status as a Jewish state , or lose their citizenship and their right to vote .
A demand to pledge eternal loyalty to their status as second class citizens is unlikely to sit well with most Arabs , already frustrated by their ill treatment during the most recent war .
It would also amount to a de facto ban on Balad , which has as one of its central tenets the demand for equal rights for all citizens .
With Lieberman ’s
Party looking to gain big in next month ’s elections , the citizenship bill may have more momentum in the new Knesset .
If you never make the same mistake twice , you 'll still never run out .

This graph shows the A2 / P2 spread from the Fed 's commercial paper report .
The A2 / P2 Spread hit 586 bp as of Friday .
When the A2 / P2 spread spiked to 160 last year that was considered shocking ; now that spike looks minor .
Maybe that was holiday related , but look at the 10 year Treasury yield :
This shows the 10 year yield since 1962 .
The current yield is at 2.72 % .
This is the lowest yield in the 46 year history of the 10 year treasury note .
This spike was probably because of comments by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed might buy longer term treasuries .
[ T ]he Fed could purchase longer - term Treasury or agency securities on the open market in substantial quantities .
This approach might influence the yields on these securities , thus helping to spur aggregate demand .
Neither of these graphs suggest anything positive for the credit markets or the economy .

A little over a year ago , it seems , a new industrial facility sprang up on the edge of town .
It was in a remote industrial zone and appeared to be a bus depot .
The new enterprise was surrounded by an imposing security fence and bore no outward signs identifying its services .
However , it soon became apparent that the compound was in the business of outfitting a fleet of prison buses .
Thirty or so secondhand city buses were being reconfigured with prison bars in the windows and a coat of fresh paint bearing the “ Wackenhut G4S ” logo on the side .
The new Wackenhut operation is shrouded in mystery .
It has been running its fleet of empty prison buses night and day , apparently logging miles on a Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) contract .
Multiple buses can be seen driving all over town and even on remote desert back roads .
Oddly , except for the driver and one escort guard seated in front , these buses are always empty .
Wackenhut Services was founded by George Wackenhut in 1954 to provide prison guard services to state and federal governments .
Mr. Wackenhut was reported to be something of a brawler himself , having once earned distinction beating up his business partner in a fist fight .
Now owned by the Danish corporation G4S , Wackenhut Services has a sinister reputation for hiring thugs .
It has been said that it ’s hard to tell which is more dangerous , the prisoners or the guards .
Observers originally thought that the purpose of the new Wackenhut operation was to outfit prison buses to be distributed in other parts of the country .
But it soon became apparent that none of the buses was leaving the Tucson depot .
Recently , a passerby observed what appeared to be a training operation there .
In what seemed to be strange activity for 10:30 PM on a Saturday night , the depot yard was fully illuminated , the entire fleet of buses was up and running , and drivers and guards were scrambling around the yard .
The question is , what were they training for ?
Wackenhut has never officially announced itself to the community , and the local news media have never mentioned its presence .
Hiring has been discreetly conducted via the Internet , and an apathetic general public has taken little notice .
Among the few who have noticed , one theory is that the prison bus depot is simply infrastructure for border security .
But if so , where are the illegal aliens ?
Why are these buses always empty ?
What is the alleged justification for burning thousands of gallons of diesel fuel to run thirty decrepit , smoking buses night and day without passengers ?
There is another interesting piece to this puzzle .
On the desolate plain between Phoenix and Tucson is a tiny town called Florence , Arizona , which features a population consisting largely of prisoners .
For decades , Florence has been the home of two of the largest county and federal prisons in the state ; and in 2007 , a vast new DHS prison was built there as well .
Like the Wackenhut buses , this shiny new facility , which literally disappears into the horizon , has gone unannounced and unnoticed by the general public .
A new facility for imprisoning illegal aliens ?
It is hard to imagine such expensive infrastructure being built for that purpose when U.S. policy has been to simply return illegals to their home countries .
Fraud and waste aside , this mysterious activity has sinister implications .
Why the obvious secrecy ?
Since the World Trade Center disaster in 2001 , the Department of Homeland Security has grown to monster proportions , claiming a projected $ 50 billion of the federal budget in 2009 .
DHS includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , which earned notoriety in 2005 for its gross mishandling of the Katrina disaster in New Orleans .
Al Martin , a retired naval intelligence officer and former contributor to the Presidential Council of Economic Advisors , has linked the remilitarization of FEMA to the civil unrest anticipated along with economic collapse .
He wrote in a November 2005 newsletter called “ Behind the Scenes in the Beltway ” :
“ FEMA is being upgraded as a federal agency , and upon passage of PATRIOT Act III , which contains the amendment to overturn posse comitatus , FEMA will be re-militarized , which will give the agency military police powers .
. . .
Why is all of this being done ?
Why is the regime moving to a militarized police state and to a dictatorship ?
It is because of what Comptroller General David Walker said , that after 2009 , the ability of the United States to continue to service its debt becomes questionable .
Although the average citizen may not understand what that means , when the United States can no longer service its debt it collapses as an economic entity .
We would be an economically collapsed state .
The only way government can function and can maintain control in an economically collapsed state is through a military dictatorship . ”
1
Of course , there may be another , more innocent explanation for all this .
But anyone living near one of these facilities should be asking to hear it .
In the meantime , the ominous implications would seem to warrant exploring alternative sources of funding for the federal budget and the federal debt .
There are other ways to deal with the national debt than relying on the waning appetites of the Chinese and the Japanese for U.S. securities .
Some innovative possibilities for funding both the federal debt and President Obama ’s new economic stimulus package will be the subject of future articles .
Stay tuned .

During the summer of 1982 I had the opportunity to visit the Nazi concentration camp just outside Dachau , Germany and then the little town itself .
Given the proximity of the town to the camp , my immediate reaction was : “ This town is so close to the camp that the citizens of Dachau must have known what was going on out there .
Why did they not do anything about it ? ”
I had the exact same reaction during the last two weeks of May 1986 as I traveled up and down the West Bank and Gaza Strip in order to investigate Israel ’s atrocities and war crimes against the Palestinians .
When I then complained about these reprehensible practices to the appropriate high - level legal officials sequentially at the Israeli Ministry of Defense , the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , I was told that they were all required by and could be justified under the doctrine of “ military necessity . ”
Rather than engaging in an extended debate over this point , I simply responded to all three of these lawyers that this was precisely the argument used by the Nazi war criminals before the Nuremberg Tribunal in 1945 to justify their own incredible outrages upon humanity , including the Jewish people .
After a bit more argumentation , these three lawyers basically conceded my Nuremberg analysis , but then each independently , uncannily , and matter - of - factly informed me : “ We have public relations people in the United States who take care of these matters for us . ”
Even more distressingly , upon a visit to the office of the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Ministry to discuss the prospects for peace , I was immediately informed by him that Israel had a “ claim ” under international law to the West Bank : it might not constitute the basis for perfect title , but it was nevertheless a “ claim . ”
At the time I recalled the fact that of course Hitler had a “ claim ” to the Sudetenland as well .
Although the Munich Pact of 1938 permitted German occupation and annexation of the Sudetenland into the Nazi Reich , this act of cowardice by Great Britain and France ultimately paved the way for the outbreak of the Second World War one year later , with all the tragic consequences that conflagration entailed for the Jewish people , among others .
Today , the United States and Israel are striving to consummate a Middle East version of the Munich Pact that will sell out of the right of the Palestinian people to self - determination and a real independent state of their own .
Only history will tell if the consequences shall be as tragic for the fate of the Arab and Jewish peoples in the Middle East , if not the rest of the world .
I fear that there is a high probability that history will repeat itself .
Toward the end of my 1986 trip to Palestine , I visited the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to complain about these criminal Israeli occupation practices .
An assistant U.S. political attaché informed me that such matters concerned “ internal affairs ” of the Israeli government .
I stridently objected : Under basic rules of international law , the Israeli government is what is known as a “ belligerent occupant ” of the West Bank , Gaza Strip , and Jerusalem .
Pursuant to article 4 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , all non-Israelis living in these occupied territories are what are called “ protected persons . ”
Article 147 thereof provides that
any of the following acts committed against “ protected persons ” are “ grave breaches ” of the Convention : “ wilful killing , torture or inhumane treatment .
. . wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health .
. . . ”
Furthermore , article 146
mandates all state parties to impose “ effective penal sanctions for persons committing , or ordering to be committed , any of the grave breaches of the present Convention .
. . . ”
Thus , any Israeli political leaders or military officers who have ordered or committed such “ grave breaches ” are “ war criminals ” within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions and the Nuremberg Principles .
These Israeli war criminals can and must be prosecuted by any state in the world community that obtains jurisdiction over them .
Finally , under common article 1 to the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949 , all state parties are obliged not only to respect , but also “ to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances . ”
When a party to the Conventions such as Israel is committing “ grave breaches , ” such practices are not “ an internal affair ” but rather international crimes and therefore a matter of international concern .
The United States government , inter alia , has an absolute obligation to use its enormous political , military and economic leverage over Israel to terminate such criminal practices immediately .
Yet for the past sixty years the United States government has had no response to make to the desperate pleas by the Palestinian people for freedom , justice , dignity , respect and independence , in other words , for self - determination .
After forty years of an incredibly brutal and inhumane military occupation , the only really effective manner for all states party to the Geneva Conventions to ensure respect for the terms of the Fourth Convention in these occupied Palestinian territories would be to compel all Israeli military forces and colonial settlers to withdraw immediately and by all means possible from the West Bank , Gaza , and East Jerusalem .
In 1999 President Clinton ordered Indonesia out of East Timor that it had illegally invaded and annexed as far back as 1975 with the approval of the Ford / Kissinger administration .
Some future American President must likewise order Israel out of Palestine .
It was toward obtaining that end that I had originally called for the establishment of an Israeli divestment / disinvestment campaign in November of 2000 .
Free Palestine !

China approves universal health care plan RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday January 21 , 2009
Print This Email This China will spend 850 billion yuan ( $ 124.26 billion ) to offer health care to its 1.3 billion citizens .
At a meeting of the nation 's State Council presided over by Premier Wen Jiabao , the expenditure , with aims to guarantee universal medical coverage to China 's population by 2011 , was approved , Xinhua reported Wednesday .
" Growing public criticism of soaring medical fees , a lack of access to affordable medical services , poor doctor - patient relationship and low medical insurance coverage compelled the government to launch the new round of reforms , " according to the report .
Measures to be taken between now and 2011 include equalizing the level of care available in urban and rural areas , cataloguing and supervising drugs , and the launch of a pilot program to overhaul hospital administration , operation and supervision .
" Primary healthcare and medical services will become accessible to more people ( and ) people 's medical expenses will be visibly reduced , " the draft plan reads .
According to China 's Ministry of Health , about 400 million people have no health care coverage at all .

An , Evelyn Towry , in Kootenai Elementary School because of accusations that she was assaulting school ’s staff .
What happened was that she had been refused entry into a school Christmas party because she refused to take off her beloved cow costume that was a hoodie with cow ears and a tail .
Evelyn was put in a separate classroom away from the party , but when she tried to leave , the teachers told her to stay put .
When Evelyn protested , the adults physically restrained her .
She was very scared so she reacted in a violent way to the physical restraint .
Evelyn got bruises on her legs , and is tormented by memories of the incident .
The staff immediately called the police
First after a couple of hours her mother was allowed to take her home .
The Towry family is considering legal action against the school .
At a hearing on the case the prosecutor said that he did n’t think at this time it would be beneficial to pursue it because of Evelyn ’s age and her condition .
To celebrate the New Year , we at Cracked have dug deep in the annals of local news to salute those ordinary folks who in 2008 had their lives forever cursed by some unfortunate photographs .

MOSCOW 
The prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine agreed Sunday to resolve their gas dispute , with an understanding that prices would be pegged to the price of oil , but with a discount for 2009 that means Ukraine could pay little more than it did last year .
The deal , expected to be signed Monday , came after a din of criticism from officials in Europe , where more than 20 countries have been affected since a Jan. 6 cutoff of natural gas and at least 12 people have frozen to death in a dispute that is ostensibly over prices and transit fees , but that is also deeply entwined in post -Soviet politics .
If the agreement holds  and previous deals have not  the gas dispute would essentially end where it started in terms of prices , in what would be a baffling result considering the hardship caused by the embargo .
It was unclear after the announcement when gas would start flowing back to Europe .
Politically , Russia appeared to have made gains in influencing internal Ukrainian affairs ahead of an election scheduled there next year , but at the cost of alienating officials in European countries in a standoff that was as much geopolitical as commercial .

Sensationell comeback i Modo i vinter - men inget spel i LG Hockey Games .
Viktigare att träna med Modo
– Hade jag valt NHL hade jag spelat i LG Hockey Games .
Då hade det varit bra att få några matcher innan jag åkte över .
Men som läget är nu känns det viktigare att vara hemma och träna med Modo under landslagsuppehållet .
Vad fick dig att bestämma dig ?
– Att tiden rann ut och att jag fortfarande inte är helt hundra på att jag kan spela .
Men jag är optimistisk .
Foten känns bättre än när jag åkte över och spelade med Colorado förra våren i alla fall .
Jag har lyckats bli av med problemen att foten drar ihop sig , samtidigt som jag inte vill ta ut något i förskott .
Modo enda alternativet utanför NHL
– Men det känns rätt att spela i Modo eftersom det var enda alternativet utanför NHL .
Jag kunde ha väntat , men det känns bra att ha tagit det här beslutet .
Det går ju lite tungt för Colorado och i Philadelphia var det ju ständiga problem med foten när jag var där senast , så det ville jag inte utsätta mig för igen .
Hur många klubbar var intresserade i NHL förutom de två ?
– Jag vet faktiskt inte .
det hann aldrig gå så långt .
Du gick igenom en ganska omfattande , ny fotoperatiion i höstas ?
– Ja , det var ett ganska stort ingrepp .
Det var inte så att man åkte hem dagen efter precis .
Det känns bättre än förra gången jag gjorde comeback , men jag kan fortfarande inte säga att det är helt hundra .
– Men går allt som det ska spelar jag hemma mot Skellefteå 12 februari .
Längre fram ser jag inte .
Men nu är du plötsligt tilllgänglig för VM i Schweiz ?
– Ja , men det vill jag inte spekulera i allas .
Så långt fram tittar jag inte överhuvudtaget .
Det är här och nu som gäller .

" We first introduced a pork chop biscuit a few years ago and , even though we stopped selling it last year , we still get many requests from people asking us to bring it back , " said Brad Haley , Hardee 's Executive Vice President of Marketing .
" And , since we had many reports from our restaurants that people were ordering a side of our famous sausage gravy to dip the biscuit in , we decided to re-test it with sausage gravy already on it and it was more popular than ever .
So , I guess the old saying among our test kitchen people is true : ' The only way to make it better is to add gravy to it ! ' . "
Hardee 's has announced the return of their Pork Chop ' N' Gravy Biscuit .
And now they 've added gravy .
It follows the Southern cuisine popularity Hardee 's found with the success of their Chicken Fillet Biscuit .
The Pork Chop ' N' Gravy Biscuit features a breaded , boneless pork chop and sausage gravy on a ' made from scratch ' biscuit .
It is priced at $ 2.99 , or in a small combo for $ 4.59 ( with hash rounds and a drink ) .
It has 680 calories ( 370 from fat ) and 42 grams of fat .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday he 's still trying to keep Connecticut Sen .
Joe Lieberman within the Democratic caucus despite anger over Lieberman 's support of Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
Harry Reid says it's up to the Democratic caucus to make any decision about Joe Lieberman 's future .
While he has opposed Democratic efforts to end the war in Iraq , " Joe Lieberman votes with me a lot more than a lot of my senators , " Reid told CNN 's " Late Edition . "
" Joe Lieberman is not some right - wing nutcase , " he said .
" Joe Lieberman is one of the most progressive people ever to come from the state of Connecticut . "
Lieberman , a Democrat - turned - independent , broke with the party over the war in Iraq and ran as an independent after losing the party 's nomination in 2006 .
Since then , he has been the 51st vote that kept the Senate in Democratic hands .
Lieberman also was Al Gore 's running mate on the 2000 Democratic ticket .
But this year , he was a fixture on the campaign trail with McCain -- and now that Democrats have gained at least six seats in the chamber , Reid is under pressure from many Democrats to punish Lieberman for harsh criticism of Sen.
Barack Obama in a speech at the Republican convention .
" Sen . Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead .
But , my friends , eloquence is no substitute for a record , " Lieberman said at the Republican convention in early September .
Lieberman charged that Obama had not reached across party lines to " get anything significant done " and said that the McCain - Palin ticket was " the real ticket for change . "
Reid said it was up to the Democratic caucus to make any decision about Lieberman 's future , noting that , " Quite frankly , I do n't like what he did . "
But he pointed out that Lieberman has supported Democrats on most issues , including an important budget vote earlier this year .
" For those people beating up on Joe Lieberman , I 've done my share , " he said .
" Recognize the glass being half full , not half empty . "
Reid and Lieberman met Thursday to discuss the Connecticut senator 's future .
Reid said no decisions have been made , and he would not confirm reports that Lieberman was offered the chairmanship of a lower - profile committee on veterans affairs instead of his current post as chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
A Lieberman aide told CNN that the proposal was unacceptable , and that the senator has been approached by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell about switching sides .
Lieberman on Thursday did not discuss what he and Reid talked about , but said , " The election is over , and I completely agree with President - elect Obama that we must now unite to get our economy going again and to keep the American people safe .
" That is exactly what I intend to do with my colleagues here in the Senate in support of our new president , " he said .
" And those are the standards I will use in considering the options that I have before me . "
Obama campaigned for Lieberman during his 2006 loss to an anti-war primary challenger .
But the president - elect 's designated chief of staff , Rep. Rahm Emanuel , told ABC's " This Week " that Lieberman 's fate was up to his fellow senators .
" The business of what we have to do when we get sworn in is focusing on what the American people care about , " Emanuel said .
" Priority one is the economy . "
All About Harry Reid • Joseph Lieberman
On its opening day , the London Millennium Bridge experienced unexpected swaying due to the large number of people crossing it .
A new study finally explains the Millennium Bridge ' wobble ' by looking at how humans stay balanced while walking .
The same pedestrian - structure interaction has also been identified on several other bridges , including Bristol 's famous Clifton Suspension Bridge .
The phenomenon is not related to the structural form of the bridge , but rather the behaviour of the pedestrians .
The paper by civil engineers at the University of Bristol , published in the Royal Society journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A , examines the basic way humans maintain balance .
Balance is achieved by changing the position of foot placement for each step , based only on the final displacement and speed of the centre of mass from the previous step .
The same balance strategy as for normal walking on a stationary surface was applied to walking on a laterally swaying bridge .
Without altering their pacing frequency , averaged over a large number of cycles , the pedestrian can effectively act as a negative damper to the bridge motion , which may be at different frequency .
Hence the pedestrian can inadvertently feed energy into bridge oscillations .
Dr John Macdonald , Senior Lecturer in Civil Engineering , said : " It is clear that the motion of the bridge affects the force from the pedestrian , rather than the pedestrian simply applying an external force . "
It has generally been thought the Millennium Bridge ' wobble ' was due to pedestrians synchronizing their footsteps with the bridge motion .
However , this is not supported by measurements of the phenomenon on other bridges .
The researchers found , to their surprise , that pedestrians walking randomly , keeping balance as normal can cause large bridge sway .
This finally seems to explain the initiation of the Millennium Bridge ' wobble ' and gives new insight for designing bridges to avoid vibration problems .
A box unchecked
An Ambinder reader notices a gap in the diversity of the otherwise extraordinarily , thoroughly diverse Obama cabinet : Southerners .
John Edwards probably would have filled that slot , had he not fallen from grace .
Sam Nunn and Max Cleland have been mentioned , but faded .
Their absence is part happenstance , but also reflects the declining political power of a region that used to be crucial , and also the fact that -- as Jonathan Martin and I wrote just after the election -- Obama 's win sprang in some organic way from the newer , faster - growing , better - educated regions of the country , which do n't include most of the South .
Meanwhile , a quick thought on the rest of the cabinet makeup : Bill Clinton , former aides say , worked hard for his Cabinet that " looks like America , " and reached outside the normal establishment channels for some of his picks .
George W. Bush , reaching into a less diverse GOP , did the same in some cases .
Sixteen years later , Obama has n't had make any apparent special effort to avoid having a cabinet dominated by white guys : People like Susan Rice , Steven Chu , Eric Shinseki , Hillary Clinton , Bill Richardson , Janet Napolitano , and Eric Holder are obvious choices , with their own power bases , relationships with Obama , and / or establishment credentials -- some earned at high levels of the Clinton administration -- that the notion of a special effort to ensure diversity at the top level of this administration seems sort of irrelevant .
That does n't mean that there 's no effort for racial balance or box - checking , but it 's a different story than in years past .
My 15 - year - old daughter Eleanor has just finished her mock GCSEs , and has done pretty well despite my conviction , aired at regular intervals , that she was spending too much time at the computer on social networking sites when she could have been revising .
It is eerie to find history repeating itself , to say nothing of chemistry and physics .
When I was 15 , my mother took the draconian decision to have the television set removed .
She asked Mr Williams from
No 54 to store it in his garage while I kicked the habit .
Similarly , my wife and I have resolved to stop Eleanor 's access to MSN messenger if we feel that her schoolwork is suffering , an exercise much easier than that undertaken by Mr Williams , who reportedly tripped over the front door step in his haste to get the telly out before I got home from school , exuding teenage malevolence .
Nonetheless , these two examples of parental angst , a generation apart , are instructive .
As parents in the danger - strewn 21st - century it is important to maintain a sensible perspective , even in the light of a report just published by market research agency ChildWise , which after surveying 1,800 children at 92 schools claims " a major boost to the intensity and the independence with which children approach online activities " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Teenagers have always found ways to worry and alienate their parents , and always will .
It is part of their birthright , just as parents are entitled to fret that their children are exposed to more pernicious influences than they were at the same tender age .
The relentless march of technology makes this unequivocally true , of course .
My children can access pornographic images without leaving the front room , whereas I had to rely on reliable contacts in the shoplifting business .
Just to bring my mother back into this story , incidentally , I vividly recall my horror one day at finding that my secret stash of pornography had disappeared from its impregnable hiding place under my bed , and how horror turned to mortal embarrassment when my mum casually said : " if you 're wondering where your girlie magazines are , I 've put them with your Look & Learns .
That seems to be the category they belong to . "
Now , it would be disingenuous of me to equate a 1977 Playboy centrefold with the images that my kids can download , but the point is that I trust them not to , and since trust is one of the most valuable commodities there is in the relationship between parent and child , I 'm not going to let go of it without a struggle .
Admittedly , it is a struggle intensified by the myriad of online attractions , especially once you add games consoles to the equation .
Indeed , this report reckons that children between the ages of five and 16 are spending almost six hours a day peering at screens of some sort , and if that seems decidedly alarmist , I yield to nobody in my dislike of the spectral glow that bathes Eleanor 's face late into the evening as she messages the school friends she has spent all day with .
But then 30 years ago precisely the same objection was levelled at teenage girls for spending ages on the phone .
As for boys , in 1977 the eminent psychologist William Belson published Television Violence and the Adolescent Boy , a report which suggested that teenagers who watched The Sweeney were 49 per cent more likely to duff someone up .
That seems as quaint now as the ChildWise report will be to Eleanor , when she 's dealing with my 15 - year - old grandchildren .

In this article I ’ll explain how I installed PyS6o on my Nokia N73 phone , which runs on Symbian 9.1 ( 3rd Edition ) operating system and supports S60 software platform .
So here is the plan :
Download necessary files
Transfer them to the phone
Install PyS60
Write a test script and run it .
1. Download necessary files
You need to download two python installers (. sis extension ) from Sourceforge.net .
The first is the PyS60 interpreter and the second one is the Python Script Shell ( i.e. user interface ) .
Here are the links for the files that I downloaded :
PythonForS60_1_4_5_3rdEd.sis
PythonScriptShell_1_4_5_3rdEd.SIS
Notice that the second part of the filename represents the version number ( 1.4.5 ) and thrid part represents the edition of the OS ( in this case 3rd ) .
2. Transfer them to the phone
Transfer the downloaded files to the phone by USB cable or Bluetooth or whatever medium that you use .
3. Install PyS60
Go to Menu > Tools >
File Manager .
Browse to the directory where you have placed the installers and run them .
After installation go to Menu >
Applications and look for the Python logo that appears on the list .
4 . Write a test script and run it
You would notice that a directory name ‘ Python ’ has been created on the phone file system , depending on whether you have installed PyS60 on the phone memory or on the expandable memory .
Write a single line script in your computer :
print " Hello World " ;
Save it as hello.py and transfer it to the Python directory of your phone .
Now launch the Python application .
Select Run script from Options , choose hello.py from the list and run it by clicking OK .
It will print the message on the console .
Alternatively you can run the demo scripts provided in the Python directory .
Update : PyS60 1.9.0 has recently been released ( thanks to cb22 for informing me ) .
Download it from here .
The guiding principle in Municipal Judge Paul Sacco ’s courtroom is an eye for an eye .
Or rather , an ear for an ear .
So when teenagers land in front of him for blasting their car stereos or otherwise disturbing the peace in this small northern Colorado city , Sacco informs them that they will spend a Friday evening in his courtroom listening to music -- of his choosing .
No , they ca n’t pay a fine instead , he tells them .
So , he adds with a snicker , ever heard of Barry Manilow ?
For the last decade , Sacco , 55 , has administered a brand of justice somewhere between “ cruel ” and “ unusual . ”
Advertisement
Young people in Fort Lupton know that if they ’re caught , they ’re in for a night that could begin with the “ Barney ” theme song , move on to an opera selection and end with Boy George ’s “ Do You Really Want to Hurt Me . ”
Sacco ’s answer to that last question :
Yes , he does .
Or rather , he wants a little payback to the scofflaws blaring their tunes without regard for their neighbors -- a vexing habit in this blue - collar community of about 8,000 , said Police Chief Ron Grannis .
For a while , Sacco -- a part - time judge who also has a law practice -- issued tickets , $ 95 apiece , to the noise violators .
But one day , as he ordered a teenager to pay a fine , he realized the kid ’s parents , flanking him , would probably just pay it for him .
Advertisement
“ It just seemed I was a rubber - stamper , ” he said .
“ I hate that . ”
What he really wanted to do , Sacco thought , was give the kid a dose of his own medicine .
And the “ music immersion ” sentence was born .
The concept was simple : Stick the kids in a room -- on a night they ’d rather be out socializing -- and turn up the volume .
Manilow immediately came to Sacco ’s mind .
Not because he disliked Manilow , but because he knew they would .
But the playlist also features other artists , mostly selected for their ability to annoy the younger set .

While Sacco -- himself a musician whose tastes run to Pink Floyd and Simon & Garfunkel -- acknowledges that vengeance is one motive , he has others .
“ The kids are exposed to music they would otherwise not hear , ” he said .
It ’s also his way of letting young people know he cares .
Growing up in the Chicago area , he too had his share of scrapes , Sacco said .
“ But the cops cared about me .
They did n’t just throw a book at my head . ”
His music immersion program , he said , is his attempt to emulate that .
“ They know I like them and care about them , ” said Sacco , although he did once make the offenders listen to a song he wrote and performed .

The Friday night sessions are run by Sacco ’s court administrator , Karen Cade , accompanied by a Taser - carrying bailiff .
On a recent Friday night , they greeted their offenders as they walked , slumped and scowling , through the metal detector at City Hall .
While the ticketed are often teenagers , they include some adults .
Tyler North , 18 , a high school senior , looked grim .
“ I wish I was n’t here , ” he said as he took a seat facing the speakers .
Eric Hart , 20 , was more optimistic .
How bad could it be ?
he wondered .
“ It ’s only an hour . ”
Cade introduced herself , then pressed the play button on the small CD player in the center of the conference table .
As the opening notes of the “ Barney ” song blared , her lips twitched .

Then came the “ All In the Family ” theme song and a nameless , screeching harmonica solo .
The men squirmed .
The bailiff did paperwork .
As Manilow crooned , “ I write the songs that make the young girls cry , ” a couple of them looked like they might do just that .
Gabriel Rocha , a 31 - year - old construction worker , cracked his knuckles .
Only Andrew Gehrig , 21 , mouthed the words along with Manilow .
Bing Crosby .
Beethoven ’s Ninth .
When Branden Stinehelfer ’s head slumped toward his chest , the bailiff nudged him .
By the time Melanie sang “ Brand New Key ” ( chorus : “ I ’ve got a brand new pair of roller skates ” ) , every face looked pained .
Advertisement
At 8 p.m. , there were still four songs to go , but the time was up .
Cade hit stop , cutting off Willie Nelson mid-song .
“ OK , we ’re done , ” she said .
“ I hope you ’ve learned something from this . ”
The program ’s recidivism rate is less than 5 % ; once subjected to a night in City Hall , the offenders rarely return .
Interestingly , the offense rate also seems to have plummeted recently , Cade said .
Sacco sentenced 56 people to music in 2007 ; by 2008 , that number had dropped to 20 .
It works in the short term , said Grannis , the police chief .
“ They go back to doing what they ’re doing , ” he said , but they ’re more cautious about it .
Advertisement
“ As soon as they see you , [ the blaring car stereo ] shuts off , ” said Grannis .
“ I really think it ’s a deterrent . ”
He counts himself a fan of the program , though as a country music fan , he does n’t think Willie Nelson belongs on the playlist .
The latest crop of offenders said they wo n’t let themselves get caught again .
“ If you see a cop car , turn your volume down , ” said Gehrig , a convenience store clerk .
It could ’ve been worse , he pointed out , with ABBA or 1980s hair metal .

“ A little Manilow here and there , ” he confided , “ is n’t too terrible . ”

The San Francisco 49ers on Friday acknowledged that the battered economy likely will slow down their plans to build a new stadium in Santa Clara and now has them willing to discuss a once unthinkable option — sharing a new home with their cross-bay rival , the Raiders .
Combining resources with the Oakland Raiders — as the New York Jets and Giants have done on a new $ 1.6 billion stadium — may be the only way for the 49ers to overcome frozen financial markets to fund a new stadium , NFL insiders and sports economists say .
Team officials said Friday that they remain focused on starting construction of a new $ 854 million stadium in 2010 , but acknowledged the economy and other factors “ are making hitting our target more difficult . ”
While there are no immediate plans to join forces with the Raiders , the 49ers would be willing to discuss sharing a stadium “ if a workable option emerges . ”
Given the disruption of the bond markets and the 49ers ’ continuing impasse with the Ohio company that controls the land where the 68,000 - seat stadium would be built , the team ’s plan to begin construction next year for a 2012 opening is almost certainly defunct , sources said .
Santa Clara Mayor Patricia Mahan said the recession could force Santa Clara to pare back its financial investment of up to $ 136 million in redevelopment money in the project .
Considering the dramatic run-up in stadium construction costs in recent years , the 49ers ’ plan to finance a stadium alone , with a smaller government subsidy than many NFL teams have received for stadiums which cost much less , was always a difficult project .
But the economic collapse of the last six months has pushed that plan to the brink of impossibility — at least temporarily , say investment bankers who have financed NFL stadiums , sports economists who study the league ’s finances , and NFL team officials who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The 49ers are contending with many obstacles : the effect of the recession on big corporations that would buy naming rights and luxury suites , uncertainty over the future of the NFL ’s stadium finance program , and the fact that almost every team outside California has already built a new stadium .
“ There is no question that new stadium projects are difficult to accomplish in California and the current economic climate creates new wrinkles that we have to work through , ” said Lisa Lang , a 49ers spokeswoman .
“ But we have an ownership group that is spending significant resources each month to make this goal a reality , and we are pushing forward despite the economic factors . ”
The good news , Lang said , is that the 49ers are focused on environmental studies and negotiating a deal with Santa Clara now , and are not yet seeking financing .
“ Our hope is that once we begin the financing phase , the credit markets will have recovered and we will be able to finance our project , ” she said .
None of that means the 49ers ’ stadium ambitions in Santa Clara are dead .
The economic picture could be very different a year or 18 months from now , economists and bankers say .
And one silver lining is that the global slowdown has blunted inflation in concrete and steel prices that had been increasing construction estimates by $ 25 million a year .
Ron Garratt , the assistant city manager who is Santa Clara ’s lead negotiator , said the city and the team are pushing forward on a term sheet that would define in great detail the financial agreement between the 49ers and the city .
“ We ’re making progress , ” Garratt said Friday .
“ We are absolutely moving toward an election this year , and a term sheet that will be coming out sooner rather than later . ”
But for now , the 49ers face the worst financial climate many stadium experts have ever seen .
“ Sorry to be so negative , but I would n’t be sanguine if I was those guys , ” said Robert Tilliss , chief executive of Inner Circle Sports , a New York investment banker who has worked on numerous stadium deals , including AT&T Park in San Francisco .
Tilliss called the current market for long - term financing of a stadium project “ crippled . ”
Sports economist Michael Leeds of Temple University said the current downturn is hitting wealthy individuals and corporations who form the core market for premium seating , stadium advertising and naming rights , which are central to financing the 49ers stadium .
Several insiders said the economy could force the 49ers to consider what the Giants and Jets did — teaming up with their cross-bay rival , the Raiders , to build a stadium the two teams would share .
A shared stadium would generate more revenue , potentially making risk - averse lenders more likely to finance it .
There is a huge wild card in that plan , however — the Raiders ’ mercurial owner .
“ Economically it makes sense , but you ’ve got to get people to agree to live together and live harmoniously , ” Tillis said .
“ It ’s complicated .
The Jets and Giants have been living together for awhile , so they know what they are dealing with , but with Al Davis in the mix , I think it ’s challenging . ”
Raiders CEO
Amy
Trask declined to comment about the possibility of sharing a stadium with the 49ers Friday , other than to say , “ We enjoy our relationship with the 49er organization and wish it the best with its stadium endeavors . ”
Lang said a shared stadium with the Raiders is not the 49ers ’ current objective .
“ However , if it makes sense to share the stadium with another professional sports team and a workable option emerges , it is something we would be willing to discuss , ” she said .
By sharing a new stadium , the Giants and Jets were able to extract $ 300 million from the NFL ’s stadium finance program , and will move into their new stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands in 2010 .
But with the league ’s stadium fund exhausted , a replacement finance program would have to be completed in conjunction with a new collective bargaining deal with the NFL players union — a process rife with uncertainty , especially given the death last year of longtime union president Gene Upshaw .
Also looming is a stalemate between the 49ers and Cedar Fair Entertainment , the Ohio amusement park company that owns Great America .
Over the past six months , “ there ’s been no progress in that area , ” Lang said .
A Cedar Fair spokeswoman , Stacy Frole , said the company is still willing to sell its interest in Great America to the 49ers , clearing a path to build the stadium on Great America ’s main parking lot , but she agreed there has been no significant progress .
“ It ’s the same situation , ” she said .
Mahan said the jobs that would be created by construction make the case for a stadium stronger .
But the mayor said that the recession ’s impact on Santa Clara may force the City Council to slow its evaluation of the proposal , even if that means the project is delayed .
“ I ca n’t help but think , ” Mahan said , “ that there ’s going to have to be a delay . ”

Interesting Monkey Festival in LopBuri .
The town of Lopburi in Thailand celebrated its annual interesting Monkey Festival over the weekend , laying out a lavish banquet for the more than 2,000 macaques that roam freely through it .
Locals believe that providing food for the monkeys , Lopburi ’s most famous residents , brings good fortune and prosperity .
The feast is also a sort of “ thank you ” for the interesting animals whose antics entice thousands of tourists to the town every year .
The main attraction of this area is a group of monkeys that run freely for the city .
They are mainly localized to templio of San Phra Kan , but you can also see wander in the street , close to shops , or simply that penzolano from the trees .
It can be fun to spend an hour look , as can be similar to us sometimes .
The only other interesting thing to Lopburi is the palace of King Narai , with a beautiful garden , a museum and various historical ruins .
Twenty among the best
Thai cooks have set up a banquet by 500000 Bhat ( about $ 15000 ) consists of two tons of sausages , fresh fruit , fruit , vegetables , ice cream , jam and milk .
Banquet it seems highly appreciated by around 2000 visitors to put it mildly curious since 2000 were macachi !
In the small town of Lopburi ( Thailand ) each year is celebrated the Festival of the Apes , where he prepares precisely this sumptuous banquet and macachi have all weekend to abbuffarsi !
For local this holiday is a good omen and also a way to thank the ‘ cousins ’ that attract many tourists every year .
The macachi in Lopburi are free to run through the streets , going into gates and spassarsela to the streets .
The only advice if capitate to Lopburi is to be careful portfolios and the food that sgranocchiate and be ready to diffenderli by monkeys !
While 2008 saw investments wiped out institutions falter , and record job losses , the house that Mario built chugged its way back into the record books .
According to NPD Group statistics , Nintendo sold a record 10.17 million Wii consoles to US Americans in 2008 .
That trumps Nintendo's own record of 9.95 million consoles sold in the relatively healthy 2007 economic climate .
Nintendo added to its money pile by hawking 9.95 million DS handhelds for the year compared to the 8.52 million sold in 2007 .
Those tallies represent 55 % of all consoles and 72 % of all handheld consoles sold in the US .
Daaaamn .
P.S. Want to see what Nintendo's 2008 dominance looks like in the form of a pie chart ?

We 've seen conservatives for Obama : last week Chris Buckley 's endorsement got him fired from the National Review .
We 've seen Republicans for Obama : the Chicago Tribune has just endorsed a Democratic nominee for the first time in its 161 year history ( going back to when the parties were almost the mirror image of today ) .
We 're even seeing racists for Obama : a canvasser in Pennsylvania had someone say " We 're voting for the n***er ! "
If all those people can put aside their ideologies for a greater good , so can anarchists , greens , and far lefties .
In 2000 I strongly supported Ralph Nader , and I do n't regret it .
There were three very good reasons .
First , I believed then and still believe that a Gore victory would have been worse , in the long term , than a Bush victory .
Bill Clinton had just spent eight years behaving like a Republican on economic and business issues , and thereby moving the whole political frame of reference to the right , while behaving like a sixties liberal on cultural issues and thereby firing up the Republican base .
He built up massive potential energy for a right wing surge , and a budget surplus for them to spend .
Gore seemed likely to pile up even more kindling , while Bush seemed like the perfect leader to waste it with his incompetence .
And that 's exactly what happened .
Bush has done plenty of damage , but imagine the damage a highly skilled ruler could have done with the same tools .
And now , only seven years after its peak , the Republican party is falling apart .
Second , fringe parties have succeeded many times in American history , not by winning elections , but by winning enough votes that one of the dominant parties adopts their positions .
I was hoping that Nader would get 10 % or more and cost Gore the election , and the Democrats would be forced to get back to their roots of economic populism .
Of course , it did n't work out that way .
But the window was wide open and we had to take our best shot .
Third , the reason that window was open was that Nader was channeling the power of the Democratic base .
With Al Gore now reborn as a environmental rock star , we forget that in 2000 his campaign was aggressively bland , that his running mate was Joe Lieberman , and that his rallies were dull gatherings of tired partisans , while Ralph Nader was filling arenas with crowds that stood on their feet for fiery two hour speeches .
I still think it 's tragic that all that energy came to nothing .
This year , all those reasons are gone .
You could argue that a McCain / Palin presidency would move public sentiment even farther to the left , but if it goes too far , left wing leaders will be corrupted by power .
This is a good time to stop investing and take the payoff , and we 're not going to see a better candidate to spend it than Barack Obama .
Here 's a good article from March about the kind of person he is , An hour and a half with Barack Obama , and a summary of his work in the Senate , 37 bills written or co-sponsored by Barack Obama .
And he has proven his executive skills by running the most effective and airtight campaign in the age of television .
This year no third parties are in a position to sway the Democrats , because the energy that was channeled by Nader in 2000 is being channeled by Obama -- and not just into speeches and yard signs , but into an extremely impressive political machine .
Obama has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from small donors , and has built the largest and best organized network of local volunteers in history .
Here 's an inspiring article about Obama 's ground game in Ohio .
This alone should earn our support ( assuming the popular energy is emotionally healthy ) , because if you want to be tactically effective , you have to go where the action is .
Any change we imagine cannot even begin until we first establish a precedent that ordinary people can engage the system and make a difference .
Now , the fringe voters and non-voters are saying , " But but but -- do n't you know that Obama is tight with Zbigniew Brzezinski , and that his foreign policy is indistinguishable from Bush Sr , and that he has done nothing to oppose corporate rule or the war on drugs or ...
" Of course I know all that .
I can't even watch the debates because of all the bullshit they take for granted : that it 's good for America to be much stronger than other nations , that there is a moral difference between our military bombing other countries and their militaries bombing us , that the real job of our troops is to spread democracy and not to enforce a global domination system , that swarthy foreigners are determined to strike us for vague hateful reasons , that we must sacrifice autonomy and privacy for security , that we even need this much security , that surveillance technologies should be used from the top down before they 're used from the bottom up , that private sector fees are good and normal but public sector fees are a terrible burden , that medical care should be paid for through insurance , that the real job of the schooling system is to make kids smart and not to make them submissive , that the economy should grow , that it 's normal and good to have an economy based on lending , that material wealth is a good measure of success , that every technology we have ever adopted is now a " need " .
We are in a deep hole .
The question is , what are we going to do about it ?
Of course we can plant fruit trees and ride bicycles and reduce our expenses and generally cut our connections to hierarchical disempowering systems and replace them with cooperative roles in our local communities .
But at the same time we can still engage the big systems , and the more powerful the big systems are , the more important it is to engage them .
And we have to engage them where they are , not where we want them to be .
If you 're trying to green a desert , you start with cacti and sagebrush , not with redwood seeds .
Suppose you could pick anyone in the world to run for president , but you could n't change the context your candidate had to run in : not the biases and assumptions of the big media , not the power of the elite , not the ignorance and political shallowness of the American people .
Who would you pick ?
Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich did run , and they lost .
Anyone with their positions who came close to winning would be neutralized , if not by violence then by humiliation in the media , which they did to Howard Dean even though he was pretty conservative on the issues .
Obama is doing what anyone would have to do to be president , and he 's doing it with impressive skill to be able to overcome his race and his name .
All our complaints about Obama are really complaints about the system he has to run in .
So the key question is , if we elect him , how will he change that system ?
Will he end subsidies to factory farms ?
Free all the drug war prisoners ?
Restore the Constitution and add a Privacy Amendment ?
Close all the foreign military bases and spend the money on naturopathic hospitals ?
Transform America into a nice European - style socialist country , or into a rhizomatic network of permaculture communities linked by bike trails and solar steampunk trains ?
No .
But he has already changed the election system by shifting the Democratic party 's funding from big donors to small donors , and that investment will eventually pay off in policy changes .
And where radical policy changes are needed , Obama will tend to move toward them , as far as it 's politically realistic .
If subsidies to factory farms are doing more harm than good , Obama is a smart observer who will notice it , a good thinker who will look for a different path , and a skilled leader who will persuade others to work with him .
Here 's an article , Judge Him by His Laws , describing how Obama singlehandedly turned around the Illinois state legislature and police establishment to pass a difficult law requiring interrogations to be videotaped .
The patience of Obama 's vision is less important than his skill in moving others in the right direction without provoking a backlash .
Right now , Obama 's most valuable asset is his adaptability .
It makes him seem weak to us because he has adapted to the requirements of running for president .
But if he becomes president , adaptability means that as America 's military dominance weakens , he will pull back where McCain would push harder .
It means that if your group occupies an abandoned suburb and turns the lawns into gardens and goat pastures , and the owning banks complain , Obama will negotiate a compromise where McCain would send in the Blackhawks .
We are entering difficult , dangerous , and rapidly changing times , and it's better to have a skilled observer and navigator in charge than a hard - driving ideologue , even an ideologue who you agree with .
We all want to see Utopia in our lifetimes , but the painful truth is that your grandchildren 's grandchildren will not see it .
Good big changes take a long time , and big changes that take a short time are not good .
This year it 's actually the Republicans who represent radical change .
If you want to see angry mobs burning houses , possibly your own house , elect Sarah Palin , who has shown enthusiasm for stirring up the worst emotions in the worst Americans .
If you want to see the end of history , elect John McCain , who is impulsive , emotionally unstable , and allegedly said in 2000 , " If I was in charge , I would nuke Iraq to teach them a lesson . "
That McCain vacation story remains unverified , but here 's a well - researched article about McCain 's character .
Compare it with this story , translated from a Norwegian newpaper , about how in 1988 Obama gave $ 100 to help a stranger in an airport There 's a common argument on the fringe that Obama and McCain are the same .
This is like seeing Jesus on a tortilla : a compelling vision driven by belief and constructed by focusing on a few data points and ignoring everything else .
Obama and McCain are nearly opposite on character , competence , curiosity , flexibility , thoughtfulness , and many issues that directly affect the lives of people around you .
Here 's a summary of Obama vs. McCain on interest group scorecards .
If you know anyone who needs access to birth control , or you would like to see a peaceful reduction in human population , it will matter to you that Obama has a rating of 100 by Planned Parenthood and McCain has a rating of zero .
If you fear a police state , you might care that the ACLU rated Obama 89 and McCain 17 for the latest congressional term .
Maybe they should have rated them both zero to not complicate the issue for people who only knew about FISA .
Here 's an article by an economic specialist smart enough to see the financial collapse coming years ago , raving about Obama 's economic rescue plan :
" For the first time in years , the American people are not having their hands tied behind their back while the government spits directly in their face . "
And here 's an article about Seymour Hersh , America 's most prominent investigative journalist , who says if Obama wins , " You can not believe how many people have told me to call them on 20 January .
' You wanna know about abuses and violations ?
Call me then .
'" This is real shit .
Do these differences trump , or are they trumped by , the fact that Obama and McCain are the same on the core assumptions that hold up industrial civilization and the American Empire ?
It depends on how much you 're going to have to deal with reality .
I think the problem with American fringe voters is not that they do n't identify enough with the system , but that they identify too much with it .
Think of it this way :
Your city has seceded from America .
It 's a tense situation , with federal militarized police surrounding you on all sides .
And somehow , maybe through a friend in the next state , you get a vote .
Now does it bother you less to vote for someone you have deep disagreements with ?
American greens , ask German greens who you should vote for .
American anarchists , ask Spanish anarchists .
If foreign policy is important to you , ask people in Baghdad or Caracas or Tehran .
I think they 'll say , " Are you daft ?
Do you want us all to burn ?
Vote for Obama ! "
Why does a vote for the American president have to be deep statement of your personal values ?
It 's not a fucking tattoo .
There is one argument that I can't refute : from your perspective , your one vote is not going to decide the election .
But from my perspective , " your " vote means the votes of the thousands of people who are reading this , and each of you has the power to influence more voters , or help them get to the polls , and that influence might be necessary if Republican voter caging and machine hacking nullify Obama 's margin .
And even if your actions do n't change the national result , your choices , and how you make them , can influence your own values , your thinking habits , your path in this world .
Every presidential election is like a long national therapy session .
In 2000 , switching to Nader meant breaking out of the frame of major party politics by following your heart .
This year , switching to Obama -- from any direction -- means breaking out of the frame of voting - as - purity by following your intelligence .
Programming Clojure Beta 6 is now available .
What 's new :
A new Chapter , " Functional Programming , " exlains recursion , TCO , laziness , memoization , and trampolining in Clojure .
A new Section , " Creating Java Classes in Clojure , " shows how to create and compile Java classes from Clojure .
The snake example has been moved into the concurrency chapter .
The snake demonstrates how to divide your model layer into two parts : a functional model and a mutable model .
The STM example in the introduction now uses alter instead of commute , which allowed a race condition .
Given the problem domain of the example , the race condition was acceptable .
However , explaining this in the introductory chapter would have been distracting .
instead of , which allowed a race condition .
Given the problem domain of the example , the race condition was acceptable .
However , explaining this in the introductory chapter would have been distracting .
The lancet runonce function now uses locking instead of an an agent .
Yes , you can do plain old - fashioned locking in Clojure !
Agents are unsuitable for the kind of coordination lancet requires , because you cannot await an agent while inside another agent .
While I am talking about lancet : it now has its own repository .
I have added integration with clojure .
contrib .
shell - out , so lancet can now call either
Ant tasks or other applications .
It is still far from being a replacement from Ant or Rake , but maybe your contributions can change that !
The book is now prose - complete , so if you have been waiting for the whole story , this is it .
A number of readers have made suggestions for additional topics .
If you have suggestions , please add them as comments to this post .
For reasons of space and time , most new topics will appear in a series of articles on this blog , not in the book itself .
Clojure and clojure - contrib continue to evolve .
To make sure you have the latest , greatest version of the sample code from the book , go and grab the github repo .
Thanks again to everyone who has been offering feedback .
I have cleared almost 400 entries from the errata / suggestion page .
Keep the feedback coming !
When you want to lose weight , many diet programs and health experts recommend brisk walking as a calorie - burning cardio exercise .
But what is the right amount of walking each day to help you achieve your weight loss goals ?
How Long to Walk Each Day for Weight Loss
Aim for a brisk walk of 30 to 90 minutes most days of the week for weight loss .
You can walk more on some days and less on others , but the total time for the week should be at least 150 minutes ( 2.5 hours ) .﻿﻿
You should walk fast enough that you are in the moderate - intensity exercise zone at 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate .
You should be breathing harder than usual and can speak in full sentences , but you could n't sing .﻿﻿
You can use your heart rate and exercise zone reading from a fitness band , app , or heart rate monitor to ensure you are exercising at moderate intensity .
While you can break up your walking time into periods of 10 minutes or longer , you get an added benefit of burning fat when you walk at a brisk pace for longer than 30 minutes at a time after warming up .
If you 're new to walking , get started with shorter periods of walking and steadily build up your walking time .
You might want to take longer walks every other day at first .
Try not to skip more than one day in a row .
Consistency is good for burning calories and improving your metabolism , as well as for building new habits .
On your non-walking days , try strength training exercises .
If you find yourself worn out , take a day off .
But be sure to get back walking the following day .
If you 've hit your weight loss goal and are working on maintaining your weight , the CDC recommends you should spend 60 to 90 minutes most days of the week in moderate - intensity physical activity while not eating more calories than you expend all day .﻿﻿
How Far Can You Walk in 30 Minutes ?
If you walk at a brisk walking pace for 30 minutes , the distance you will cover would be : 1.5 to 2.0 miles .
2.5 to 3.3 kilometers
3,000 to 4,500 pedometer steps .
What If You Ca n't Walk for 30 Minutes at a Time ?
Life can be busy .
If your schedule does n't permit walking continuously for 30 minutes , break it up into walking two or three times a day for shorter periods of at least 10 minutes at a brisk pace .﻿﻿
Always warm up for five minutes at an easy pace no matter what duration you will be walking .
You can use higher - intensity intervals , stairs , and brisk walking to get the most out of shorter walking workouts .
Research published in 2017 shows that high - intensity intervals are at least as good as continuous moderate - intensity workouts and can be a good way to fit exercise into your day .﻿﻿
Calories and Fat Burned in 30 Minutes
At a brisk walking pace , you would burn 100 to 300 calories in 30 minutes ( depending on your weight ) or 200 to 600 calories in an hour .
By walking for 30 minutes or more at a time , some of those calories will be from stored fat .
During the first 30 minutes of exercise , your body is burning sugars stored as fuel .
These are used up after about 30 minutes .
To keep going , your body releases fat from your fat cells and burns it for fuel .
This stored fat is exactly what you want to lose , and it's a good reason to build up your walking endurance so you can walk for more than 30 minutes at a time .
Walk most days of the week for at least 30 minutes to burn an extra 1,000 to 3,000 calories in total for the week and to improve your metabolism each day .
A Word From Verywell
You 've taken the first step towards a healthy weight and an active lifestyle .
It may sound a little daunting to think of how much physical activity is needed to burn calories .
But it 's also the amount recommended to reduce your health risks for diabetes , heart disease , and more .
Thousands displaced in Fiji by severe flooding
By Margaret Rees
15 January 2009
Tropical storms triggered severe flooding in Fiji last weekend , killing at least 11 people .
More than 9,000 people have abandoned their homes and are now in makeshift evacuation centres .
Meteorological Service director Rajendra Prasad said it was the " worst flooding situation in the recent history of Fiji " .
Military chief and self - appointed Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama has declared a national state of emergency .
Last week 's tropical depression involved rainstorms and flooding that burst river banks , caused landslides and wreaked havoc on the impoverished country 's agriculture and infrastructure , including roads , and water , power , Internet and phone services .
Fiji has again been put on flood alert as another low depression hit yesterday , bringing more torrential rains .
Fiji's Western Division ( covering the western half of the main island , Viti Levu ) from Sigatoka to Rakiraki , as well as parts of the Central Division ( including the eastern half of Viti Levu ) , have been declared disaster zones .
More than half of those made homeless are from the Western division , with at least 5,000 people taking refuge in 75 shelters there .
Popular tourist and business centre Nadi recorded the highest number of evacuees with more than 1,800 .
Curfews from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. have been imposed in Ba , Nadi and Sigatoka towns , in order , according to the military regime , to prevent looting .
In the Northern Division ( which includes the Vanua Levu island ) eight landslides were reported late yesterday , cutting two highways .
The death toll is likely to rise .
A 35 - year - old mother is missing in Vatukoula , after having been caught in a landslide with her daughter and swept over a cliff into a river .
The girl managed to swim to safety .
A toddler and a teenage girl were also killed in landslides .
A four - your - old boy reportedly died after falling into floodwaters from the balcony of his home .
The sugar industry — one of the main industries in the country — in the Lautoka region has been hard hit .
" The damage is currently largely through lodged cane ( cane that falls or leans over ) , water - logged fields , silting , debris imported into the fields and the washing away of recently applied fertiliser , " sugar cane growers ' spokesman Surendra Sharma said .
" Should the fields remain water - logged , this will compound the damage .
If strong winds strike , this could result in cane tops snapping and if this happens , the crop is a total write - off and nothing can be salvaged ...
Cane farmers have no crop or other insurance .
These are the poorest of the poor in Fiji and the very people that cannot afford any losses , " he said .
In Ba and Nadi , 90 percent of retailers had suffered damage .
Four metres of water flooded Ba 's main street and vegetable market .
In Nadi , Chamber of Commerce president Dr Ram Raju estimating the damage to business at $ F100 million ( $ US55 million ) .
" Almost all shops in town are left with only four walls .
All the infrastructure is damaged , with many losing millions of dollars worth of stock , " he said .
While details are still emerging , the storms and flooding have caused considerable hardship .
Destitute people in Nadi are forced to scavenge for muddy clothes and pots being thrown out by shopkeepers .
Supermarkets have prevented scavenging for damaged food items , due to the danger of disease .
There have been reports of pending food shortages in many evacuation centres .
Health officials warned of the dangers of typhoid and dysentery .
National Bloodbank manager Seru Rokasuka warned of shortages of blood , with less than 100 pints in stock , and appealed for emergency donors .
The tourism industry , already suffering a protracted downturn because of the 2006 military coup , then the world economic crisis , will take a further hit .
Resorts have been cut off , with tourists from Australia , New Zealand , the US and Europe unable to reach the airport due to washed out roads .
The roads from Nadi to the airport are only partly accessible by four - wheel - drive vehicles .
Local staff at many resorts have been sleeping in conference facilities , because the floods have washed their own homes away .
No doubt concerned to pre-empt criticism over the government 's limited response to the disaster , junta leader Bainimarama visited authorities and flood victims in Western Division yesterday .
" I am disappointed with the delivery of food at the evacuation centres , " he declared .
" They [ the evacuees ] should be fed and looked after well .
The police and the military should send their teams to the evacuation centres , it is in disarray right now . "
The rescue and humanitarian effort has been hindered by the lack of international assistance , particularly from Australia and New Zealand .
Canberra has announced additional aid of just $ A150,000 and Wellington $ A82,000 — pittances that represent a tiny fraction of what is required .
The Fijian government has estimated that the cost of the clean - up for general infrastructure alone is at least $ A17 million .
An article in the Australian today , " Fiji on its own in flood disaster " , noted that none of the usual logistical support , including military helicopters capable of delivering aid to outlying areas , has been provided .
The reaction by the two leading regional powers underscores their contempt for the plight of ordinary Fijians .
The overriding concern remains that of bolstering Canberra 's and Wellington 's strategic positions in the South Pacific .
Relations with Fiji have become increasingly tense , as Bainimarama has turned to rival powers , particularly China , for support .
In response to the flooding , Beijing 's representative in Suva pledged $ A41,000 in assistance , and the Red Cross Society of China donated an additional $ A25,000 to the Fiji Red Cross .

Lewis Lapham is n’t happy with political journalism today .
“ There was a time in America when the press and the government were on opposite sides of the field , ” he said at a premiere party for Gonzo : The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson on June 25 .
“ The press was supposed to speak on behalf of the people .
The new tradition is that the press speaks on behalf of the government . ”
An example ?
“ Tim Russert was a spokesman for power , wealth , and privilege , ” Lapham said .
“ That ’s why 1,000 people came to his memorial service .
Because essentially he was a shill for the government .
It did n’t matter whether it was Democratic or Republican .
It was for the status quo . ”
What about Russert ’s rep for catching pols in lies ?
“ That was bullshit , ” he said .
“ Thompson and Russert were two opposite poles . ”

Charles Darwin would probably love the fact that the 200th anniversary of his birth is being celebrated with radio shows , documentaries and exhibitions , but he might not have enjoyed the way that furious Christians still despise his theories and try to prove the Bible is more reliable .
For example , the Discovery Institute has announced that : " We want students everywhere to speak out ... for the right to debate the evidence against evolution and turn ' Darwin Day ' into ' Academic Freedom Day ' . "
But they 're lucky Darwin is n't forced on us the way religion has been , otherwise the national anthem would start : " Our Gracious Queen will be saved or not according to a series of factors that are sod - all to do with God , " and once a week school assemblies would start with everyone singing : " All things biological / All matter sweet or frightening / Are Godless , real and logical /
See – where 's the bleeding lightning ? "

The creationists demand that biblical theories are taught alongside Darwin 's theories of natural selection , which might sound reasonable except that creationism depends not on evidence but on faith .
If all theories are given equal status , teachers could say : " Your essays on the cause of tornadoes were very good .
Nathan 's piece detailing the impact of warm moist air colliding with cool air , with original sources from the Colorado Weather Bureau , contained some splendid detail .
But Samatha 's piece that went " Because God is cross " was just as good so you all get a B +. "
To improve their standing the anti-Darwin lobby have changed their tactics , so now instead of arguing for creationism they call their theory " intelligent design " .
Mostly this consists of trying to illustrate how species are too complex to have been formed by nature .
But then they can't help themselves , so you get articles such as the one by prominent advocate of intelligent design , David Berlinski , that starts : " Charles Darwin says , ' In the struggle for survival , the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals . '
Another man , Adolf Hitler says ' Let us kill all the Jews of Europe . '
Is there a connection ?
Yes is the obvious answer . "
So there we are – study the differences between finches and you 're half way to organising a holocaust .
The founders of intelligent design are nearly all creationists , and one of their books , Of Pandas and People , is identical to a book used by creationists .
Except that , after a ruling in the US Supreme Court that creationism could n't be taught in schools , the word " creationist " was deleted throughout , and replaced with " intelligent design " .
The new theory , where it is new , states there are many species that can't have become the way they are through gradual evolution , because if you remove any one part of them the whole structure would collapse .
So they must have been created whole , as they are now , without changing .
But this ignores the beauty of Darwin 's discovery , which is that species change not because they 're on a march towards perfection but by accident .
What may be ideal for survival one day is no good once the environment has changed .
For example if it gets colder , or the colour of the surroundings changes , the individuals in a species best suited to the new conditions will be the ones to last , and the species becomes altered .
Survival of the fittest means those accidentally matching the requirements of a new situation , not the creatures most prone to winning a scrap .
Otherwise by now the only hamsters to survive would be those ones who could pick up the wheel and smash it over their mate 's head , and the only surviving parrots would be the ones squawking : " Who wants some ?
Who wants some ? "
And this dominance of the accidental is the most damning argument against intelligent design , because if all species were designed , it was hardly done by someone intelligent .
If it was , how do you account for the parasitic wasp that lays eggs on its prey so they hatch and eat its victim while it 's still alive ?
More to the point , why are your most sensitive nerves at the end of your toe , where they 're most likely to get walloped ?
Why are men's nuts in such a vulnerable location , ay ?
Bloody vindictive design that is .
Why do dogs do the squashiest , most unpleasant turds that hide in the grass and spread themselves in the indentations on the bottom of your shoe , but do n't start smelling until you get indoors and then render the place uninhabitable until you 've left every window open for a month ?
Why , why , why ?
Come on intelligent design people , the questions you have to answer have barely begun .
Facebook has been used to serve legal documents , in a case where the defendants failed to turn up to court .
In one of the first such cases in Australia and potentially the world , a Canberra court has used Facebook to serve legal documents in a case where the defendants could n't be found any other way .
The ACT Supreme Court ordered that a judgement be served to defendants via the social networking site , after they failed to appear in to court .
Young Canberra lawyer Mark McCormack suggested a novel way to contact them .
" Both myself and my colleague Jason Oliver have Facebook accounts , so we thought we could access that and see if we could find them , " he said .
The co-defendants were listed as being friends with one another and their Facebook profiles displayed their birth dates , which was enough to satisfy the court that the right people would receive the documents .
Courts have previously allowed judgements to be delivered by email and footballer Sonny Bill Williams was recently served via text message .
A Victorian law firm says it has also used Facebook to deliver a legal notice .
The Victorian County Court delivered a six - figure amount against the defendant in that case , after the Facebook communication was successfully sent through .
Lawyers say the willingness of the courts to use the new technology gives them more opportunities to perform their work in difficult circumstances .

FROM PICKING UP A GUITAR TO A PAYING GIG WITHIN A FEW WEEKS
There ’s an interesting lesson in how you started .
When you decided you wanted to play music , you immersed yourself into the local live scene and started performing publicly within a few weeks of picking up a guitar .
Yeah .
I had literally picked up a guitar for the first time just three weeks before going to my first open mic .
I had songs I wanted to play .
I wanted to see and meet other musicians , and understand what the scene was like .
I was just excited about doing music and wanted to saturate myself , so naturally I thought , “ Be around other musicians . ”
Get in there , see what other people are doing , share what I ’m doing , and see what people think of it .
I was extremely shy .
I remember the first open mic I did , people were looking at me on stage , and I thought , “ Why is everyone looking at me ? ”
And I had to remember , “ Oh , right .
I ’m playing . ”
If you immerse yourself anytime you ’re getting into something , it ’s like learning a language : if you ’re surrounded by it , it ’s a lot easier .
Especially with the music community because everybody is so nice because they ’re doing what they love .
You know ?
The sense of community and being able to talk to people and hear people and get response from people about what you ’re doing .
Everybody went to the same open mic every week and hung out - it was a nice little group .
Also I just did n’t know any better .
I just thought , “ Oh , you ’re doing music ?
Me too !
So I ’ll go hang out with you . ”
Then you got your first paying gig right away .
I had only done the open mic for about four weeks .
I was still playing C , G , and sometimes F. I really was n’t experienced at all .
But one day , a couple friends and I just walked into a coffee shop with our guitars and started singing , as a joke - because we were nerdy like that .
The manager of the coffee shop called me the next day and said , “ Hey , what would we have to pay you to come back every Sunday ? ”
We said $ 20 , thinking that was for all three of us to split , but when he gave us $ 20 each we thought , “ Oh my gosh !
We ’re making money ! ”
Then you really turned this into a scene , bringing in other artists , right ?
Yeah .
We played that place for about a year , but we would invite other musicians to come play with us , and started creating a scene .
Then people would ask us to do other shows .
I started bringing other artists that I liked into Reno .
If somebody was playing in San Francisco or Sacramento I would contact them and say , “ Hey , we have a growing music scene here in Reno , and if you want to play here I would be happy to book you . ”
So I actually had a lot of people at one point contacting me to be booked , where I had nothing to do with the music part , I was just booking .
I did it just to learn about it .
WORKING FOR A BOOKING AGENT
Then you interned for a booking agent , and learned a ton .
There ’s a Hilton in Reno that ’s a big music venue with national acts .
I called the booking agent there and just asked if I could intern for her - basically just kind of follow her around for a day .
I told her I was a musician , just getting started , and wanted to learn about the booking from the booker ’s end , because I did n’t know anything about it , and there were n’t many musicians in Reno who knew about booking things other than a coffee shop , you know , like booking real shows .
People like her probably do n’t have a lot of people asking for their expertise in something .
It ’s a show of respect to the people who do know what they ’re doing and letting them know that you want to learn - and that you ’re willing to help in whatever ways that you can help .
Even if it ’s just grunt work , you know ?
She was really nice and had me go in there every week to help her out with filing or whatever .
She would show me press kits to show me what they did book and what they did n’t book .
That was really helpful : rather than trying to learn everything from a musician ’s point of view , branching out and asking , “ What are these people receiving ? ”
What are the biggest lessons you learned from working with the agent ?
As a musician , make sure you ’re providing something - not just asking for something .
Let the booker know whether you can bring people out , or whether you ’re going to do all that you can to get the media involved .
Let them know that you ’re putting effort into it .
Tell them straightforward , that you ’re reaching out to people on MySpace , that you ’re going to write a press release up and ask them for a media list .
They like that , even if it takes them an extra minute to send out their media list , they like knowing that you ’re putting the effort in and that you really want to make it a good show .
That you ’re not just expecting to go there and have a built audience and have them do all the work .
You know ?
A booker receives tons of press kits .
Certain ones are going to stand out and certain ones are n’t .
So what is the difference ?
What does that ?
Following - up .
A lot of press kits sat there because nobody called and nobody asked about it .
There ’s definitely a point where people can follow - up too much , but I think that if you ’re just consistent and looking for an answer , whether it ’s a yes or no , and understanding that these people have a lot on their plates and they ’re shuffling through everything .
Remind them that you really want to play there or that you really think that it would be a good fit .
There were all of these factors that I had never considered yet - and then I kind of got a little taste of that .
Then this agent started helping you , more than you expected .
She started booking me as an opening act for some of their bigger shows .
That was n’t what I went there for .
I did n’t even really think that that would happen .
I did n’t think that I was ready to play there .
I really did n’t expect her to book me .
But when you put yourself out and you ’re trying to learn something , and you ’re trying to help somebody along the way , I think people want to help .
Especially when you ’re eager to learn , you know ?
People do really want to help .
It brings you more of the community feeling - that sense of family - to what you ’re doing .
It ’s easy to think that the business people are on the other side , but when you actually start meeting them and working with them you understand that everybody is on the same side - getting into music because they love something about it .
ADVICE ON BOOKING TOURS
Booking your first gig outside of Reno - in San Francisco - how were you able to do that ?
I just Googled “ music in San Francisco ” , which is what I do any time I ’m going to a new place really .
Also finding out who does a similar thing to me , and where they were playing .
I put a press kit together , and sent it to the venue .
I had built a website that was simple but had everything , and showed that I was playing a lot of shows in Reno .
I just told them , “ I have n’t played outside of Reno , but I would really like to play in San Francisco and I ’ve heard about your place . ”
I ’d seen a couple other people who ’d played there , and they had really liked them .
I was just enthusiastic in wanting to do it and being willing to put the effort into bringing people out .
Enthusiasm does a lot .
It does n’t have to be hyper crazy enthusiasm , but I think it ’s just good to be really into it , and letting them know that you ’re putting your best effort into it .
People enjoy seeing that .
Then let ’s pretend you you wanted to play somewhere you ’ve never played - like Atlanta .
How would you approach it ?
Maybe we should pick a different city , because when I was at the Folk Alliance conference , I met Eddie from Eddie ’s Attic , a top venue in Atlanta .
He told me , “ Come play Eddie ’s Attic any time you ’d like .
Just come in . ”
So I would just do that .
Interesting !
Good answer .
So just by being out and about at Folk Alliance , you meet people that would book you in Atlanta .
Let ’s pick somewhere else .
How about Billings , Montana ?
Yeah .
Let ’s do Billings , Montana .
I would start online , searching “ Billings Montana concerts ” or “ music ” .
It will come up with venues , newspapers , or people ’s MySpace pages with listings .
I ’d find a venue that ’s a good fit and that makes sense first .
Then I ’d first contact the venue by email , so that I can write a better introduction .
Then it ’s important to ask for a specific date !
I learned this when I was booking gigs in Reno for others .
A lot of people would write and say , “ Oh I ’d love to play in Reno .
When would be good ? ”
But you ca n’t do that .
Instead just pick a day , like , “ April 27th or April 28th I ’m available . ”
Because then people can look at their calendar and say , “ Oh yeah .
I do have that day . ” or , “ I do n’t have that day - but the 29th would work . ”
That ’s a huge thing .
You do n’t want to leave it open .
You want to tell them specifically what day you want to be there .
So a booker says , “ OK .
I can fit you in on Tuesday March 15th . ”
Would you take it if they gave you a Tuesday night or would you say , “ Hell no , I want Friday ! ”
It all depends .
If you deserve a Friday then you should ask for a Friday and if you deserve a Tuesday then you should take the Tuesday .
You know ?
Ideally , yeah , everybody wants to play on Thursday through Saturday nights .
Especially if you ’re new to an area , you should n’t be too picky , but you should n’t be a pushover either .
But if you can do a Tuesday and you think it ’ll work then do a Tuesday .
Then how do you bring people to the show ?
Usually venues will have a media list that you can use .
Especially for a town like Billings , Montana .
They probably will respond to a touring artist .
More so than New York City , for example , because there ’s just so many musicians .
I ’ll write up a press release , then email it to the radio stations and the print people .
You can write one press release for a whole tour , just changing the little bit of it that has the specific contact information .
Getting some excitement , putting posters out , contacting people , doing media and stuff like that .
Let them know that you ’re doing a show and then practice for the show to make sure that you ’re going to give them something that ’s really good that ’s worth the excitement that you ’re stirring up .
You ’ve always found a great advantage in smaller towns , whether Reno or Europe .
Doing smaller towns is really good , especially when you ’re starting .
I do the same thing in Europe where I ’ll go to , say , Eastern France and it ’s the best show .
It ’s even better than doing London or Paris because it ’s places like this where people are really responding .
The newspapers are really excited about having somebody out there .
It ’s great to get into the small places .
Do n’t just do the obvious cities .

Now on Facebook too , oh boy ! ---
When you write an email , you do n’t want to brag , at all .
It comes off bad .
But you do want to show them that you ’re putting a lot of effort into it , and want them to know a little clue of what you ’ve done .
So having it in your email signature is a really good way of doing it .
That way , you do n’t have to say , “ Oh and by the way I won this contest and I just opened for this person . ”
You do n’t want to have to say it , but you want them see it .
So the email signature is a great tool for that .
My email signature has all my upcoming shows , contact information , and a couple quotes .
Right now I have a quote from NPR and an international songwriting contest .
I ’ve had bookers contact me back and say , “ Oh wow - I see that you ’re opening for Loudon Wainwright , ” or “ I see that you just got played on NPR , ” or “ I see you ’ll be at South by Southwest . ”
I ’ve had bookers say that that was the reason that they wrote back , was because they saw that .
They ’re getting tons of emails and need to just be able to quickly see if they ’re interested in checking it out .
TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
Now that you ’ve done over a thousand shows , is there any difference now between that initial apprach you took , and what you ’re doing now ?
Or is it just lots and lots of that ?
That ’s a good question .
It is just continuing doing that .
But bookers can can see my history and that I ’ve done it for five years .
That is n’t really that long , but when people are consistently moving toward something for an extended period of time , it moves more from just excitement for something new , to something where people know that they ’re doing it for real .
It ’s become more of an identity .
I ’m not new , I do n’t feel new at this anymore .
I ’ve played at least a thousand shows .
Because I return to many of the same venues I ’ve played at before , I do n’t need to put a lot of effort or time into booking anymore .
New places also contact me to play .
If I ’m doing opening shows for people , they ’ll be asking me or I ’ll ask them .
It feels more grounded now - more established - like there ’s a foundation to it .
So it does n’t take as much effort .
How are you able to make a living doing this ?
How much do you make for an average gig ?
I usually get about $ 250 to $ 300 for a smaller solo show where I can bring some people out .
Not a particularly crazy night .
If I do house concerts or something private , I ’ll get between $ 600 and $ 1200 .
If I ’m overseas it ’s different because of the exchange rate .
I make a little bit more there because the dollar is worth less .
I ’ll take $ 0 if I ’m doing an opening spot for somebody I really want to open for .
Usually they ’ll pay at least $ 50 to $ 250 .
But if there ’s something where I ’ll be getting great promotion or the opportunity to open for my hero , I would probably pay to do it !
But really , most of the money comes from CD sales .
The only way that I ’m able to tour is because of CD sales .
How do you turn this from a few gigs into being a full - time touring musician ?
If you put enough effort out - and you ’re contacting enough people about it - and people like your music - then they ’re going to respond .
You ’ll have some response and it ’ll build .
If you ’re constantly building on what you ’ve previously done , it ’s going to work .
It ’s important to not have a backup plan .
If you want to be touring , you should not have a job .
Make it work .
Any time you have a backup plan , you can always fall back on it .
If you really decide you want to do something , you should do it .
People surprise themselves when they have to make something work .
Being fearless and creative with how everything ’s being done .
At least if you just want to be touring and supporting yourself with it I think you can , I think anybody can do it , really .

Craigslist made a splash last month when it announced a set of policy changes aimed at stamping out sex crimes facilitated through the Erotic Services section of its site .
But sex workers and legal experts say the measures are likely to have scant impact on the shadowy world of online prostitution .
Following the initial report about the new policies , a reader who identified herself as a " working girl in San Francisco " told InternetNews.com that Craigslist is hardly the only game in town .
" Because of the new procedure on Craigslist , we are turning to other Web sites ... to promote our services , " she wrote in an e-mail .
" These sites are free and just as effective .
I do n't believe that this change in Craigslist will do anything to affect the industry . "
The reader declined to be interviewed further for this report , but people on both sides of the war on prostitution agree that the multiplicity of adult - oriented sites on the Internet has made the policeman 's work considerably more complicated .
" It 's really just a function of today 's digital economy , " said Alexander Southwell , an attorney with the law firm Gibson , Dunn and Crutcher and a former federal prosecutor .
" The Internet 's ability to make illicit services available is really groundbreaking . "
" It 's a question of convenience , " Southwell told InternetNews.com .
" It used to be for prostitution you would have to go to some shady corner of town at night .
Now you can do it on the Internet . "
In partnership with more than three dozen states ' attorneys general , Craigslist recently began requiring advertisers to provide a working phone number before posting an ad to the erotic services section .
It also started charging a $ 5 dollar fee , which entails credit card verification , for the erotic ads that users had previously been able to post for free .
The effort follows previous initiatives between state law enforcement agencies and social networking communities MySpace and Facebook to expel sexual predators from those sites .
Craigslist pledged to coordinate with law enforcement officials from the participating states , and has filed a series of lawsuits against companies it believes are providing software to enable people to evade its usage policies .
But Craigslist is just the tip of the iceberg , according to Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal , who spearheaded the initiative .
" If you take the sex trade internationally , or even nationally , Craigslist is a pretty small part of it , " Blumenthal told InternetNews.com .
" We 're beginning with Craigslist because it 's the biggest and one of the most apparent -- and frankly , one of the more cooperative .
They 've been cooperative from the early stages of our investigation . "
That investigation , which in addition to prostitution is probing other crimes such as child exploitation and human trafficking , began early this year .
" We 're reviewing other sites , and we 're beginning a dialogue with them , " Blumenthal added .
" My hope is that others will [ cooperate ] as well . "
As part of its effort to purge illicit sex ads , Craigslist is deploying software and filtering tools to remove ads with pornographic content from the erotic services section .
Craigslist did not respond to a request for comment for this story , but Blumenthal noted that that effort is still in its early stages .
In addition to the pornographic images of men and women that can still be found in the section , it also contains ads with warnings about the new enforcement policies and links to other adult - oriented sites .
Reliable statistics on the scope of the industry -- particularly the online segment -- are difficult to come by .
Blumenthal admitted that there is " no way of determining " the extent of the online sex trade .

The Internet changes everything
OTTAWA–Canada stood alone before a United Nations human rights council yesterday , the only one among 47 nations to oppose a motion condemning the Israeli military offensive in Gaza .
The vote before the Geneva - based body shows the Stephen Harper government has abandoned a more even - handed approach to the Middle East in favour of unalloyed support of Israel , according to some long - time observers .
Thirty - three countries voted for the strongly worded motion , which called for an investigation into " grave " human rights violations by Israeli forces , while 13 nations , mostly European , abstained .
The United States , regarded as Israel 's greatest ally , is not a member of the council .
Marius Grinius , Canada 's representative on the council , said the language of the motion , which accused Israel of sparking a humanitarian crisis , was " unnecessary , unhelpful and inflammatory . "
He said the text failed to " clearly recognize " that Hamas rocket attacks on Israel triggered the crisis .
But observers say Ottawa 's unwavering support of Israel in the current conflict – highlighted by yesterday 's vote – is a break from more neutral positions of the past .
Paul Heinbecker , a former Canadian ambassador to the UN , said that , although Canada was always considered " a friend of Israel , " until recently Ottawa 's representatives at the UN voted on Middle East issues on the basis of " principle " and " fair - mindedness . "
Of Canada 's current approach , he said , " It 's not a middle - of - the - road position .
It is a frankly supportive position of Israel . "
He said internationally Canada is increasingly seen as being on the American - Israeli side on these issues .
But assessing yesterday 's vote at the UN 's human rights council , Heinbecker pointed out " the resolution is unbalanced " in its repeated condemnations of Israel .
Along with Arab states , countries backing the resolution included Russia , China and Brazil .
Among those abstaining were Britain , France , Japan and South Korea .
The council itself has faced accusations it is biased against Israel .
The U.S. , arguing the council 's credibility has been undermined , has declined to be a member .
However , in this conflict , Heinbecker said the Canadian government has " not tried itself to introduce a lot of balance into its position " on the fighting in Gaza .
" There are now 900 - plus ( Palestinian ) deaths , a large number of whom are civilian , who are the predictable victims of a military campaign in a densely populated space where the people can't flee because the borders are closed , " he said .
Thirteen Israelis have been killed .
Given Canada 's past actions to expand protection of civilians in conflict zones , he would have expected Ottawa to put more stress on the " urgent " need for a ceasefire and a demand that both sides in Gaza respect international protections for non-combatants , Heinbecker said .
Harper made clear his strong support for Israel just months after he took office in 2006 .
That summer , he defended Israel 's military incursion into Lebanon with a controversial comment that it was a " measured " response .
NDP MP Paul Dewar ( Ottawa Centre ) criticized Ottawa 's " muted " reaction to this latest offensive .
He said Canada should be taking a " robust " role to deliver aid to civilians and monitor any ceasefire .

Instead , he said Canada is sitting on the " sideline , " suggesting a pro-Israel viewpoint by the Conservative government was the reason for lack of outcry from Ottawa .
The Canadian Islamic Congress yesterday called on the federal government to act as a peace broker and " lead the world as it used to .
" It 's not time that we speak on who is right and who is wrong .
I think it is time that innocent people in Gaza and Israel be protected , " Zijad Delic , the congress 's national executive director of the congress said .
" I worry that Canada did not take a fair approach , " he said .
The government 's vote won praise from B'nai Brith Canada , which commended Harper for Ottawa 's " principled stand . "
Frank Dimant , the group 's executive vice - president , called the motion " perverse " for failing to mention Hamas and its " pivotal " role in provoking the conflict .
Last night , the foreign affairs department said Canada had opposed a " deeply flawed " resolution .
" The resolution wholly failed to acknowledge Hamas 's continual rocket attacks on Israel that brought about the current crisis , and ignored a state 's legitimate right to self - defence , " a spokesperson said in an email .
" Canada remains deeply concerned about the ongoing hostilities ... and encourages all diplomatic efforts to achieve an immediate , sustainable and durable ceasefire .
But first and foremost , Hamas 's rocket attacks must stop so that a ceasefire can be realized . "

problems with Control .
Applicative
I really like the ideas behind Control .
Applicative , but find it troublesome to use in practice .
mainly , the minimalist choice of what to make class methods makes it very difficult to use for various applications .
an example that is bugging me right now is that it is the _perfect_ fit for my frisby parser generator , however , I am unable to use it because the primitives ' pure ' and ' fmap ' and ' <*>' which Control .
Applicative is built on are not suitable low level primitives in practice ( despite being sufficient in theory ) .
The basic issue is that frisby relys on optimizing the parser before executing it , so any static information that can be gleaned from the built parser is very important to have available .
however , the optimizer has no way to " see through " an ' fmap ' since the functional argument is opaque as far as frisby is concerned .
the rub is plain old fmap is almost never used , but all the useful things Control .
Applicative provides are : in particular : ( <$ ) :: Functor f => a -> f b -> f a (*> ) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b ( <* ) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a optional :: Alternative f => f a -> f ( Maybe a ) some :: Alternative f => f a -> f [ a ] many :: Alternative f => f a -> f [ a ] ( along with pure ) are sufficient to encode pretty much every reasonable parser , and all of them have a special internal representation independent of ' fmap ' it is rather disapointing that I can't make use of this library as it is in ghc when it is such a good fit for the application .
Perhaps in the next revision we can move these ( or a suitable subset ) functions into the class ?
note I do n't really consider RULES appropriate here , knowing that the optimizer will be able to see through these operations is vital for writing a parser that works at all .
I would also like to see mapM_ as part of the class definition for traversable .
For many monads it makes the difference between linear and constant space usage and space behavior of haskell programs is hard enough to reason about without having to worry about certain rules firing .
Also , relying on rules means not being able to use polymorphic combinators built upon these primitives without taking special steps to ensure the rules can still fire .
I really like the ideas behind Applicative , Traversable , and Foldable .
but I feel these issues will unecesarrily hurt their utility .

At least 40 people were killed and 55 injured when Israeli artillery shells landed outside a United Nations - run school in Gaza , UN officials have said .
A number of children were among those who died when the al - Fakhura school in the Jabaliya refugee camp was hit , doctors at nearby hospitals said .
Israel said its soldiers had come under fire from militants inside the school .
Earlier , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) warned of a " full - blown humanitarian crisis " in Gaza .
Speaking on the 11th day of the Israeli assault , a senior ICRC official , Pierre Kraehenbuhl , said life in Gaza had become intolerable .
Palestinian health ministry officials say 595 people have been killed since the attacks began , 195 of them children .
Mr Kraehenbuhl said much more needed to be done to protect civilians .
GAZA CRISIS BACKGROUND
Profile : Gaza Strip Who are Hamas ?
Middle East conflict : History in maps
The UN Security Council is set to resume debate on a ceasefire call in New York , with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , several Arab foreign ministers , UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice among those attending .
At least 125 Palestinians and five Israeli soldiers were killed on Tuesday .
One soldier was killed in an exchange of fire with militants in Gaza City , while four others were killed by shellfire from their own tanks earlier in the day , Israeli military officials said .
Israel says its offensive is stopping militants firing rockets , but at least five hit southern Israel on Tuesday , with one reaching the town of Gedera , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) from Gaza , and injuring a baby .
Four Israeli civilians have been killed by rocket fire from the Gaza Strip since the offensive began .
In other developments : Israeli forces push further south in the Gaza Strip and clash with militants near Gaza City
Skirmishes are reported on the edges of the Deir al - Balah and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza
Witnesses say Israeli tanks and soldiers are advancing on the southern town of Khan Younis
Venezuela orders the expulsion of Israel 's ambassador in protest at the offensive and its " flagrant violations of international law " Many claims cannot be verified .
Israel is refusing to let international journalists into Gaza , despite a Supreme Court ruling to allow a limited number of reporters to enter the territory .
' Mortar fire '
The UN aid agency in Gaza , Unrwa , said three artillery shells had landed close to the al - Fakhura school on Tuesday afternoon , spraying shrapnel on people both inside and outside the building .
Gaza offensive - in maps Gaza humanitarian crisis deepens

About 350 people had sought refuge at the school in an effort to escape the fighting between Israeli soldiers and militants on the outskirts of the Jabaliya refugee camp , to the east of Gaza City .
Television footage showed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood .
The UN officials said they regularly provided the Israeli military with exact co-ordinates of their facilities , and that the school was in a built - up area .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said he was " deeply dismayed " that despite these efforts , three UN - run schools had been hit by nearby Israeli strikes .
The Israeli military said that , according to initial checks , its soldiers had come under mortar fire from militants inside the al - Fakhura school .
" The force responded with mortars at the source of fire , " it said in a statement .
" Hamas cynically uses civilians as human shields . "
It later reported that two well - known members of a Hamas rocket - launching cell had been among those killed at the school , naming them as Imad and Hassan Abu Askar .

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said the incident was a " very extreme example of how Hamas operates " .
" If you take over - I presume with guns - a UN facility .
If you hold the people there as hostages , you shoot out of that facility at Israeli soldiers in the neighbourhood , then you receive incoming fire - I think that 's a war crime under international law , " he told the BBC .
A Hamas spokesman , Fauzi Barhoun , said allegations that fighters had used the school to attack Israeli forces were " baseless " .
" There was no fire of any kind from the school , " he told the BBC .
Two unnamed residents who spoke to an Associated Press reporter by phone said a group of militants had been firing mortar shells from near the school .
Earlier in the day , at least three Palestinians were killed when another school was hit in the Shati camp , UN officials said .

Ten people were also injured at a UN health centre in the Bureij refugee camp .
Maxwell Gaylard , the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for the Palestinian territories , described the incidents as tragic and demanded an independent investigation .
The director of operations for Unrwa , John Ging , told the BBC that conditions in Gaza were " horrific " and that nowhere was safe for civilians there .
Mr Ging said international leaders had a responsibility to act to protect civilians , some 14,000 of whom are sheltering in UN buildings .
' Immediate ceasefire ' Diplomatic efforts to try to end the violence are gathering pace .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he had asked his Syrian counterpart , Bashar Assad , to help convince Hamas to co-operate with efforts to end the Israeli offensive .
Syria is regarded as a main backer of Hamas .
The loss of civilian life in Gaza and Israel is a source of deep concern for me
US President - elect Barack Obama
Asked about the deaths at the UN school in Gaza , Mr Sarkozy said : " It reinforces my determination for all this to stop as quickly as possible . "
He later held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Sharm el - Sheikh , who offered to hold talks with Israel and the Palestinians on border security without delay .
US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said the US would like to see " an immediate ceasefire " in Gaza .
US President - elect Barack Obama , meanwhile , broke his silence about the conflict , telling reporters that " the loss of civilian life in Gaza and Israel is a source of deep concern for me " .
However , he also reiterated his principle that only President George W Bush would speak for US foreign policy at this time .
The BBC's Laura Trevelyan in New York says the contours of an agreement are taking shape - international monitors along the Egypt - Gaza border to stop Hamas smuggling weapons and firing rockets at Israel , and the creation of a humanitarian corridor in southern Gaza to ensure that aid reaches the Palestinians .
The question now is whether Hamas will accept such a deal and if a call for a ceasefire will be heeded by Israel , our correspondent says .
Hamas has said that Israeli attacks on Gaza must stop and the crossings into the territory , which Israel controls , must be fully opened , before it agrees to a ceasefire .
Israeli Prime Miniser Ehud Olmert said on Tuesday that the military campaign in Gaza would continue until Israel had completely wiped out Hamas 's ability to fire rockets into Israel .
Update :
In February 2009 , the United Nations said that a clerical error had led it to report that Israeli mortars had struck a UN - run school in Jabaliya , Gaza , on 6 January killing about 40 people .
Maxwell Gaylord , the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Jerusalem , said that the Israeli Defense Force mortars fell in the street near the compound , and not on the compound itself .
He said that the UN " would like to clarify that the shelling and all of the fatalities took place outside and not inside the school " .

In early email systems , several email formats were tried .
Only one survived , though , and that 's the familiar username@entity .
TLD ( with TLD being the top - level domain such as .com , .org , .net , and .gov ) format used today .
The maximum length of an email address based on this format is 254 characters , although that was n't always the case .
Character Limitations in an Email Address
Every email address consists of two parts .
The username comes before the @ sign , and the domain name follows it .
In " person@company.com , " the username is " person " and the domain name is " company.com . "
The total length of an email address in the original standard was 320 characters .
The standard limited the username to 64 characters and the domain name to 255 characters .
( If you 're doing the math , that adds up to 319 .
The final character is the @ symbol in between . )
This 320 - character limit is different from the 254 figure because the current standard limits the total length of an email address to 256 characters , including punctuation .
Some addresses , however , use angle brackets ( <> ) , which take up two characters , leaving the maximum number of characters used in an email address at 254 .
So , when creating a new email address , limit your username to 64 or fewer characters , and the total number of characters to 254 .
Just remember that the shorter the email address is , the easier it is for people to remember .

The perils of the internet do not cease during the Holidays , of course .
The ruses just get more focused .
Most are familiar with the traditional e-mail scam : an unsolicited message is received from an unknown person in a foreign land requesting financial assistance with the promise of a large financial reward .
Following the instructions , victims of the so - called " Advance - fee fraud " ( aka the Nigerian E- mail scheme ) send money overseas with little hope of seing any return .
According to legend , the e-mail scheme business is a major industry in Lagos , where internet cafes cater to scammers working on prying the cash out from overseas .
The ideas of the scams have been numerous , if not silly , at times using false airline tickets , diplomas , and even the forged signature of the Nigerian president .
Evidently , as we at the New Madrid discovered , the scam artists began targeting Christmas Tree vendors during these holidays .
One of our contributors - who at times has operated a Christmas Tree farm ( really ) - received a slew of grammatically - flawed sales inquiries at his business address from a number of email addresses , each asking for an order of trees to be sent overseas .
The scam comes in when the " purchaser " demands a certain shipping agent ( of course , a fake one ) be used and paid in advance by the tree vendor , as we discovered in the following correspondence .
In this case , however , something beautiful blossomed from our correspondence with the scammers : true love , the ultimate Christmas gift .
Please enjoy the following exchanges .
We responded in turn as an " independent Christmas Tree consultant " for the below correspondence .
It is long in length , but a quick read that is entirely worth your time .
The correspondence from the scammers is entirely unedited .

It ’s not joyous , I can guarantee you that , to get yelled at by a fat woman every day about a tree putting bugs in her house .
But anyway , I am confused , because you introduced yourself as " Weezy Salah , " but you signed your email Reverend Chris .
Interestingly , I have already been in correspondence with another customer named Reverend Chris .
I wonder if your email mixed with his and I got the confusing signature !

Subject : Quote needed for Christmas Tree Shipments - Attn MR. DOYLE TODD
Hello ,
I am contacting the International Gali and Express Shipping company , particularly trying to reach MR .
DOYLE TODD at the behest of my friend WEEZY SALAH of the Alihatu Osu orphanage in Accra , Ghana .
Weezy and I have worked out a deal in which he is buying 40 trees for 55 dollars apiece from my Christmas Tree Wholesaling Company , which is called the Lusy Dupree 's Trees ( after my wife , Lusy , who died some years back … my condolences , my condolences ) .
I am an independent Christmas Tree Consultant , you see .
Christmas
Trees are my business and Weezy and I worked out this deal for the Christmas trees , okay ?
Look , I told him I would have given him a better discount if he told me it was for an orphanage , but sometimes I doubt Weezy 's business savvy , you know what I mean ?
I mean , if you have something under your belt , like you run a goddamn orphanage and you can put it up in a vendor 's face , you do it , you know ?
You 'll get a goddamn discount with information like that - any goddamn vendor in his right mind will give a goddamn AFRICAN orphanage a discount .
It ’s common sense , especially during the Christmas season .
People are extra gullible during the Christmas season , you know what I mean ?
Look , you are a businessman like me , and I am not sure how well you know Weezy , but he is just naive sometimes .
I know , orphanages are n't a business .
That 's what my second wife told me last night .
( Her name is Janet . )
She said , " Go easy on Weezy , he is not a businessman like you , " and I said to her , “ well I ca n’t adjust my practices just because someone is n't a businessman .
If I did , could I even call myself a businessman ? ”
Whatever .
Listen , Doyle , I need to get these trees to this address :
Alihatu Osu orphanage
897 osu Road 4t
Accra-Ghana
00233 .
You can pick the trees up at :
1088 S. Main St .
Lot 2
Hazard , KY 41702
It ’s a parking lot , as used by most standard tree vendors .
The weight of the 40 trees has to be about 1.3 tons .
I asked Jared ( MY SON ) to guess the weight the best he could and that 's what he guessed .
He is a good weight guesser — he used to do it at the County Fair to make extra spending money — so I trust him .
They will be wrapped the best I can , but I am going to be honest with you , Doyle , I have never shipped trees to Africa before .
I figured there would be some sort of problem with customs , but that is for you and Weezy to deal with .
He told me you were the best , and I expect that he is right .
I trust Weezy ; I have known him a while , so I trust you by extension .
Anyway , Doyle , get me that quote ASAP , buddy .
Appreciate it .
You be good , now .
In Him ,

Mariam ,
No offense , but I was told to deal with Doyle Todd .
Who exactly are you , and where is Mr. Todd ?
My understanding is he has a personal relationship with my client , Weezy Salah .
Please put me in touch with Mr. Todd for the quote .

WEEZY ,
Listen , I think we have a problem .
I contacted the shipping company you recommended , and asked for Mr. Todd .
Unfortunately , I heard from some jackass named Mariam .
And , to be quite honest , she was a bit rude and I do n’t know if I trust her .
I am not sure if my message was intercepted by pirates OR WHAT , but I would prefer to do business with your friend , MR .
DOYLE TODD .
Where is he ?
Have you heard from him ?
Do you know this so - called Mariam ?
On the other hand , Mariam gave me a quote of $ 650 , which seems pretty good to me .
Do you think that is a good deal ?
I have contacted some other shipping companies about how much they would charge .
What do you think ?

Well , that is good news ( Mariam is real ! ) but there is BETTER news .
The BETTER news is that I got a better quote on shipping from my friends at Global Tree Container Solutions !
Mariam said $ 650 , but that is so high !
Global Tree Container Solutions will ship all of the trees for just $ 400 !!!!
That will save you money .
How exciting !
So I will use Global Tree Container Solutions to ship the trees to you .
Also , do you know Mariam ?
Will you tell her that I am sorry for calling her a " jackass ? "
Thanks .

Weezy ,
I do n’t understand — I got a quote from global container solutions for $ 400 and you want to pay $ 250 more to ship the trees ???
Weezy , this is something I need to talk to you about .
Mariam and I were both talking , and we think you are not necessarily — and please do n’t be offended — the best or perhaps most fiscally - minded businessman in the world .
First , you did not ask for a discount even though the trees are for an orphanage !
What ’s up with that ?
It ’s common sense to use the charity angle for a discount , but you left that arrow in your quiver .
Inexplicable .
Incident Number
Two is this whole shipping conundrum .
Now , you need to level with me .
It does n't make business or fiscal sense — and , mind you , I am a businessman — to use Mariam 's shipping company .
As you can see from the statement I attached below , Global Container solutions gave me a BETTER QUOTE ! 250 dollars cheaper .
You have to explain to me why you want to use Gali Shipping .
Please .
and be honest , because we are old friends .
I think I know what the reason is , anyway .
You know I love you , Weezy , and I do n’t want to see you hurt , but throwing business to Mariam is n’t going to make her love you unless there is already something there .
Let me just ask you straight out :
Are you using Mariam 's shipping because you have a secret crush ?
Is somebody crushing ?
Is it Weezy ?
I thought so , lil ' Weezy .
I thought so .
But just tell me .
We are friends , but we have to establish that bond of honesty again , about everything .
Just tell me you love Mariam , and GREAT !
It ’ll be wonderful .
Heck , if you are willing to throw 250 bucks away on your love of Mariam , maybe I can too .
Just let me know .
As soon as you can .
Christmas is getting closer .
Your best friend ,
Larry D .

Weezy ,
Since you refuse to tell me that you love Mariam , I am taking your discount away .
I am sorry , but it ’s within my rights as a businessman .
That brings your total up to $ 1,350 .
Also , I am adding a $ 1,000 consultancy fee to your original total because I have had to write several emails for this transaction , and I do n’t think you understand that I live in a trailer with no internet .
I have to literally power this computer by burning vegetable oil in an engine my niece Jared set up .
It ’s very smelly and time - consuming , and all you can do is throw money out the window , which DOES NOT MAKE SENSE for an orphanage to do .
With the $ 250 you are throwing away on your flirtations with surreptitious and unrequited love for Mariam , you could be buying wagon tongues and clothing sets for your orphans .
What is wrong with you ?
Can I have the phone number of the orphanage director ?
Are you the orphanage director ?
Also , I need to let you know that we ONLY accept Diner 's Club credit cards .
Is that okay ?
Do you have a Diner 's Club card ?
They are supposedly international , so you should .
You can apply here :

You may be wondering how I found this out .
Well , I will have you know I am a pretty good detective in my own right .
I watch CSI ( NY AND MIAMI ) and NCIS and Cold Case , like all the time .
I told Weezy that I had gotten a lower shipping quote from another company — WHICH I DID — and he insisted that I use your company .
I asked him why he wanted to use your company and spend MORE MONEY and this is what he wrote :

Weezy ,
I hear what you are saying .
Just think about this :
If you 're down , and confused
And you do n't remember who you 're talkin' to
Concentration slips away
' Cause your baby is so far away
Well there 's a rose , in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love , honey
Love the one you 're with
Do n't be angry , do n't be sad
Do n't sit cryin ' , talkin ' ' bout the good times you had
Well there 's a girl , sittin ' right next to you
And she 's just waiting for something to do
Well there 's a rose , in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love , honey
Love the one you 're with
Turn your heartache right into joy
She 's a girl , and you 're a boy
So why do n't you get it together , make it nice
You ain't gonna need any more advice
And there 's a rose , in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
Sometimes you can't be with the one you love , honey
Love the one you 're with
A little wisdom from the gods .
You feeling that ?
Do you have a Diner 's Club card OR NOT ?
I do not accept Visa or MasterCard , just Diner 's Club .
I told you that a long time ago and you do n't listen .
I am going to tell Mariam you called her " old " if you are n’t careful .

Look , honestly , Weezy , it would make me feel good .
I have really been down in the dumps and depressed lately .
I lost my job and my step - cousin Jared came down with shingles and I do n’t even have the money to pay for his shingles medication and the government is saying they are going to put him in an orphanage with no Christmas trees AND WOULDNT THAT BE AWFUL .
I really just want to know that I made a difference in someone 's life , especially if I ca n’t help Jared .

So just send me the email of your love confession .

Noting the war crimes now known and admitted to by George Bush and Dick Cheney , George Washington University 's highly - respected constitutional law professor Jonathon Turley asked MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann last week : " If someone commits a crime and everyone 's around to see it and does nothing , is it still a crime ? "
The discussion came in the wake of a new bipartisan US Senate report ( pdf ) that found that Bush was responsible for approving torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and Cheney 's admission during an ABC interview that he helped to approve torture and abuse in interrogations .
During the interview , Turley mentioned that it 'll be up to the citizens whether or not any action is actually taken to prosecute those who committed these crimes .
" It will ultimately depend on citizens , and whether they will remain silent in the face of a crime that 's been committed in plain view , " Turley suggested .
" It is equally immoral to stand silent in the face of a war crime and do nothing , and that is what the citizens are doing . "
But is there any real basis for his well - meaning argument that accountability could possibly be brought by popular demand ?
Unfortunately , as the media has been virtually silent about what may be the most offensive crimes ever committed by an executive branch in the US ( just as silent as they were during the lead - up and follow - through of the Iraq war , when those same officials sent our nation into war on the basis of demonstrable lies ) , it 's bloody unlikely that most citizens will even learn about these scandals , much less take action on them .
And if they did , who would bother to report it ?
As Turley said : " There 's this gigantic yawn as we hear about a war crime on national television being discussed matter - of - factly by the vice - president . "
But how much can citizens actually do , particularly with the sparse amount of information they 've been presented ?
They hit the streets to protest by the millions , prior to and during the Iraq war , and the bulk of the media did n't bother to even cover it .
I 'm currently driving through Oklahoma ( passenger seat ) as I write this .
Republicanist Sean Hannity is yammering away , misinforming listeners on the radio , and a station promo just announced he 'll be followed by Michael Savage for three hours , then Laura Ingraham for three hours , then John Gibson for three hours .
Rightwing nuts all .
I 'm guessing Rush Limbaugh was on before Hannity .
So , in those 15 consecutive hours of rightwing talk – on our publicly owned airwaves – who exactly will be informing citizens of the documented evidence of war crimes committed by Bush and Cheney ?
Yes , if the citizens began throwing shoes everywhere by the millions , someone in the corporate mainstream media might cover it somewhere .
But without the daily barrage of a real media , covering the topics that actually matter , with the attention they deserve , the citizens are often clueless , and otherwise virtually powerless , in this wingnut - fed media world we 've allowed to be created around us .
If you doubt any of that , just ask yourselves what we'd be listening to on talk radio , and thus watching on the cable news network , and thus see debated on the floor of Congress , had a bipartisan panel found that President Bill Clinton had approved war crimes that hastened the deaths of thousands of US troops , just before vice - president Al Gore went on ABC News to admit it , and even crow about it .
You suppose that coverage might help inspire a citizen uprising in that case ?
You bet .
But it is , for the moment , a wingnut world .
We just live in it .
Do Americans simply not care about war crimes ?
Of course they do .
But not unless they know about them , and not unless the argument that they occurred , and the evidence of it , is presented in the detail that such an issue merits .
While a small number of outraged citizens who take action actually can make enormous differences on the local level , accountability for international war crimes requires an untiring , responsible , focused media to inspire the mobilisation of a nation .
Such as it is , these crimes were committed by Republicans , and did n't overtly involve sex , so they do n't actually matter .
Arguably , as Turley noted , none of it even happened at all .
" I think that 's really the argument of this administration : ' It ca n't be a crime because no one 's prosecuted us for it . ' "
It 's good to be king .

slimv.vim : Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Vim ( ' SLIME for Vim ' )
script karma Rating 955/271 , Downloaded by 15815 Comments , bugs , improvements Vim wiki created by Tamas Kovacs script type utility description Slimv is a SWANK client for Vim , similarly to SLIME for Emacs .
SWANK is a TCP server for Emacs , which runs a Common Lisp , Clojure or Scheme REPL and provides a socket interface for evaluating , compiling , debugging , profiling lisp code .
The SWANK server is embedded in Slimv , but you can also use your own SWANK installation .
Slimv opens the lisp REPL ( Read - Eval - Print Loop ) inside a Vim buffer .
Lisp commands may be entered and executed in the REPL buffer , just as in a regular REPL .
Slimv supports SLIME 's debugger , inspector , profiler , cross reference , arglist , indentation , symbol name completion functions .
The script also has a Common Lisp Hyperspec lookup feature and it is able to lookup symbols in the Clojure API , as well as in JavaDoc .
Slimv comes with Paredit Mode , which is similar to the functionality of paredit.el in Emacs .
Paredit Mode tries to maintain the balanced state of matched characters ( parenthesis marks , square and curly braces , double quotes ) .
Matched characters are inserted and removed in pairs , also when working with a block of text ( well , mostly ) .
Slimv also implements many paredit.el s-expression handling functions , like Split / Join / Wrap / Splice / Raise .
Slurpage and Barfage known from Emacs is also possible but in a different fashion : you do n't move the list element in or out of the list , rather you move the opening or closing parenthesis over the element or sub-list .
Please visit the Slimv Tutorial for a more complete introduction :

Slimv works on Windows , Linux and Mac OS X ( via Terminal.app ) , Cygwin is supported .
The script requires the following programs installed on your system :
* Vim with Python feature enabled
* Python ( must be the same Python version that was Vim compiled against )
* Lisp ( any Common Lisp with SLIME support ) or Clojure or MIT Scheme ( Linux only )
Vim's Python version can be identified with the :ver command , look for the - DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL= \" pythonXX \ " string ( if you have it ) .
Another way of determining Vim's Python version :
: python import sys ; print(sys.version )
Slimv tries to autodetect your Lisp / Clojure / Slime installation directories .
If it fails to determine the correct directories , then you need to enter the command to start the SWANK server into your vimrc file .
Linux example :
let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '!
xterm -e sbcl -- load /usr / share / common-lisp / source/slime/start-swank.lisp &'
Windows example :
let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '! start " c:/ Program Files / Lisp Cabinet/bin/ccl/wx86cl.exe " - l " c:/Program Files / Lisp Cabinet/ site/lisp/slime/start-swank.lisp " '
Mac OS X example :
let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '! osascript -e " tell application \ " Terminal\ " to do script \ " sbcl -- load ~/.vim/slime/start-swank.lisp\ " " '
For Clojure use the g:slimv_swank_clojure option , e.g. :
let g:slimv_swank_clojure = '!
xterm -e lein swank &'
- For pure text - based console without XTerm
If you only have `SSH` and can not use `XTerm` , you can use `tmux` or `screen` instead .
Linux example with `tmux` :
let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '! tmux new - window -d -n REPL - SBCL " sbcl -- load ~/.vim/bundle/slimv/slime/start-swank.lisp " '
Linux example with `screen` :
let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '!
screen -d -m -t REPL -SBCL sbcl -- load ~/.vim/bundle/slimv/slime/start-swank.lisp '
Mac OS
X example with `tmux` :
let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '! osascript -e " ! tmux new - window -d -n REPL - SBCL " sbcl -- load ~/.vim/bundle/slimv/slime/start-swank.lisp " '

Special Agent in Charge Eric Zahren ( center ) , joined by SpecialAgents Laura Topolski ( left ) and Malcolm D. Wiley Sr. ( right )
Special Agent Malcolm D. Wiley Sr. , a former college - football player , has a winning smileand a handshake that could bend steel .
He ’s been in the U.S. Secret Service for 17 years , part ofthat time directly guarding the President .
How does it feel to go to work knowing that he may haveto take a bullet ?
“ It comes with the job , ” he says crisply .
“ It ’s an honor to protect the President .
End of discussion . ”
Secret Service agents have a job that they must literally be willing to die for .
“ Cops aretrained to retreat when gunfire starts , but the Secret Service has to stand tall and go into thegunfire , ” says James Previtera , a Secret Service agent from 1998 to 2005 who now runs Florida ’sHillsborough County jail system .
Adds Special Agent in Charge Eric Zahren , an 18 - year veteran , “ From day one , you ’re part of a larger mission and operate as part of a team .
It ’s not about you asan individual . ”
With the inauguration of Barack Obama , the nation ’s first African - American President , justover two weeks away , more scrutiny than ever is on the members of the Secret Service –theanonymous , dark - suited men and women who guard his every move .
Obama ’s Secret Service protectionbegan earlier than that for any previous Presidential candidate–in May 2007 , 18 months beforeElection Day–after top government officials expressed fears for his safety .
Since his election , there ’s been speculation that the Secret Service has found a record number of individuals andgroups to be plotting to harm him .
Says Wiley , “ We never comment on how many threats are madeagainst the President . ”
Observers point to extra measures that have been used to protect President - elect Obama , such as the bulletproof glass panels surrounding him during his acceptance speech at Chicago ’sGrant Park on Election Night .
“ Those are not new , nor do they reflect any specific threat to the President - elect ’s safety , ” says Wiley .
“ They are one more tool in the arsenal that we deploy . ”
Agents joke that to want to join the Secret Service , you have to be “ type - A squared . ”
SaysThomas D. Sloan , who served on President Clinton ’s detail and now heads international security atthe New York Stock Exchange , “ Failure is not an option . ”
So how do they prepare ?
I visited the Secret Service ’s James J. Rowley Training Center inBeltsville , Md. , on a warm , sunny morning .
Located 30 minutes outside Washington , D.C. , the centeris tucked away on 500 acres of rolling countryside .

During my days inside the Secret Service , I ’m struck by two things .
Number one is how sharpthe agents are .
They ’re personable and intelligent , but all of them have a glint of steel lurkingjust below the surface .
The other quality is n’t as easy to describe .
It ’s a sense of purpose andmission I feel that permeates everything the Secret Service does and sends a buzz through the air .

“ And we ’re aware of the consequences should we fail , both for the agency andfor the nation . ”

Special Agent in Charge Eric Zahren ( center ) , joined by SpecialAgents Laura Topolski ( left ) and Malcolm D. Wiley Sr. ( right )
Special Agent Malcolm D. Wiley Sr. , a former college - football player , has a winning smileand a handshake that could bend steel .
He ’s been in the U.S. Secret Service for 17 years , part ofthat time directly guarding the President .
How does it feel to go to work knowing that he may haveto take a bullet ?
“ It comes with the job , ” he says crisply .
“ It ’s an honor to protect the President .
End of discussion . ”
Secret Service agents have a job that they must literally be willing to die for .
“ Cops aretrained to retreat when gunfire starts , but the Secret Service has to stand tall and go into thegunfire , ” says James Previtera , a Secret Service agent from 1998 to 2005 who now runs Florida ’sHillsborough County jail system .
Adds Special Agent in Charge Eric Zahren , an 18 - year veteran , “ From day one , you ’re part of a larger mission and operate as part of a team .
It ’s not about you asan individual . ”
With the inauguration of Barack Obama , the nation ’s first African - American President , justover two weeks away , more scrutiny than ever is on the members of the Secret Service –theanonymous , dark - suited men and women who guard his every move .
Obama ’s Secret Service protectionbegan earlier than that for any previous Presidential candidate–in May 2007 , 18 months beforeElection Day–after top government officials expressed fears for his safety .
Since his election , there ’s been speculation that the Secret Service has found a record number of individuals andgroups to be plotting to harm him .
Says Wiley , “ We never comment on how many threats are madeagainst the President . ”
Observers point to extra measures that have been used to protect President - elect Obama , such as the bulletproof glass panels surrounding him during his acceptance speech at Chicago ’sGrant Park on Election Night .
“ Those are not new , nor do they reflect any specific threat to the President - elect ’s safety , ” says Wiley .
“ They are one more tool in the arsenal that we deploy . ”
Agents joke that to want to join the Secret Service , you have to be “ type - A squared . ”
SaysThomas D. Sloan , who served on President Clinton ’s detail and now heads international security atthe New York Stock Exchange , “ Failure is not an option . ”
So how do they prepare ?
I visited the Secret Service ’s James J. Rowley Training Center inBeltsville , Md. , on a warm , sunny morning .
Located 30 minutes outside Washington , D.C. , the centeris tucked away on 500 acres of rolling countryside .

2008 was an amazing year for science fiction novels , with Anathem hitting bestseller lists and critics going crazy over slavery tale Liberation and cyborg fantasy Alchemy of Stone .
We 've got the year 's eleven best books .
Advertisement
Below are eleven of the year 's best science fiction novels , with links to our reviews of them - as well as several interviews we did with the authors .
Now 's the time to catch up on what you missed out on reading last year !
Liberation , by Brian Francis Slattery
Here 's what we said in our review of the novel :
What would the United States look like after the collapse of everything ?
The answer is n't a zombie - strewn wasteland or a sudden revival of punk - rock fashions , but rather something more like a flashback to the mid-19th century .
The frontier spirit , small communities banding together , roaming Indian tribes ... and huge masses of the population living in slavery .
Brian Francis Slattery 's dystopian second novel , Liberation has many brilliant ideas , but its depiction of a 21st century revival of slavery is really what burns it into your memory .

Anathem , by Neal Stephenson
Here 's what we said about Stephenson 's smash hit novel :
The planet Arbre , which is very much like Earth in some ways , differs from our world one major respect .
Its religious and scientific institutions are essentially reversed .
Monks called the avout live ascetic lives studying science in gracious , ancient " maths , " while the so called " saecular " world is populated with Deolators ( god- worshipers ) who are obsessed with religion and technology .
Stephenson 's world - building skills , honed by the exacting work he did on his recent Baroque Cycle trilogy , are at their best here .
Anathem is that rarest of things :
A stately novel of ideas packed with cool tech , terrific fight scenes , aliens , and even a little ESP .

We also interviewed Stephenson about the novel .

Nano Comes to Clifford Falls , by Nancy Kress
A collection of Kress ' short stories from her many years of writing , this book was disturbing , frustrating . . . and memorable .
Here 's what we said about it :
Nancy Kress loves to thwart our expectations about the future .
In her new short story collection Nano Comes to Clifford Falls and Other Stories , she takes stereotypical SF tales of galactic colonization , alien invasion , and nanotech singularities - and slaps them upside the head .
In one story , aliens " invade " Earth by landing a spaceship and just letting it sit in rural Minnesota for centuries ; in another , we see the nanotech singularity from the perspective of people in a small prairie town .
A story ostensibly about exploring a black hole at the center of the galaxy turns out to be about how AI uploads of people actually have better personalities than their originals .

The Alchemy of Stone , by Ekaterina Sedia
We were blown away by Sedia 's stark , beautifully - written portrait of a cyborg caught in the middle of a workers ' revolution .
Here 's what we said in our review :
With a face made of porcelain , a wind - up heart , and a talent for alchemy , Mattie is hardly a typical science fictional robot .
While most novels about robots focus on how these humanoid machines are stronger and smarter than humans , Ekaterina Sedia 's The Alchemy of Stone explores the vulnerability of mechanical beings who depend on humans for repairs and survival . . . [ Sedia 's ] focus on Mattie 's relationship with her creator allows her to grapple with the tiny power struggles inherent in all human relationships - especially those between men and women .

We also interviewed Sedia about the book , and got into a really interesting discussion about robots and women .
Advertisement
Sly Mongoose , by Tobias Buckell
This novel about fighting zombies on a floating habitation bubble hovering over a Venus - like cloud planet is definitely the year 's best action novel - and still manages to be thoughtful .
Here 's what we said about it in our review :
If there 's anything better than a ninja fighting zombies , it 's a ninja with alien - tech - enhanced powers nuking space zombies infected by a plague of collective murderous consciousness .
And I have n't even gotten to the part about floating cities on a Venus - like planet covered in sulfur - specked clouds .
That 's the beauty of Tobias Buckell 's latest novel , Sly Mongoose .
Just when you think the action can't get more insane , it does .
Even better :
Just when you think you 're reading a pure military SF adventure , Buckell gives you a wide - angle shot of the larger political context where the alien smackdown is blowing up , and takes your breath away .

The Night Sessions , by Ken MacLeod
MacLeod is never one to shy away from the big , weird questions , and this novel is no exception .
Here he wonders whether robots might become Protestant terrorists .
In our review of this amazing novel , unfortunately available only in the UK , we said :
Ken MacLeod 's latest novel , The Night Sessions , is about a near - future Earth that 's ruled by atheists who have driven Christians into the closet .
The " Faith Wars " have purged governments in the East and West of their religious leaders , and left in their wake a fairly peaceful world order .
Still , the population is filled with people and sentient robots haunted by memories of the violent " God Squads " who led the anti-religious purges . . .
An intricate murder mystery about Protestant terrorist factions of the future , The Night Sessions is also a strangely moving tale of the emotional bonds between humans and robots .
MacLeod has given us a crisp novel of speculation made achingly realistic by his characters ' believable , messy lives .
Advertisement
Earlier this year , we interviewed MacLeod about why science fiction has gone back to the near future .

Postsingular , by Rudy Rucker
Rucker takes us on another mind - bending , nano - powered ride .
Here 's how we described it :
It 's not much of a spoiler to say that the Singularity happens in Rudy Rucker 's new novel Postsingular , since the title gives that development away .
But what happens after the Singularity will surprise you .
People usually define the Singularity as the moment when artificial intelligences improve themselves to the point where they surpass us , but Rucker 's singularity takes many more forms , and is much more confounding , than that .

Little Brother , by Cory Doctorow
In our feature on how young adult books will save science fiction , we talked about Doctorow 's stunning YA novel that rebooted scifi for teens .
Here 's what we said :
We 're lucky to have both YA literature with science - fictional themes and " regular " science fiction .
There 's no reason we can't have both , and appreciate both for what they are , including the innovation and breadth of concepts that mature science fiction can explore .
But we should especially celebrate the awesome potential of YA SF to revitalize the field , and bring new readers to SF concepts .

Matter , by Iain M. Banks
The latest in Banks ' celebrated Culture Series , Matter is a tale of war and betrayal set inside a giant , artificial habitat made of nested spheres .
Here 's what we said in our review :
Iain M. Banks is the master of narrative zoom and pan : one minute he 'll bring you in very close to a tiny moment in one person 's life as she mourns the death of a brother , and the next you 'll be spinning in deep space staring at a supermassive artificial world created by liquid - breathing aliens , millions of miles long , made of enormous braided tubes .
Which of these minutes matters more ?
In Banks ' new novel Matter , both do - and both are also tragicomically inconsequential .
What always pleases about Banks ' science fiction novels , many of which are set against the backdrop of a pan-galactic , A.I. - centric , socialist - libertarian society called The Culture , is that Banks always delivers substance and spectacle .
You 'll get the ethical questions , the sorrowful depictions of war , and the meditations on social evolution .
But you 'll also get world - shattering explosions , weird - ass aliens , and ancient technologies that are purely there to be fucking cool .

We also talked to Banks about why he likes to blow things up .

Hunger Games , by Suzanne Collins
A young adult novel about a girl warrior in a post - apocalyptic world , Hunger Games delivered the awesome .
Here 's what we said in our review :
Suzanne Collins has written a sharp book about televised death - sports in a post - apocalyptic future .
Her story pits a resourceful young hero against a media machine that does n't just want to watch her die - it also wants to devour every bit of her emotional life .
I 'm sick of " reality TV " parodies , but the Hunger Games goes one better by making the audience the villains .

Multireal , by David Louis Edelman
An amazing hard scifi tale , this is the second in an action - packed series from Edelman .
Here 's what we said in our review :
With so much mass - media science fiction featuring anti-science heroes who battle to stop science from " going too far , " it 's great to read a really smart novel about a hero who 's fighting to save scientific progress from being suppressed .
David Louis Edelman 's Multireal , the second volume in the trilogy that begins with Infoquake , is a welcome cure to the Fringe / Eleventh Hour science - bashing , even though it presents both the pro- and con- arguments about radical progress .
But Multireal is also way more entertaining than the science bashers .
After years of appeals and court battles , an unprecedented case over the federal Clean Water Act will face the Supreme Court on Monday .
Local environmentalists organized against a plan by a gold mine nearby Juneau , Alaska to dump mining waste and rubble into a nearby lake .
While the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council lost the original lawsuit to stop the plan in 2006 , they later won the appeal with the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
[ social_buttons ]
The Supreme Court now must decide whether mines should be prevented from storing their waste in water bodies , as specified in the Clean Water Act.
Alaska issued a permit to the mine allowing it to dump waste in the lake , but environmentalists pointed out the discrepancy .
A ruling in either direction will have vast reprecusions for mining projects across the country .
Another Alaskan mine in Southwest Alaska has been awaiting the completion of this court case to determine what to do with the waste from their copper and gold mining operation .
The state of Alaska has sided with mine owner Coeur Alaska Inc. and helped with the legal effort to undermine the Clean Water Act .
Several members of congress have spoken out in opposition to Alaska ’s position along with tribal and fishing organizations in the region .
National organizations such as EarthJustice and the Sierra Club have also spoken out against the project .
If allowed , millions of tons of mining waste could be dumped in a beautiful mountain lake called Lower Slate Lake .
“ There are other options for mine waste disposal for the Kensington Mine , ” said Russell Heath , director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council back in 2005 .
“ For example , Coeur ’s approved 1997 mine project used a land - based disposal facility instead of dumping the tailings into a lake . ”
The Supreme Court will hear Coeur Alaska Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council tomorrow .
“ We feel confident and optimistic about this appeal , ” said Tom Waldo , Earthjustice attorney representing the environmental groups .
“ We ’re looking at it as an opportunity to have the Supreme Court clarify once and for all that mines cannot dump their tailings into lakes and rivers and streams . ”

FLORHAM PARK , N.J. -- Eric Mangini had the New York Jets in first place a month ago , a special season shaping up for a franchise sorely in need of one .
Four losses in five games dashed the Jets ' Super Bowl hopes with a thud , and cost the coach his job .
Mangini was fired Monday , a day after New York failed to make the playoffs despite an 8 - 3 start and having an NFL - high seven Pro Bowl selections .
" I feel that we let him down and we could have done a better job of making plays , " wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery said .
" It 's tough . "
Behind quarterback Brett Favre , the Jets beat New England and Tennessee on the road in consecutive weeks , raising visions among fans of the team 's first Super Bowl trip since 1969 .
New York controlled its playoff fate while sitting alone atop the AFC East before the late - season free fall .
" I do n't think it was one thing , " owner Woody Johnson said .
" We had to go in a different direction .
There 's nothing specific .
It 's just a call we made .
Hopefully , it 's correct . "
The 37 - year - old Mangini went 23 - 26 in his first head coaching job , and had another year remaining on his contract .
" He did a great job for us for three years and he helped lay a great foundation , " general manager Mike Tannenbaum said .
" We felt , in our judgment , we want to build on that and go in a different direction . "
住所調査が増 加
家出調査とは異なり、所在調査や身元調査でもある「住所調査」は現代社会においてかなり増加してきた調査項目です。
まず現代では殆どの人が携帯電話やスマホを持っており、メールやLINE、SNSを利用しており、個人同士の連絡もとても容易くなってしまいました。
個人同士との連絡が容易くなったことでこの点を利用して金銭貸借によるトラブル、寸借詐欺、結婚詐欺などが横行しているのです。
携帯電話の通話やメールなどのやり取りが頻繁に出来ていて信用の出来る人と思い、お金を貸したら、突然、連絡が取れなくなった。
よくよく考えると相手については本名かどうかも判らない、住所も知らないという被害者が多くなってきているのです。
被害者の多くは人が良いのか、警戒心が足りないもしくは世間知らずなのか、簡単に相手を信用してしまい金品を貸してしまう。
最近急に増加しているのが男性の被害者なのです。
飲食店や風俗店に働いている女性とLINE交換や番号交換をして頻繁にやり取りをしていると愛情も湧いたり、舞い上がってしまうのかもしれません。
そんな時にいろいろな事情によりお金が必要だと訴え援助を求めてくるのだそうです。
また同様に男性被害者が被害に会うのはSNSなどで知り合った一般女性なのです。
当初はネット上でたわいもない話のやり取りをしているものの次第にうち解けていき、プライベートの事までやり取りするようになり、友人関係を構築、更には恋愛対象といった疑似恋愛対象者という雰囲気にまで陥るそうです。
そんな状況になってくるといろいろと金銭的に困窮しているという状況をメールで言ってくるのだそうです。
例えば奨学金の返済が出来なくなってしまったとか、自分が病気になったとか家族が入院したとかで治療費を捻出しなくてはならないとか、いろいろと今の生活が維持出来なくなってきそうだと訴えてくるのです。
いずれにしても頼られているという男性心理と背景にはやはり下心もあってか簡単にお金を貸してしまう男性がかなり存在しています。
中には何度かに分けて総額数千万円を貸してしまったという男性もいた位です。
連絡が取れなくなって振り返ると本名はきちんと知らない、身分証明書らしきものも見たことがない、正確な住所も知らない、この辺と聞いているなど、この程度の情報しか与えられていなくても貸してしまうのです。
ところが突然、携帯電話も出てくれない、着信拒否されている、メールの送っても返信もなく、終いには携帯電話も解約されてしまい、勤めていたお店屋勤務先も辞めてしまいもう連絡すらも出来ず、探し出す手掛かりもなくなってしまったなどなど。
こうなって初めて男性被害者は探偵事務所に住所調査の相談に来るのですが、携帯電話やネット社会と言われる現在だから増加した寸借詐欺的な犯罪の匂いがしてきます。
被害男性の金額は数万円から数千万円と幅広く、調査料金を考えると完全に赤字となる少額被害者もおられます。
この住所調査では相手に対してどれだけの正確な情報を持っているかによって調査料金も異なってきます。
余りにも正確な情報をお持ちでないと如何に探偵といえども住所を特定するには至りません。
カッコを付けたり見栄を張ったりする事なく、金銭を貸す場合には最初に相手について正確な情報を入手すべきです。
もし正直にいろいろな正確な情報を提供してくれたら本当に困窮しているのかもしれません。
助けることでその人が救われるかもしれませんが、自分の情報を話したがらない人にはその関係が壊れても貸さない事です。
しかも、貴方だけではなく複数の異性に同じような事をして借金しているケースも多いのが現実です。
騙されてから探偵に住所調査を依頼され、結果、特定出来たからといって全額返済に至るという保証もないのですから。
And the Catholics wonder why their membership is declining .
A Roman Catholic priest has told parishioners they should confess if they voted for Barack Obama because the president - elect supports abortion .
The Rev. Joseph Illo says his parishioners at St. Joseph ’s Catholic Church in Modesto should n’t risk losing their “ state of grace ” by receiving communion sacrilegiously .
He delivered the message in a Nov. 21 letter and during mass .
In an interview this week with the Modesto Bee , Illo says he sent the letter because Catholic teaching requires that people go to confession when they commit a mortal sin .

A PLACE that is covered in graffiti and festooned with rubbish makes people feel uneasy .
And with good reason , according to a group of researchers in the Netherlands .
Kees Keizer and his colleagues at the University of Groningen deliberately created such settings as a part of a series of experiments designed to discover if signs of vandalism , litter and low - level lawbreaking could change the way people behave .
They found that they could , by a lot : doubling the number who are prepared to litter and steal .
The idea that observing disorder can have a psychological effect on people has been around for a while .
In the late 1980s George Kelling , a former probation officer who now works at Rutgers University , initiated what became a vigorous campaign to remove graffiti from New York City 's subway system , which was followed by a reduction in petty crime .
This idea also underpinned the “ zero tolerance ” which Rudy Giuliani subsequently brought to the city 's streets when he became mayor .
Many cities and communities around the world now try to get on top of anti-social behaviour as a way of deterring crime .
But the idea remains a controversial one , not least because it is often difficult to account for other factors that could influence crime reduction , such as changes in poverty levels , housing conditions and sentencing policy — even , some people have argued , the removal of lead from petrol .
An experimental test of the “ broken windows theory ” , as Dr Kelling and his colleague James Wilson later called the idea , is therefore long overdue .
And that is what Dr Keizer and his colleagues have provided .
The writing 's on the wall
Dr Kelling 's theory takes its name from the observation that a few broken windows in an empty building quickly lead to more smashed panes , more vandalism and eventually to break - ins .
The tendency for people to behave in a particular way can be strengthened or weakened depending on what they observe others to be doing .
This does not necessarily mean that people will copy bad behaviour exactly , reaching for a spray can when they see graffiti .
Rather , says Dr Keizer , it can foster the “ violation ” of other norms of behaviour .
It was this effect that his experiments , which have just been published in Science , set out to test .
His group 's first study was conducted in an alley that is frequently used to park bicycles .
As in all of their experiments , the researchers created two conditions : one of order and the other of disorder .
In the former , the walls of the alley were freshly painted ; in the latter , they were tagged with graffiti ( but not elaborately , to avoid the perception that it might be art ) .
In both states a large sign prohibiting graffiti was put up , so that it would not be missed by anyone who came to collect a bicycle .
All the bikes then had a flyer promoting a non-existent sports shop attached to their handlebars .
This needed to be removed before a bicycle could be ridden .
When owners returned , their behaviour was secretly observed .
There were no rubbish bins in the alley , so a cyclist had three choices .
He could take the flyer with him , hang it on another bicycle ( which the researchers counted as littering ) or throw it to the floor .
When the alley contained graffiti , 69 % of the riders littered compared with 33 % when the walls were clean .
To remove one possible bias — that litter encourages more litter — the researchers inconspicuously picked up each castaway flyer .
Nor , they say , could the effect be explained by litterers assuming that because the spraying of graffiti had not been prevented , it was also unlikely that they would be caught .
Littering , Dr Keizer observes , is generally tolerated by the police in Groningen .
The other experiments were carried out in a similar way .
In one , a temporary fence was used to close off a short cut to a car park , except for a narrow gap .
Two signs were erected , one telling people there was no throughway and the other saying that bicycles must not be left locked to the fence .
In the “ order ” condition ( with four bicycles parked nearby , but not locked to the fence ) 27 % of people were prepared to trespass by stepping through the gap , whereas in the disorder condition ( with the four bikes locked to the fence , in violation of the sign ) 82 % took the short cut .
Nor were the effects limited to visual observation of petty criminal behaviour .
It is against the law to let off fireworks in the Netherlands for several weeks before New Year 's Eve .
So two weeks before the festival the researchers randomly let off firecrackers near a bicycle shed at a main railway station and watched what happened using their flyer technique .
With no fireworks , 48 % of people took the flyers with them when they collected their bikes .
With fireworks , this fell to 20 % .
The most dramatic result , though , was the one that showed a doubling in the number of people who were prepared to steal in a condition of disorder .
In this case an envelope with a € 5 ( $ 6 ) note inside ( and the note clearly visible through the address window ) was left sticking out of a post box .
In a condition of order , 13 % of those passing took the envelope ( instead of leaving it or pushing it into the box ) .
But if the post box was covered in graffiti , 27 % did .
Even if the post box had no graffiti on it , but the area around it was littered with paper , orange peel , cigarette butts and empty cans , 25 % still took the envelope .
The researchers ' conclusion is that one example of disorder , like graffiti or littering , can indeed encourage another , like stealing .
Dr Kelling was right .
The message for policymakers and police officers is that clearing up graffiti or littering promptly could help fight the spread of crime .
Obama 's famous 2002 speech in Chicago at an anti-war rally , outlined his opposition to the coming Iraq war invasion :
" ... But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States , or to his neighbors , that the Iraqi economy is in shambles , that the Iraqi military a fraction of its former strength , and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until , in the way of all petty dictators , he falls away into the dustbin of history . "
Obama voiced his opposition to the Iraq war , but he also made an effort to explain a broader policy about war in general :
" What I am opposed to is a dumb war .
What I am opposed to is a rash war . "
This brings us to Afghanistan .
President Barack Obama is carrying out a campaign pledge that the United States must be willing to strike al Qaeda targets inside Pakistan .
Obama is currently continuing Bush 's policy to use American airpower to drop bombs inside Pakistan 's northern provinces .
Many anti-war sites were quick to pick up on this :
" A pair of missile strikes from American drones into Pakistan ’s North and South Waziristan Agencies have killed at least 20 people , and injured an unknown number of others .
This marks the first cross - border attack by US forces since President Obama took office on Tuesday . "
Obama has also vowed to escalate the number of American troops in Afghanistan .
In his Berlin Speech last year Obama said :
" There 's starting to be a growing consensus that it 's time for us to withdraw some of our combat troops out of Iraq , deploy them here in Afghanistan ...
Now is the time for us to do it . "
So this is what the nation is in for over the next 8 years : a continued and escalating military presence in Afghanistan , with frequent airstrikes inside Pakistan .
Obama 's plan is necessary and doable .
I will addres why , by answering the claims of why we should not .
First the cons -
Is this doable ?
Soviet Russia had a long and bloody conflict in Afghanistan in the 1980s and it ended in failure , what makes us think we will do any better ?
The situation today in Afghanistan is different then the one Russia had in the 1980s .
For one , the resistance to the United States is not currently being armed with the most sophisticated weapons available by the CIA .
The biggest obstacle Russia encountered was state - of - the - art surface to air missiles the resistance had .
These were provided via Operation Cyclone , and the easy to use shoulder - fired stinger missiles effectively removed the advantage Russian air - superiority had .
There will not be a similar Operation Cyclone this time .
It did not happen in Iraq , or the recent wars in Lebannon and Gaza , nor has it happened in Afghanistan .
The current resistance to the West 's military involvement in the world has been confined to , though deadly , weapons that our air - power is virtually immune to .
Helicopters have been shot down in Iraq with anti-personnel rocket propelled grenades , but the casualties the Russians experienced in Afghanistan at the hands of these state - of - the - art anti-aircraft missiles were much much higher .
Iraq was a failure , and the weapons the Taliban have are similar to the weapons the Iraqi resistance have .
What makes us think we will do any better in Afghanistan ?
Iraq is different from Afghanistan because the Iraqi people were fighting for their country .
It is an easy rallying cry to follow to get the invaders out of a country .
However Obama is luckier in Afghanistan then Bush was in Iraq because the Taliban are not fighting for their country .
The Taliban are a paramilitary organization based in Pakistan .
This was obvious when in the first days of the Afghanistan war , the Taliban fled Afghanistan to their southern neighbor Pakistan .
And every spring when the Taliban return to Afghanistan to launch attacks , where do they come from ?
The Taliban cross the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan .
This enemy will be easier to defeat then the one we faced in Iraq .
The resistance in Iraq did not leave the country , then regroup and cross back over the border to fight us , despite what Donald Rumsfeld claimed .
The resistance in Iraq were Iraqies , and they were not fighting some holy war , they were fighting for their home towns and cities .
The Taliban are fighting to conquer land , not to reclaim some hereditary land , their ancestors lived in for ages .
There has been fighting in Afghanistan forever , there will never be peace .
What makes us think we will have peace in Afghanistan this time ?
This is again not true .
What we are fighting in Afghanistan are the Taliban , and the Taliban are not some age old adversary .
They are a new organization , starting off as separate paramilitary organizations in Pakistan funded by the West in their fight against Russia , and later combining under the name Taliban in 1996 to run the government of Afghanistan .
So what we are basically fighting is a group that 14 years ago did not exist .
The Taliban are a group supported by the Pashtuns , and the Pashtuns are from a region that contains parts of southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan , so it will be impossible to stop Afghan support for the Taliban .
Again , if this was the case why is the Taliban an organization that is only 14 years old ?
So far I have only discussed why defeating the Taliban is possible .
There is still the question of " Why should we do it ? "
Everyone knows innocent people are going to die , civilians , women and children .
Obama 's famous 2002 speech in Chicago at an anti-war rally , outlined why he believed some wars are necessary :
" The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history , and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword , the sacrifice of multitudes , that we could begin to perfect this union , and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil . "
It would have saved alot of lives if the south willingly ended their oppression of blacks in this country , but unfortunately they were unwilling to do so .
But Afghanistan is not the United States .
And this brings us to the final claim against Obama 's call to defeat the Taliban :
We know the Taliban are mean , and oppress women 's rights , and everything else , but why do we have to go halfway around the world to solve a problem when we have so many at home ?
The answer has alot to do with why we elected Obama in the first place .
We want Obama to solve all the problems Bush created .
However Obama should not limit himself to just Bush .
Or even both Bushes .
What Obama will do in Afghanistan is solve the problem Ronald Reagan created when he funded the first holy warriors in the 1980s who would eventually become the modern day Taliban .
We all saw the blowback during the September 11th 2001 attacks , and like so may Republican mistakes in the past , it is now Barack Obama 's task to fix them .
Colbert : Bush worked with Dems like Ike ' worked with ' Tina David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday November 13 , 2008

As final vote tallies continued to result in additional gains for Democrats a week after the election , even fake right - wing pundit Stephen Colbert was almost ready to give up hope for the Republican Party .
" I 'm just going to go out on a limb here and say that things are not going well for the Republicans , " Colbert conceded on Wednesday .
However , he added more cheerfully that " it 's never too early to rewrite history . "
" One thing being rewritten very clearly right now by the right , " Colbert explained , " is that , for the past eight years , the party in power has been brutally victimized by the Democrats -- who had no say whatsoever . "
" We all know the greatest victim was the president , " Colbert added .
" We are finally starting to hear just how oppressed the most powerful man in the world has been . "
" I feel that in many ways , President Bush was misunderstood , " Fox 's Sean Hannity told Karl Rove on Monday .
" He was diminished and demonized and insulted on a regular basis by the Democrats . "
" I 've learned , " replied Rove , " a sobering lesson that a president needs to be careful in his language , but he cannot allow the kind of brittle and brutal attacks that were made on this president at certain times to go unanswered . "
" Yes ! " exclaimed Colbert .
" You need to answer those attacks !
An eye for an eye !
A tooth for a tooth !
An outing - a- CIA - agent for a critical editorial in the Times .
A right - to - wiretap - you for a having - a- phone . "
Colbert went on to suggest that Bush has been demonized " because he cared too much , " citing a Wall Street Journal editorial -- titled " The Treatment of Bush Has Been a Disgrace " -- which claims " this is the price Mr. Bush is paying for trying to work with both Democrats and Republicans . "
" See ?
He tried to work with Democrats , " Colbert stated plaintively , as the sidebar commented , " The way Ike worked with Tina . "
" But we know they refused , " Colbert continued .
" With the exception of reauthorizing the Iraq War , the Patriot Act , domestic wiretapping , approving his tax cuts , the financial bailout , immunity for telecom companies , and his two Supreme Court nominees , they fought him tooth and nail . "
" And now , the greatest victimization of all , " Colbert concluded in mock - anguish .
" The Republicans , who have always criticized the Democrats ' liberal culture of victimhood , have been forced by this stunning defeat to portray themselves as the victim . "
" But they have no other choice , " Colbert insisted .
" Because at this crucial moment in our nation 's history , the question we should be asking ourselves is not ' Why were the Republicans rejected by the voters ? ' but ' Who can we blame for it ? ' "

RubyConf '08 featured many talks about the various Ruby VMs .
The talks varied from in - depth technical coverage of implementation details , to tech demos and general talks about Ruby performance .
Koichi Sasada 's talk " Future of Ruby VM " , where he explains his view of the C implementation of Ruby as the pragmatic solution for the near future , despite some of it's problems such as the conservative GC .
He continues to discuss some optimizations which were implemented for 1.9 , which are off for now , but should be enabled in 1.9.2 .
Examples of these optimizations are tail call optimization , stack caching , efficient method caching and a more efficient Fiber implementation .
At around 20:00 , he mentions some of of his research interests .
One of them is Ricsin , which allows to embed C source inside Ruby code .
The sample source from the presentation slides should make the concept clear :
def open_fd ( path ) fd = _C_ ( % q [ /* C code */ return INT2FIX ( open( RSTRING_PTR( path ) , O_RDONLY ) ) ; ]) raise ' open error ' if fd == - 1 yield fd ensure raise ' close error ' if - 1 == _C _ ( % q [ /* C Code */ return INT2FIX ( close ( FIX2INT( fd ) ) ) ; ])
end
It 's differs from RubyInline by allowing to put C snippets inside a Ruby method .
The current version received special support in YARV .
Ricsin's SVN repository is available publically .
Further projects are a Ruby to C compiler ( at round 28:40 ) , followed by Atomic - Ruby , which tries to shrink Ruby by allowing to exclude some parts .
At 41:00 the status of the Ruby MVM project is explained as well ( InfoQ reported about Ruby MVM ) .
Evan Phoenix ' talk on Rubinius explained the status of the Rubinius project and of its C++ VM .
The reasons for the rewrite of the old C VM to the C++ VM is explained .
The reasons are type safety and how C++ helped make the code simpler and removed many manual checks .
At 18:04 the current state of the implementation of primitives is discussed ( how to write primitives in C ) .
At 26:30 , method dispatch and the strategies used to make it fast are discussed .
At 35:00 , the current state of MethodContext ( " stack frames " ) allocation is explained .
In older version of Rubinius , these were heap allocated , but the current version tries to allocate them on a stack ( in a dedicated memory region ) to reduce allocation cost .
However , MethodContexts can be kept alive beyond the lifetime of the methods that they were created for ( eg. by a Closure ) .
These objects are kept alive - but since the memory region dedicated to MethodContexts is limited in size , it will fill up at some point , which will trigger a GC run to clean up MethodContexts which are not referenced anymore .
At 38:40 follows a discussion of Rubinius ' support for Ruby extensions , which is mportant to run C extension gems such as hpricot , mongrel , mysql , sqlite drivers .
Rubinius ' handling of the problems of extensions is also explained ( eg. problems with the generational GC or segfaulting C code ) .
Another talk about these topics is " How Ruby can be fast " by Glenn Vanderburg .
While not a VM implementer , he discusses some reasons why Ruby is or can be slow .
At 07:00 an explanation of Garbage Collection gives an overview of the theory of Generational GCs , followed by an explanation of performance optimizations for method dispatch at 19:35 .
" Ruby Persistence in MagLev " by Bob Walker , Allan Ottis , explained the current status of MagLev.
Bob Walker explains the basic benefits of Gemstone 's persistence model , which allows to simply persist object graphs instead of having to map them to a relational model , thus avoiding a whole lot of issues with ORM libraries and tools .
At 14:30 Allan Ottis follows with a detailed explanations of the inner workings of MagLev , starting with the implementation of the object persistence .
At 18:50 he continues with an overview of similarities and differences between Smalltalk and Ruby and what problems they pose for implementing Ruby on Smalltalk .
At 22:29 the compilation process is explained , as well as the current parsing solution ( ie. a Ruby server to parse Ruby code and use the ParseTree gem to return an AST formatted as ParseTree s- exprs ) .
At 25:00 the execution modes , both interpretation and native code generation are explained .
At 30:30 the implementation of the allocation of Contexts ( " stack frames " ) is shown , followed by the details of the object memory ( heap ) and the garbage collector .
The questions start at 44:20 , with questions about distributed caching , future parsing strategies ( using ruby_parser ) , the behavior of transactions across the distributed object memory .
Some of the more demo oriented Ruby VM talks were
Finally , this is rounded off by Brian Ford 's talk on RubySpec , where he explains the RubySpec project which now has tens of thousands of tests which define Ruby 's behavior - a crucial tool of every alternative Ruby implementation .
MALMO , Sweden , Jan. 19 ( UPI ) --
A southern Sweden woman who claims to be addicted to Coca Cola will be allowed to enter an addiction treatment clinic , a court ruled .
The Administrative Court of Appeal overturned an earlier decision by the Administrative Court , which had sided with health authorities who said the Malmo woman 's addiction could be sufficiently treated through standard healthcare , The Local reported Monday .

However , the appeals court said the woman , who has been deaf since childhood , faces risks to her health as a result of her lifestyle that require special attention .
The court ordered a special addiction treatment clinic for the deaf to admit the woman , who said her eating and drinking habits have led to emergency hospitalization for diabetes and high blood pressure , and treat her for her addictions to Coke and food .
Over recent months I 've read plenty of articles about the impact the credit crunch will have on publishing , and the general consensus appears to be that while it will doubtless be affected like every other industry , the impact will likely be gentler than elsewhere .
The industry is used to struggling already , so it 's less likely to be panicked by narrowing profit margins than those skittish coke - fiends in the city .
What 's more , recessions generally do n't seem to stop people buying books .
Punters may have less money to throw away on extravagant food - porn absurdities such as The Big Fat Duck Cookbook , but this is balanced out by the sad fact that plenty of people suddenly find themselves with a lot more time to read .
I 'm prepared to go along with that theory , but an article I just came across on bookninja.com has led me to question the premise slightly .
The stealthy links - master ( whom I love even though he once tried to have me assassinated ) suggests that if we 're feeling the financial pinch , we should stop going to bookshops : " Instead of going out and buying more books you fully - intend - to but are - not - going - to read , why not examine your shelves for ones that slipped through the cracks and feel lonely and neglected . "
If everyone has as many unread books as I have such actions wo n't help the industry - as bookninja suggests .
And much as I 'd appreciate the spare cash he also points out will result from not buying books , the challenge has a definite dark side .
In directing us to the books we already own , bookninja is asking us to confront the tyranny of the to - read pile head - on .
Bibliophiles everywhere will be only too well acquainted with the demons of guilt and shame that such explorations would conjure .
The to - read pile is more than just a physical stack of books : it 's a tower of ambitions failed , hopes unrealised , good intentions unfulfilled .
Worse still , it 's a cold hard reminder of mortality .
Already , I have intentions to read more books than I can hope to manage in a normal lifetime .
How will this pile of books taunt me when I'm 64 ?
And Cynthia Crossen , whose Wall Street Journal article inspired Bookninja 's own musings , points out another evil of the to - read collection .
It 's a catalogue of pathetic excuses :
" As I scanned my shelves , I found I had convincing arguments why I should n't read each one of the orphans – or convincing to me anyway .
I rejected a book called English , August , by Upamanyu Chatterjee because it is , after all , November .
No to The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists by Robert Tressell because the book jacket says it 's about ' the desperate lives of working people . '
No to The Unconsoled by Kazuo Ishiguro because I heard it was n't nearly as good as Remains of the Day or Never Let Me Go . "
I know exactly what she means .
Each book on my overloaded pending shelf comes with its own unconvincing reason as to why I can't quite manage it yet and am going to buy the new Paul Auster instead .
Chief among my tormentors is Thomas Pynchon 's Against the Day .
There 's no ignoring it , because it 's so big .
Indeed , owing to the fact that my shelves are right next to my bed , it 's pretty much the last thing I see before I go to sleep and the first thing I see when I wake up .
And I have no reason not to read it other than its size .
I know I 'll enjoy it , but , you see , I need to know I 'm going to have a good month or so at home before I make a start .
It 's just too heavy to go on holiday or assignment and I 'm also worried that taking it in a bag will break the spine .
( And in case you 're thinking I should just interrupt my reading for a few days , I can't .
It 's Pynchon .
Losing the thread could get me completely lost . )
I 'm similarly haunted by a copy of The Spire by William Golding .
My failure here is made even more irksome because when I picked the book up ( three years ago ) in the lovely Priestpopple Books in Hexham the man behind the till laughed at me and said : " Good luck with that . "
He clearly did n't know what kind of an intellectual giant he was dealing with , I thought , as I pocketed it .
I intended to munch it within a week – and enjoy it .
But since then , I 've found that the splashes of turquoise on the cover have put me off .
It 's really not a colour I like .
And so it goes – through Richard Yates ' Revolutionary Road ( I 'm saving that for a trip to the US ) , to Joseph Roth 's What I Saw ( too depressing for winter ) via Umberto Eco's The Island Of The Day Before ( it 's a trade paperback ; I hate those ) …
I do n't have one single good excuse for my failure to read any of them .
Indeed , the whole process has so depressed me that it will be at least a month before I can face the to - read pile again .
Maybe the publishing industry will survive after all .

Rebates
Icann oversees much of the basic functionality of the net
Plans to offer hundreds of new web addresses as alternatives to .com have been criticised by the US government .
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , which oversees net addresses has floated plans for the radical change to the existing system .
But the US Commerce department has questioned both the benefits and the costs of such a scheme .
Officials have also raised concerns about whether the plans will destabilise the current system .
Clear rationale
The US government 's response includes two letters sent separately by officials raising concerns about the plans .
In a letter sent last week , Commerce Department official Meredith Baker questioned Icann 's proposed pricings for the new addresses .
The net body planned to offer between 200 and 800 new addresses for sale at $ 185,000 ( £ 125,000 ) per domain with a yearly cost of $ 60,000 .
But Ms Baker said Icann needed to " articulate a clear rationale for the proposed fee structure " .
She also called on the net body to supply evidence that the changes would " not compromise the stability or security of DNS ( Domain Name System ) " .
There are currently 21 so - called gTLDs ( Generic Top Level Domains ) .
They include .com , .org , .net and .gov .
In June 2008 Icann announced proposal to allow an unlimited number of new gTLDs , citing greater competition and lower costs as the benefits of a more open system .
But another Department of Commerce official , Deborah Garza , has questioned the plan .
In her own letter to Icann she wrote : " The DOC is unconvinced that new gTLDs will alter the preference for .com domains , and fears that a huge number of new gTLDs will simply force companies to register them in order to maintain and redirect appropriate traffic " .
The criticisms are pertinent because the US government is still nominally in charge of Icann despite calls from the net body for administrative freedom .

Year - after - year I ’ve watched the usual suspects make their tech predictions , so this year I ’ve decided as a fanboy that it was my right to make a fool of myself as much as the next guy .
Most people are in a doom and gloom mindset right now , but I ’ve always felt that there are opportunities when the going gets tough .
In fact my one ambivalent prediction is that somewhere in 2009 / 2010 someone will start a new company which will become the next big thing .
But here ’s what I think will be happening with the current cast of characters in the tech scene :
Sun is Acquired or Sells Off MySQL / Java Assets
Sun Microsystems stock tanks and the company becomes an acquisition target for the likes of IBM or HP — or the company goes back to their hardware roots and they sell off the valuable software assets to stay alive .
Microsoft Announces Silverlight Office & Outlook
This will be the point where people realize that not only is Microsoft serious about going after Google , but they ’re in it to win it by doing what they do best :
By being the upstart underdog .
Mahalo Acquires About.com from the New York Times
In one fell swoop Jason Calacanis takes on Wikipedia while Google quietly closes down Knol .
Calacanis uses the opportunity to open an advertising network out of NYC thus firing the opening shot of Silicon Alley 3.0 .
Apple Rolls Time Machine into Apple TV
It ’s sink or swim time for Job ’s hobby and one sure way to make Apple TV make more sense is to add further functionality .
Yahoo !
Will NOT Be Acquired
Yahoo !
always made money and with a recession this will seem like a virtue once again .
Pixar Announces a 2D Styled Feature Film
With everyone doing yet another 3D film Pixar will zig while everyone zags and will reinvent classic animation while doing it .
Technorati Shutters Down
I ’m sort of surprised that this did n’t happen in 2008 — I ’m still trying to figure out what this site is good for anymore ?
Amazon and / or eBay Will Announce an iTunes Like Desktop App
( or Embrace a Silverlight or Flash Interface )
As Flash and Silverlight embrace accessibility you ’ll start to see more high end commerce sites become more like desktop applications as ease - of - use will bring in more sales .
Google Acquires Twitter
Like Blogger and YouTube our friends at Google love to buy the best - of - breed dynamic websites .
In many ways Google will also do this as a checkmate against further investment in Facebook by Microsoft .

On 14 June 1918 , the supply ship Makambo struck a submerged rock off Lord Howe Island , a volcanic dot 780 kilometres north - east of Sydney , Australia .
The cargo was salvaged and taken ashore to the island , which is a semi-tropical paradise , lushly forested and rich in plants and animals found nowhere else .
Unfortunately , the ship ’s rats came ashore too .
They spread rapidly , soon dispatching several island species , including a giant wingless stick insect , or phasmid .
By the 1930s , the Lord Howe Island phasmid ( Dryococelus australis ) was written off as extinct .
By all accounts , it had been a spectacular insect , so big the islanders called it the land lobster .
Females grew up to 15 centimetres long , with bodies as thick as a finger and long , stout legs equipped with hooks .
The slightly shorter males had peculiarly massive thighs armed with evil - looking spines .
They could n’t fly but they could run surprisingly fast . [… ]
[…]
However , in 1964 , a rock climber found a dead phasmid , not on Lord Howe Island but on Balls Pyramid , a remote spire of rock 24 kilometres to the south - east .
Another climber found two more dead phasmids there in 1969 , one lodged in a bush , the other as part of a seabird ’s nest – a stick insect mistaken for a stick .
Was the giant phasmid alive and well and living somewhere on Balls Pyramid ?
It seemed improbable .
This was a creature of warm , damp forests that needed living trees with sizeable hollows to hide in .
Balls Pyramid is the world ’s highest sea stack , its sheer cliffs rising 550 metres .
Isolated , exposed to high winds and with no apparent water supply , the islet has just a few scraps of vegetation and no trees .

Gabriel 's
Horn is not so puzzling
Take the curve y = 1/ x for x ≥
1 .
Revolve it around the x-axis , generating a trumpet - shaped surface , " Gabriel 's Horn " .
Elementary calculations , with calculus , allow one to show that although the Horn has finite volume , it has an infinite surface area .
This is considered paradoxical , because it says that although an infinite amount of paint is required to cover the interior surface of the horn , the entire interior can be filled up with a finite amount of paint .
The calculations themselves do not lend much insight into what is going on here .
But I recently read a crystal - clear explanation that I think should be more widely known .
Take out some Play - Doh and roll out a snake .
The surface area of the snake ( neglecting the two ends , which are small ) is the product of the length and the circumference ; the circumference is proportional to the diameter .
The volume is the product of the length and the cross-sectional area , which is proportional to the square of the diameter .
Order
Elementary Calculus : An Infinitesimal Approach
from Powell 's
As you continue to roll the snake thinner and thinner , the volume stays the same , but the surface area goes to infinity .
Gabriel 's
Horn does exactly the same thing , except without the rolling , because the parts of the Horn that are far from the origin look exactly the same as very long snakes .
There 's nothing going on in the Gabriel 's Horn example that is n't also happening in the snake example , except that in the explanation of Gabriel 's Horn , the situation is obfuscated by calculus .
I read this explanation in H. Jerome Keisler 's caclulus textbook .
Keisler 's book is an ordinary undergraduate calculus text , except that instead of basing everything on limits and on limiting processes , it is based on nonstandard analysis and explicit infinitesimal quantities .
Check it out ; it is available online for free .

New research indicates that the most pervasive global strain of HIV began spreading among humans between 1884 and 1924 , suggesting that growing urbanization in colonial Africa set the stage for the HIV / AIDS pandemic .
The estimated period of origin , considerably earlier than the previous estimate of 1930 , coincides with the establishment and rise of urban centers in west - central Africa where the pandemic HIV strain , HIV - 1 group M , emerged .
The growth of cities and associated high - risk behaviors may have been the key change that allowed the virus to flourish .
The research , led by Michael Worobey , an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at The University of Arizona in Tucson , was co-sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the National Institutes of Health , and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation .
The findings are published in the current issue of the journal Nature .
Worobey and his collaborators screened a number of tissue samples and uncovered the world 's second - oldest genetic sequence of HIV - 1 group M , which dates from 1960 .
They then used it , along with dozens of other previously known HIV - 1 genetic sequences , to construct a range of plausible family trees for this viral strain .
The lengths of the tree branches represent the periods of time when the virus genetically diverged from its ancestors .
The timing and number of these genetic mutations enabled the scientists to calibrate the probable range of rates at which the trees have grown .
That is , the probable rates of evolution of HIV - 1 group M. Based on this range of rates , the scientists projected back in time to the period when the trees most likely took root : around the turn of the 20th century .
This marks the probable time of origin of HIV - 1 group M , according to Worobey and the others .
Using newly developed techniques , the scientists recovered the 48 - year - old HIV gene fragments from a wax - embedded lymph - node tissue biopsy from a woman in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
The oldest known HIV - 1 group M genetic sequence comes from a 1959 blood sample from a man , also from Kinshasa .
A comparison of the same genetic region in the 1959 virus and the 1960 virus provided additional evidence that the common ancestor of both viruses existed around 1900 .
The comparison revealed that the amount of genetic divergence between these two HIV sequences took more than 40 years to evolve .

Worobey , who teaches the evolution of infectious diseases and molecular phylogenetics at the UA , has spent several years studying how to recover the fragmented pieces of viral DNA and RNA from archival specimens , to track when the virus first jumped from chimpanzees to humans .
" Previous work on HIV sequencing had been done on frozen samples and there are only so many of those samples available , " Woroby said .
The 1959 and 1960 samples are presently the oldest links to the HIV epidemic .
" From that point on , the next oldest sequences that anyone has recovered are from the late 1970s and 1980s , the era when we knew about AIDS .
Now for the first time we have been able to compare two relatively ancient HIV strains .
That helped us to calibrate how quickly the virus evolved and make some really robust inferences about when it crossed into humans , how quickly the epidemic grew from that time and what factors allowed the virus to enter and become a successful human pathogen . "
Research shows that HIV spread from chimps to humans in southeastern Cameroon .
Worobey said the resulting HIV epidemic among humans correlates to the growth of urban centers near this area , principally the present - day city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which began as a colonial center for Belgium .
Other countries ringing this area include the Central African Republic , Congo , Gabon and Equatorial Guinea .
By 1960 a large number of people in this region were infected with HIV , reflected by the considerable amount of genetic diversity of the virus .
From there events seeded the epidemic in different parts of the world .
By 1981 , people started realizing that something was happening and the rest is history .

Worobey said laying the technical groundwork for analyzing samples of HIV 's ancient history was extraordinarily painstaking .
" The DNA and RNA in these samples is in a really sorry state .
It 's highly fragmented , so instead of a nice , pearl - strand of DNA or RNA , you have a jumbled mass that 's all jammed together .
It 's been gratifying , but a ridiculous amount of work . "
Worobey said his research in the near term will be on recovering more samples and assembling the fragmented DNA and RNA sequences to form a clearer picture of HIV 's history .
He said the Nature paper " does a lot to snap everything into sharp focus and allows us to understand the timing of these events and the growth of the epidemic . "
" There 's still a lot of interesting work we can do with these techniques .
We have lots more samples to analyze and hopefully recover nucleic acids from and it's pretty exciting to be in that position , " Worobey said .
" I think the picture that has emerged here , where changes the human population experienced may have opened the door to the spread of HIV , is a good reminder that we can make changes now that could help reverse the epidemic .
If HIV has one weak spot , it is that it is a relatively poorly transmitted virus .
From better testing and prevention , to wider use of antiretroviral drug therapy , there are a number of ways to reduce transmission and force this virus back into extinction .
Our results suggest that there are reasons for such optimism . "
Worobey 's colleagues on the paper include Marlea Gemmel , Dirk E. Teuwen , Tamara Haselkorn , Kevin Kunstman , Michael Bunce , Jean - Jacques Muyembe , Jean - Marie M. Kabongo , Raphael M. Kalengayi , Eric Van Marck , M. Thomas P. Gilbert and Steven M. Wolinsky .

Osama denies involvement
Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden has denied involvement in the United States terror attacks , but justified the killing of thousands in Washington and New York as " oppressors ' reaction against suppresser " .
A statement carried by the Pakistani Urdu newspaper Ausaf quoted bin Laden , who lives in Afghanistan , as saying , " I do n't have any link to the US attacks , but I second it as it is the oppressors ' reaction against suppresser . "
The story by Ausaf editor Hamid Mir said bin Laden 's statement was read out to him by a Laden special envoy who translated it from Arabic to Urdu .
Laden , the daily said , appreciated those who committed Tuesday 's horrendous terrorist attacks in the U.S.
He added , however , that the majority of those dead were innocent people .
" But those being killed in Palestine are also innocent .
Who cares about those innocent people ?
The terrorist US is fully behind those killings . "
Bin Laden , accused by Washington of carrying out deadly bombings of US embassies in Africa in 1998 , also warned the United States against attacking him in Afghanistan .
" The US will be in more danger if they tried to kill me .
If they will kill one Osama , hundreds of Osamas will stand against them . "
He said he was on a " holy mission " and would soon complete it .
He said his mission was to liberate Palestine from Jews .
" I promise to fulfil my mission with the help of my followers . "
Bin Laden also claimed that thousands of Muslim youths were committed to stand by him .
" They are even ready for suicidal missions .
Moreover dozens of Muslim scientists who are experts in different fields have assured me their knowledge and expertise against anti-Islam forces . "
He said the jihad against anti-Islamic forces would continue " until atrocities against Muslims stopped .
There are many Muslims like me who after quitting luxurious life have come to the path of jihad .
And we will continue the jihad against infidels .
" We do n't possess any chemical weapon but our morale is even higher than all those who have nuclear bombs .
We 'll force the U.S. to change its policies and quit the anti-Islam agenda . "
Earlier , immediately after the terrorist attacks , an official of Afghanistan 's ruling Taleban denied the involvement of the Taleban and bin Laden in the strikes but warned that any retaliation against Kabul would be " a big mistake . "
" We condemn the attack and make it clear that we are not involved in it any way , " Online news agency quoted Afghan ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef Mugf as telling reporters in Islamabad late Tuesday .
" Osama bin Laden has no facilities to make such a big planning .
We do n't expect the US to attack us on mere assumptions . "
" It would be a big mistake of the US if they tried to target Afghanistan for the crime .
We are not in anyway involved and we have cleared our position in this regard . "
" Osama has not been allowed to play with international law and order .
We have not left him to carry such terrorist attacks .
We recommend an investigation into the issue . "

Muslims live and worship freely in Australia despite occasional friction A Muslim cleric in Australia who said men have a right to force their wives to have sex has been told to apologise by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
The cleric , Samir Abu Hamza , reportedly questioned how rape can exist within marriage , and encouraged " light beating " of disobedient women .
" I would call upon this Islamic cleric to publicly apologise and repudiate his remarks , " Mr Rudd said .
He told reporters that such views have no place in Australia .
" Under no circumstances is sexual violence permissible or acceptable in Australia , " he said .
" Nor are they acceptable in my view to mainstream Muslim teachings , " he said of the views apparently supporting violent treatment of women .
Samir Abu Hamza runs the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia and , according to local media , is a self - taught cleric , popular with young Muslims in Melbourne 's northern suburbs .
' Amazing '
His 2003 lecture entitled The Keys To A Successful Marriage has been posted on the internet in a 50 - minute video .
In this , Mr Hamza tells his audience that hitting their wives is not allowed but a light smacking is .
Australia will not tolerate these sort of remarks .
They do n't belong in modern Australia and he should stand up , repudiate them and apologise
Kevin Rudd , Australian prime minister " You beat them ... but this is the last resort , after you have advised them for a long , long time , then you smack them , you beat them .
" You are not allowed to bruise them , you are not allowed to make them bleed , this is just to shape them up - ' shape up woman ' - that 's about it .
" You do n't go and get a broomstick . "
The Australian - born Mr Hamza went on to express his disbelief at Australia 's legal definition of rape , saying that a woman was not allowed to refuse her husband 's requests for sex .
" Even if her husband was to ask her for a sexual relationship and she is preparing him the bread on the stove , she must leave it and come and respond to her husband , " he said .
" In this country if the husband wants to sleep with his wife and she does not want to and ... there 's nothing wrong with her , she just does not want to , and he ends up sleeping with her by force , it is ... known to be as a rape .
" Amazing .
How can a person rape his wife ? "
Mr Rudd said the cleric 's remarks " have no place in modern Australia at all " .
" I would say to this Islamic cleric : Australia will not tolerate these sort of remarks .
They do n't belong in modern Australia and he should stand up , repudiate them and apologise , " Mr Rudd said .
Mr Hamza was reported to be on leave and unavailable for comment .
A leading Islamic cleric , Sheikh Taj Aldin al - Hilali , was replaced as Mufti of Australia in 2007 after creating a storm of protest when he described scantily - dressed women as " uncovered meat " inviting rape .

One is being reported by the BBC .
In Britain there 's a government post with the Orwellian title of " Culture Secretary " .
The title is of course a misnomer as a Culture Secretary does not so much promote culture , as restrict it .
At the moment the post is occupied by one Andrew Burnham .
Mr Burnham , a father of three young children , believes internet - service providers should offer child - friendly web access .
In other words , anodyne and safe for the likes of Mr Burnham .
But how can ISPs only offer child friendly access ?
This is n't about turning back the clock .
The internet has been empowering and democratising in many ways , but we have n't yet got the stakes in the ground to help people navigate their way safely around it [...]
This is not a campaign against free speech , far from it , it is simply there is a wider public interest at stake when it involves harm to other people .
A wider public interest than free speech .
There is no public interest wider than free speech .
Free speech is a human right .
Burnham and his ilk find that human right inconvenient so he wants to curtail it in favour of a greater good - his own convenience .
How the government will do this is a mystery , but no doubt high on the list is giving ISPs a list of approved web sites .
That 's one way Mr Burnham can have " stakes " to help the sheeple navigate .
It is no wonder that Guido , who has been identified as a threat by ministers , is moving his website somewhere else .
Guido is being threatened again , because some minor politician , Zac Goldsmith , who can't keep his dick in his trousers , does n't want the truth to get out about his bedroom exploits .
And that 's the truth of it .
Politicians want to censor the internet so they can do what the want with impunity .
On a gamer forum , a vigorous discussion about whether it's fair for employers to discriminate against World of Warcraft players when hiring , on the grounds that WoW players are never fully out of the game .
A surprising number of players agree with this proposition .
I met with a recruiter recently ( online media industry ) and in conversation I happened to mention I 'd spent way too much time in the early 2000s playing online games , which I described as " the ones before World of Warcraft " ( I went nuts for EQ1 , SWG and the start of WoW , but since 2006 I have only put a handful of days into MMOG playing – as opposed to discussing them – I 've obsessed over bicycles and cycling instead ) .
He replied that employers specifically instruct him not to send them World of Warcraft players .
He said there is a belief that WoW players cannot give 100 % because their focus is elsewhere , their sleeping patterns are often not great , etc .
I mentioned that some people have written about MMOG leadership experience as a career positive or a way to learn project management skills , and he shook his head .
He has been specifically asked to avoid WoW players .
WELLINGTON , New Zealand , Jan. 1 ( UPI ) -- Prison officials in New Zealand said a prisoner nearing the end of his sentence for rape and murder stabbed another prisoner for frightening his cat .
Corrections Association President Beven Hanlon said the attacker was living with the victim in a minimum security self - care unit at Rimutaka Prison in Wellington that was designed to help prepare long - term prisoners for release , The Dominion Post reported Thursday .

Hanlon said the victim entered the shared living room in the unit Dec. 26 , causing the cat to flee .
The attacker stabbed the other man six times in the neck and likely would have killed him had a third prisoner not intervened , Hanlon said .
" That prisoner is lucky to be alive , " Hanlon said .
The victim was taken to Hutt Hospital and returned to the prison Dec. 28 .
Tony Howe , acting southern assistant regional manager for the Corrections Association , said the attack was carried out with a " makeshift weapon . "
Howe said police and corrections officials are investigating the incident and the attacker has been moved to a high security area .
Templates are one of the extremely powerful features of C++ that set it apart from most other languages .
You can do most everything with them , from extremly complicated compile - time meta - programming like binary self - balanced trees , down to simple shared pointers or generic container classes .
When I switched to Linux a few years ago , I found KDevelop3 and liked it .
However I noticed that it did n’t support code - completion for even the simplest C++ templates like for example a reference - counter pointer .
That was my entry into KDevelop development .
I implemented template support in KDevelop3 that had most of the needed features , and worked quite well when the needed libraries were processed .
However the quality it could reach had some upper bounds , since there was no powerful backing structure like the DUChain , but rather just a flat completely string - based code - model .
Actually it was quite hard making the static DUChain structure compatible with dynamic templates , where a new declaration can be created with every use of a class .
However I finally succeeded , and today I ’ve reached a milestone that is far above of what KDevelop3 , and probably even most other IDEs can reach : Full support for C++ template specialization instantiations .
Explicit Template Specializations
What basically motivated me to finish this was that even though the template support was already quite mature , the code - completion for __gnu_cxx :: normal_iterator , the iterator used by std::vector , did not work correctly .
The problem :
It uses the template - class iterator_traits to compute its used types , which looks something like this :
template < class T>
struct Traits {
typedef T Type ;
} ;
template < class T>
struct Traits <T*> {
typedef T Type ;
} ;
This means that , depending one the template - parameter given , another class with different content is instantiated .
This case is relatively easy , but this whole principle allows implementing most any algorithm statically , and thus can become arbitrarily complex .
The good thing is that I already implemented a framework for the matching of implicit template - parameters to template - functions , that could partially be re-used to do the actual matching .
So the result of the last days is : Full code - completion for all stdc ++ functions / classes that use iterator_traits , which is mainly the iterators , and well , also code - completion for any other C++ classes that use explicit specialization .
And important : Without any hacks , it ’s based on pure language understanding .
🙂
Technically this means that the internal C++ engine is now , apart from bugs and slowness , mostly feature - complete .
Meta Programming
As said above , explicit template specialization can not only be used to form new types , but also to compute numerical stuff statically .
While this is not very useful in the form I ’m going to present , it does serve as a utility to create really efficient code in practice .
Today I ’ve pushed the C++ engine in KDevelop4 so far , that it can actually evaluate such meta programs right within KDevelop .
So here we go :
What you see on the screenshot is mainly a simple meta - program I found on the internet that can compute whether a number is a prime - number .
I tuned it a little so the results can nicely be visualized graphically be KDevelop ’s declaration highlighting :
At the bottom , you see all the lines highlighted that were computed as prime numbers .
Useful Stuff
What I ’ve presented until now is mainly backend features , that will be very helpful in practice without you noticing it , because they will make code - completion , use - building , etc. for more complex template - code “ just work ” .
There is also some annoying stuff about templates though .
One of the main problem :
They are not nice to write .
You never know what types you ’re actually dealing with .
Even if the types are supposed to fit into some pattern , most IDEs cannot give you any code - completion while you ’re writing a template class .
There is a feature in KDevelop4 to recover you from that misery though .
So consider the following screenshot :
You see a very simple template class called TemplateClass .
Within its member function , you can not have any code- completion for the template type T , because it is unknown .
However if you put the cursor above one of the instantiations at the bottom , in our case above “ TemplateClass < Struct1 > ” , and push the shortcut to jump to its declaration , then KDevelop will remember that you ’re interested in that specific instantiation , and will give you total correct code - completion for that instantiation within that class :
Development Status
Apart from those features , I ’ve worked a bit more on the backend , and fixed a lot of thread - safety and stability issues .
This went so far that now , after a very long single - threaded time , I have enabled multi- threaded parsing again .
This also leads to faster reparsing and re-highlighting while editing the document , because one parsing - thread is reserved only for parsing triggered by user - input .
The United States of America has attacked Syria , Iraq 's neighbor to the West .
" A U.S. military official said the raid by special forces targeted the network of al - Qaida - linked foreign fighters moving through Syria into Iraq . "
The attack , which Syria decried as " serious aggression " resulted in the deaths of eight civilians ;
" The government said civilians were among the dead , including four children . "
According to the MSNBC article the Syrian border is loosely controlled in comparison to the shared border 's with Saudi Arabia and Jordan , two of Iraq 's other neighbors .
US Major General John Kelly stated that the US is helping to construct a series of sand burms and ditches between the Iraq - Syria border .
He then went on to say that " there has n't been much , in the way of a physical barrier , along that border for years . "
Is the grand answer a wall ?
I thought Reagan 's greatest accomplishment was supposed to be the destruction of the Berlin wall , where he famously declared : Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall . "
But now his party seems content to rebuild it .
Why on earth would the Bush administration order an attack on Syria nine days before the election ?
There are two scenarios ; either Bush believes this escalation will help McCain or he believes that McCain is so far behind that his only resort is to leave Obama with a bigger problem .
I 'm still disregarding a possibility however ; perhaps this attack was actually the right course of action .
Or not .
Any attack that could be carried out now , could be carried out in nine days , after the election .
The timing of this attack illustrates its intention .
What made this attack imperative ?
The apparent reasoning follows , as quoted from the MSNBC article : " The area targeted is near the Iraqi border city of Qaim , which had been a major crossing point for fighters , weapons and money coming into Iraq to fuel the Sunni insurgency . "
If the US government just realized rebels were entering Iraq through the borders they are absolutely stupid .
They should have known this already , and as such they could have conducted such a raid anytime within the last three years .
The White House 's supportive reasoning behind this attack illustrates its intention .
The intention of this attack was not in America 's best interest , but rather George Bush's .
This October surprise will not help John McCain , whether intended or not , for two reasons .
The first is the youth vote ; McCain already stands to lose by a considerable margin among this demographic , and war usually drives the youth turnout .
The second issue focuses on a mindset , the anti-war mindset of most Americans .
A poll conducted by CNN between 10/17 and 10/19 showed that 66 % of American 's already oppose the War in Iraq .
If you were one of the 66 % and have not decided who you are going to vote for , this attack on Syria is unlikely to push you towards McCain , regardless of his foreign policy experience .
The ramifications of this attack on Syria will not be good for America , for John McCain , and when history writes itself , for George W. Bush .

£ 3.8 trillion wiped off pensions globally
The worldwide pension crisis took a severe turn for the worse in 2008 as new research reveals that the value of global retirement funds collapsed by 19 % or $ 5 trillion ( £ 3.8trillion ) over the year .
Globally shaken : Some $ 5 trillion has been wiped off pensions around the biggest markets in the world
According to consultancy , Watson Wyatt , in 2008 , global institutional pension funds , in the 11 major markets plummeted from $ 25 trillion to around $ 20 trillion .
Roger Urwin , at Watson Wyatt , said : ' The pensions system is being tested on every level .
The ramifications of this global economic crisis will be played out for many years to come .
' Overall we see an industry facing a mountainous challenge . '
The decline in fund values is in sharp contrast to an average five - year growth rate , to the end of 2007 , of 12 % a year , taking assets back to below 2005 levels .
Pension assets now amount to 61 % of the average GDP down from 72 % , 10 years ago , which takes the measure back to levels last seen in 1996 .
How safe is your fin al salary pension ?
Urwin added : ' To meet the demographic crunch ahead , countries need the advanced funding of pensions to grow relative to the size of their economies .
This data shows a worrying picture .
' This is a wake - up call for governments worldwide to engineer bigger allocations to pension savings . '
Until 2007 , global pension assets had more than doubled in the previous decade , growing at an average of 7.1 % a year but the turmoil caused by the credit crunch has ravaged the average , which now stands at just 3.7 % .
Despite losing market share in the past decade , the US , Japan and the UK remain the largest pension markets in the world while Australia is the fastest growing .
All countries in 2008 endured significant losses in pension assets , except Germany which was helped by its high allocation away from stock markets and into bonds .
Watson Wyatt 's research follows a plethora of dismal news for pension funds , over the past year .
Notably , this week , the National Association of Pension Funds , concluded that in the UK , one in every four gold - plated final salary pension schemes will close their doors to existing workers during the next five years .
Former , Treasury pensions adviser , Dr Ros Altmann , said the news marked , ' the death knell ' for these lucrative schemes .
The trade body found that a quarter of leading firms admitted the credit squeeze would make final salary schemes too expensive to hold on to .
Some 90 % of the UK's 5.8 m public sector workers have final salary pensions , which promise to pay workers two - thirds of their salary in retirement and just 26 % of private sector final salary schemes are open to new members .

Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has had a miraculous escape in a high - speed car crash .
He suffered minor injuries to his legs , hand and back in the head - on collision during filming for the BBC show .
He described it as his first serious road traffic accident in 31 years .
Clarkson , 48 , said : " My right index finger looked like a burst sausage , my left shin was fatter than my thigh and my back felt like someone had driven over it with a pile - driver . "
In 2006 , his co-host Richard Hammond survived a 315 mph crash , also while filming .
Yesterday , from their Cotswolds home in Chipping Norton , Clarkson 's wife Frances said : " My husband is fine . "
A bipartisan Senate report concluded that decisions by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld were a " direct cause " of inhumane treatment of POWs .
The report , endorsed by Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee , is the most forceful denunciation to date of the role that Rumsfeld and other top officials played in the prisoner abuse scandals of the last five years .
The document also challenges assertions by senior Bush administration officials that the most egregious cases of prisoner mistreatment were isolated incidents of appalling conduct by U.S. troops .
" The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 was not simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own , " the report says .
Instead , the document says , a series of high - level decisions in the Bush administration " conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees in U.S. military custody . "

US Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen thought she was being hoaxed when a man who sounded a lot like Barack Obama called her - so she hung up on him .
In fact , the man at the other end of the line was indeed President - elect Obama himself .
It took two further phone - calls before Ms Ros-Lehtinen was convinced that the telephone call was genuine .
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was recently fooled by a DJ pretending to be French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
' I wo n't be punked ' " I thought it was one of the radio stations in South Florida playing an incredible , elaborate , terrific prank on me , " Ms Ros-Lehtinen told the Miami Herald newspaper .
" They 've gotten Hugo Chavez and others to fall for their tricks .
I said , ' Oh , no , I wo n't be punked ' . "
Mr Obama was calling to congratulate her on her re-election , and to say that he looked forward to working with her in her role as the most senior Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Relations Committee .
After a minute or so , Ms Ros-Lehtinen cut Mr Obama off , telling him she was not fooled by the hoax and that he was a better Obama impersonator than Fred Armisen , the man who does an impression of Mr Obama on the TV comedy show Saturday Night Live .
Shortly afterwards , Mr Obama 's Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel called Ms Ros-Lehtinen back to persuade her to take the call , but she hung up on him as well .
It was only when Howard Berman , a fellow member of her committee , called her that she was persuaded to take the call .
" I asked Howard to tell me a private joke we share about colleagues in the House to make sure it really was him , " Ms Ros-Lehtinen said .
" When he did , I realised it was the real deal . "
Mr Obama then called her back , and was amused by the incident , according to Ms Ros-Lehtinen .
" He laughed a lot , saying ' in Chicago they do it all the time - I do n't blame you for being sceptical ' . "
The pair then had a constructive discussion about foreign affairs , according to the congresswoman .

With coral reefs as their tea leaves , scientists are forecasting that in the next several decades there will be another major earthquake along the Sunda fault off Sumatra like the one that spawned the catastrophic tsunami of Dec. 26 , 2004 .
Image A reef exposed in what may be the start of a cycle of quakes .
Credit ...
Science
Kerry Sieh , formerly of the California Institute of Technology and now at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore , and colleagues write in the journal Science that a 2007 quake along a more southerly stretch of the fault represented only a first , partial rupture of that 400 - mile section , which had been quiet for nearly two centuries .
The researchers say this part of the fault , called the Mentawai section , is likely to be the site of at least one more major rupture .
As evidence , they point to the growth patterns of coral reefs in the region over the last 700 years .
When a quake occurs , the seafloor rises up , effectively lowering the sea level so that shallow coral reefs are now above the surface .
The reefs cannot grow upward , but their still - submerged portions grow outward .
ATLANTA --
Almost three decades later , Jimmy Carter recalls vividly what it was like trying to get Americans to turn down their thermostats and kick the oil habit .
" It was like gnawing on a rock , " the former president says .
Now President - elect Barack Obama is heading to Washington with a set of energy goals as ambitious as Mr. Carter 's back ...
I 've been working on a few collaborative side - projects in my spare time which has ended up requiring several servers provisioned by a couple of different providers .
The majority of them are Slicehost VMs but we also use Bytemark as a way of distributing risk for the unlikely event that the entire Slicehost network is suddenly unavailable , which means we have a fail - over for access to backups and a mirror of our entire wiki .
In order to manage the configuration of all of these machine I use Puppet to handle both server configuration and base - line software installation and set - up of all of our servers .
Here 's a diagram of the rough layout :
Puppet is a centralised server management tool written in Ruby which is available in Ubuntu stable repositories .
It has two main components ; a central service , the " puppetmaster " daemon and a client " puppet " service , which is installed on every machine that will take instructions from the puppetmaster .
It 's designed to apply configuration in an idempotent manner .
Idempotence in this case means that repeatedly applying rules will always result in the same outcome .
This is clearly a necessary requirement of anything that 's managing server configuration .
Installation
I wo n't go into detailed set - up instructions here - but you will find comprehensive instructions on the Puppet wiki .
Before you dive into installation read on to get more of a flavour for what 's possible with Puppet and why it 's awesome .
Once you have installed the puppet master set - up you can configure a puppet client for each server you want to manage .
Puppet has a neat system where each client is set - up with an SSL certificate so that all communication with the Puppetmaster is carried out securely .
Puppet Manifests
Manifests are the rules which define what puppet can do .
Manifests contain classes that can be subclassed to form a set of rules with inheritance .
Puppet is great at all system configuration tasks from managing configuration files , installing users , managing cron jobs , handling package installation etc .
It does this by abstracting the various tools for different server operating systems so that if you write a manifest that installs apache for example it will use the correct package management software whether you run that rule against a Redhat , Ubuntu or Solaris client .
Nodes
The way I 'm using puppet is to have a set of rules for each type of server that we run .
E.g : webservers and utility servers .
Each of this is a node .
If I need to set - up more hardware for any reason I can order a slice which will be set - up in a matter of minutes .
I can then install the puppet client , point it at the puppetmaster and configure it with the set of rules for a webserver and then within a couple of minutes that server will be running all of the necessary software ( apache / mod_wsgi/django / python ) along with all of our carefully tweaked configuration files .
This also means that we know that across all of our servers we are running the same configuration and software versions .
If a global config manifest is updated we know that the next time that puppet client updates it will pull in the changes and we can also configure an event to restart relevant services on update too .
What I like about this is that I 've only got to worry about setting things up once and then I can reproduce a stable set - up across as many servers as I want in a really short space of time .
Previously I did all of these things manually which has two disadvantages , one ; you spend lots of time carrying out the same set - up many times over for every machine .
Secondly , you end up with things being set - up inconsistently and prone to human error .
Consistency is very important when it comes to security .
Puppet can be used to provide hardening across all your machines by default which means that it 's impossible to forget or overlook basic security services .
When you put a box online it 's secured by default .
As each node is configured separately you can also set - up test nodes in order to test configurations before rolling them out to front - line machines .
This is much more re-assuring than just running updates and hoping for the best .
Also , test nodes can be built from Virtual Machines on your local development machine so you do n't even need to have slices for testing - albeit with the caveat that the hardware will of course be subtly different .
Types
Puppet has a concept of types which provide the means to handle all common configuration needs .
For example there 's package management for the installation / removal of specific packages .
There 's a type to handle user configuration .
There 's types for managing the creation of files / directories .
When using puppet it 's easy to get stuck and start relying on the Exec type to run shell - scripts so you can cover things you think puppet can't do .
This is fine when necessary but all I 'd say is make sure that puppet really can't do what you 're doing with the shell - script as the built - in types are likely to be a lot more robust and well thought out .
What I do n't like about Puppet
It should be pretty clear from what I 've said that I think puppet rocks .
However there are couple of small flys in the ointment .
The first one is that puppet rules are written in a Domain Specific Language which is a bit like an amalgam between JSON and PHP .
It 's nice enough to use once you get used to it and has solid features like subclassing and functions , but personally I 'd prefer it if it was Python .
This of course is really unlikely to happen unless someone chooses to write a clone of Puppet in Python which pretty much amounts to wishful thinking on my part .
Overall the puppet language does n't really get in the way too much and I 'm generally finding it to be a non-issue the more I use it .
The second problem is the memory overhead of the client process .
I do n't run the clients on each server permanently ( they default to looking for updates every 30 minutes ) as I prefer to run updates manually via cron at a wider interval .
This saves them sitting there taking up memory when they 're not pulling updates from the master .
Memory footprint may well have been addressed in more recent versions but I 'm sticking to a policy of using the version available through the stable repo .
Though I may consider using a PPA ( Personal Package Archive ) to provide a more recent version .
( PPAs are a way of creating personal repositories for Ubuntu through launchpad.net )
Lastly , in the version I 'm using if you make a mistake in the syntax of a puppet rule when you try and apply the rules to the target node nothing happens .
When what you expect to happen does n't , it 's almost always a sign you 've made syntactical errors .
If you restart the puppet master and re-run the update on the client - only then will you see an error message relating to the problem .
If you hit this problem and it annoys you then this recipe provides a way to know about syntax errors in your manifests .
Conclusion
I really like puppet and it's saved me from spending lots of weekends slaving over a hot terminal .
I 'd highly recommend it to anyone who is running more than one server or might do so in the future .
Whilst learning the DSL for manifests takes a little time the learning curve is not too steep and it's well worth investing that time as it will save lots of headaches in the long run .
In a research note titled " Foreclosure Update : over 8 million foreclosures expected " ( no link , hat tip Frank ) updated last week , Credit Suisse analysts are now forecasting 8.1 million homes will be in foreclosure by the end of 2012 , representing 16 % of all households with mortgages .
The analysts projected this could be as low as 6.3 million in a mild recession , with a somewhat successful loan modification program ( re - default rates at around 40 % ) , and as high as 10.2 million in a more severe recession .
Note : the Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan noted this morning that re-defaults rates appear to be well in excess of 50 % for recent mods , much higher than the hoped for 40 % .
What really stood out in the forecast was the shift from mostly subprime foreclosures to non-subprime ( Alt - A and Prime ) foreclosures .
This fits with some of the housing themes we 've been discussing - that foreclosures will now be moving up the price chain .
Click on graph for larger image in a new window .
This graph shows the Credit Suisse estimate of loans in Foreclosure and REO as of Sept 2008 ( in blue ) and their base forecast for new foreclosures by the end of 2012 , for both subprime and other mortgages ( Alt - A and Prime ) .
Credit Suisse believes 2008 will be the peak year for subprime foreclosures , although subprime foreclosures will remain elevated over the next few years .
However they are forecasting a significant increase in foreclosures over the next couple of year for non-subprime loans .
When I spoke at the Inman Real Estate conference in July 2008 , I suggested that real estate agents should expect increasing foreclosures in high end areas .
As I 've previously mentioned , my comments were greeted with incredulity .
I wonder if views have changed ?
We 're all subprime now !
Myth 1 . Snoring ’s not that big a deal .
Sawing logs can feel good , even if it does annoy your woman to no end .
Besides , real men snore .
It ’s what we do .
It ’s a sign of vigor , right ?
Um , not so fast .
The truth is that snoring can indicate serious health problems .
How serious ?
Studies have found that snoring associates with hypertension , obesity , and a condition known as sleep apnea , in which your airway shuts off and you literally starve your brain of oxygen … forcing you to gasp for breath … and then the horrible snoring cycle starts all over again .
Snorers who live with sleep apnea are at greater risk of stroke and heart attack .
On top of that , snoring can strain relationships , unless you ’re dating a weirdo who for whatever reason digs listening to your snoring .
They probably also watch you while you sleep .
Creepy .
Either way , the solution is not just better earplugs for your bedmate – it ’s to get to a doctor ASAP .
Myth 2 . Fido and Fifi never have insomnia .
Your loyal dog , cat , hamster , lizard , moose , or spotted peacock may seem to enjoy copious amounts of shuteye – especially compared to your sleep - starved self .
But before you go trying to swap places with your favorite furry friend like some bad Freaky Friday remake consider this : animals get insomnia just like humans do .
B’lieve it .
Scientists in a recent study attempted to breed insomnia in fruit flies .
And it worked .
They discovered that the flies with enhanced insomniac traits were more apt to stumble around ( or get swatted ) and had a worse memory than their better rested counterparts .
So while you picture tiny insomniac fruit flies stumbling around like little drunks who forgot their way home , remember this is factual .
They studied it .
This is science dammit .
Animals do n’t sleep any better than you .
Myth 3 .
You gotta get 8 hours of sleep or you ’re screwed .
The amount of sleep you need varies from day - to - day and from stage to stage in your life .
Teens need more than adults .
Babies sleep crazy hours .
Senior citizens do n’t need to sleep at all as long as they can veg watching CNN for a few hours ( they love them some Lou Dobbs – why ? ) .
It ’s not even clear that human beings are evolved to sleep in full blocks eight hour blocks .
Our crazy modern world forces us to sleep at night and make widgets all day .
Naps are for babies and stoners and old folks , say we .
But is that natural ?
It may be healthier to sleep in several blocks a day .
Some European cultures , for instance , emphasize the “ siesta ” – a two hour nap ( or sex break , for the ambitious ) taken in the middle of the day .
Of course , Europeans seem to enjoy more facets of life than Americans do , and stressing over that might be what ’s keeping you up at night to begin with .
Myth 4 .
You need to make up missed sleep .
Only slept a few hours last night , and need to ‘ make up ’ the hours you missed ?
Need to catch zzz ’s ASAP to get back on schedule ?
Then feast your eyes on this technical debunking of Myth # 4 :
The sleep system is homeostatic – it self - regulates .
If you sleep less than your body wants you ’ll naturally restore balance to the system the following nights .
But it ’s not a simple calculus .
If you miss an hour on Monday , you wo n’t just “ make up ” that hour on Thursday .
The body and brain adjust .
That said , if you starve your body of sleep for a long period , you can damage the neural apparatus in your brain that controls your sleep cycle .
Not to mention making you susceptible to temporary insanity .
Tell it to the judge .
Myth 5 .
You do n’t fall asleep “ all at once ” – you drift away .
Wrong .
The Sandman kicks your ass every night .
Unless you have crazy insomnia or a sleep disorder , you literally “ go out like a light . ”
One minute you ’re here , next minute you ’re gone .
If you ’re a geek with waaay too much time on your hands and some fancy - schmancy sleep machines , you can actually graph the differences among your waking , hypnogogic , and sleeping states and pinpoint precisely when you shift consciousness .
Myth 6 . Sleepy during the day ?
You must be sleep deprived .
If you ’re tired , you need sleep .
So saith our good friend Captain Obvious .
Think again , Captain .
Drowsiness or fatigue can be caused by an enormous variety of factors , including disease , malnutrition , stress , pollution , psychosomatic disorders , a rambling girlfriend , college , a boring job , hard partying , or staying up past 3 AM to write an article while crashing hard from 4 Red Bulls and a Vyvance that did n’t counteract last night ’s all - nighter like they were supposed to .
Snap out of it .
Here are 10 free tools I use almost daily for my blog .
1. Picasa
Via my brother Kris , I learned the benefits of Picasa , a free download from Google .
Picasa lets you store all pictures on your hard drive in a library and perform basic editing like cropping , tone adjustment and watermarking .
But I use it the most to compress pictures in size and quality before posting them on my blog so the download speed is reduced .
Picasa also allows you to synchronize all your pictures with your online library .
2. Flickr
I store all my picture on Flickr a free online service by Yahoo .
They have a small tool which lets you right - click on any picture to add it to an upload batch .
Pictures are organised in folders and refered to by an URL .
Flickr provides basic online editing with Picnik .
You can publish pictures for the whole Flickr community allowing comments , grouping , ...
3. Google Analytics
There are many free web statistics tools available , but the most well - featured is probably Google Analytics .
It provides deep analysis of your blog visitors , top content , referral sites , search keywords , etc. .
All data can be displayed in a wide array of graphs and can be exported in a spreadsheet or PDF .
3. Woopra
For a different flavour of web activity monitoring , try Woopra .
While still running in Beta , this tool monitors activity on your blog or website in real time .
It consists of a small script on your page and a downloaded tool for your PC .
Woopra shows your visitors as they come in ( with all usual details such as browser , country , referral site , etc.. ) and navigate through your site , tracing the visited pages .
More than a curiosity or a ' big brother ' tool , Woopra comes in handy e.g. to check which of your posts propagate visitors through your site rather than have them bounce off after the first read .
Woopra also offers the standard summarized and graphed page visits , referrals , user characteristics , .. but in real time .
Handy comes in the user tagging tool , alerting you when a particular user comes in .
Allows you to catch the spammers .
4 . A menu bar generator
The drop down menu bar you see atop this blog , is made with the CSS Menu Generator by WonderWebWare .

The pop star : VV Brown
by Fiona Sturges
On paper , 24 - year - old VV Brown certainly has the makings of a star – beauty , a big voice and , crucially , the backing of a major record label .
Add to that her penchant for retro-soul and success on a huge scale seems a foregone conclusion .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yet Vanessa , as VV was once known , is no mere Winehouse - a- like .
Where the past few years have heralded the rise of bee - hived girls singing Dusty torch songs , Brown takes the glamour and pizzazz of Sixties girl groups ( check out the retro flat - top ! ) and imbues it with an indie - punk edge , a sound that she has artfully described as " musical mashed potatoes " .
And confounding the norm of soul singers backed by expensive writing and production teams , Brown can take credit for writing , producing and performing songs on her forthcoming debut album Travelling Like the Light .
One of six siblings born and raised in Northampton , Vanessa was weaned on a diet of Aretha Franklin , Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie .
She studied piano from the age of five , sang in the church choir and turned down a place at the London School of Economics in order to sign her first record deal .
She upped sticks and moved to LA in the process but was ill at ease with the R&B diva role the record company had carved out for her .
Two years later , after stints singing backing vocals for Madonna and the Pussycat Dolls , she returned to London to start over .
She rented a flat , bought a one - stringed guitar from a second - hand shop and wrote " Crying Blood " , a cheerful confection that blends the bluesy croon of La Winehouse with the barmy spirit of Bobby Pickett 's novelty hit " Monster Mash " .
The song is just one in a collection of deliriously upbeat , doo - wop numbers to be found on Travelling Like the Light .
It is , VV says , the album she wanted to make all along .
This is her second stab at success , and this time around she 's taking no prisoners .
The broadcaster : Rachel Riley
by Ian Burrell
Fresh out of Oriel College , Oxford , with a masters in mathematics , 22 - year - old Rachel Riley is the new Carol Vorderman , taking on the role of human calculator in the revamped Channel 4 afternoon quiz Countdown .
Riley was planning on a career in marketing but beat 1,000 rival applicants to the Countdown job where she will work alongside the dry - witted Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling .
If she really can get her consonants in a line and follow Vorderman 's career path , then the potential rewards are immense .
Vorderman was on £ 1 m per annum , though she quit the job earlier this year after being asked to take a 90 per cent pay cut .
Riley 's starting salary of £ 100,000 a year is hefty enough for someone straight out of university .
" This is the best graduate job in the world , " she says .
" There 's only one cool maths job around and I was lucky enough to get it . "
For the Countdown auditions , Rachel and other applicants were tested on their maths skills , having to answer complex sums within 30 seconds – with the Countdown clock music in the background to add to the pressure .
She was then shortlisted alongside five other candidates who took part in screen tests in Leeds .
Expect Riley to become a cult figure with undergraduates – a key Countdown demographic – next year .
Like most students she was an obsessive watcher of the show , formerly hosted by Richard Whiteley , Des Lynam and Des O'Connor .
" I 've had the Countdown theme as my mobile - phone ringtone for years , " she says .
" Prior to my audition I bought five Countdown puzzle books and tackled over 500 different numbers games in order to hone my skills . "
If the new series is a success , expect Channel 4 to explore further television projects with Riley to broaden her profile .

The novelist : Richard Milward
by Boyd Tonkin
From the heyday of Hockney to the age of Emin , art - school mavericks have made waves in British culture that break far beyond the world of galleries and dealers .
Since the 1950s , the art tribe has taught other fearless spirits – in pop , fiction or film – that the weary distinctions between " high " and " low " culture can fall down with a single well - aimed shove .
Richard Milward , a 24 - year - old graduate of Central St Martins college , belongs in this anti-tradition of fence - smashing provocateurs whose aesthetics mix trash and transcendence .
Milward 's debut novel , Apples , won praise from Irvine Welsh for its sink - estate Garden of Eden peopled by temptation - prone teenagers .
He is now at work on the screenplay – and in February , Faber & Faber publishes his second book , a novel whose profane but touching cocktail of anarchy and artistry will surely brand it the Trainspotting of modern Middlesborough .
Apart from a brief , nightmarish trip to London , Ten Storey Love Song mostly unfolds in and around a cosmetically renovated high - rise .
Here , the wasted young painter Bobby struggles to pursue his outsider art , and to rekindle his passion for girlfriend Georgie in the face of endless drug - related distractions .
His mates in Peach House , Johnnie and Ellen , struggle to keep their love alive as bad sex as well as substances and suspicions pull them apart .
Elsewhere in the tower , the unsavoury truck driver Alan repels his neighbours as a sad – and maybe bad – loner but nurses secrets no one else can share .
Not since Georges Perec 's eccentric classic Life : A User 's Manual has a block of flats given cult fiction such an engagingly offbeat home .
Comic , erotic , candid but charming , Ten Storey Love Song unspools over 280 pages in a single virtuoso paragraph .
Milward gleefully slathers drugs , sex and rock 'n ' roll all over his canvas but a sort of innocence prevails .
Repelled by the creepy London art and media scene , Bobby flees back to Middlesbrough and reflects that fame is all about " getting lots of initial success and then a slow decline into mediocrity and backlash and paranoia " .
He will speak for readers whose heads may be lost in creative space but whose feet remain happily stuck on planet Earth .
The opera singer : Vuyani Mlinde
by Michael Church
When Vuyani Mlinde is on stage , you do n't take your eyes off him : the timbre of voice and vividness of performance demand attention .
Now recognised as a rising star among bass - baritones , this unassuming 28 - year - old South African is making his mark with all the big baritone roles , from Leporello and the Commendatore in Don Giovanni to the philosopher Colline in La Bohème .
His beginnings in Bloemfontein were musically inauspicious .
" When I was 12 , the teacher in charge of the choir made us all stand up , " he recalls .
" And when she came to me , she suddenly said , ' You are in my choir , come at 2.30 this afternoon ' .
I was surprised , because football was what interested me , but for some reason she knew I would be a bass . "
He turned up , sang hymns and traditional songs " and when my voice broke at 15 I knew I already had a nice instrument , though I did n't know how to use it , and it never occurred to me that I could make a career from it " .
An astute voice - coach offered him free lessons , after which he sang the evil Sparafucile in Rigoletto , went on a tour of Australia , landed a scholarship at London 's Royal College of Music , and the rest is history .
He 's still passionately involved with his roots : he 's just come back from Pretoria , where his community choir had invited him to join them as soloist for a new Zulu Mass .
And he agrees that African voices are special : " They have a lot of strength .
The musical talent in South Africa is huge , but most of the time people do n't know they have talent – as I did n't .
They can bring something different to European music . "
As he is doing .
" I just wish that what I am doing here could be seen in my country . "
Hopefully one day it will .
The environmentalist : Matt Shardlow
by Michael McCarthy
The environmentalist with the most conspicuous rising reputation in Britain looks after the lowliest of wildlife .
Matt Shardlow is Britain 's champion of invertebrates – insects , spiders , worms , snails and the rest of " the little things that rule the world " .
Although Britain has a long and noble tradition of entomologists and other specialists in mini-beasts , Matt is director of a pioneering body that looks out for the interests of all of them – Buglife , the invertebrate conservation charity .
His voice is increasingly being heard , not least as concern is growing nationally about the alarming declines in populations of insects such as butterflies , moths and bees , and this year Buglife has figured in two prominent High Court challenges to the development of an insect - rich brownfield site in the Thames Estuary , West Thurrock Marshes .
This appears to be the first - ever High Court case fought out over insect welfare ; it is a test case of the duty of public bodies to have regard to wildlife , but also an indication of how our view of what is important in the natural world has broadened from pandas and tigers ( final judgment was still awaited at the time of our going to press ) .
Matt , 37 , has loved all invertebrates , from ladybirds to slugs , since he was a child in Sussex .
An environmental science graduate , he formerly looked after wildlife other than birds for the RSPB , but since 2004 has concentrated full time on invertebrate campaigning at Buglife 's head .
As he points out , they are worth fighting for as they make up the majority of living things in Britain – there are about 40,000 invertebrate species ( including 28,000 insects ) in the full roll - call of 70,000 species in this country .
He is recognised by his peers as one of the strongest green campaigning voices to emerge in years .
The artist : Petros Chrisostomou
by Michael Glover
The giant , full - colour photographs of Petros Chrisostomou put you in mind of the magical world of Alice in Wonderland as it was realised by Sir John Tenniel , the first and still the greatest of Lewis Carroll 's illustrators .
Tenniel plays with scale in order to alarm and amuse us , simultaneously – the Red Queen 's face looms horribly out at us , disproportionately large ;
Alice herself drinks a potion that causes her to grow and grow until her body is squeezed up against the ceilings .
Chrisostomou , who graduated with an MA in Fine Art from London 's Royal Academy schools last summer after a first degree at Central St Martins , does something similar in his photographs .
He takes objects with which we are all too familiar – a high - heeled shoe or two ; some eggs ; a head of blonde hair – and he plays with scale to such an extent that they look monstrously large in their contexts .
The consequence of this is that they turn into the stuff of dreams – sometimes playful ones , at other times nightmarish .
The perfectly ordinary object becomes wholly extraordinary .
The known world , with all its paraphernalia , becomes an unreal construction , a kind of bizarre still - life .
As in Alice , the objects he concentrates on – a buckled frankfurter ; scraps of doner - kebab meat – suddenly seem to take on a reality of their own .
Too small for the spaces they occupy , they want to disrupt them , burst out of them , shoulder them aside .
" I started making things as a child in north Finchley during the 1980s , " he tells me .
His mother had come to England from Cyprus in the 1970s ; his father was born in Swindon .
" That was before the world of computer games .
It was a time when you had to invent your own imaginative worlds by putting a blanket over a couple of chairs , simple things like that . "
Next year already promises to be a busy one .
Several group shows are under discussion , and in November he has his first solo exhibition at the Ceri Hand Gallery in Liverpool .
He has also won the Royal Academy / Land Securities award for 2009 , which will give him free studio space at 48 Oxford Street for a year , a bursary and an exhibition in June .
The playwright : Lucy Kirkwood
by Alice Jones
Meet Lucy Kirkwood , a young playwright with a singular – and just a little bit dark – dramatic vision .
Her first play , Tinderbox , was described as " Joe Orton 's Entertaining Mr Sloane as rewritten by the League of Gentleman " while her bold , rip-roaring take on Hedda Gabler , at the Gate Theatre , transposed Ibsen 's classic drama to 21st - century Notting Hill where , instead of flinging Lovborg 's manuscript on the fire , in a thrilling coup de théâtre , Hedda gulped down the memory chip containing his life 's work .
Kirkwood was midway through a degree in English at Edinburgh when she took a surprise call from Caryl Churchill 's agent , Mel Kenyon , requesting a meeting .
It turned out that her short play Grady Hot Potato , having been rejected by the National Student Drama Festival , had been passed to the jury of the prestigious PMA award – and Kenyon and her fellow judges had deemed it a worthy winner .
From there she received her first two professional commissions , from the National Theatre studio ( a work still in progress ) and the Bush , where Tinderbox opened in April .
It was while holed away " like a hermit " in Northumberland , writing the dystopian fairytale Tinderbox , that she took another surprising call , this time from the producers of Skins , asking her to join their writing team .
Kirkwood did n't have a TV at the time and had never heard of the hit teen soap .
" My sister , who is much younger and trendier than me , could n't believe it ... "
For now she 's hard at work on a couple of new theatre commissions , a new episode of Skins and a TV script for Kudos .
Who 's her inspiration ?
" I like playwrights who deal with big ideas , " she says .
" Caryl Churchill does it with humour and delicacy but she 's also kind of cut - throat .
If I were to aspire to one thing , it 's that quality . "
The chef : Rachel Humphrey
by Madeleine Lim
There 's a new face at the helm of the two - Michelin - starred French restaurant Le Gavroche in London 's Mayfair – and she 's a woman .
Rachel Humphrey , 30 , formerly senior sous chef at the restaurant , was recently named head chef ; the first woman to gain such a position in the restaurant 's 42 - year history .
But she 's much too clever – and honest – to be lured into idle speculation on the subject of whether the small number of female chefs in the UK is due to a lack of talent or a shortage of opportunity .
" I 'm not really sure why Britain 's restaurant industry is male - dominated , " she says , " but there are certainly more and more opportunities for women chefs these days .
As far as I 'm concerned , what 's most important is to prove yourself in the kitchen , whatever your sex .
The kitchen environment can be aggressive , but I learnt that the best way to be respected in the kitchen was to make sure that I never gave the guys any ammunition against me . "
Humphrey joined the restaurant as an apprentice straight out of school in 1996 .
" I got lucky with the timing .
I wrote off to loads of restaurants and when I got an acceptance letter from Le Gavroche , I felt I was destined to work there . "
Encouraged by chef- patron Michel Roux , she quickly rose through the ranks , despite a three - year absence when she left the restaurant to work in the less rarefied atmosphere of the RAF catering corps – " I needed to gain confidence and experience and I had always wanted to work in the army . "
She 's treating her new post at Le Gavroche with typical understatement , and is winning new customers over with her subtle , warming dishes including a wintry creamy pheasant and lentil soup .
" I 'm just trying to keep up the same high standards . "
But she admits she is also deftly , subtly , lightening up the menu : " I 'm trying to make the lunch menu a little less masculine , replacing some of the heavy butter sauces with delicate jus whippings . "
A woman 's touch , perhaps ?
" Not really , " she says .
" It just depends on your personality – I know some guys who have a wonderfully delicate touch and other female chefs who are really heavy - handed .
All I know is that I 've got 40 years of tradition to live up to ! "
The politician : Chuka Umunna
by Andrew Grice
Chuka Umunna is not a household name yet , even within his own party , but he is winning rave reviews as one of the next generation of Labour politicians .
He is not an MP , but has a strong chance of becoming one at the next general election having been chosen as Labour 's candidate in Streatham , south London , where he has lived all his life .
The highly articulate 30 - year - old employment lawyer is even tipped by some senior Labour figures as the man who could be the next leader to take the party to an election victory .
It is not a label he would welcome , since history is littered with ex -" future leaders " .
Umunna will want to be known as a " Labour MP " rather than a " black MP " .
He does not want to be seen as " Labour 's Barack Obama " , even though party colleagues see him as an inspirational figure too .
He was ecstatic about Obama 's election victory , saying : " Words can not express how happy I am . "
He has noted that they have one thing in common – a strange name .
He will try to avoid the media limelight , and is anxious to avoid the fate of David Lammy , the black Skills Minister , who struggled to live up to his billing after being tipped as a future Labour leader .
Umunna is no fan of New Labour , a brand that might well be out of fashion after an election defeat .
A free - thinker , he disliked the " on message " control - freakery of the Blair era .
He is on the board of Compass , the left - wing pressure group , and has urged Gordon Brown to be bold by adopting policies such as a windfall tax on energy companies .
Although untested at a high level , he is seen as charming and ambitious .
Friends say he is on the party 's soft or pragmatic left and will gravitate towards its mainstream as he rises up the political ladder .
The comedian : Barunka O'Shaughnessy
by James Rampton
Barunka O'Shaughnessy once worked in a jam factory in order to make ends meet .
It was mind - numbing work .
" My job was to pick up any jam - jars that had fallen over , " she recollects , " but one only fell over every five hours .
I was going mad there ! "
Her professional career certainly started quietly .
In 1999 , she played a drugged - up girl in Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson 's much - loved sitcom , Spaced , " for about a minute " .
She went on to take parts such as Checkout Girl in The Mighty Boosh , Woman Extra in Extras and Waitress in Absolute Power .
Such anonymity , however , seems unlikely to befall O'Shaughnessy in the future .
The performer , whose unusual name reflects her Czech and Irish parentage , looks set to break through to the major leagues in the coming year .
A graduate of Cambridge University , where she was friends with the double act of David Mitchell and Robert Webb , O'Shaughnessy has penned material for Jonathan Ross , Matt Lucas , Sally Phillips , Phill Jupitus and John Thomson .
She is now writing for School of Comedy , a new Channel 4 series in which grown - up sketches are performed by youngsters .
But it's as a performer that O'Shaughnessy is really making her mark .
After two well - received Edinburgh shows , she appeared on the Paramount Comedy Channel as an Eastern European prostitute and enjoyed a successful run in the much - lauded sketch troupe at Ealing Live !.
She then landed a big break , appearing as Avid Merrion 's ( Leigh Francis ) wife ( and sister ! ) , Sacha , on C4's cult - com Bo ' Selecta .
O'Shaughnessy has since been a regular on C4's Bremner , Bird and Fortune and been reunited with her old university pals on BBC2's That Mitchell and Webb Look .
In addition , she has starred as another Eastern European prostitute in Five 's brothel - set sitcom , Respectable .
" I was in danger of being typecast , " she laughs .
Now she is one of four performers in E4's new all - female sketch show , Beehive , which has been compared to both Smack the Pony and French and Saunders .
All in all , 2008 has been quite a year for O'Shaughnessy – and 2009 promises to be even better .
The designer : Tom Price
by Clare Dwyer Hogg
When Kanye West says he likes your chair on his blog – before you 've even graduated – that 's probably not a bad start to your career .
Tom Price 's Meltdown Chair was one of his final pieces before graduating from the Royal College of Art in 2007 – a month later , he landed his first major commission ( he got the call when he was on the beach ) : the Metropolitan Works in east London wanted him to create a design around their new building .
He clad the building in 40 perforated panels – a symbol of old technology , perfectly stamped , very regimented – and liquefied them , so the holes melted .
" I wanted to express the capacities of the centre , so they became swirling patterns – like a large abstract painting , " he says .
The project , Price says generously , was a " huge learning experience " , thanks to public liability requirements : once the panels were produced , he was told the holes could n't be larger than 10 mm in diameter , with the bridges between the holes at 3 mm .
" Because the holes were organically produced , that meant I had to go back and change every line , every circle – hundreds and thousands of them , " he laughs .
The building will finally be unveiled in February ; after this sisyphusian task , what next ?
There 's Oliver Sweeney 's shop window that he 's taking over in New Bond Street to display new pieces of furniture , also in February .
" I see myself lying somewhere between art and design , " he says .
" I am very much dealing with the three - dimensional . "
Keep your eyes open for his work – something tells us it wo n't be long before his fan base is made up of rather more than a global hip - hop star .

The actress : Rebecca Hall
by Jonathan Romney
Last May , at the Cannes press conference for Woody Allen 's new film , all the talk was of Penelope Cruz and Scarlett Johansson , until journalists started to ask , " Who 's the English actress ? "
That actress is Rebecca Hall , and she comprehensively steals the show in Allen 's Vicky Cristina Barcelona .
She plays an uptight American abroad , and her spiky performance has earned her a nomination in the forthcoming Golden Globes .
Cannes exposure was a heady experience for 26 - year - old Hall , but it was n't her first screen success .
She made her film debut in the 2006 Britcom Starter for 10 , then made a strong impression in The Prestige .
The daughter of Sir Peter Hall and the opera singer Maria Ewing , Hall is sceptical about being tipped as a face of 2009 : " I 've been on ' next ' lists for the past five years . "
But it 's hard to imagine Hall being anything other than extremely visible next year .
She 'll also be seen in Ron Howard 's Frost / Nixon ; in a new version of Dorian Gray ; and in a Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace 's brutal Red Riding murder novels .
Much of Hall 's year will be spent on stage : she is taking part , with a company including Ethan Hawke and Simon Russell Beale , in the Bridge Project , a marathon initiative that will tour Sam Mendes ' productions of The Cherry Orchard and A Winter 's Tale .
" It 's kind of crazy but exciting , and illuminating – how the plays resonate with each other is endlessly fascinating . "
Hall is taking a break from filming for a while : the Bridge Project will keep her busy up to August .
How will she sustain her energies through all that ?
" Ask me in a couple of months , " she laughs .
" I 've got no idea . "
' Frost / Nixon ' is released on 23 January ; ' Vicky Cristina Barcelona ' on 6 February .
The Bridge Project opens at the Old Vic in May .
The fashion designer : Nasir Mazhar
by Harriet Walker
I try to create a world for myself , but I know real life subconsciously seeps in and has its effect , " declares Nasir Mazhar , currently the brightest star in London 's galaxy of young designer talent , and the creator of the spiked headguard that Madonna sported on her recent Dazed & Confused cover shot .
The 25 - year - old headgear designer started out as a hair - stylist with Vidal Sassoon before turning to theatrical design to fulfil his desire to work in a more highly conceptualised way .
His work ethic is as idiosyncratic as his personal aesthetic , and was evident in his spring / summer 2009 collection , showcased in an atmospheric presentation during September 's London Fashion Week .
Mazhar claims his main inspiration is the city he lives and works in , but he likes to weave stories for his pieces .
Mazhar 's blurring of the arcane and the modern comes together in a collection that swoops from dramatically draped medieval hennins and crimson cardinal hats , to Hannibal Lecter - esque muzzle masks and nuclear decontamination hoods and visors .
That presentation marked him out as part of an upsurge of creativity and methodology on the East End design scene that has eschewed the " street style " and " hipster " mentality , which has been so prominent on the Hoxton circuit , for something more fundamentally artisanal .
Mazhar rather quaintly refers to himself as a hatter – not a milliner , who would traditionally trims hats , rather than designing or creating them .
As such , any form of headgear is within his remit , and he has a passion for exploring not only the worn form , but also the space and shape surrounding the head .
This is especially true of one of his most recognisable pieces , the sequinned and face - obscuring cube headdress that topped off the opening look at Gareth Pugh 's spring / summer 2008 show .
The piece had become famous before most of the style press even knew Mazhar 's name .
It is Mazhar 's innate hybridisation and re-interpretation of ideas that last season won him coveted Topshop New Generation sponsorship , a financial support that will enable him to show again at Fashion Week in February .
The photographer : Michael Grieve
by Nick Hall
A brothel in Slough , a porn - film shoot in Peterborough , a swingers ' club in Sheffield – unlikely locations for some beautiful and tender photographs , but these are the sort of places featured in the 41 - year - old photographer Michael Grieve 's first book No Love Lost , which will be published by Images En Manoeuvres Editions next year .
Newcastle - born Grieve started working as a photographer for the music press in the 1980s before studying for an MA in photography at the University of Westminster .
Among his influences he cites the American William Eggleston and the Briton Chris Killip – whose 1980s book In Flagrante , which documented the effects of the de-industrialisation of the North East , had a particularly powerful effect on him .
" It 's simply one of the best books ever . "
" Sex is a great motivator , " Grieve says .
He 's interested in how people can engage in something so intimate which at the same time can mean absolutely nothing – as well as how this reflects on how we as " outsiders " ( presumably ! ) behave and " perform " in our own private lives .
He has spent the past six years travelling Britain photographing sex and the industry that surrounds it in its many forms .
As well as the tender portraits , there are unsettling photographs too – disturbing in their sense of the ugliness , the emptiness and banality of some of the situations .
" I wanted each photograph to be a different experience , as you go through the book you move from tender to cruel moments . "
He prefers film over digital – " I can't deal with all that " .
Although he is a contributing editor to the online contemporary photography magazine 1,000 Words , he believes that the book is the natural home for photography .
" It 's the whole experience , a place to contemplate " .
The film - makers : Christine Molloy & Joe Lawlor
by Jonathan Romney
The words " British cinema " and " art film " do n't usually go together .
But 2008 brought a surprise renaissance for idiosyncratic , highly crafted , defiantly non-mainstream UK - made films , from such names as Terence Davies ( Of Time and the City ) , the artist Steve McQueen ( Hunger ) and the newcomers Joanna Hogg ( Unrelated ) and Duane Hopkins ( Better Things ) .
Next in line is the duo of Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor .
Their debut feature , Helen , is a mystery thriller of sorts , about a young woman who volunteers to impersonate a missing girl in a police reconstruction .
Eerie and psychologically insightful , the film echoes TV cop dramas on one hand , and Antonioni 's glacial 1960s riddler Blow - Up on the other .
The duo met in Dublin in the early 1980s , and soon began operating under the banner Desperate Optimists .
Since then , they have worked in a range of media , including video , theatre , internet and radio .
" It 's been a meandering route , " Lawlor says .
" We were using any methods we could to explore ideas . "
Ten years ago , they moved away from the stage and started to concentrate on the camera .
As film - makers , Molloy and Lawlor are best known for their Civic Life project , a series of shorts , each shot in one day , using casts from community groups – notably Who Killed Brown Owl , a nine - minute single take in which an idyllic English afternoon collapses into chaos .
The team 's next project , Mister John , concerns a man who goes to Thailand to confront his brother 's demons .
" It 's imagining what would happen if my brother died , " says Lawlor .
" My name is Joe , I have a brother named John , he does live in Thailand ...
It 's just using some of our biography as a springboard . "
They plan to shoot Mister John this summer .
" It 'll be more ambitious [ than Helen ] – that or more excessive . "
' Helen ' is released on 17 April
The model : Amy Greenhaugh
by Harriet Walker
I 've been bombarded with fey , young - looking models for the past couple of years , " says Beth Dadswell , The Independent 's senior stylist , " so Amy Greenhough 's intriguing beauty really made her stand out from the crowd . "
Twenty - two - year - old Greenhough 's look combines the two classic idioms of fashion modelling : she has a natural beauty and poise that women want to emulate , and a magnetism that ensures your total attention to any shoot you see her in .
Spotted by Select Model Management two years ago , Greenhough delayed her modelling career to concentrate on her studies .
Now reading English literature and drama at Kingston University , her first shoot was with The Independent in October .
" As soon as I saw the first polaroid of Amy , " adds Dadswell , " I knew she had the potential to be really special . "
Her looks recall the quirky , gamine beauties of the Seventies , whose attractions lay in their idiosyncrasies and asymmetry ; Greenhough 's self - assured aesthetic chimes perfectly with the off - duty nonchalance floating around fashion right now , referenced in collections from the likes of Alexander Wang and Rick Owens , and perfected by French Vogue 's edgy fashion director Emmanuelle Alt .
Her kooky , indie girl - next - door features also tap into a resurgence on the catwalks of a sturdier and more unusual beauty , after seasons of doll - like cupid bows and arched eyebrows .
Alongside her university exams , she has been shooting recently in Milan for Italian Vogue and has worked with Steven Meisel in New York for the high - end American magazine , W. " I have no doubt she will be the face of at least one big European advertising campaign next year , " predicts Dadswell .
You saw her here first .
The athlete : Lisa Dobriskey
by James Lawton
For Lisa Dobriskey the Beijing Olympics might have been one of those breaking points which so regularly invite a young athlete to step back from the challenge that has consumed so much of their lives .
She had had the opportunity to reach out for the kind of achievement that made Kelly Holmes a Dame and Rebecca Adlington the instant darling of the British sports public .
A drug bust had stripped the women 's 1,500 metres of some of its most potent contenders , including the Russians Yelena Seboleva and Tatyana Tomashova .
But Dobriskey , who won Commonwealth gold two years ago , finished one place out of the medals .
" At such a time , " says Dobriskey , " it is hard to contain your disappointment .
You think of all the work you have done and all the optimism you took to the track . "
Then , if you are determined enough , you realign your ambitions and swear that you will do the work all over again .
" After Beijing I had to ask myself how much I wanted to taste the kind of success enjoyed by Kelly Holmes in Athens and the other British women who stood at the top of the podium . "
There are not so many : Holmes , Mary Rand , Ann Packer , Mary Peters , Tessa Sanderson , Sally Gunnell , Denise Lewis and Christine Ohuruogu .
Dobrisky saw Ohuruogu join the pantheon and realised the depth of her ambition .
You might think at the age of 24 Dobriskey has gone beyond the circle of gilded youth .
But on the track she remains almost a baby .
Holmes was 30 when she gained Olympic bronze at Sydney and she went to Athens under a shadow of persistent injury .
Dobriskey argues that she will bounce back stronger from her disappointment .
It is a resolve that will make her one of the most compelling stories of London 2012 .

In recent days , the news had broken that the previous month Navy airmen and others had gone wild — engaging in sexual molestation , out - of - control drinking , and other misconduct — at the Tailhook Association convention in Las Vegas , an annual gathering of retired and active - duty naval aviators .
“ I cannot tell you , ” McCain proclaimed , “ the distaste and displeasure that I have as a naval aviator … concerning this incident . ”
He bemoaned the fact that senior ranking naval officers and civilian leaders had been at the meeting .
He called for an investigation and urged the Navy to suspend its traditional participation with the Tailhook reunions .
“ There is no time in the history of this country that something like this is more inappropriate , ” McCain said , “ and we can not allow it .
It is unconscionable .
And we in the military … should be ashamed and embarrassed … that this kind of activity went on .
And there is no excuse for it . ”
Now , McCain has placed one of the men responsible for permitting — and encouraging – loutish activity at the Tailhook meetings in a powerful position : heading up his transition team .
McCain recently named John Lehman to oversee his transition effort and figure out how a McCain administration ought to get started — and whom it ought to hire for the most senior jobs — should McCain win the November 4 election .
Lehman , now an investment banker , was secretary of the Navy during the 1980s , and he played a R- rated role in the Tailhook scandal .
Lehman was no longer Navy secretary when the Tailhook scandal exploded .
But in 1991 and 1992 , as military investigators and journalists probed what had happened at the 1991 convention — which included the so - called Gauntlet , a line of rowdy and drunk junior officers who harassed and assaulted women passing by –they learned that the events at the Tailhook convention of 1991 were predated by similar behavior in early years .
And they discovered that Lehman , as Navy secretary , had been an enthusiastic participant .
In his 1995 book , Fall from Glory : The Men Who Sank the U.S. Navy , Greg Vistica , the San Diego Union - Tribune reporter who broke the Tailhook scandal , described a scene from the 1986 Tailhook meeting :
When the door to the suite at the Las Vegas Hilton opened , a prominent member of President Ronald Reagan ’s administration and a naked woman were clearly visible .
He was lying on his back , stretched out in front of a throng of naval officers .
There were probably one hundred men watching him , laughing with him … .
Several of the Navy and Marine officers now crammed into the room … knew him personally and worshiped him .
Many knew he was married and had three children .
Almost everyone knew who he was , which made the show that much more fascinating ….
Most of the officers in the room , including the man on his back , were hard - drinking renegades .
Some had been partying for days , others for hours .
The carpet was spongy and damp from alcohol spilled on it by drunken military men .
The room itself reeked with the odor of booze and sweat .
But nobody seemed to care much .
All eyes were on the man and the naked woman standing over him , wagging her bare rump in a teasing motion .
The men in the room went into a throaty uproar at the site , and their cheers and laughs grew louder as the show went on .
The man on the floor was Lehman .
And this was the example he was setting at this particular Tailhook convention .
Another account of the Tailhook scandal – The Mother of All Hooks : The Story of the U.S. Navy ’s Tailhook Scandal by William McMichael–noted that Lehman ate whipped cream out of the stripper ’s crotch .
Lehman , who had once been a Navy pilot , left his post as Navy secretary the following year — four years before Tailhook would become a controversy .
But the 1993 report on Tailhook ’91 conducted by the Pentagon ’s inspector general concluded that the 1991 convention was “ the culmination of a long - term failure of leadership ” in the Navy .
According to the report , “ the nature of the misconduct at the annual convention was well - known to senior aviation leaders … .
We were repeatedly told that such behavior was widely condone by Navy civilian and military leadership . ”
A footnote in the report stated :
Throughout our investigation , witnesses told us remarkable incidents at past Tailhook conventions .
Incidents related by witnesses included a high - ranking Navy civilian official dancing with strippers in hospitality suites .
The IG ’s report noted that Tailhook had spun out of control during Lehman ’s tenure as Navy secretary : “ By many accounts , the increase in rowdy and improper behavior culminated at Tailhook ’ 85 . ”
After that convention , one Tailhook Association board member privately complained to the group , “ Dancing girls performing lurid sexual acts on Naval aviators in public would make prime conversation for the media . ”
But no steps were taken — by the association or the Navy–to rein in the Top Gun aviators .
And Lehman ’s antics at the 1986 gathering sent an obvious signal : party on , men .
1n 1996 , Lehman , appearing on ABC News ’
This Week with David Brinkley , downplayed the Tailhook affair .
Asked if he had participated in public lewdness at one of the conventions , he said that was unimportant and railed against “ gutter reporting , ” insisting that Tailhook ’91 should have been nothing more than a minor story .
Speaking more broadly about the military during the Clinton years , Lehman added , “ This is not a touchy - feely bureaucracy here .
It has to have a macho , tough , warrior culture , and that ’s what ’s being eroded . ”
Lehman ’s involvement in the Tailhook scandal did not harm his career .
In the past two decades , he has been a businessman and has sat on the board of several corporations , while working with hawkish think tanks , including the Project for the New American Century .
He served as a commissioner for the 9/11 Commission .
Though McCain was quick to denounce the misconduct at Tailhook ’ 91 , it also became a campaign issue for him the following summer , when he was running for reelection to the Senate .
In August , 1992 , Newsweek published a story reporting that a 1987 Tailhook newsletter had noted that McCain had appeared at that year ’s convention and had “ participated in the camaraderie of the third [ floor ] ” — where the carousing happened at Tailhook events .
His Democratic opponent , Claire Sargent , criticized McCain for attending the 1987 convention and the 1990 gathering .
McCain maintained that he had been unaware how rowdy the parties had become .
He added , “ I heard there was drinking going on , furniture sometimes broken , and occasional vomiting . ”
But McCain insisted that he had talked to several people who had been at Tailhook ’91 and that they had told him that the abuse of women guests “ was unheard of until 1991 . ”
The subsequent IG report on Tailhook would make it clear that was not true .
But the Tailhook matter caused McCain no political pain — especially after Naval Lieutenant Paula Coughlin , a female pilot who had publicly charged she was harassed at Tailhook ’ 91 , produced a statement praising McCain .
He cruised to an easy reelection .
During that campaign , on September 24 , 1992 , McCain issued a statement regarding the ongoing Tailhook investigation .
“ It is my hope , ” he said , “ that we will take every necessary action to ensure that every man in every service who crossed the line , either in participating in the abuses at Tailhook or in covering them up , receives whatever penalties apply . ”
McCain praised the current Navy secretary for proceeding with the inquiry .
He said nothing about the previous secretaries , including his good friend , John Lehman .
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has discovered carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another star .
This breakthrough is an important step toward finding chemical biotracers of extraterrestrial life .
The Jupiter - sized planet , called HD 189733 b , is too hot for life .
But the Hubble observations are a proof - of - concept demonstration that the basic chemistry for life can be measured on planets orbiting other stars .
Organic compounds also can be a by - product of life processes , and their detection on an Earthlike planet someday may provide the first evidence of life beyond our planet .
Previous observations of HD 189733 b by Hubble and NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope found water vapor .
Earlier this year , Hubble found methane in the planet 's atmosphere .
" Hubble was conceived primarily for observations of the distant universe , yet it is opening a new era of astrophysics and comparative planetary science , " said Eric Smith , Hubble Space Telescope program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" These atmospheric studies will begin to determine the compositions and chemical processes operating on distant worlds orbiting other stars .
The future for this newly opened frontier of science is extremely promising as we expect to discover many more molecules in exoplanet atmospheres . "
Mark Swain , a research scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , used Hubble 's near - infrared camera and multi- object spectrometer to study infrared light emitted from the planet , which lies 63 light - years away .
Gases in the planet 's atmosphere absorb certain wavelengths of light from the planet 's hot glowing interior .
Swain identified carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide .
The molecules leave a unique spectral fingerprint on the radiation from the planet that reaches Earth .
This is the first time a near - infrared emission spectrum has been obtained for an exoplanet .
" The carbon dioxide is the main reason for the excitement because , under the right circumstances , it could have a connection to biological activity as it does on Earth , " Swain said .
" The very fact we are able to detect it and estimate its abundance is significant for the long - term effort of characterizing planets to find out what they are made of and if they could be a possible host for life . "
This type of observation is best done on planets with orbits tilted edge - on to Earth .
They routinely pass in front of and then behind their parent stars , phenomena known as eclipses .
The planet HD 189733 b passes behind its companion star once every 2.2 days .
The eclipses allow an opportunity to subtract the light of the star alone , when the planet is blocked , from that of the star and planet together prior to eclipse .
That isolates the emission of the planet and makes possible a chemical analysis of its atmosphere .
" In this way , we are using the eclipse of the planet behind the star to probe the planet 's day side , which contains the hottest portions of its atmosphere , " said team member Guatam Vasisht of JPL .
" We are starting to find the molecules and to figure out how many there are to see the changes between the day side and the night side . "
This successful demonstration of looking at near - infrared light emitted from a planet is very encouraging for astronomers planning to use NASA 's James Webb Space Telescope after it is launched in 2013 .
These biomarkers are best seen at near - infrared wavelengths .
Astronomers look forward to using the Webb telescope to look spectroscopically for biomarkers on a terrestrial planet the size of Earth or a " super - Earth " several times our planet 's mass .
" The Webb telescope should be able to make much more sensitive measurements of these primary and secondary eclipse events , " Swain said .
Pictured : Erected by Iraqis , the 3 m - high ' sole - ful ' tribute to Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at Bush
One of the most enduring moments of the dying days of George Bush 's presidency has now been immortalised as a giant monument .
Iraqi journalist Muntazer al - Zaidi hurled his shoe at the former U.S. president during a press conference at the Prime Minister 's Palace in Baghdad , shouting : ' This is for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq ' .
The moment was captured on camera and broadcast around the world , provoking cheers throughout the Middle East , chuckles throughout most of the West , and even an online computer game .
Putting the boot in :
The tribute to journalist Muntazer al - Zaidi , who hurled his shoes at George Bush on his farewell visit to Iraq
Now fans of the irate journalist 's actions have shown their appreciation , erecting a giant shoe in Tikrit , the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein , which lies 95 miles outside Baghdad .
The statue stands three metres high , sitting on top a giant pedestal , and a tree has been planted inside the heel , with a rose - bush growing alongside .
It stands in the gardens of an Iraqi foundation that cares for children whose parents have died since the U.S. invasion began in 2003 .
Presidential duck : George Bush shows lightning - quick reactions as he dodges the first shoe during a news conference with Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki
The statue stands three metres tall and stands outside an Iraqi orphan foundation
A member for the centre said : ' This is a gift for the family of Muntazer al - Zaidi , a hero , whose act helped Iraqi people feel proud . '
Zaidi hurled his shoes during Bush 's farewell visit to Iraq on December 14 , an action considered a grave insult in the Arab world .
The 29 - year - old journalist for Al - Baghdadia television also shouted : ' It is the farewell kiss , you dog ' .
The surprisingly nimble Bush seemed to take an almost joyful glee in ducking the boots and laughed the episode off - while the journalist was instantly arrested and allegedly beaten up by bodyguards .
Girls walk past the shoe sculpture in Tikrit
His actions were hailed across the Arab world , and gave Zaidi instant fame as the moment was replayed over and over again on news channels and over the internet - becoming a popular meme with hundreds of tribute or spoof videos appearing on YouTube and other video - sharing sites .
The popularity of his actions throughout the Muslim world - especially in Iraq - threw the stated American purpose of liberating Iraq through the war into an uncomfortable light .
The journalist was arrested and charged with ' aggression against a foreign head of state during an official visit ' , and he faces up to 15 years in jail if offended .
He is believed to have requested political asylum in Switzerland .
The foundation 's president , Shaha al - Juburi , insisted that the sculpture was not backed by any political party or organisation .

Ruben Navarrette says Sarah Palin 's critics challenged her because of prejudices about small - town values .
SAN DIEGO , California ( CNN ) --
During the presidential election , some Democrats demanded to know how I could defend Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Simply put , Palin is my people .
She 's small - town folk who wound up in the big leagues .
Because I grew up in a small town with a population of less than 15,000 people , I was disgusted by the insults and condescension coming from those who think of themselves as the enlightened elite .
Meanwhile , in small towns , I detected great affection for Palin .
People talked about how she was " a real person " who " reflected their values . "
The most significant divide in America is n't Red State vs. Blue State , it 's rural vs. urban .
The country mouse and the city mouse are still slugging it out .
In 1982 , New York Mayor Ed Koch ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York .
Some say the deciding factor was when Koch described life in upstate New York as " sterile " and said he dreaded living in the " small town " of Albany , if elected .
That did n't play well in rural areas .
Now comes Colin Powell .
During a recent appearance on CNN's " Fareed Zakaria GPS , " Powell attempted an autopsy on the Republican Party 's failed presidential bid .
He went after Palin , accusing her of pushing the party so far to the right that it went over a cliff .
" I think [ Palin ] had something of a polarizing effect when she talked about how small - town values are good , " Powell said .
" Well , most of us do n't live in small towns .
And I was raised in the South Bronx , and there 's nothing wrong with my value system from the South Bronx . "
You'd think the presidential campaign was about conservatives picking on urbanites .
It was n't .
Sure , some Republicans probably made a mistake by using phrases such as " real America " or " real Americans " as a rallying cry for the base .
Americans who live in cities might have thought they were being slighted .
But those phrases referred as much to people 's politics and values as it did their zip code .
I live in a city with a population of more than a million people and I never thought the GOP singled me out as not being a " real American . "
If anything , it appeared that big -city liberals were tapping into prejudices about small - town America to belittle the governor of Alaska
After Powell attacked Palin , one of the governor 's most vocal defenders , conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh , returned the favor by attacking Powell .
" What is this hatred for conservatives and small - town people and Sarah Palin ? "
Limbaugh asked on his radio show .
" I know a lot of people that are from the Bronx , Gen .
Powell , and if you think the values there in the Bronx today reflect the ones you grew up with , take a trip back and see if the street corners and the activities there are the same as when you were growing up . "
Limbaugh got it .
When people use phrases such as " small - town values , " it 's as much about time as it is place .
The idea is n't that people who live in small towns have better values than people who live in cities .
It 's simply an attempt to recall , with nostalgia , what life was like when more Americans lived in small towns .
It used to be that more families ate dinner together and high school students worked summers and after school .
It used to be that our schools did n't make excuses for why some kids do n't learn because they were too busy trying to teach them .
It used to be that parents were n't interested in being their kids ' best friends , only good parents .
And it used to be that people pulled their own weight and would never dare ask for a handout .
During a recent interview with the conservative newspaper , Human Events , Palin was asked if she thought her humble background accounted for some of the flak she got from the media .
Palin acknowledged that she did n't come from elite stock , but said that she was grateful for that .
" I got my education from the University of Idaho because that 's what I could afford , " she said .
" No , I do n't come from the self - proclaimed ' movers and shakers ' group and that 's fine with me .
It 's caused me , or rather , allowed me , to work harder and pull myself up by my bootstraps without anyone else helping me .
I think it allows me to be in touch with the vast majority of Americans who are in the same position that I am . "
Sarah Palin understands a lot about America .
Too bad many Americans do n't understand Sarah Palin .
No worries .
They may get another chance to acquaint themselves with her -- in say , four years .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr .

NHS send workers to enjoy fine wine and Harley Davidson rides on Australian ' jolly '
Delegates were invited to enjoy trips around Melbourne on Harley Davidson motorcycles
NHS bosses have been blasted for sending employees to a three - day conference in Australia .
Lancashire Care NHS
Trust - which runs mental health services in the county - spent almost £ 9,000 funding three delegates to the 6th International Conference on Early Psychosis in Melbourne .
The news comes a fortnight after it was revealed that another trust - NHS Blackpool - had spent £ 30,000 on a lavish staff party at a hotel in the resort .
The delegates who went to Australia - members of the Lancashire Care 's Early Intervention Service team - were invited to enjoy a full social programme including food and fine wines from around the world and even trips around Melbourne on a Harley Davidson .
Lancashire Care Trust has defended the trip , stating it was a useful fact - finding exercise .
But Michael Jack , MP for Fylde and Lancashire , today said : ' I can't believe the trust needed to send anybody to Australia to improve their medical practices .
' The amount spent seems disproportionate to the potential gain , and their explanation very sparse .
Have they not heard of video link ?
The workers were attending the 6th International Conference on Early Psychosis in Melbourne
' This is another suggestion NHS organisations need more rigorous regulation of expenditure and this should be investigated . '
Lancashire Care Trust 's Early Intervention Service , established in 2002 , is currently treating around 65 people in Blackpool - more in the wider North Lancashire area - and sees around 26 new patients each year .
A spokesman for the Trust said : ' Lancashire Care funded three members of the early intervention service to attend this conference .
' Staff flew out on economy flights and stayed in standard rooms in the Holiday Inn .
The total cost for each member of staff which includes flights , visas , accommodation , meals , travel to and from the airport and attending the conference was £ 2,885 each .
MP Michael Jack says the team could have used a video link instead
' The conference provided an opportunity for staff to hear about the latest research into early intervention services and to bring back best practice examples , which can be brought into Lancashire Care 's service , ultimately improving the service for patients and their carers . '
The three care co-ordinators have not yet met with their team leaders , but the Trust say the conference will be used to add to a training program from March onwards .
The academic program included talks from professionals and an ' Early Psychosis Film Festival ' held at the historic National Gallery of Victoria .
The social program on the conference website describes the event as a ' change of pace from scientific sessions ' , where ' delegates and their guests will have many opportunities to meet socially , with magnificent venues , fine wines , delicious food and evenings of entertainment . '
Susie Squire , Campaign Manager at the TaxPayers '
Alliance said : ' This is a shocking waste of taxpayers ' money .
At a time when the NHS cannot afford to provide people with the right drugs , spending thousands of pounds on a jolly is a disgrace .
' All available funds should be put into improving frontline services .
There is no reason any fact finding could n't have been done over email , for free . '
Jane Wilde , founder of Blackpool anorexia nervosa support group Fighting for Freedom , said she had been campaigning for help for her daughter , Hayley .
She said : ' Hayley had to go to Cheadle , Cheshire for treatment for anorexia .
It was a terrible waste and it's great for the health staff to escape from it all , but people who go through illnesses like this can't .
' The money could have been used to help set up a much - needed support centre in Blackpool . '
Earlier this month , NHS Blackpool bosses apologised for the upset caused by their party for 420 staff at Blackpool 's Hilton Hotel .
The event - organised to celebrate the 60th birthday of the NHS - was widely criticised by patient and community groups who claimed it was a sickening waste of public money .
NHS bosses will now be grilled by Blackpool Council 's Health Scrutiny committee next month .
Gordon Marsden , MP for Blackpool South , said : ' I look forward to seeing how this conference alters the Trust 's medical techniques .
' The Department of Health certainly needs to think about producing much clearer guidelines on how the NHS should spend their budget , and perhaps dedicate a website to this . '
In the annual NHS Health Check , Lancashire Care NHS
Trust achieved a score of ' good ' in its use of resources and ' fair ' in its quality of services .
( CNN ) -- Senate Democrats and the White House failed to find 60 votes to end debate on a $ 14 billion auto bailout bill and bring it to a vote Thursday night , killing the measure for the year .
Sen .
Tom Coburn , center , and other Republican senators raised objections to the auto bailout plan Wednesday .
The 52 -35 vote followed the collapse of negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans seeking a compromise .
" We have worked and worked and we can spend all night tonight , tomorrow , Saturday , and Sunday , and we 're not going to get to the finish line , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor before the vote .
" That 's just the way it is .
There 's too much difference between the two sides . "
Reid acknowledged the bill would not survive the procedural vote .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the sticking point was the United Auto Workers ' refusal to set a " date certain " to put employees at U.S. auto manufacturers at " parity pay " with U.S. employees at foreign automakers in the United States .
Currently , analysts estimate the union workers at U.S. automakers make about $ 3 to $ 4 per hour more than the non-union U.S. employees of foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda , according to the Center for Automotive Research .
Watch the market ramifications of the bailout failure »
The House easily passed the bailout bill earlier this week , but it quickly ran into trouble in the Senate , where Republicans objected to several provisions .
Negotiations Thursday involved a compromise proposal put forward by Sen. Bob Corker , R - Tennessee , but the senators could not reach agreement .
The collapse of negotiations could possibly doom General Motors to a bankruptcy and closure in the coming weeks , with Chrysler potentially following close behind .
While Ford Motor has more cash on hand to avoid an immediate crisis , its production could be disrupted by problems in the supplier base , as could the production of overseas automakers with U.S. plants such as Toyota Motor and Honda Motor .
Watch how the automakers crisis has a ripple effect on Asia »
The struggling automakers may get some money anyway .
As part of their effort to urge skeptical Republicans to back the deal , Bush officials made clear that if Congress did n't act , the White House would have to step in to save Detroit from collapse with funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , according to the sources familiar with the conversations .
One of the sources said that a White House official made it clear to a GOP senator that would be the worst option , because the loan could go to the auto companies with few or no requirements along with it .
The sources asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of private conversations .
Democrats pressed the White House from the start to help Detroit by using some of the $ 700 billion for the financial sector , but the White House and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson refused .
" I would only hope that the president , who has worked so well with us for the past several weeks , would now consider using the TARP money , " Reid said after Thursday night 's vote .

Advertisement Thousands of mourners have attended the funerals of victims of a gas leak on a Russian nuclear submarine .
Twenty people , mostly civilians , died when freon gas was released , in an unsanctioned activation of a firefighting system , officials said .
Twelve of the victims , all civilian contractors , were buried on Wednesday in the city of Komsomolsk - on - Amur , in Russia 's Far East .
The accident occurred on Saturday in the Sea of Japan .
The Nerpa , or Akula - class , attack submarine was undergoing sea trials and had more than 200 people aboard , 81 of them service personnel .
There has been speculation that overcrowding and the presence of so many civilians aboard the vessel may have contributed to the death toll - but this has not been confirmed by officials investigating the accident .
Survivors ' account
Three servicemen and 17 civilians were killed and another 21 people were injured in the accident , which happened in the nose of the submarine , officials said .
1 . Personnel working in front section of submarine affected when fire extinguishers set off unexpectedly
2 . Affected area may have been sealed off , trapping personnel inside .
There were more staff than usual on board as submarine was undergoing tests
3 . Fire extinguishers release freon gas , which displaces breathable oxygen , causing workers to suffocate
4 . Twenty people die and 21 are injured
Preliminary investigations suggested that the " unsanctioned activation " of the automatic firefighting system caused the tragedy , Russian investigators said earlier this week .
Freon gas displaces oxygen from the air to put out a fire .
However , the investigators said it was still unclear what triggered the system .
Several survivors later recalled the terrifying seconds after the gas started filling some sections of the submarine .
Viktor Rifk said he managed to put a gas mask on time " I was lying down resting after being on watch .
Suddenly the freon gas started coming down right above me .
It was like a drug .
I lost consciousness , " said Viktor Rifk , an engineer , quoted by the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper on Tuesday .
" We all had gas masks but maybe some people did n't manage to put them on in time , " Mr Rifk later told Russia 's NTV television .
A number of the people were sleeping when the accident happened , and reports in Russian media suggested that some of them were too dazed to put on gas masks .
Earlier , several former Russian mariners suggested that the civilian personnel - engineers and shipyard workers - may have lacked experience in handling the breathing apparatus .
The nuclear reactor , which is in the stern , was not affected and there was no radiation leak , officials said .
The submarine is due to be leased to India , and Indian naval personnel were due to travel to Vladivostok earlier this month to train on board the submarine ahead of its transfer , according to the website Indian Defence .
Russia 's worst submarine disaster happened in August 2000 , when the nuclear - powered Kursk sank in the Barents Sea .
All 118 people on board died .
The then president , Vladimir Putin , was criticised for being slow to react to the incident and reluctant to call in foreign assistance .

I think we 're all familiar with the Surly Pugsley and it's well know that Moots custom builds snow bikes .
Plenty of other options are available for fat tire bicycles for snow and sand riding . " is the trademark for the bicycles from Wildfire Cycles in Alaska .
The frames and forks are specially built to take ultra wide rims and tires for use on Alaska 's deep snow .
They use the DeSalvo FatBike fork .
DeSalvo also can build up fat bikes for you in Oregon .
What got me thinking about Fat Bikes was mention of this titanium fat bike from Speedway Cycles in Alaska .
The " Fatback " has mondo clearance , vertical dropouts , 100 mm forks , and 100 mm bottom bracket for all possible gears .
Because it 's titanium , it 's rust free .
Vicious Cycles builds the Thunderwing .
This steel bike features proprietary cable routing to keep the kinks out ( important in extreme weather ) , 3 bottle mounts for water and fuel , and sealed tubes to keep the water out as well as a seat tube drain hole .
A stainless steel bottle opener is welded to the frame .
Turner is apparently a favorite to convert into a snow bike I think all Evingson does is fat tire bikes .
Check out this build with a Rohloff 14 speed hub .
Plenty of people convert their 29ers to " half fat tire " by replacing the front fork with a fat fork and putting a normal 26 inch tire on the rear .
I just had to mention Jeff Jones " Fat Fork " option , though , because he specifically mentions the bike 's " lateral stiffness , vertical compliance " on the website -- ha ha !
Do n't forget to visit Fat Bike Alaska blog for more fat tire snow bike goodness .
Most of these photos were taken from the bike builder website or from this MTBR discussion on fat tire snow bikes .
Many of these independent bike builders will be at the North American Handmade Bicycle Show in Portland in a couple of weeks .
I 'll be there too and let you know about the goodies I see there .
I 'll also have some giveaways ( Kryptonite lock , Swrve pants , 53 Mile Per Burrito stickers ) --
I just need some ideas on how to do the giveaway !
After a lot of research , I ’ve come to the conclusion that the easiest to build and most profitable websites are niche product review sites .
Combine product - review sites with Rapid SEO ( a new concept I ’m developing ) and you have the ultimate winning combination for making money online with organic traffic .
However , recently , Google has been slapping review sites that use Adwords – the quality score dropped dramatically .
I suspect this is just warning – almost a shot across the bow for webmasters to clean up their content .
You may or may not be aware , Google is very AGGRESSIVELY combating link - sales , and all this started with a simple warning too .
So , I think it ’s inevitable that affiliate - link - loaded - content sites in the SERPs will be hit too – sooner or later .
If you follow Google ’s webmaster guidelines to the letter , you ’ll probably make very little or no money – Google DO NOT condone active link building ; no links means no money !
Thus , to make money online , you have no choice but to dabble in the dark side .
Sooner or later , you will convert completely because the Force ( the profit potential ) is much , much , much greater on the dark side .
Now , to slap Google back , use the WordPress Search Engine Link Cloaker ( SELC ) plugin below .
This is how it works : the SELC simply identifies visitors – either search engine spiders or humans – and displays authority links to the spiders and affiliate links to humans .
To use , simply add your affiliate links to your blog posts as normal .
Then go to the SELC user - interface in WordPress , enter your affiliate links in the boxes provided ( on the left ) and authority links in the boxes on the right .
Then , enter your IP to test the plugin – it ’s really simple to use .

" Already we have a filter on the internet for all parliament house computers .
It blocks some political sites , alternative lifestyle sites and other sites that , while not to my personal taste , are hardly grounds for censorship , " he wrote .
" Imagine if such censorship was extended to every computer in the country through mandatory ISP filtering .
Who would be the ultimate arbiter of what is permissible content ? "
Bernardi , who tried to censor Gordon Ramsay by calling for a Senate inquiry into swearing on television in March , is known for his conservative views .
The pro-life Senator has questioned whether global warming is caused by human activities , has opposed therapeutic cloning of human embryos and protested against proposed laws prescribing equal treatment of same - sex relationships .
In his blog post , Bernardi acknowledged that his position on the web censorship issue would " surprise many " and said " a big part of me wants to support it " .
However , Communications Minister Stephen Conroy 's plan was " so devoid of detail " that it was impossible to form a considered opinion .
Senator Conroy has consistently dodged questions in Parliament about the scheme , particularly surrounding the specific types of content that the Government wants to block .
The Opposition , Greens and even NSW Young Labor have opposed the scheme , which will make it difficult for the Rudd Government to pass the required legislation .
The individuals who hold the balance of power in the Senate , the independent Nick Xenophon and Family First 's Steve Fielding , have said they would want online gambling sites and hardcore pornography blocked by the filters , respectively .
" Parental responsibility cannot and should not be abrogated to government - if it is , our society will only become weaker , " Senator Bernardi said .
" Yes , illegal content should be banned from the web ... but it is wrong to give the government a blank cheque to determine what is appropriate for us to view on the internet . "
The deadline has passed for ISPs to sign up to conduct live trials of the internet filtering scheme , some of which are scheduled to begin before Christmas .
However , Senator Conroy has refused to release a list of ISPs that applied .
Telstra and Internode have both said they will not take part , while iiNet said it will run a trial purely to show the Government the proposed scheme wo n't work and Optus 's trial will be scaled back to encompass filtering only of a set blacklist of 1300 sites .
The Government 's policy includes the mandatory censorship of " illegal " content as determined by a blacklist of up to 10,000 sites , which will be held by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
The second tier , which will be optional , will seek to block " unwanted " content that is inappropriate for children .
No ISP has announced plans to trial the second tier , which is more draconian and technically difficult as it would involve analysing every piece of content handled by the network .
Internet experts say the real - time analysis of content will dramatically slow network speeds , while some child welfare groups have expressed concerns that the internet filters could be easily circumvented , creating a false sense of security .
Lab tests released by ACMA in June found available ISP filters frequently let through content that should be blocked , incorrectly blocked harmless content and slowed down network speeds by up to 87 per cent .
Recent tests of software - based internet filters by consumer advocacy group Choice found they were more than capable of blocking offensive material , which raised questions around the need for mandatory ISP - level filters .
The previous government provided client - level software filters for free via netalert .
gov.au , however , Senator Conroy has said the NetAlert scheme will be shut down by the new year .
At first glance , Los Angeles might seem like the last place anyone would visit for architectural inspiration : Patchwork quilts of parking lots and strip malls alternate with vast carpets of matching faux - Mediterranean subdivisions , all knit together by a web of eight - lane freeways .
But look closely and you ’ll see daring architecture dotting the scrubby hillsides .
There are Frank Lloyd Wright homes that resemble Mayan temples , John Lautner ’s UFO - inspired residences from the space - obsessed 1960s , and turn - of - the - millennium deconstructions , such as Frank Gehry ’s luminous Walt Disney Concert Hall .
“ In Los Angeles , there is always a chance , ” says Richard Weinstein , a transplanted New Yorker who serves as the vice chair of architecture and urban design at UCLA .
“ The place is so full of holes and so badly governed , ” he adds dryly , “ that you can occasionally drive a great building into the gaps . ”
That drive is , more and more , coming from the other side of the Pacific .
Last year , both UCLA and its crosstown rival , the University of Southern California , named new directors to their architecture programs — and both come from Asia .
Hitoshi Abe , UCLA ’s new chair , hails from Sendai , Japan , while USC ’s dean , Qingyun Ma , keeps offices in his native Xi’an , China , and in Shanghai .
The appointments represent an intriguing turn at a time when dynamic new architecture , wrestling with questions of history and urbanization , sprouts all over Asia — and as U.S. architectural programs come under fire from figures such as Rem Koolhaas , who told the Los Angeles Times that they were “ shamefully focused on the West . ”
Says Abe : “ Urban design has been Western - centric .
Asia has a lot of energy right now , so we have to look there . ”
One of Ma ’s core ideas — the impermanence of architecture — has particular appeal for anyone who would be happy to see Los Angeles ’ relentless sprawl bulldozed .
Ma , 43 , views today ’s Western architecture as a descendant of the Greco - Roman tradition , which is all about building in stone and erecting things that are intended to last forever .
( Which makes it all the more amusing that he ’s an occasional collaborator of Koolhaas , creating mind - bending buildings , such as Beijing ’s CCTV headquarters , that look as if they might fall down . )
Clearly a son of modern China , he questions the West ’s preservationist reflex .
“ Everything has a life cycle , as should buildings , ” he says .
“ Preservation is an action in sacrifice of future possibilities .
The future needs its own space . ”
The wisdom of razing and rebuilding depends largely on context and execution , of course .
Urban renewal failed in some U.S. cities , for instance , and wo n’t Beijing suffer by replacing its centuries - old hutongs with generic apartment buildings ?
Yet Ma does n’t argue that we should jettison the past .
His Thumb Island project near Shanghai modernizes the ancient Chinese reverence for landscape .
Grass - carpeted knolls created by the undulating roof over a community center pair with a nearby lake , paying homage to the traditional coupling of mountain and water .
For Abe , 46 , who maintains an atelier in his homeland — one of the world ’s most densely populated countries — issues of environment are paramount .
Japanese architects have long had to figure out how to build attractive , functional living spaces on the most microscopic slices of land ; it ’s not uncommon for family homes to occupy just 300 square feet of earth .
In 2006 , in Saitama , a cluttered city just north of Tokyo , Abe created a combination pediatric clinic / private home that manages to drench three stories of interiors in sunlight , but maintains privacy by wrapping part of the structure in a concrete screen punctuated with asymmetrically placed windows .
The building feels open , without putting its residents on display .
That sort of solution — and the environment that inspired it — is what Abe wants to expose his students to .
“ Tokyo is the future , ” he says .
“ It is so contemporary : the density issue , the ecological issue , the relation between public and private . ”
The hiring of these two architects has n’t instantly transformed the curricula or culture of either school .
“ It ’s very nice to have people from [ Asia ] running the schools at USC and UCLA , ” says Robert A.M. Stern , the architecture dean at Yale , a university that has had programs in Hong Kong and Shanghai since 1999 .
“ But just having someone from that place does n’t necessarily affect the culture . ”
Which is why both Abe and Ma are taking advantage of Los Angeles ’ relative proximity to Asia and sending their students abroad , believing that exposure to what ’s happening in Japan and China will inspire fresh thinking in the next generation of American architects .
Masters candidates at UCLA are spending this academic year studying urbanism and architecture in Tokyo , looking for lessons that might be applied to L.A .
At USC , Ma has established the first - ever American Academy in China — modeled on the venerable American Academy in Rome — where scholars from all over the world can do research individually , as well as share ideas collectively .
“ The elites from other cultures have been educated in the United Sates , but American leaders are never educated in other places , ” Ma says .
“ If America wants to maintain its position , it has to shift .
It ca n’t just be about muscle , but about leadership in the arts and the humanities . ”
TEL AVIV ( Reuters ) - Israel has all but ruled out fully reopening border crossings with the Gaza Strip as long as Hamas rules the enclave or stands to benefit from easing of the restrictions , a top adviser to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said .

Hamas has made a shaky cease - fire , which ended Israel ’s 22 - day offensive in the Gaza Strip on Sunday , conditional on Israel lifting its blockade , which , the adviser made clear , would not happen anytime soon .
The Islamist group , which won a 2006 Palestinian election and seized control of the Gaza Strip 18 months later after routing President Mahmoud Abbas ’s security forces , has been shunned by major Western powers for refusing to recognise Israel and renounce violence .
Speaking a day after Olmert spoke by telephone to U.S. President Barack Obama , the adviser expressed confidence the new administration in Washington would maintain George W. Bush ’s policy of refusing to deal with or talk to Hamas .
The adviser spoke to a small group of reporters at Israel ’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv , on condition of anonymity .
The adviser said Israel would allow the “ maximum ” flow of food , medicine , oil and gas to the Gaza Strip to help its 1.5 million residents recover from the offensive , which killed more than 1,300 Palestinians , but a wider range of goods , including steel and cement needed for rebuilding , would have to wait .
Israel believes the restrictions will give it leverage to pressure Hamas to free Gilad Shalit , a captured Israeli soldier .
Diplomats and aid agencies say the restrictions will doom Gaza ’s reconstruction , estimated to cost at least $ 2 billion ( 1.4 billion pounds ) .
Olmert ’s adviser said Israel ’s underlying goal was to deny Hamas control over border crossings that could help it cement its hold on power .
“ If opening the passages will strengthen Hamas , we wo n’t do it , ” he said .
European powers have called on Israel to reopen the border crossings fully .
The adviser said he doubted Hamas would agree to let Abbas ’s security forces , backed by international observers , return to the border crossings , as Israel and Egypt have proposed .
ABBAS QUELLED WEST BANK RIOTS
He said Abbas ’s forces did “ something remarkable ” in the West Bank by “ containing riots and demonstrations ” during the war in Gaza but added that they were not ready for Gaza .
“ It ’s a limited force .
And in order to take it to Gaza , I think they need first more training , more forces , and this is something that takes time . ”
Even if Hamas agreed to let Abbas ’s Palestinian Authority run the crossings , Israel believes Hamas would maintain control behind the scenes and take over “ within days , ” he said .
“ It ’s all nice , as an idea .
But at the end of the day , if the PA ( Palestinian Authority ) will not go back to control Gaza , the issue of passages will be controlled by Hamas , no matter how , in what disguise you ’ll give it , ” the adviser said .
“ This will cement the ability of Hamas to rule , and to rule the passages , ” he added .
Western diplomats and Palestinian officials complained that Israel was already throwing up obstacles to Gaza ’s recovery .
This week , Israel told the United Nations and other aid groups planning for the rebuilding that they must apply for project - by - project Israeli approval and provide guarantees none of the work will benefit Hamas .
Israel has also prevented Abbas ’s government in the occupied West Bank from transferring cash to the Gaza Strip to pay Palestinian Authority workers and others in need of assistance .
Olmert ’s adviser denied preventing cash shipments but acknowledged the “ big dilemma ” facing Israel on reconstruction .
“ The main focus now is how to allow all the needed goods , and I do n’t think that cement or metal is the needed goods now for the population , ” the adviser said , referring to materials Israel fears Hamas will use to make more weapons and bunkers .
The adviser said the goal was a mechanism that would ensure that credit for reconstruction does not accrue to the Iran - backed Hamas , which announced on Thursday that it would distribute up to 4,000 euros ( 3,745 pounds ) in cash to families hard hit by Israel ’s offensive .
One potential disadvantage of funnelling international reconstruction aid through the Palestinian Authority was that Hamas would be spared the financial burden of rebuilding , he added .
Hamas could then use its resources to rebuild its military capabilities .
The Federal Government will provide up to $ 22 million to keep ABC Learning Centres open until the end of the year .
The rescue funding was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard as she revealed that a preliminary analysis had found 40 per cent of ABC 's 1040 centres are not profitable .
The funding will be used to keep those centres open for the next two months but she said the Government would not step in to buy or operate the centres .
There are no clear benefits to using long - acting beta2 - agonists ( LABAs ) for treatment of asthma in children , a new study concludes .
In an overview of recent Cochrane reviews , Child Health Field researchers report that there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest the drugs , which are recommended to relieve the symptoms of asthma , offer any additional benefit to conventional preventative medications .
LABAs such as salmeterol and formoterol can reduce the symptoms of asthma for periods of up to 12 hours and are often given to relax the airways overnight or after exercise .
Currently , LABAs are recommended as add - on therapies to inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) , which are taken on a daily basis to help control symptoms over a longer term .
Since LABAs have previously been shown to increase the risk of life - threatening adverse effects in adults when used as the only drug ( monotherapy ) , they are not recommended as the main treatment agent in asthma in any age groups .
Now researchers say that although giving LABAs to children can improve lung function , their use does not generally provide any further benefit over regular ICS therapy .
" We found no evidence to suggest that LABA should be used alone or in combination with ICS in the majority of young asthma sufferers .
ICS should remain the therapy of choice , " says Amy Plint , who led the study at the University of Ottawa in Canada .
The overview included four previous reviews of trials in children above the age of four .
Together , the trials showed that ICS in combination with LABAs significantly improved lung function compared to ICS combined with placebos .
LABAs did not , however , reduce severity of asthma symptoms as measured by hospital admissions or the need for steroid medication .
The researchers say more long - term trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of LABAs in children .
However , they think that the drugs may improve lung function in the most severe cases .
" We should not rule out combination therapy as a treatment option in children with poorly controlled asthma despite compliance with moderate dose ICS agents , " says Plint .

As 2009 dawns , there is some good news .
For example , Bonkers Bolton is no longer , officially , in a position to precipitate an illegal ( under international law ) attack by the Bush - Cheney Administration on certain Iranian facilities .
Those facilities being subject  as required by the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to frequent inspections whereby the International Atomic Energy Agency ensures that no NPT - proscribed " nuclear materials " have been diverted to a military purpose .
Having returned to his civilian perch at the American Enterprise Institute , Bolton is now reduced to attempting , unofficially , to precipitate an illegal ( under international law ) attack by someone  anyone  on those Iranian IAEA - Safeguarded facilities .
In a lengthy op - ed harangue just published by a complicit Wall Street Journal , Bolton begins by urging President - Elect Obama to put " pressure on China " to clean up the mess on the Korean peninsula .
A mess Bolton largely created , by falsely charging in 2002 that Kim Jong - Il ’s regime was in flagrant violation of an agreement , concluded in 1994 by the Clinton - Gore administration , and since continuously monitored by the IAEA .
Without question , the Bush - Cheney - Bolton unilateral abrogation of that Agreed Framework led North Korea to withdraw from the NPT , to chemically separate weapons - grade plutonium from spent - fuel elements previously under IAEA lock and seal , and to construct perhaps a half - dozen nuclear weapons .
So , in what cuckoo - land has Bolton been residing for the past year or so ?
Almost the last thing Obama should do upon taking office is to put pressure on the Chinese  who literally hold America ’s financial future in their vaults  to do anything , much less clean up Bolton ’s mess .
Almost .
You see , Bonkers Bolton goes on to urge Obama to do absolutely the last thing he should do : assist Israel , " should it decide to strike Iran ’s nuclear facilities " !
Recall that in his first State of the Union address , President Bush essentially accused North Korea , Iran and Iraq of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs .
“ States like these , and their terrorist allies , constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world .
“ I will not wait on events , while dangers gather .
I will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer .
The United States of America will not permit the world ’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world ’s most destructive weapons . ”
But  at that time  North Korea , Iran and Iraq were NPT signatories , their facilities and activities subject to regular IAEA inspections .
The principal mission of the IAEA is to facilitate “ the contribution of atomic energy to peace , health and prosperity , throughout the world . ”
But the IAEA  in carrying out its principal mission  “ shall ensure , so far as it is able ” that materials and activities under its “ supervision ” are not “ diverted ” so as “ to further any military purpose . ”
Whenever IAEA inspectors detect possible “ diversion , ” the Director - General reports that to the IAEA Board of Governors .
The Board can then decide  by a two - thirds majority  whether or not the “ diversion ” furthers “ any military purpose ” and should be reported to the UN Security Council for possible action .
Since 2003 , IAEA Director - General has been regularly reporting to the IAEA Board of Governors and to the Security Council that there are no “ indications ” that any NPT - proscribed materials have been so " diverted . "
Nevertheless , after several years of concerted effort , Bush - Cheney - Bolton got the UN Security Council  allegedly “ Acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations ”  to “ reaffirm ” its previous “ decision ” that Iran “ shall , without further delay , suspend :
“ a ) all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities , including research and development , to be verified by the IAEA ; and
“ ( b ) work on all heavy water - related projects , including the construction of a research reactor moderated by heavy water , also to be verified by the IAEA ”
Which prompted the Iranians to send a March 25 , 2008 letter to the UN Secretary General , explicating the largely successful efforts of Bush - Cheney - Bolton to not only corrupt the IAEA Board of Governors and UN Security Council , but to undermine the IAEA Statute , the NPT and UN Charter , itself .
In particular , Iran correctly noted that :
“ Involvement of the Security Council in the Iranian peaceful nuclear program is in full contravention with the organizational , Statutory and safeguards requirements governing the IAEA practices and procedures .
“ Furthermore , the substantive and procedural legal requirements , that are necessary for engaging the Security Council in the issues raised by the Agency , have been totally ignored in this regard .
“ The Security Council has never determined Iran ’s Nuclear Program as a threat to international peace and security under Article 39 of the UN Charter and , thus , it could not adopt any measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . "
That Iranian letter was followed by a statement from the Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  which includes Afghanistan , Algeria , Bahrain , Bolivia , Egypt , Indonesia , Iran , Iraq , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , Libya , Oman , Pakistan , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Syria , Turkmenistan , United Arab Emirates , Uzbekistan , Venezuela , et al .  wherein the Ministers
“ reaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all states ”  including , by name , the Islamic Republic of Iran  to the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes , “ without discrimination ”
“ recognized the IAEA as the sole competent authority for verification of the respective safeguards obligations of [ NPT ] member states ”
“ reaffirmed the inviolability of peaceful nuclear activities , ” whether operational or under construction , against “ attack or threat of attack , ” either of which “ constitutes a grave violation of international law , principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and regulations of the IAEA . ”
Okay , the rest of the world is in Iran ’s corner on this issue .
So , the question is what will happen if the paranoid Israelis attack Iran and “ we ” are viewed as having  as Bonkers Bolton urges  enabled them ?
Try to have a Happy New Year .

THE Sharper Image store on Manhattan 's West 57th Street is sharp no more : its last state - of - the - art massage chairs and stylish humidifiers have been put in storage and its windows papered over .
A few doors away , the assistant in the Sharper Image - like Brookstone shop seems unusually desperate to make a sale .
In between , huge posters adorn the storefront of Metropolitan , an antique shop , proclaiming that it is “ Going Out of Business ” .
The economic downturn has struck at the heart of the world 's shopping capital , and not even the influx of foreigners taking advantage of the weak dollar has been enough to save Sharper Image or its neighbour .
Unlike the fashion houses along the street , neither was helped by the fact that their big - ticket items could not easily be carried onto a plane .
But even Bergdorf Goodman , a nearby luxury department store , reported weak sales in August .
Sharper Image filed for bankruptcy protection in February , and has since been liquidating itself , getting even lower prices for its assets than it had hoped .
Several other well - known retailers have since gone bust .
Steve & Barry's , a casualwear retailer that is a core tenant of numerous shopping malls , terrified commercial - property investors when it entered bankruptcy protection in July .
It emerged in August with new private - equity owners and a plan to close 103 of its 276 stores .
Linens 'n Things filed in May , and at first hoped to reorganise itself and leave bankruptcy .
After the collapse of a planned sale to Cerberus , a private - equity firm , it now plans to liquidate itself , with closing - down sales due to start at its remaining stores on October 16th .
These failures have contributed to a rise in bankruptcy filings in 2008 that is showing every sign of accelerating .
Even before September 's record - breaking financial - sector bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , with assets of well over $ 600 billion , and the technical bankruptcy of Washington Mutual en route to its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase , there had already been more bankruptcies this year than in 2007 .
By May corporate borrowers had defaulted on 28 high - yield bonds ( formerly and perhaps again to be known as “ junk ” ) , compared with 21 such defaults in the whole of 2007 , according to a recent report by the corporate - renewal group at Bain & Company , a consultancy .
Even before the recent intensification of the financial crisis , which has made it harder and costlier for even the best - run companies to get credit , Bain forecast that 4.8 - 5.9 % of American high - yield bond issuers would default this year , up from 0.9 % last year , with the number of large bankruptcies ( companies with assets of over $ 100 m ) rising to 50 - 75 , from 13 in 2007 .
Admittedly , last year 's total was unusually low , and Bain 's forecast could be seen as nothing worse than a return to normality .
But what the credit markets are now pricing in to bonds is far nastier than that .
For the first time since late 2002 , the average spread between high - yield corporate bonds and Treasuries now exceeds 1,000 basis points — which , for an individual bond , usually earns it the title “ distressed ” , implying a probability of nearly 25 % of default within the following 12 months .
No doubt some of that average spread reflects the lack of liquidity in today 's financial markets .
A somewhat better indicator of the market 's feelings about the probability of default is the number of individual corporate - bond issues trading at least 1,000 basis points above Treasuries , says Martin Fridson of Fridson Investment Advisors .
This is now at a record level of 45 % of all high - yield issues , up from 29 % on September 11th this year and 10 % at the start of January .
The face value of distressed American corporate high - yield debt is now $ 328 billion , up from $ 59 billion in January .
Retailers loom large among the firms at risk , which range from casinos to carmakers ( though Detroit 's Big Three , at least , look slightly less fragile after last week 's $ 25 billion government - loan deal ) .
Once a bond becomes distressed it has nearly 20 times more chance of defaulting in the following 12 months than a non-distressed high - yield bond , says Mr Fridson , who calculates that on past trends the market is currently pricing in a default rate of 12.4 % over the next 12 months , compared with an actual default rate of 3.4 % in the 12 months to September .
In the two previous recessions the percentage of actual defaults peaked at 11.59 % ( in January 2002 ) and 13 % ( June 1991 ) .
Mr Fridson fears that if the economy suffers a recession as deep as that in the early 1990s , the default rate will be far higher , because the mix of high - yield bonds is now far riskier .
One mildly encouraging piece of news , says Edward Altman , an economist at New York University , is that so far this year there have been fewer defaults and bankruptcies than might have been expected given the deteriorating economy .
That is because many firms took advantage of generous credit markets in recent years to refinance at low rates , with less onerous covenants than in the past and “ toggle ” clauses that gave them the option of automatically adding interest bills to the sum borrowed rather than paying it .
Such terms are no longer available , and in the next couple of years hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate bonds and loans will need to be refinanced , says Mr Altman .
He predicts default rates over the next 12 months of 8 - 11 % , depending on the “ wild card of the severity of the recession ” .
Another wild card is the behaviour of private - equity firms , which now own some of the most highly leveraged companies .
In the recession of the early 1990s , the bursting of the leveraged - buy - out bubble exacerbated the bankruptcy problem and its overall impact on the economy .
A study by Steven Kaplan and Jeremy Stein of the buy - outs done at the peak of the bubble ( 1987 - 88 ) found that around one - third went bust or needed restructuring by 1991 .
Though private - equity firms claim to be far better run today , and many of them still sit on large cash piles , there is a danger that “ today is déjà vu all over again , ” says Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School .
The $ 2 billion injected into Washington Mutual in April by TPG represents the biggest - ever single loss by a private - equity firm — and it occurred in less than six months .
Already this year at least 32 significant private - equity - backed firms have gone bust , says Mr Altman .
Never has there been a greater need for that stress - relieving Sharper Image massage chair .
The LEGO Cigarette , so funny !
it 's an addiction .
It 's appetizing news for anyone who 's ever wanted the savory taste of meats and cheeses without actually having to eat them : chemists have identified molecular mechanisms underlying the sensation of umami , also known as the fifth taste .
The much - loved but historically unappreciated taste is produced by two interacting sets of molecules , each of which is needed to trigger cellular receptors on a tongue 's surface .
" This opens the door to designing better , more potent and more selective umami enhancers , " said Xiaodong Li , a chemist at San Diego - based food - additive company Senomyx .
Li co-authored the study , published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Four other basic tastes — bitter , sweet , salty and sour — were identified 2,400 years ago by the Greek philosopher Democritus , and became central to the western gastronomic canon .
In the late 19th century , French chef and veal - stock inventor Auguste Escoffier suggested that a fifth taste was responsible for his mouth - watering brew .
Though Escoffier 's dishes were popular , his theories were dismissed until 1908 , when Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda showed that an amino acid called glutamate underlies the taste of a hearty variety of seaweed soup .
In honor of Ikeda , the taste was dubbed umami , the Japanese word for delicious .
It took another 80 years for umami to be recognized by science as comparable to the other four tastes .
In the meantime , monosodium glutamate became wildly popular as a flavor enhancer .
But MSG can cause headaches and dizziness , and has been tenuously linked to long - term neurological disorders .
Between the public dissatisfaction with MSG and growing demand for artificial meats and dairy products , an umami alternative is welcome .
" The only way to have a substitute is to find the molecular target of glutamate .
If we figure that out , then we can screen for agents that are not glutamate but could mimic it , " said Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist Solomon Snyder , who was not involved in the new study .
Li's team took human kidney cells and added the genes for receptors linked to umami taste .
Receptors formed on the cells ' surface , geometrically resembling the mouth of a Venus flytrap — the plant renowned , appropriately , for its meat - eating proclivities .
When glutamate caught on a receptor 's lips and a molecule called ribonucleotide lodged in its throat , the receptor snapped shut .
" The configuration of the receptor changes , sending a signal down into the cell , " said Li .
In their engineered and disconnected cells the signal quickly fizzled — but in a tongue surface cell , said Li , " Your brain gets a signal : Something tastes good that is in my mouth . "
The umami receptor 's shape is similar to that of sweetness receptors , he said , and his team 's research could eventually suggest alternatives to sugar .
But more work is needed to determine exactly what happens when signals are sent from tongue to brain .
" Right now we 're working on the first step of the activation of this receptor .
Downstream , there are still lots of things to understand , "
said Li , who added that his favorite umami-containing food is lobster .

You may remember that back in May , RPS was the first place in the world to announce Valve ’s new addition to Steam , Steam Cloud .
Today Valve have declared that it ’s finished , and ready to go live .
Steam Cloud is a feature for Steam which , when implemented , allows players to store their save games and game configurations on Steam ’s servers , rather than their own computers .
With Steam you can access your games from any computer , so long as you ’ve bought them on your account , but you ’d have to start the game from scratch or carry your saves around with you .
So the idea is , with your saves and configs stored on Steam , you can just pick up and carry on whichever computer you use .
The first roll - out of the system is going to be focusing only on the config stuff .
Valve explain ,
“ Steam Cloud support will ship with Valve ’s Left 4 Dead demo later this week and the full game on November 18 .
In this first release , the information stored and accessible through the Steam Cloud includes keyboard , mouse , and gamepad configurations , as well as multiplayer settings such as spraypaint images . ”
Of course , with Left 4 Dead not having saving , there ’s no need for the other half of the Cloud feature .
But there ’s currently no word on when that function will be available .
However , it ’s also become more clear that it wo n’t be annoyingly fiddly .
“ The Steam Cloud will “ just work , ” meaning any user changes to their game options will propagate to the Cloud by default .
Upon logging into Steam from another PC , these settings will be brought down from the Cloud and automatically leveraged by the game .
Any configuration changes on this second machine are then synced to the Cloud for future sessions . ”
It ’s free to users , and perhaps more importantly , to developers and publishers , and it ’s available to be retrospectively added to previously released games .
It seems like an idea good enough that it would be quite ridiculous not to include it in any future games .
Although you might wonder about the reaction from publishers who seek to prevent customers from installing games on more than one computer .
Ideally , the Cloud system becoming commonplace would make such draconian thinking look sillier .
Valve say they have plans to expand the features in the near future , which hopefully means an announcement on save games .
In SF , as in many other large cities , there has been a large " housing first " push , meaning you first need to stabilize people 's lives by housing them before you can move on to dealing with other serious conditions ( mental illness , medical issues , whatever ) .
WHile I am all for it , Mayor " I want to be Governor " Gavin Newsom has put all his homeless money into only housing the most visible homeless , meaning those street folks that all the tourists complain about ( rightfully so ) .
So , basically , if he can be known as The Guy Who Made SF more Disneylike , he 'll have a better chance at the governorship , and if some old homeless males get housed along the way , great !
( who cares about homeless mothers with children , they are n't blocking the sidewalk ! )
What I love about this is , there are a bunch of hardcore homeless that hang around city hall , and now that they are all housed , what do they do all day ?
Stand around and drink .

Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley believes that not only did Vice President Dick Cheney “ unambiguously ” confess to a war crime during an ABC interview on Monday , but the US ’ future as a nation may depend on taking action .
Asked by MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann whether Cheney had just confessed to a war crime on national television , Turley at first replied wryly , “ It ’s an interesting question , is n’t it ? …
If someone commits a crime and everyone ’s around to see it and does nothing , is it still a crime ? ”
“ It most certainly is a crime to participate , to create , to in many ways monitor a torture program , ” he added .
“ What [ Cheney ] is describing is most certainly and unambiguously a war crime . ”
During Monday ’s interview , Cheney was asked , “ Did you authorize the tactics that were used against Khalid Sheikh Mohamed ? ” and replied , “ I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared . ”
“ What happens if the next administration does not press this ? ” Olbermann asked .
“ Do we let the International Court at the Hague come in and take over all our responsibilities for policing our own act here ? ”
“ That ’s what worries me the most , ” Turley replied , “ is that you ca n’t talk about change without having some moral component to it .
It ’s not just about creating jobs or lowering the price of gasoline . ”
“ What occurred in the last eight years was an assault on who we are , ” Turley said .
“ I think that President - elect Obama ’s going to have to decide whether he wants power without principle or whether he wants to start with a true change , to say that no matter where an investigation will take us , if there are crimes to be found they will be prosecuted . ”
“ It will ultimately depend on citizens , and whether they will remain silent in the face of a crime that ’s been committed in plain view , ” Turley concluded .
“ It is equally immoral to stand silent in the face of a war crime and do nothing , and that is what the citizens are doing .
There ’s this gigantic yawn . ”
This video is from MSNBC ’s Countdown , broadcast Dec. 16 , 2008 .
Borat went down well in the US , but not in Glod When a TV crew offered to pay to film the residents of a Romanian village , the locals agreed .
But they were furious to find themselves ridiculed by the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen 's hit film , Borat , and are determined to win recompense in court .
Seventeen - year - old Carmen Ciorebea dreamed of escaping her life in the poor Romanian village of Glod .
While her parents wanted her to marry her boyfriend and have children , all she wanted was to leave for Spain , to find wealth and meet new people .
Glod , which lies about 85 miles ( 140 km ) north - west of the capital , Bucharest , has cable television , yet no running water .
Clothes are washed by hand in the stream .
There are few job opportunities , least of all for Carmen , whose mother persuaded her to abandon her education to work in the family shop .
" It 's not easy here .
I 'm not happy .
It does n't suit me , what is here .
It 's better to leave and forget everything I do n't like here , " she lamented .
" Thank God I learned Spanish by watching TV .
If you learn a lot you can leave this village . "
' Backward people '
Three years ago a film crew came to Glod .
They asked the villagers to take part in a film , and - the villagers claim - paid those who did about three euros ( £ 2.50 ) each .
Glod was to become the fictional Kazakh home of Sacha Baron Cohen 's character , Borat , in the 2006 film of the same name that went on to take £ 150 m at the box office .
Carmen Ciorebea dreamed of escape to Spain
In the film , Cohen plays an uncultured journalist who leaves his home in Kazakhstan to travel to the US , where he pursues the actress Pamela Anderson .
But the villagers of Glod say they were tricked into appearing in Cohen 's film .
They claim they were told it was going to be a documentary , but instead have been portrayed as backward people and criminals .
This is disputed by the film company , which says most , if not all of the film 's subjects knew what the shoot was about .
According to Carmen 's grandfather Spiridom , the town mechanic : " They portrayed me as a gynaecologist and that I do abortions .
" I 'm not a doctor .
I 'm not a gynaecologist and I 'm not a criminal .
I do n't do abortions .
That 's what bothers me the most .
If it was a documentary , as they told us , I would n't mind . "

In another scene , Cohen stands alongside a local girl and describes her as the " number four prostitute of the whole of Kazakhstan " .
The people of Glod were persuaded to try to take on Hollywood by two lawyers , Michael Witti from Germany , and Ed Fagan from the US .
The lawyers advised them that they could receive as much as $ 30 m ( £ 18 m ) in compensation .
" They were talking about a documentary , but this is something completely different .
This is humiliation and an affront , " Mr Witti said .
Ambitious plans Carmen 's father Ion became involved in pursuing the claim against Cohen because if it was successful , he said , he wanted to use the money to invest in infrastructure and set up industry with jobs and pensions that would benefit the villagers .
Ion planned to install water pipes so the villagers would no longer have to collect their water from a well , and has ideas of opening a juice company and starting a fruit exporting business .
Ion and Spiridom Ciorebea , together with another villager , Nicholae Todorache , travelled to London from Romania where they presented their file at the offices of 20th Century Fox .
Glod 's residents were not expecting to hit the silver screen
But the lawsuit was thrown out in April by US district judge Loretta Preska , who said the case would need to make more specific allegations if it was to be successful .
A 20th Century Fox representative rebutted the Glod villagers ' claims , saying : " Most of the villagers knew they were taking part in a film , not a documentary . "
But she admitted that " maybe not all people who took part in the film understood what it was all about . "
20th Century
Fox maintain that all villagers signed release forms and most were paid more than the $ 4 , or 3 euros , recommended by the local film board .
There has been no compensation for the villagers of Glod , though their lawyers intend to refile their case .
Carmen , meanwhile , has still not escaped to Spain .
Instead , she got married and has given birth to a baby girl .

Much of the world has greeted the transfer of power from President George W. Bush to President Barack Obama with sighs of relief if not shouts of joy .
Although President Bush won a few friends in a few countries  his administration aided India and Israel and kept good relations with China , for instance  most people in most countries were happy to see him go .
Despite his administration ’s late turn toward diplomacy , President Bush was seen as too militaristic , unilateral , and arrogant in his approach to the rest of the world .
President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have voiced their intention to follow a very different strategy .
Diplomacy is back in vogue , with Secretary Clinton planning to rely on " smart power . "
No longer will the message from Washington be : " You ’re either with us or we ’ll bomb you . "
A new age has dawned , when international relations , if not the planet , have begun to heal .
Dream on .
Unfortunately , while the personnel have changed in Washington , the policies have not .
The U.S. is still determined to micro-manage affairs around the globe .
It just plans on ordering people about more nicely .
Dramatically illustrating the new administration ’s plan to adjust means , not ends , is the appointment of special envoys for Afghanistan / Pakistan and the Middle East .
Richard Holbrooke , slated for the former , is a talented diplomat  who had hoped to be secretary of state in a Hillary Clinton administration .
George Mitchell , covering the even more troubled Mideast , made the switch from politician to envoy in helping to midwife the peace settlement in Northern Ireland .
But their skills will be wasted unless Washington adjusts its policies .
The problem in Afghanistan is that the U.S. and its allies are attempting to build a centralized state where none has ever existed .
The Bush administration quickly achieved its goal of defenestrating the Taliban regime but was too enamored of starting another war in Iraq to consolidate its gains .
There appears to be no military solution today , yet President Barack is preparing to send 30,000 more troops to this " graveyard of empires . "
Pakistan has suffered from too much U.S. attention for too long .
Throughout the Cold War Washington underwrote and armed whatever regime , civilian or military , was in power in Islamabad .
To weaken the Soviet Union , Washington funneled aid to the Afghan resistance through Pakistan  which supported the most extreme Islamist factions .
Corrupt democracy alternated with repressive autocracy with no obvious impact on U.S. policy .
Even when democracy reemerged last year , Washington was unwilling to give up on President Pervez Musharraf , a dead man walking politically , loathed by most everyone except his own family .
Even as he was being eased out the U.S. government lectured the Pakistani people about his virtues .
His successor faces multiple crises , made worse by continuing U.S. strikes in Pakistani border territories .
Even when American missiles hit their targets , they kill innocent as well as al - Qaeda , further stoking hatred of the U.S. and the impotent U.S. - supported regime in Islamabad .
So just what is Richard Holbrooke supposed to do ?
Invite everyone to circle a fire in the wilds of northwest Pakistan and sing " Kumbaya " ?
The Middle East is even worse .
For 40 years the U.S. government has backed Israel and a toxic mix of Arab dictatorships , irrespective of circumstances .
The Palestinian people have suffered through Israeli occupation , Arab indifference , brutal misgovernment , material poverty , and constant conflict .
Despite occasional professions of humanitarian concern for the plight of people living without political rights and economic opportunity , Washington steadfastly backed Israel as it colonized the West Bank and inflicted needless death and hardship on the peoples of Lebanon and the occupied territories , most recently in Gaza .
Highlighting who holds the leash , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently claimed to need just one phone call to President Bush to force Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to abandon the United Nations Security Council resolution on Gaza that she helped author .
So what is George Mitchell supposed to do ?
Invite everyone to a church retreat to share their feelings ?
Naturally , the usual journalists and analysts in Washington are focused on the usual inside baseball .
To whom will the emissaries report ?
Will they escape Secretary Clinton ’s control ?
And who is the first person that Holbrooke , known to be anything but the demure personality many people associate with diplomacy , will offend ?
The Bush administration ’s confrontational mien obviously undercut administration policy .
But the greatest flaw of the Bush era was substantive , not procedural .
George W. Bush apparently believed that the U.S. could dictate to the rest of the world , transforming distant countries and disparate peoples into America ’s image .
This extraordinary hubris would have guaranteed failure even had the administration not adopted ignorance and incompetence as its handmaidens .
Unfortunately , in few important areas does the Obama administration different significantly from its predecessor .
Some troops may come home more quickly from Iraq .
Diplomatic dialogue may open with Iran and Syria .
The embargo against Cuba might be moderated .
Sweet nothings likely will be whispered in the ears of European leaders .
But military exertions in Afghanistan will increase .
Economic relations with China may become more contentious .
Battles over trade may intensify .
In short , America ’s foreign policy remains deeply flawed .
No amount of improved diplomacy will make a difference : the Obama administration is attempting to put lipstick on a pig , to coin a phrase that the president knows well .
The end of the Bush administration is an undoubted plus for America and the rest of the world .
But without a change in policy , the benefit is likely to be more atmospheric than substantive .
It is time for a serious debate over foreign policy .
Should the U.S. continue to act as the globe ’s dominatrix , irrespective of cost and risk ?
Should Washington continue to sacrifice domestic prosperity , liberty , and security in order to impose its will around the world ?
So long as the Obama administration answers yes to these questions , the world is going to look about the same as the last eight years .
Which means that the tragic results will be the same as well .

As a Movable Type Consultant , I would like to share with you some key characteristics your Web hosting should support :
1 ) LAMP
LAMP is an acronym that stands for Linux , Apache , MySQL and PHP .
The combination of these powerful open - source technologies is used to define the web server 's environment where your site will be hosted .
In other words , your Web site should be hosted on a Linux server operating the Apache Web server , running PHP , and allowing you to develop a Movable Type- powered site with a MySQL database .

2 ) ImageMagick
Movable
Type allows you to create thumbnails on the fly for all the images you would like to display with your articles .
You have this option when you upload the image , or you could automatically generate it using a dedicated plugin .
This functionality , however , requires a plugin module called ImageMagick .
To be operational in Movable Type , ImageMagick should be complemented with PerlMagick .
Unfortunately there are still some hosting providers that support pre-version 4.x of , or do not have ImageMagick installed .
3 ) Server Perfomance
Many hosting companies , even some of the big names , unfortunately do not share enough server resources with their customers .
That is because or they have too much customers , oversell the server capacity or do not invest on top quality devices .
As a consequence the Movable Type Support Forums are full of hundreds and hundreds of support requests mentioning various problems with all sort of Errors , mainly Error 500 .
Do your research seriously or apply for PRO IT Service 's hosting package and we guarantee that you get your money back if you experience any problems hosting with us .

Heartland Payment Systems ( HPY ) on Tuesday disclosed that intruders hacked into the computers it uses to process 100 million payment card transactions per month for 175,000 merchants .
Robert Baldwin , Heartland 's president and CFO , said in a USA TODAY interview that the intruders had access to Heartland 's system for " longer than weeks " in late 2008 .
The number of victims is unknown .
" We just do n't have the information right now , " Baldwin said .
Tech security experts said the breach could set a record .
Retail giant TJX lost 94 million customer records to hackers in 2007 .
With more than 100 million transactions per month , they could discover that several months ' worth of transactions were captured , says Michael Maloof , chief technology officer at TriGeo Network Security .
Heartland processes card payments for restaurants , retailers and other merchants .
It discovered the hack last week after Visa and MasterCard notified it of suspicious transactions stemming from accounts linked to its systems .
Investigators then found the data - stealing program planted by the thieves .
" Our discussions with the Secret Service and Department of Justice give us a pretty good indication that this is part of a group that appears to have done security breaches at other financial institutions , " said Baldwin .
" This is a very sophisticated attack . "
Once it sorts out the matter , Heartland plans to notify each victim whose data were stolen to comply with data - loss disclosure laws in more than 30 states , Baldwin said .
" Cleaning up the mess could be potentially much more expensive than any fines or penalties , " says Michael Argast , senior analyst at security firm Sophos .
Heartland 's disclosure coincides with reports of heightened criminal activities involving stolen payment card numbers .
Security firm CardCops has been tracking a 20 % year - over - year increase in Internet chat room activity where hackers test batches of payment card numbers to make sure that they 're active .
" The numbers could have come from a processor , like Heartland , or some other source that has access to a lot of customer data but is not a retailer , " says Dan Clements , CardCops president .
Also , Forcht Bank in Kentucky last week began issuing replacement debit cards to 8,500 patrons , due to reports of fraudulent card activity .
" There are several other banks affected , and this is not isolated to Forcht Bank customers , " the bank said in a Jan. 12 statement to customers .

A woman , who registered on MySpace as a boy , will face trial after she bullied a girl who later committed suicide .
The jury selection is on its way .
The 49 - year - old Lori Drew pretended to be a boy named Josh Evans .
She made friends with 13 - year - old Megan Meier and after the woman broke off the " friendship " by writing a number of offensive words , the girl hanged herself .
The girl was a neighbor of Ms Drew , living in St Louis and a friend of the woman 's daughter .
She committed suicide in October 2006 .
It is believed that the girl hanged herself after receiving a number of cruel messages from the fake 16 - year - old boy .
One of the messages Drew wrote to the girl said that the world would be better off without her .
According to prosecutors , Drew and a number of other individuals decided to register a fake profile on MySpace after a fight she had with Meier .
The charges Ms Drew faces are most often used against computer hackers , i.e. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
The reason why these charges were stated is because prosecutors could not come across any laws within the state of Missouri that could be applied , reports BBC .
Drew could be sentenced to 20 years in case she is found guilty on each of the four counts .
It is important to note that she is not being charged over the girl 's death .
At first District Judge George
Wu decided not to take into consideration the evidence of the suicide in order to shun from the defense case .
However , he dismissed the idea , considering the jurors would most probably know the details of the case .
The lawyers of Ms Drew are concerned with the fact that jury would confuse the issues and come up with the conclusion that the case is about the death of a young girl .
" The jury is going to end up thinking that Lori Drew is being tried for the death of Megan Meier , " said Dean Steward .

Heavy falls in Aberdeenshire even gave the sheep a coating of snow
Snow began falling at 10 am yesterday in parts of Scotland and north - east England as the weather front moved in from the Arctic circle , with around five centimetres in Aberdeen last night .

The freak snowfall on the night of October 28 has already been described by forecasters as the most outstanding example of early snowfall in the south east of England since 1880 and has seen some bookmakers slashing their odds on a white Christmas .

Gene Robinson , the gay bishop Barack Obama invited to his presidential inauguration , has criticized the president - elect in the past .
But he ’s on board with the transition team ’s insistence that his invitation was long planned , well before the Rev. Rick Warren scandal … even though he was n’t actually invited until recently .
( Obama maintains they had planned to invite him all along . )
Here appeared tonight on Rachel Maddow ’s show — which locked him in to a “ speak to us and nobody else ” arrangement — saying , “ I do feel very confident that this president - elect understands us [ the gay community ] and stands with us in the issues that are important to us .
Of course , we ’re going to hold his feet to the fire about that . ”
“ But as a religious person , no one had a bigger tent than Jesus , and I must say I think the whole notion of the big tent , where every human being is acknowledged as being a child of God and frankly , as worthy of our respect and concern , that sort of vision I believe is Barack Obama ’s vision as well , and I long for a government that respect the dignity of every human being , especially those who are less fortunate . ”
And regarding Obama ’s 1996 full support of gay marriage , Robinson says : “ As you know , all the Democratic candidates stopped short of endorsing gay marriage .
What I do believe about this new president is that he believes in equal rights for all American citizens .
And in the end , I hope that that ’s where America will move in terms of gay marriage .
Certainly as a religious person I will support anything that shows us to be equally valuable to each other and to our government . ”
Florian Mueller , Open Source Patent Activist , just released the following information .
He believes that patents already used by IBM against TurboHercules are also a threat to other major FOSS projects .
He now calls on the community for action .
OpenBSD , Xen , VirtualBox , Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization , MySQL , PostgreSQL , SQLite and Kaffe could also face patent infringement assertions -- " FOSS Patents " blog lists patents and explains how those patents may read on other Free and Open Source Software Projects -- " Call to Research " on FOSS community for further analysis and identification of additional issues
Brussels , Belgium , 12 April 2010 -- Florian Mueller , the founder of the European NoSoftwarePatents campaign who recently published a letter in which IBM threatens the Hercules open source emulator with 173 of its patents , has today published an initial analysis according to which a dozen of the patents IBM asserted against Hercules may also read on other major Free and Open Source Software ( FOSS ) projects , including but not limited to OpenBSD , Xen , VirtualBox , Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization , MySQL , PostgreSQL , SQLite and Kaffe .
Mueller lists those patents on his blog and provides a general description of the programming techniques covered by those patents and inhowfar they are a potential threat to other FOSS programs .
Mueller is not yet aware of any actual assertions by IBM of such patents against other Free and Open Source Software than the Hercules mainframe emulator , but " [ c] onsidering that IBM has already used them in a threat letter to TurboHercules , those patents must be considered particularly dangerous " , says the activist .
He was widely credited for his contributions five years ago to the rejection of a European proposal for software patent legislation .
In order to look into this in more depth and find additional IBM patents assertable against Free and Open Source Software , Mueller issues a " Call to Research " , encouraging members of the FOSS community to provide further analysis and identify additional problems that IBM 's patents -- especially the ones already asserted against the French open source startup TurboHercules -- could represent .
The blog post indicates that Mueller will look at the community contributions to this effort and indicates that IBM will ultimately be requested to remove the potential threat emanating from its patents to Free and Open Source Software in general , describing the original pledge of 500 patents as only a " drop in the ocean " .
In a previous blog post , Mueller stressed that " IBM 's attack on Hercules is an attack on interoperability and FOSS innovation " .
While there are only 10,000 to 12,000 mainframe computers in use today and there is consequently only a limited number of Hercules users , the activist believes the FOSS community should look at the " broader implications " of the case .
for the open innovation model and for interoperability between FOSS and proprietary systems : " Do you still want to be able to open Word and Excel documents with OpenOffice ?
Do you want to run a heterogeneous network of Windows and GNU / Linux machines and exchange data freely ?
If the answer is yes , then you should care about Hercules " , Mueller writes .
In his post he expresses the belief that those and similar views are shared by a majority of the FOSS community : " No one in his right mind wants patents to be used against FOSS . "
Head of L.A. film festival quits over Prop . 8
Richard Raddon , the director of the Los Angeles Film Festival , who has been at the center of controversy since it was revealed almost two weeks ago that he had contributed $ 1,500 to the campaign to ban same - sex marriage in California , resigned from his post over the weekend .
The nonprofit arts organization Film Independent sponsors the Los Angeles Film Festival , held in May , and the popular Independent Spirit awards .
Raddon is a member of the Mormon Church , which called on its congregants to work for the passage of Proposition 8 , the constitutional amendment defining marriage as only between a man and a woman .
It has been estimated that Mormons gave more than $ 20 million in support of the recently passed ballot measure .
After Raddon 's contribution was made public online , Film Independent was swamped with criticism from " No on 8 " supporters inside and outside the organization .
Within days , Raddon offered to step down as festival director , but the board , which includes Don Cheadle , Forest Whitaker , Lionsgate President Tom Ortenberg and Fox Searchlight President Peter Rice , gave him a unanimous vote of confidence .
Yet the anti-Raddon bile continued to bubble in the blogosphere , and according to one Film Independent board member , " No on 8 " supporters also berated Raddon personally via phone calls and e-mails .
The recriminations ultimately proved too much , and when Raddon offered to resign again , this time the board accepted .
In a statement , Raddon said , " I have always held the belief that all people , no matter race , religion or sexual orientation , are entitled to equal rights .
As many know , I consider myself a devout and faithful Mormon .
I prefer to keep the details around my contribution through my church a private matter .
But I am profoundly sorry for the negative attention that my actions have drawn to Film Independent and for the hurt and pain that is being experienced in the GLBT ( gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender ) community . "
Raddon 's support for Proposition 8 has sparked debate within the gay community and Hollywood , as many publicly worry about punishing people for free speech , even speech they deemed hateful , and his departure already has provoked ambivalence .
" I 'm personally saddened by the outcome , " said Film Independent board member Bill Condon , the writer - director of " Dreamgirls . "
" Someone has lost his job and possibly his livelihood because of privately held religious beliefs .
I think the organization was ready to tough this out , but Rich ultimately decided it was n't worth the cost .
I 'm not sure he was right . "
Ever since the passage of Proposition 8 , liberal Hollywood has been debating whether and how to publicly punish those who supported the controversial amendment to the state Constitution .
Scott Eckern , the director of the nonprofit California Musical Theatre in Sacramento , recently resigned amid a flurry of condemnation from prominent theater artists .
There also have been calls for boycotts of the Cinemark theater chain , whose chief executive , Alan Stock , donated $ 9,999 to " Yes on 8 . "
Activists have also called for pulling " Milk , " the film about slain San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk , from Cinemark screens .
A representative for " Milk " distributor Focus Features said that the studio had long ago committed to playing " Milk " in Cinemark houses in December , because of their successful exhibition of " Brokeback Mountain , " the 2005 Oscar - winning film about two cowboys in love .
The Aviarios Sloth Sanctuary in Costa Rica rescues injured and orphaned sloths .
Many of these sloths are released back into the wild but often stick around the neighborhood .
This series of photos follows Joy , a baby sloth born on October 25 , 2008 to two of the sanctuary 's residents , Juliett and Gigia .
Mama Juliet came to the sanctuary with severe electrical burns .
However since then she has thrived and become a sweet and gentle resident .
Father Gigia was rescued from street vendors when he was a week old .
Joy is the pair 's their fourth baby .
In addition to rehabilitation , Aviarios Sloth Sanctuary promotes conservation and sloth interests within Costa Rica .
Joy and her parents are two - toed sloths , also called Choloepus .
Many many more photos below the fold .
Nonetheless the comments of Gwede Mantashe , the party 's secretary - general , were laden with qualifications .
" I do n't think invading Zimbabwe or sanctions would work , " he said .
" What will we do to make Mugabe retire ?
We will persuade him . "
But he said such a mission would not be easy , because of what he claimed was racism on the part of the international criminal court in The Hague .

Excerpts :
" (U ) Al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists are taught to expect Americans to abuse them .
They are recruited based on false propaganda that says the United States is out to destroy Islam .
Treating detainees harshly only reinforces that distorted view , increases resistance to cooperation , and creates new enemies .
In fact , the April 2006 National Intelligence Estimate “ Trends in Global Terrorism : Implications for the United States ” cited “ pervasive anti U.S. sentiment among most Muslims ” as an underlying factor fueling the spread of the global jihadist movement .
Former Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee in June 2008 that “ there are serving U.S. flag - rank officers who maintain that the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat deaths in Iraq – as judged by their effectiveness in recruiting insurgent fighters into combat – are , respectively the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo . ”
(U) The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of “ a few bad apples ” acting on their own .
The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees .
Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives , strengthened the hand of our enemies , and compromised our moral authority .
This report is a product of the Committee ’s inquiry into how those unfortunate results came about
A. Conclusions on GTMO ’s Request for Aggressive Techniques :
Conclusion 13 : Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ’s authorization of aggressive interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo Bay was a direct cause of detainee abuse there .
Secretary Rumsfeld ’s December 2 , 2002 approval of Mr. Haynes ’s recommendation that most of the techniques contained in GTMO ’s October 11 , 2002 request be authorized , influenced and contributed to the use of abusive techniques , including military working dogs , forced nudity , and stress positions , water boarding in Afghanistan and Iraq .
B. Conclusions on Interrogations in Iraq and Afghanistan :
Conclusion 15 : Special Mission Unit ( SMU ) Task Force ( TF ) interrogation policies were influenced by the Secretary of Defense ’s December 2 , 2002 approval of aggressive interrogation techniques for use at GTMO .
SMU TF interrogation policies in Iraq included the use of aggressive interrogation techniques such as military working dogs and stress positions .
SMU TF policies were a direct cause of detainee abuse and influenced interrogation policies at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere in Iraq .
Conclusion 19 : The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 was not simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own .
Interrogation techniques such as stripping detainees of their clothes , placing them in stress positions , and using military working dogs to intimidate them appeared in Iraq only after they had been approved for use in Afghanistan and at GTMO .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ’s December 2 , 2002 authorization of aggressive interrogation techniques and subsequent interrogation policies and plans approved by senior military and civilian officials conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees in U.S. military custody .
What followed was an erosion in standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely . "

Sometimes water , fire extinguishers and axes just do n't cut it when it comes to effective fire fighting .
Sometimes you have to bring in the big guns .
Sometimes ... your only recourse is the ' Fire Fighting Flower ' !
Always on the cutting edge of new technology , Japan has developed a totally new way to fight fires .
Have n't bought yours yet ?
Believe me , this is going to be the next big ' thing ' in fire fighting circles .
The package is extremely user friendly .
On the side here they use real life pictures to show you in graphic detail exactly how to use the flowers .
I 've included an English guide on the left side free of charge .
If that was n't clear enough , the back panel includes a little cartoon ( this is Japan after all ) with a more detailed description .
1 . A young mother forgets about that pan of hot oil she was heating on the stove as she was busy watching daytime dramas .
She walks into the kitchen an hour later ( holding the flowers naturally ) and notices that she 's minutes away from burning down her building .
2 . With a determined gesture , she sticks the flowers into the fire .
Take that fire !!
3 . The fire is out and the battle is won .
Or is it ?
Better wait a minute to make sure those flames have settled , the pan is cooled and the flowers have done their business .
4 . If getting the chance to use your flowers successfully in a real life fire is n't a reason to smile , I do n't know what is !
Do n't worry about the fact that you 've ruined dinner and a good pan , scorched the ceiling , filled your apartment with smoke and contributed to global warming .
So how effective are they ?
Well I could 've bought some , started a fire in my apartment and given them a hands on test , but this picture convinced me of their competence .
If firemen are already using them , then I think that 's a pretty good recommendation . |
Like consumers and homeowners , America ’s corporations binged on easy credit when times were flush , racking up huge debts .
Now the bills are due , and paying them back will not be easy , or cheap .
This year alone , more than $ 700 billion in corporate loans will come due , according to Standard & Poor’s .
That is the size of the federal bailout of the financial sector .
Many companies were counting on being able to borrow more money to meet those obligations and kick their debt farther down the road .
But with the credit markets still tight , corporations are being forced to pay much higher interest rates than they did a few years ago , putting more strain on balance sheets already hammered by falling profits and a grinding recession .
It is a lesson the discount carrier Southwest Airlines learned firsthand in December , when it went to the bond markets to raise $ 400 million , in part to cover its losses from betting that fuel costs would stay high .
As President - elect Barack Obama and lawmakers attempt to reach agreement on what sort of stimulus package has the best chance of arresting America ’s economic free fall , the enormity of the immediate crisis naturally pushes any issue that can be deferred to the margin .
As a consequence , there ’s been little discussion of the way in which this economic implosion has exposed the utter failure of the now - ubiquitous 401 ( k ) retirement accounts .
In fact , the entire 401 ( k ) system looks increasingly like the sort of bait - and - switch con relished by the Bernie Madoff ’s of the world .
As Robyn Credico , a leading consultant on pensions , told the Wall Street Journal this week , “ This is the biggest test that the 401 ( k ) plan has seen to date , and it has failed . ”
Here ’s the problem :
In 1978 , when Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to include Section 401 ( k ) , it envisioned the provision mainly as a way for workers to supplement their companies ’ traditional defined - benefit pension plans and Social Security .
( Secondarily , it also was a nifty hideaway where highly paid executives could shelter income from taxes . )
Advertisement
Nobody at the time envisioned the 401 ( k ) as something on which people would rely for their retirement .
But in the years that followed , more and more employers began to look for ways to get out of funding the pension and health plans that , up to then , had been regarded as part of the responsible capitalist social contract .
Two innovations in political ideology -- one on the left and one on the right -- provided superb cover for the companies ’ greed .
For the Democrats , “ choice ” became a mantra , and the 401 ( k ) suddenly became a mechanism through which working people could “ choose ” how to fund and manage their own retirement .
On the Republican side , the notion of “ an ownership society ” came into vogue .
There , the theory was that giving working people an ownership interest in the equities market would promote greater personal responsibility and make people better citizens .
Nobody bothered to ask employees whether they wanted to swap their pensions for choice or ownership , nor did anybody stop to notice that very few people are suited by background , ability or temperament to actively manage investments .
Advertisement
If there is such a thing as lethal social poison , it is avarice cloaked in political piety .
Companies seized the opportunity to abandon their defined - benefit pension plans .
Today , more than 60 % of all U.S. workers rely on 401 ( k ) s as their primary retirement fund .
They ’re not eager to “ choose ” their own retirement program , nor are they enthusiastic “ owners ” of American business .
They ’re draftees .
Essentially , millions of us have been conscripted into the equities markets , where we have helped fuel stock prices and provided a bonanza for the financial services companies that manage and sell investment funds .
The problem is that , since the markets ’ peak in October 2007 , our 401 ( k ) s have lost a collective $ 1 trillion in value .
That ’s fully a third of the value of all 401 ( k ) s .
The picture is actually worse than that because another $ 1 trillion has been stripped from people who lost or changed jobs and rolled their 401 ( k ) s into individual retirement accounts .
Those are the most obvious losses .
Look a little closer and the picture is even bleaker : According to a study by the American Assn. of Retired People , 20 % of American workers have been forced to stop contributing to their 401 ( k ) s and individual retirement accounts by economic hardship .
Advertisement
Millions of others have been forced to make early , so - called hardship withdrawals from their accounts because they ’ve lost their jobs or healthcare or are facing foreclosure .
The 10 % early withdrawal penalty is a catastrophic expense in such a context .
Millions more have taken loans from their 401 ( k ) s to meet pressing debts or expenses , like college tuitions .
Not only are those workers missing out on any available appreciation in their investment , but -- in a time of rising unemployment -- they ’re running a terrible risk .
If you lose your job , you must immediately repay the entire balance on any outstanding loan from your 401( k ) .
If you can ’t , you ’re liable not only for income tax on the unpaid balance but also the additional 10 % penalty for early withdrawal from the 401( k ) .
With many economists predicting unemployment at 9 % to 10 % by the end of 2009 -- welcome to hard times .
Finally , consider this :
The collapse of the 401 ( k ) experiment is occurring just as the baby boom generation begins to retire in significant numbers .
Welcome to hard times , indeed .

Like many money managers , Mr. Gross is a conservative  he describes himself as a “ Reagan fan from way back ”  who generally prefers limited government involvement in the markets .
But he and others say that the government ’s sweeping intervention into private industry and in the markets , though sometimes flawed , is necessary to prevent a collapse of the financial system .
They are hoping that policy makers do even more to stimulate the economy and revive moribund financial markets .
Given the damage in the markets , however , policy makers face daunting challenges .
“ When we have bear markets , they usually take twice as long to get down this far , ” said Robert C. Doll , vice chairman of BlackRock , the big investment firm .
The markets have become incredibly volatile , especially since Lehman Brothers sank into bankruptcy in September .
Since then , the S.& P. has moved more than 5 percent in either direction on 18 days .
There were only 17 such days in the previous 53 years , according to calculations by Howard Silverblatt , an index analyst at S.& P .
Diversification  the idea that it is unwise to put all your eggs in one basket  did not pay off for investors in 2008 , casting doubt over this cornerstone of modern investing .
The American market was far from the worst hit in 2008 .
Stocks fell 55 to 72 percent in the so - called BRIC economies  Brazil , Russia , India and China  that were darlings of the late , great boom .
Stocks in developed European and Asian markets also fell sharply , though less than their emerging counterparts .
Many commodities like oil and copper crashed .
Losses in the credit markets , which are at the heart of this financial crisis , appear small relative to the devastation in other markets .
The International Monetary Fund estimated in October that banks and other investors would suffer $ 1.4 trillion in losses on loans and securities , a loss of just 6 percent .
Financial institutions globally have already reported $ 1 trillion in write - downs , according to Bloomberg .
The I.M.F.’s estimate , however , does not count losses on derivatives , those complex instruments that derive their value from other assets .
Losses on these instruments could outstrip those in the so - called cash markets because they are much bigger than their underlying assets .
A spokeswoman for the I.M.F. said the fund ’s estimates did not include those losses because they were transfers of wealth from one party of a transaction to another .
For example , when the insurer American International Group loses $ 1 billion on a credit - default swap , a type of derivative , it makes payments to customers like investment banks .
Rolls - Royce Testing the Waters with Tidal Power Turbines
January 14th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
The venerable Rolls - Royce , maker of some of the finest motorcars , engines and turbines in the world , will be sea-testing tidal power turbines off the coast of the UK beginning this summer .
[ social_buttons ]
According to company officials , Rolls - Royce along with a company called Tidal Generation Limited , will begin trials of a half - megawatt ( MW ) turbine this summer .
Rolls has also entered a separate R&D partnership to build and test a 1 MW version that should be in the water in about 18 months .
“ By 2020 there could be 300 MW ( tidal power deployed ) around the UK , or 100 - 200 devices , ” Ric Parker , the director of research and technology for Rolls - Royce told Reuters .
Parker said the company is spending about 5 percent of its R&D budget on clean energy technologies including tidal power and fuel cells .
Whereas the UK has been a bit of a laggard in terms of developing their wind energy resource ( mostly because of aesthetic opposition ) , they have been at the forefront of tidal power development .
Just last year a company called SeaGen installed the world ’s first commercial - scale tidal power turbine off the coast of Northern Ireland and several companies including Google are exploring the possibilities of tidal - powered data centers — both off - grid and grid - tied — in the strong tidal currents surrounding the British Isles .

With 2008 now rapidly receding in the rear - view mirror , it 's time to reflect on the year that was in drug policy .
Drug War Chronicle published around 500 separate articles on all aspects of drug policy in 2008 -- national and international , state and local -- and while it 's difficult to winnow it all down , below are the stories , processes , and themes we think make up the 10 most important drug reform stories of the year ( in no particular order ) :
Massachusetts Voters Overwhelmingly Pass Marijuana Decriminalization
Marijuana legalization still appears a distant chimera , but three decades after the initial spurt of states decriminalizing marijuana , we may be seeing the beginnings of a new round of successful decriminalization moves .
Nevada decriminalized , or defelonized , in 2001 , becoming the first state to do so since the 1970s , and in November , Massachusetts approved a decrim initiative with 65 % of the popular vote .
It goes into effect today , making the Bay State the 12th state to make the possession of small amounts of pot an infraction , not a crime .
New Hampshire could have become the next decrim state last year after a decrim bill surprisingly passed in the House , but it was later killed in the Senate .
Suburban Chicago Heights , Illinois , however , adopted decrim in December , and local initiatives making adult marijuana possession offenses the lowest law enforcement priority -- which would result in de facto decrim if law enforcement actually obeyed them -- passed in Hawaii County , Hawaii , and Fayetteville , Arkansas , adding them to a list that now includes Ann Arbor , Denver , Seattle , a half - dozen California communities , and Eureka Springs , Arkansas .
signs of life in Congress
Medical marijuana continues its long march across the states .
The biggest victory this year came in Michigan , where voters approved a medical marijuana initiative with 63 % of the vote , making Michigan the 13th medical marijuana state and the first in the Midwest .
That will undoubtedly help ongoing legislative efforts in states like Kansas , Illinois , Minnesota , and Ohio .
In Minnesota , a bill that had passed the Senate in 2007 stalled in the House in the face of veto threats , while in New York , the Assembly passed a medical marijuana bill only to have it see no action in the Senate .
Kansas saw its first legislative hearing ever on a medical marijuana bill , although that bill died a few weeks later .
Last month , a New Jersey medical marijuana bill won a Senate committee vote and is still alive .
NORA Goes Down to Defeat in California
If marijuana fared well in the November elections , the same thing can't be said for a massive sentencing reform initiative in California .
The Non-Violent Offenders Rehabilitation Act ( NORA ) would have broadened and deepened the Proposition 36 sentencing reforms passed in 2001 , but , faced with powerful and deep - pocketed opponents , including drug czar John Walters , the California prison guards ' union , and drug court professionals , NORA went down in defeat with only 39 % of the vote .
There was more bad news , too :
While rejecting NORA , voters approved the Crime Victims Bill of Rights Act , which blocks local authorities from granting early release to prisoners to alleviate overcrowding and mandates that the cash - strapped state -- officials say they will begin issuing IOUs instead of cash payments as soon as March -- fully fund corrections to ensure no prisoners are released early .
At least , voters rejected an even more onerous initiative , the Safe Neighborhoods Act , which , while aimed mainly at gang members , violent criminals , and criminal aliens , would also have increased sentences for meth offenses and provided for the expulsion from public housing of anyone convicted of a drug offense .
It looks like " tough on crime " still trumps " smart on crime " in the Golden State .
Signs of Life in Congress
After six years of Republican domination of both the executive and legislative branches in Washington , Democrats took back control of the Congress in the November 2006 elections , and by 2008 , some small stirrings on drug reform were becoming evident .
Not that we expect to see congressional Democrats end the drug war , but every little bit helps .
In February , efforts to finally begin to undo the crack - powder cocaine sentencing disparity got a boost when a House committee held hearings on it .
The next month , the Senate passed the Second Chance Act , which had already been passed by the House and which will provide assistance to prisoners reentering society .
President Bush signed that bill in April .
Even the Republicans seem to have come around a little bit .
Several of them supported bills that would address the crack - powder cocaine sentencing disparity , and Republican votes helped get the Second Chance Act over the top .
One bill that Bush would never sign -- it is unclear whether Obama would -- is Rep. Barney Frank 's ( D - MA ) federal marijuana decriminalization bill , the first such bill introduced in decades .
Do n't hold your breath on this one , but even getting a bill filed in Congress represents progress .
In another sign of changing times , in August , Rep. Jose Serrano ( D - NY ) and 25 cosponsors introduced a bill to end the federal ban on needle exchange funding .
A similar bill by Serrano lifted Congress 's ban on the District of Columbia government spending its own resources on needle exchange .
Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) also played an increasingly prominent role in pushing for sentencing and drug policy reform .
Using the Joint Economic Committee as his pulpit , he held a 2007 hearing on sentencing and followed that up with a June hearing on the economic and social costs of current drug policies .
We sure did n't see anything like that during the years the GOP controlled the Congress .
Not that it 's all good on the Hill .
Congressional Democrats continued to play the politics of tough on crime and drugs , especially around the issue of funding federal grants to support those multi-jurisdictional anti-drug law enforcement task forces .
But from a drug policy perspective , 2008 was a much better year on the Hill than any in this decade .
As for 2009 , well , that 's another article .
Salvia Divinorum and the Prohibitionist Impulse
Efforts to ban the hallucinogenic Mexican plant salvia divinorum picked up pace in 2008 , a perfect expression of the reflex prohibitionist response to any new substance .
Although the plant has been used by Masatec shamans for centuries , it is new on the recreational drug scene , and that 's enough for cops and legislators to want to shut it town , even though the DEA , which has studied it for years , has not moved to do so .
Given the scant -- at best -- evidence of any harm done by using it , the only justification for banning it is the idea that somebody somewhere is getting high and must be stopped .
In 2008 , California made Salvia sales to minors a misdemeanor ( effective yesterday , 1/1/09 ) , while Florida , Illinois , Kansas , Mississippi , and Virginia all banned it or its active ingredient , Salvinorin A .
At this writing , a similar bill is on the desk of Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland .
Other states where salvia ban efforts were underway in 2008 include Nebraska , South Carolina , Alabama , Massachusetts , and Texas .
The six states that banned it in ( or whose previously passed bans went into effect in ) 2008 joined Delaware , Louisiana , Maine , Missouri , North Dakota , Oklahoma , and Tennessee , which had all banned it since 2005 .
2008 also won the dubious distinction of being the year of the first known arrests in the US for salvia charges .
In North Dakota , Kenneth Rau was arrested after ordering $ 40 worth of salvia leaves on eBay and faced years in prison .
It 's not known what happened in his case .
And in Nebraska , Lincoln shop owner Christian Firoz was arrested for selling salvia even though the plant is not illegal there .
He was creatively charged under a law banning the sale of substances for the purpose of intoxication .
His trial is pending .
Salvia Divinorum Google ads continued to run on South Dakota news sites after Rau was busted .
Britain had taken a bold step forward when , heeding the recommendations of numerous advisory panels , it downgraded marijuana from a Class B to a Class C drug in 2004 .
But in May , desperate to burnish its tough on drugs and crime credentials , a flailing Labor government announced it was returning marijuana to Class B. Labor was aided and abetted in turning public opinion against marijuana by a Reefer Madness - style tabloid campaign that would have made William Randolph Hearst blush .
For weeks on end , credulous tabloid readers were treated to headlines along the lines of " Son twisted by skunk knifed father 23 times , " " How cannabis made me a monster , " " Escaped prisoner killed man while high on skunk cannabis , " " Boys on skunk butchered a grandmother , " and " Teen who butchered two friends was addicted to skunk cannabis " -- and that 's just from one newspaper , the Daily Mail .
Since then , the Reefer Madness campaign has subsided somewhat , only to be replaced by a steady diet of " cannabis factory " bust stories , with grow ops being busted on a daily basis and their operators too often hustled off to gaol .
The steady drumbeat of sensational press stories may help explain declining support for drug reform in recent polls .
In any case , marijuana goes back to being a more serious offense at the end of this month , and Britain marches resolutely backward into the last century .
America Wages Ineffective War Against Poppies and Islamists in Afghanistan
2008 was the bloodiest year yet for American and NATO forces in Afghanistan , where 155 American troops and 138 NATO troops were killed , along with uncounted thousands of Afghan rebels and civilians .
While the country saw a slight reduction in opium cultivation and production , Afghanistan still produces more than 90 % of the global opium supply , and that fact leaves the West with a terrible paradox :
Try to eliminate the drug trade and face driving Afghan peasants into the waiting arms of the Taliban , or ignore the drug trade and let the Taliban profit to the tune of $ 100 million a year or more .
That buys a lot of shiny new weapons to shoot at foreign troops and their Afghan government allies .
NATO and the US military want nothing to do with pissing off poppy - planting peasants , much to the dismay of the State Department and the drug warriors , but in October reluctantly agreed to enlist in the war on poppies by targeting drug traffickers associated with the Taliban -- but not those associated with the government in Kabul .
Afghanistan is possibly the most serious foreign policy crisis facing the United States , the situation is deteriorating , and the drug war and drug prohibition were right in the middle of it .
America Gets High , Mexico Bleeds
Mexican President Felipe Calderón took office in December 2006 and immediately sent in the army to battle that country 's so - called cartels .
It has n't gone well : Since then , more than 7,000 people have been killed in prohibition - related violence , with 2008 's toll alone climbing above 5,000 as the multi-sided violence escalated .
The Chronicle was there -- in person -- reporting on the military takeover of Reynosa in February , covering a conference on alternatives to the drug war in Sinaloa Cartel hometown Culiacán in May , and reporting on efforts to address military impunity for drug war human rights violations on that same trip .
Since then , matters have only deteriorated , with little sign of any improvement on the horizon .
And the US is determined to make matters worse , with the Bush administration and the Congress approving a three - year , $ 1.4 billion " Plan Mérida " aid package to provide anti-drug assistance to the Mexican police and military .
But with drug corruption scandals in law enforcement there occurring on an almost weekly basis , it is difficult to see how even a massive aid package is going to make much difference .
marijuana legalization march , Mexico City
The continuing violence -- and its roots in American appetites for drugs and desires to prohibit them -- is having a perhaps not unexpected result :
As the casualties mount and the costs increase , the Mexican public and Mexican politicians of all stripes have begun debating whether there might be a better path .
In August , the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) said it was time to put legalization on the table , a move that won some favor with Mexicans in a poll the following month .
A week later , President Calderón announced his party would consider decriminalizing possession of small amounts of all drugs , and the following month , majority members of the Mexico City city council introduced a bill to decriminalize marijuana possession and allow for cannabis coffee shops in the Mexican capital .
Mexico is living with the bloody results of drug prohibition that makes the violence of American cities pale by comparison .
And that is provoking , finally , some outside the box thinking .
The Endless War Against Coca and Cocaine
There was little for American policymakers to applaud when it came to the Andean drug war last year .
Nine years and $ 5 billion after Plan Colombia commenced , Andean coca production is essentially unchanged , and the GAO reported that it had not succeeded on its own terms .
Still , Washington remains committed to Colombian President Álvaro Uribe , one of its few friends remaining in the region , despite the ineffectiveness of eradication and interdiction and despite continuing human rights violations as denounced by Amnesty International in a November report .
Meanwhile , Bolivian President Evo Morales joined Washington bête noire Hugo Chávez of Venezuela in throwing out the DEA ( Chavez did it in 2005 , Morales in October ) , as relations between the Bolivarian allies and the US grew extremely chilly , especially after President Bush listed them as the only countries in the hemisphere to be decertified as not cooperating in US drug policy goals .
Only part of the problems were directly related to drug issues , but Morales and Chávez proved adept at parlaying regional angst over America 's drug war into a broader offensive against the colossus of the north .
Now , Bolivia will go it alone on drug policy , leaving US desires behind .
In Peru , meanwhile , President Alan García 's mid-year deployment of the military to coca growing zones in a twin bid to eradicate crops and weaken a resurgent Shining Path produced little more than unhappy results .
Pressure on coca growers in the southern valleys produced coca grower incursions on indigenous lands , while the fight against the Shining Path produced only the highest military and police death toll since the bloody insurgency was defeated in the early 1990s .
Now , largely stripped of its Maoist ideology , but equipped with shiny new weapons bought with the profits of prohibition , the Shining Path is reemerging .
The Prohibitionist Consensus Erodes in Latin America
2008 saw significant movement toward alternatives to prohibition and the drug war in Latin America , some of the most important ones coming from the courts .
In April , an Argentine court threw out drug possession charges against two young men on the grounds they were unconstitutional , and five weeks later , a Brazilian appeals court ruled the same way .
One week after that , another group of Argentine jurists threw out marijuana possession charges against a young man , saying criminalizing drug possession without demonstrating harm to others was unconstitutional .
By July , Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was calling for decriminalization of drug possession .
Meanwhile , in London in May , Colombian Vice - President Francisco Santos called for debating cocaine legalization , and at the end of July , Ecuadorian President Rafeal Correa pardoned hundreds of low - level drug mules , saying it was absurd to imprison them .
In October , Honduran President Manuel Zelaya joined the growing chorus , saying that drug possession should be decriminalized and hinting at larger legalization .
And , as noted above , there are the legalization noises now coming from Mexico , as well as the disdain for US prohibitionist policies from Bolivia and Venezuela .
While Washington has been distracted , it looks like a sea change is getting under way down south .
End - of - term approval ratings for presidents are valuable in forecasting voter preferences in the following election .
The higher a president 's job approval ratings are at the end of his term , the more likely it is a candidate from his party will succeed him in the White House .
That , of course , is not always the case .
Democratic President Bill Clinton left office with a relatively high approval rating in 2000 , but his impeachment during a second term harmed the chances that his vice president , Al Gore , would succeed him .
Republican George W. Bush narrowly won the White House in the 2000 election , though he lost the popular vote .
President Barack Obama 's sound approval rating may not be an indicator of Democrat Hillary Clinton 's chances in 2016 , either .
The last time voters elected a Democrat to the White House after a president from the same party had just served a full term was in 1856 , before the Civil War .
So which presidents were the most popular upon leaving the White House ?
And what were their end - of - term job approval ratings ?
Here 's a look at the popularity of 11 modern U.S. presidents at the times they left office using data from the Gallup organization , a reliable public - opinion firm that has tracking job approval ratings for decades .
01 of 11 Ronald Reagan - 63 Percent ( Photo by Keystone / CNP / Getty Images ) Republican President Ronald Reagan was one of the most popular presidents in modern history .
He left the White House with a job approval rating of 63 percent , support that many politicians can only dream of .
Only 29 percent disapproved of Reagan 's work .
Among Republicans , Reagan enjoyed a 93 percent approval rating .
02 of 11 Bill Clinton - 60 Percent Mathias Kniepeiss / Getty Images News President Bill Clinton , one of only two presidents to ever be impeached , left office on January 21 with 60 percent of Americans saying they approved of his job performance , according to the Gallup organization .
Clinton , a Democrat , was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 19 , 1998 , for allegedly misleading a grand jury about his extramarital affair with Lewinsky in the White House , and then persuading others to lie about it , too .
That he left office on such good terms with a majority of the American public is a testament largely to the strong economy during his eight years in office .
03 of 11 John F. Kennedy - 58 Percent Central Press / Getty Images Democratic President John F. Kennedy , who was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963 , died at a time when he had the support of a solid majority of support from American voters .
Gallup tracked his job - approval rating at 58 percent .
Fewer than a third , 30 percent , of Americans viewed his tenure in the White House unfavorably in a poll conducted in October 1963 .
04 of 11 Dwight Eisenhower - 58 Percent Bert Hardy / Getty Images Republican President Dwight Eisenhower left office in January 1961 with a job approval rating of 58 percent .
Only 31 percent of Americans disapproved .
05 of 11 Gerald Ford - 53 Percent Chris Polk / FilmMagic Republican Gerald Ford , who served only a partial term following the resignation of Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal , left office in January 1977 with the support of a majority of Americans , 53 percent .
That he took office amid such extraordinary circumstances and was able to maintain such support is noteworthy .
06 of 11 George H.W. Bush - 49 Percent Jason Hirschfeld / Getty Images News Republican George H. W. Bush left office in January of 1993 with the support of 49 percent of voters at the time , according to Gallup .
Bush , one of the few presidents to run for and lose re-election , was " unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy , rising violence in inner cities , and continued high deficit spending , " according to his official White House biography .
07 of 11 Lyndon Johnson - 44 Percent Central Press / Getty Images Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson , who took office following the assassination of John F. Kennedy , left office in January 1969 with a job approval rating of just 44 percent , according to Gallup .
Roughly the same portion of Americans disapproved of his tenure in the White House , during which time he ramped up the country 's involvement in the Vietnam War . ​
08 of 11 George W. Bush - 32 Percent Hulton Archive - Getty Images Republican George W. Bush left office in January 2009 as one of the most unpopular presidents in modern history , largely because of his decision to invade Iraq in what became an increasingly unpopular war by the end of his second term .
When Bush left office , he had the support of fewer than a third of Americans , according to the Gallup organization .
Only 32 percent viewed his job performance favorably and 61 percent disapproved .
09 of 11 Harry S. Truman - 32 Percent ( Photo by Underwood Archives / Getty Images ) Democratic President Harry S. Truman , who won the presidency despite his meager upbringing , left office in January 1953 with a job approval rating of just 32 percent .
More than half of Americans , 56 percent , disapproved of his work in office .
10 of 11 Jimmy Carter - 31 Percent Dominio público Democrat Jimmy Carter , another one - term president , suffered politically from the hostage - taking of U. S. embassy staff in Iran , which dominated the news during the last 14 months of Carter 's administration .
His campaign for a second term in 1980 was also bogged down by high inflation and a troubled economy .
By the time he left office in January of 1981 , only 31 percent of Americans approved of his job performance and 56 percent disapproved , according to Gallup .
Obama 's maneuvering to keep his beloved BlackBerry is far from over , but it 's worth noting one possible outcome : that the Prez may be stuck with one of the NSA 's approved WinMo handsets .

CNET has found out which phones have been sealed up tightly enough to satisfy the NSA 's guidelines for devices that may transmit data that 's classified as " Secret . "
They 're both quite similar , and kind of cool in a completely overdone way .
Take the Sectera Edge .
Underneath a modifed version of WinMo 6.1 , you 'll find a comically large set of unusual features , including GSM and CDMA network compatibility , " Classified " USB and serial ports and a secondary " trusted " display .

The L - 3 Guardian is a slightly newer counterpart to the Edge , but with a worldlier bent and sleeker profile .
Both phones were spawned from the Defense Department 's Secure Mobile Environment Portable Electronic Device project , which was apparently intended to create an OS that allowed for private sector individuals to easily transition from their smartphones ( BlackBerrys included ) to an appropriately secured device .
Such a device would be pretty well bolted down , so Obama will probably spend most of his presidency stuck , hilariously , trying to get Mobile IE to properly render his " Top Secret " national security briefs .
The security of the devices in question may not matter though , as the main reason for the push for Obama to relinquish his phone has to do with laws about record - keeping and privacy .
As it stands , it looks unlikely that Obama will be able to keep any kind of smartphone , but the prospect of an unsecured BlackBerry seems almost impossible .

Jun 26 , 2019 : Rainbow Destructor is an interesting blend of action , comedy , high - concept meta , and sci - fi , almost a sort of zany version of a Twilight Zone episode , or like one of those crazier 90 ’s OVA space adventure anime .
The story is short , really only a novella in length , with bite - sized chapters you can blur through in one sitting .
This is both a strength and a drawback , as the story gets right down to the point and does n’t stop for nothin’ .
On the one hand , [ more . . . ]
I will be the first person to admit that I have a sick sense of humor .
I never lose a gross - out contest , I revel in inappropriate jokes and I consider , when telling a joke , a look of horror as nearly as good as getting a laugh .
But I often hear from people — men and women — that rape jokes are never , ever funny .
Well , I would like to disagree — and to point out that even some people who swear that this is true can find one that they like .
But , furthermore , by putting sexual assault on a kind of untouchable comedy pedestal , I think we 're getting further away from allowing victims to be able to make it a normative , discuss - able and , yes , mock - able experience , and that the more different we make it and ourselves from victims of other situations , the more difficult it is the get actual equity in the way the rest of society treats it .
Granted , most people think I get a pass on this because I have been sexually assaulted .
Of course , I spent a good part of the hours after my most recent assault alternating between hysterical crying and compulsive vomiting — and cracking jokes .
I got tired really quickly of the quiet whispers and the looks of pity and the hushed voices and the overall funerary air in the room .
And then , because the cops and the detective and my friend were all too scared to laugh , I told jokes ... jokes that descended deeper into " inappropriate " territory because , if I could mock it , if I could laugh at it — and if I could make them laugh at the absurdity of trying to take a written statement from a drunk , hysterical , projectile - vomiting witness who was singing " Red , Red Wine " under her breath ( when she could breathe ) — then it was n't actually The Worst Thing In The World .
You 're supposed to laugh at that , although no one does — but if I had been mugged , or had my identity stolen or witnessed a crime , it is funny to picture that Exorcist kid spewing vomit everywhere to a reggae beat while the cops look on in horror and try to protect their paperwork .
Why is my vagina some sacred crime scene ?
But , having told this story to Anna and her husband recently — and having upset Anna 's husband , who was too horrified by what happened to me to see that there was humor or absurdity in the situation — I know that it is .
Anyway , the first relatively mainstream rape joke comes , of course , from Sarah Silverman 's performance in The Aristocrats .
It 's an arc of a performance , that starts with her telling a sweet but sick story of performing in an incestuous sex show and culminates in the heart - stopping , clear - eyed revelation that " Joe Franklin raped me . "
Except , of course , she 's proudly trodding on the landmine of comedy — and , honestly , it 's so disturbing , it 's funny .
Jessica Valenti's recent piece in The Guardian about female comedians praised Wanda Sykes ' now - infamous rape joke from her 2006 comedy special about detachable vaginas .
Valenti says :
Sykes brings a biting comedy to the most controversial topics , throwing new light on issues that are all too easily written off as age - old and intractable : rape , for example .
Advertisement
And she does , but let 's break down what she 's joking about : she 's joking about stranger rape , and she 's making light of Kobe Bryant 's victim , who was raped after she went up to his hotel room at the ungodly hour of 2 in the morning .
In fact , you could argue — and I am — that Wanda Sykes is poking fun of that victim for being , you know , stupid enough to get raped .
Is it only funny when Wanda Sykes does it ?
Many of you would say yes ( and , in fact have said that it 's never funny to say something like that ) .
Do you still think so ?
In fact , Jessica Valenti herself recently wrote , in response to a rape joke shown on The Office " there 's never really a funny rape joke , is there ? "
Well , here 's the rape joke she — and many of you , judging by our e-mails — did n't like :
To recap , Kelly claims to have been raped when she is confronted with some office malfeasance — as in , she 's only saying it to get out of trouble — and it's not the first time she 's apparently done such a thing .
Is it laugh - out - loud funny ?
Nah .
But is it poking fun of her character and using that kind of hyperbole to mock people who try to use personal crises ( " My grandmother died " ) to get out of responsibility ?
Sure .
Is it , say , less offensive than implying a rape victim was less than smart to head up to Kobe Bryant 's room late at night ?
Technically , I think both are funny , but I have a sick sense of humor .
Which , of course , brings me to the most horrifying of horrifying rape jokes : The South Park episode about Indiana Jones .
Although this only has the last two of the three rape scenes depicted in the show , it gives you enough of a sense of what it was about : Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are no longer metaphorically raping the Indy franchise , they 're really doing it .
Offensive ?
Yes .
Boundary - crossing ?
Certainly .
Horrifying in its detail ?
Yes .
Funny ?
Arguably so .
Which then , of course , brings it back to the question : when is it funny ?
And I think the answer is , for a lot of people , when you like or respect the person telling the joke .
Which is fine , and it's how most jokes work , but you can't then argue that they 're never funny , or they can't ever be funny .
Lots of humor comes from the juxtaposition of our civilized collective state of being and the ways in which we betray the lie of that constantly — fart jokes , for instance , are funniest when you really , really should be proper .
If we take sexual assault off the table of things we can laugh about or joke about , it 's just another way of saying : this is a different crime than any other crime , and so we can and must treat its victims differently than any other crime .
And , you know , fuck that .
I got treated differently than any other crime victim once because of the kind of crime that I was the victim of .
If I had been mugged , would the cops have been calling my friends and asking them how much I 'd been drinking that night ?
If I had been only robbed , would it have mattered to the cops whether I 'd told the guys I was out with that night that I was dating someone ?
If I had been shot walking out of the bar , would it have been anyone 's business if my friend thought that I was flirting or not ?
And if any of those crimes had been committed instead , would everyone be so horribly offended by me making jokes about it ?
It 's all part of the way in which society wants to treat me differently because of how I was victimized .
Let 's treat sexual assaults like any other crime and tell some rape jokes .
Cool ?
Here 's mine :
When my victim 's advocate called me up the week after I was assaulted , she went over the rape kit results and what I could expect from the process , and asked me if I had any questions .
I asked her if they could tell me the name of the man who had been arrested for assaulting me , and I heard her shuffle through papers .
His name , she said , was " Hey - zeus " after which I started laughing .
An agnostic , I was raped by Jesus .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Fragments have broken off a Soviet - era nuclear - powered satellite but do not pose a threat to the Earth ’s surface or the International Space Station , a senior Russian military official said .
The Cosmos -1818 military satellite , which was decommissioned shortly after its launch in 1987 , shed “ insignificant ” fragments into space on July 4 , 2008 , the deputy head of Russia ’s Space Forces Alexander Yakushin said in a statement Wednesday .
“ There is no risk of radioactive contamination of the Earth ’s surface , ” he said .
The International Space Station is not at risk as the satellite has a much higher orbit , he said .
U.S. publication the Orbital Debris Quarterly News reported in its January issue that the satellite released dozens of particles , possibly droplets of sodium - potassium coolant from its reactor .
The high orbit of the satellite , which was taken out of service months after its launch , means there is no threat of premature re-entry into the Earth ’s atmosphere , the report said .
Bees , not unlike some starlets we can think of , can become addicted to cocaine , according to a new study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
The Times ' Thomas H. Maugh II reports :
Researchers led by entomologist Andrew Barron of Macquarie University in Sydney trained a hive of bees to forage at a nearby supply of sugar water .
Then they applied minute quantities of cocaine to the backs of foragers .
He and neuroscientist Gene Robinson of the University of Illinois found that the bees ' dance remained tightly controlled , providing accurate directions to the food source .
But the insects now demonstrated an unusually strong response to food , acting as though a weak solution of sugar water was a much better food source and communicating their findings much more enthusiastically to hive - mates .
The Australian bees developed a tolerance to the drug and even experienced withdrawal symptoms when deprived of it -- their abilities to learn new tasks ( like distinguishing between scents ) was severely impaired , said the research team .
So will honeybee rehab become a hot new trend -- the flea circus of the 21st century ?
Only time will tell .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
On a Wednesday afternoon in late December , the average wait to sell clothing at Buffalo Exchange , a Manhattan consignment shop , was about 25 minutes .
Beyond the front counter , where the consignors sought pocket cash and tax deductions , nearly a dozen shoppers squeezed themselves between overstuffed racks in the 450 - square - foot space , seeking bargains amid used designer jeans and last season 's cashmere sweaters .
" You should see this place on weekends , " said the store 's assistant manager .
" The lines get to be at least 10 people deep . "
The month - old shop , which already possesses the slight musty smell typical to thrift stores , is the first Manhattan location for Buffalo , a Tucson - based secondhand - clothes retail chain with 34 stores across the nation .
The new store 's crowds are indicative of both Buffalo Exchange 's continuing success - the privately held company says it has $ 50 million in annual revenue and is concluding its third consecutive year of sales growth - and also of the resale market 's overall performance .
Secondhand shops are a bright spot in today 's downtrodden retail industry .
" We do real well in economic downturns , " said Kerstin Block , 66 , who founded Buffalo 34 years ago with her husband .
" I think that people are more willing to sell their clothes when the economy 's bad , and they 're more likely to shop in used - goods stores .
It 's less expensive . "
In what 's supposed to be the busiest time of year for department stores and retailers , the National Retail Federation reports that clothing stores ' sales are down more than 7 % over the previous year .
ShopperTrak , a research firm that charts foot traffic at the nation 's malls , says that holiday crowds are down by about 10 % since last year and that overall sales this season will only increase by about 0.1 % .
" People ca n't afford to buy as much these days at the regular retail channels , " said Jeff Van Sinderen , a senior retail analyst at B. Riley , a Los Angeles research and investment firm .
" Consumers are looking for extreme values . "
As a result , sales are flourishing at secondhand shops as a new echelon of shoppers finds its way into resale stores .
Of the store owners who responded to a recent survey from the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops ( NARTs ) , 74 % said that September and October sales increased over the prior year , by an average of 35 % .
Goodwill Industries , a nonprofit that operates 2,200 thrift stories , says that same - store revenue have increased by an average of 7 % compared to last year .
The Salvation Army , with 1,370 nonprofit secondhand shops nationwide , also reports significant gains .
" We 're up about 20 to 25 % over last year , " says Major George Hood , the national community relations secretary for the Salvation Army .
" Yet despite the strong sales trend , folks are n't donating as much stuff - rather than donate to charity , they 're selling elsewhere , turning their things into cash in their pockets . "
Designer fashions for less
Customers selling to Buffalo Exchange , which caters to twentysomethings in hip , urban neighborhoods , get the most cash for American Apparel ( APP ) t- shirts , cashmere cardigans , and neo - preppy button downs .
Escada tops and St. Johns jackets are selling well this season at secondhand shop Act II in Newport News , Va. Closer to Hollywood , Twice the Style , based in Orange County , Calif. , recently sold a Bottega Veneta purse for $ 1,600 - about $ 900 less than what it went for when it was new in the fall .
" Folks are looking at their closets as a source of revenue , " said Liz Pierce , a senior analyst with Roth Capital Partners , an investment bank in Newport Beach , Calif .
" So you 're probably seeing better product at these places . "
While an increase in used designer goods has helped resale stores draw more middle - class shoppers , so have rising concerns about the environment - the stigma once placed on used clothing is fading .
" I 'd say our biggest driver of business these days has been the urge for folks to be green , " says Buffalo 's Block .
The items that Buffalo wo n't buy from sellers - tattered clothing or pieces that have gone out of style - get donated to local charities .
Buffalo recently started donating used fur items to animal shelters , where they 're used as bedding .
Shunning the high end
Also helping the secondhand stores : Consumers are developing an aversion to luxury goods .
" Shoppers today are n't so much into conspicuous consumption , " says Adele Meyer , executive director of NARTs .
" They have a need to fill , and they 're looking at our industry to do it . "
Roth Capital 's Pierce , whose hairdresser recently advised her to check out a secondhand shop for holiday dresses ( " that would have never happened a year ago , " she says ) , notes that people " are buying high - low all the time .
At malls you always see folks with Neiman Marcus bags and Forever 21 bags . "
In the meantime , consignment shop owners may be the only retailers who wo n't mind a long recession .
Kerstin Block , who founded her company during a weak economy in 1974 , will celebrate her 35th year in business next year by opening three new Buffalo stores , one in Baltimore , Boston , and Seattle .
Other shop owners are a bit more cautious .
" We 're just hoping that when the economy gets better , people will stick with us , " says Shannon Barisoff , owner of Twice the Style .
" It 's sort of a circle of life . "

My Alabama fanhood was poured into my ear from an early age .
My grandfather was a friend of Coach Bryant’s .
I was born in 1971 , right before he beat USC bloody with the wishbone and proceeded to dominate the decade .
Most of the time I ’d hear about the Bear ’s emphasis on character and hard work , along with the rah - rah stuff that goes along with any sports fanhood .
Once in a while , though , someone would talk to me about Auburn ’s “ rightful position ” in the state .
Auburn was the cow college downstate , and they sucked hind tit , and this would never change .
I ’d get this at a family reunion , or at a restaurant , or even from some guy in a bad coat sitting next to me at the ’ 80 Iron Bowl .
I toed this line as a tyke , but I ’ve not been for “ Alabama and whoever ’s playing Auburn ” since I was a teenager .
Though I bleed crimson and white , I pull enthusiastically for Auburn when it ’s not contrary to Alabama ’s interests to do so , and hell , I ’m downright loud about it when they ’re out of conference in a bowl game or something .
After all , they ’re also ambassadors for my wonderful state , and it ’s a lovely town , and well , there are plenty of fine Auburn people , you know ?
Yet here , today , in the wake of Auburn hiring Gene Chizik , I ’m wondering for the first time in my adult life whether those tongue - clucking old - timers actually knew what they were talking about .
Without abandoning plausibility completely ( Simon Cowell ? Carrot Top? RuPaul ? ) , it ’s difficult to imagine a worse hire .
Auburn has shot itself in the foot — oh yes — but it has also dug out the bullet with a rusty butter knife and irrigated the wound in a cesspool .
The Southeastern Conference currently contains four head coaches who have already won national titles .
One of these is Auburn ’s bitter cross -state rival .
The Southeastern Conference currently contains at least three ace recruiters .
One of these is Auburn ’s bitter cross -state rival .
To these conditions , Auburn has responded thusly :
Pay proven winner Tommy Tuberville ( 85 - 40 at Auburn ; 42 - 9 from 2004 - 2007 ; 7 - 3 vs. Alabama ) more than $ 5 million to go away , even though he reportedly “ resigned ” and was therefore owed no buyout .
Hire former Auburn defensive coordinator Gene Chizik , head coach of Iowa State , where he amassed a 5 - 19 ( .208 ) record despite playing in the Big 12 North .
This is Auburn ’s money - is - no - object , let ’s - go - get - our - guy hire .
This is Auburn ’s future .
Drink that in .
Do n’t tell me there were no star hires available .
This was the time for a massive culture change — the time to hand over the keys and shut down the old way of doing things forever .
I touched on this very thing concerning Alabama ’s hire of Nick Saban .
You pile up the money , and you give a guy true control of the football program , and you ’ve got your superstar .
Alabama paid dearly and repeatedly while it learned to stop overvaluing connections to Bryant , and stop granting massive influence to questionable characters , and so forth .
Mal Moore shot the moon to get Saban , and succeeded .
He ’s thrilled , I ’m thrilled , you ’re thrilled — but there was a radical power shift in the administration of Alabama football when Saban arrived .
It ’s not for nothing that a college football coach makes the cover of Forbes .
I can only guess that Auburn was n’t willing to change its thinking .
It was redneck , podunk , think small , render unto Lowder Caesar , and come on in here , Coach Chizik , and welcome home , and War Eagle to you , my friend .
The mind games shall commence at the first sign of weakness — I have a private jet , and I ’m not afraid to use it — and by the way , here are the board ’s criteria for your staff .
If you always do what you ’ve always done … and you know the rest .
Alabama football will never have a more sustained down period than the past eight or so years .
Despite a six - year Iron Bowl run , it seems Auburn has n’t closed the gap much , and it ’s definitely too late now .
The restoration of the natural order is complete .
Apparently Auburn is not only resigned to its second fiddle status ; in its refusal to grow , it has implicitly embraced it .
Success is such a bitch , you know ?
She ’ll tell Auburn anything and gosh , Auburn ’s such a great friend — pat pat pat — but it ’s Alabama for whom she ’s dropping her panties and swinging from the chandelier .
It really only ever felt like a fling ( even in 2004 or 2006 ) , did n’t it , Tigers ?
Phillip Marshall , who covered Auburn sports for The Huntsville Times until this summer , once wrote something about Alabama fans and Auburn fans that has always stuck with me .
He said ( paraphrasing ; ca n’t find a link ) that no matter how badly things are going , Alabama fans are always absolutely convinced that greatness is just around the corner .
About Auburn fans , he said that no matter how well things are going , they ’re always convinced that disaster is imminent .
I think he was onto something .
War Eagle , you defeatist , self - loathing dolts .
Perhaps you ’ll get it right in 2012 or 2013 .

Google is to launch a service that would enable users to access their personal computer from any internet connection , according to industry reports .
But campaigners warn that it would give the online behemoth unprecedented control over individuals ' personal data .
The Google Drive , or " GDrive " , could kill off the desktop computer , which relies on a powerful hard drive .
Instead a user 's personal files and operating system could be stored on Google 's own servers and accessed via the internet .
The long - rumoured GDrive is expected to be launched this year , according to the technology news website TG Daily , which described it as " the most anticipated Google product so far " .
It is seen as a paradigm shift away from Microsoft 's Windows operating system , which runs inside most of the world 's computers , in favour of " cloud computing " , where the processing and storage is done thousands of miles away in remote data centres .
Home and business users are increasingly turning to web - based services , usually free , ranging from email ( such as Hotmail and Gmail ) and digital photo storage ( such as Flickr and Picasa ) to more applications for documents and spreadsheets ( such as Google Apps ) .
The loss of a laptop or crash of a hard drive does not jeopardise the data because it is regularly saved in " the cloud " and can be accessed via the web from any machine .
The GDrive would follow this logic to its conclusion by shifting the contents of a user 's hard drive to the Google servers .
The PC would be a simpler , cheaper device acting as a portal to the web , perhaps via an adaptation of Google 's operating system for mobile phones , Android .
Users would think of their computer as software rather than hardware .
It is this prospect that alarms critics of Google 's ambitions .
Peter Brown , executive director of the Free Software Foundation , a charity defending computer users ' liberties , did not dispute the convenience offered , but said : " It 's a little bit like saying , 'we 're in a dictatorship , the trains are running on time . '
But does it matter to you that someone can see everything on your computer ?
Does it matter that Google can be subpoenaed at any time to hand over all your data to the American government ? "
Google refused to confirm the GDrive , but acknowledged the growing demand for cloud computing .
Dave Armstrong , head of product and marketing for Google Enterprise , said : " There 's a clear direction ... away from people thinking , ' This is my PC , this is my hard drive , ' to ' This is how I interact with information , this is how I interact with the web . ' "
The main factors influencing the amount of physical exercise people carry out are their self - perceived ability and the extent of their desire to exercise .
A study of 5167 Canadians , reported in the open access journal BMC Public Health , has shown that psychological concerns are the most important barriers to an active lifestyle .
Sai Yi Pan , from the Public Health Agency of Canada , led a team of researchers who carried out a study which examined data from a nationwide series of telephone interviews .
She said " Our findings highlight the need for health promotion programs to enhance people 's confidence and motivation , as well as providing education on the health benefits of physical activity " .
One interview question asked participants how confident they were that they could regularly do a total of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity ( PA ) three or four times a week and a total of 60 minutes of light PA each day .
This ' self - efficacy ' score was consistently found to be related to higher PA across gender , age group , education level and family income level .
According to the authors , " Confidence in one 's personal ability to carry out exercise plays a central role in the direction , intensity and persistence of health - behavior change .
People who have higher PA self - efficacy will perceive fewer barriers to PA , or be less influenced by them , and will be more likely to enjoy PA " .
Likewise , participants were asked to what extent they intended to be physically active over the next six months .
This ' intention score ' was another important independent correlate of physical activity .
The strong effects of self - efficacy and intention on PA suggest that interventions designed to increase PA should target these factors .
The authors conclude that , " Future research is needed to identify how those influences can be optimally incorporated into interventions that will increase people 's belief in their ability and motivation / intention to be physically active " .

The Kinds of Bad Python
I spent a day re-doing about 30 % of the functionallity of 8,600 lines of elses Java - style Python into 200 lines of cleaner Python that is also more flexible .
I 've observed a few major kinds of code I would call " Bad Python " :
" Bad Python " is often " Old Python " : using only the conveniences available in Python before 2.4/2.5 .
In a fast - moving language , the old ways are often going to look bad .
" Bad Python " is often " Java Python " : Python written in Java idioms .
It 's poor form to write in one language using the idioms of another , and forgoing the benefits of dynamic typing , first - class functions , native iterators , properties , and so forth " Bad Python " is often " Bad Programming " : many of the practices would be poor form in any programming language .
Specific Examples
Accessor methods such as getDistance ( ) and setDistance ( ) , instead of using an attribute .
In Python , attributes can be turned into properties later , preserving the class interface .
Asserting the type of every argument and returned value , taking up maybe 30 % of the code itself and 80 % of the unit test code .
Checking is usually pointless because the interpreter itself will let you know if someduck did n't .quack ( ) like a duck , and makes the code less flexible .
did n't like a duck , and makes the code less flexible .
Using super - private attributes for everything , so far as to use double - underscores on each side , which are supposed to be reserved for language features .
Dozens of customising parameters in constructors , such as reversed and strip and maxlen - when passing in a general transform function would be so much more elegant and could do so much more than just reverse the strings that the class works with .
and and - when passing in a general function would be so much more elegant and could do so much more than just reverse the strings that the class works with .
Using delegates where first - class function will do .
Wrapping things classes that offer no more behavior than a dict or a tuple , while adding a whole lot of intermediate code .
namedtuple could help there .
Java Patterns in Python
Bad Programming
Vague and misleading identifiers ( topic of future post )
Massive ' god ' classes
Source files having no discernable structure
Awkward decompositions of function
Forces similar logic to be repeated in dozens of places
Prevents parts from being reused e.g. in unit tests
Prevents dependencies from being stubbed out e.g. in unit tests
Mixing logic with orthogonal aspects like error - handling and logging for a harder - to - maintain mess .

A controversial post about bad code that I observed on an unnamed Python project , in which I describe outdated idioms , Java - style code , and bad programming practices .
[ 3 minutes ]
Fun fact : an earlier version of this post ( which also disparaged the programmers - not cool ) made the Reddit front page after someone posted it to r/programming , granting me 15 minutes of internet fame .
I take it that controversial opinions get more attention that bland facts .
Some specific examples of Bad Python eyesores : Some Bad Python comes from using certain Design Patterns that can in Python be expressed in one - line idioms , not worth writing a chapter about .
Singleton Pattern ?
Write a module .
Iterator ?
It 's fundamental to the language .
Factory Pattern ?
Write a functionand substitute it within tests .
Flyweight Objects and Command Dispatch ?
Use a dictionary .
A good resources is Python Patterns for patterns specific to the language .
I think it 's too common to assume that the Gang - of - Four Design Patterns apply to every language , not just Java / C++/C#.
One can of course write bad code in any language , Python included , by doing :
Prominent neoconservative : 4,000 Americans ' had to die ' David Edwards and Diane Sweet
Published : Wednesday December 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Four thousand American troops " had to die " in Iraq , even if the United States knew Iraq did n't have weapons of mass destruction , a prominent neoconservative said in a shocking interview on MSNBC Tuesday evening .
Vice President Dick Cheney told ABC
News earlier this week that the U.S. would have invaded Iraq regardless of whether or not they had weapons of mass destruction .
Adding fire to Cheney 's surprising comments Tuesday was prominent neoconservative and former Assistant Secretary of Defense Frank Gaffney , who told MSNBC's Chris Matthews during Tuesday 's ' Hardball ' that the United States had to invade Iraq whether or not its intelligence was sound .
Asked about why the United States should have invaded Iraq even if they knew there were no WMDs , Gaffney said , " The real reason was we thought he constituted a mortal threat . "
" You believe a mortal threat to the United States , " Matthews responded , incredulous .
" Where do you get this from ?
What kind of -- where do you get these words from ? "
" My position is that it 's regrettable that any Americans died .
And it is regrettable that they had to die , but I believe they did have to die , " said Gaffney .
" The threat we did know about is the chemical capability Saddam Hussein used against his own people ....
The danger was that inaction could have resulted in the death of many more Americans than 4,000 . "
Matthews revisited the decision to invade Iraq on " Hardball , " with guests neocon Frank Gaffney , and Mother Jones ' David Corn during a discussion of weapons of mass destruction and Cheney 's admission that the United States would have invaded Iraq regardless of the presence of WMD .
Gaffney is the founder and president of the think tank Center for Security Policy , as well as a contributor , contributing editor , and columnist for a number of publications , including the Washington Times , National Review Online and WorldNetDaily .
" Was there anything Saddam Hussein could have done to stop that war ? "
Matthews asked Gaffney , and when Gaffney attempted to justify the case for war based on the first Gulf War , and not the presence of weapons of mass destruction .
" Why the long inspections debate if they did n't matter ? "
Matthews asked .
" If they did n't matter , why did we have inspections ? "
Cheney 's " admitting that they did n't have to have stockpiles for him to believe the war was justified , " he added .
" That 's what 's astounding . "

One of the key features of Solaris 10 is its Zettabyte File System ( ZFS ) that provides more storage flexibility and scalability to Unix .
For the past four years , however , ZFS was not integrated into the deepest parts of the Solaris operating system -- a shortcoming that denied administrators access to its advanced administration and recovery features .
That changed today , with the release of Solaris 10 update 10/08 , which extends ZFS into the Solaris root .
The update also provides better integration support for Sun 's legacy Solaris 8 customers .
The Solaris 10 update 10/08 is Sun 's latest attempt in the competitive market against Unix offerings from HP and IBM and the continuing pressure from Linux vendors as well .
" What we 've done with this release is taken it down even deeper into Solaris and made this a root file system in addition to being a data file system , " Dan Roberts , Director of Data Center Software Product Management told InternetNews.com .
" So , with this release , you can now run a single file across the board in a Solaris environment . "
ZFS is a 128 - bit file system that provides advanced data scalability and recovery options , including " snapshotting " -- creating space - efficient record of a previous system .
When Sun first rolled out ZFS , it was limited to use as a data file system for wherever users were placing data .
Now with ZFS for Solaris root , the core of the operating system can now enjoy the major benefits of the file system , Roberts said .
Administrators doing package updates , patches , fixes or system configuration changes will now have the same snapshotting , recovery and data - integrity capabilities as the data - centric parts of Solaris , for instance .
" You 're not going to be running petabytes of data in your root , and if you are , you 've got a really bad architecture , " Roberts said .
" So the ZFS features of scaling and size not as applicable at root level .
What is applicable is the consolidation of administration and the data integrity . "
Previously , Solaris root ran the UFS filesystem , which has been the mainline Solaris file system for more than a decade .
Roberts noted that migrating from UFS to ZFS is fairly straightforward in many situations .
But it still is n't a something that all users will need to do right away .
For one thing , Roberts noted that UFS is a proven , decade - plus - old underlying file system , so migrating immediately is n't critical .
As for why Sun is now making ZFS available for the Solaris root , Roberts explained that it has always been part of the ZFS plan for to run across the whole operating system .
" It has been our intent that once we felt it was rock solid and ready for the root file system we'd do that , " Roberts said .
" Clearly everyone want to deliver things sooner but we 're happy that we 're reaching this major milestone for our customers . "
The development also comes as Linux vendors are currently working on a filesystem called BTRFS that will include snapshot features as well .
Roberts said he is n't concerned yet about competition coming from other file systems .
" At this point , we 're happy with our position in the file system space , but at the end of the day , competition is good it spurs more innovation , " he said .
" And it 's open source competition , which is even better .
We like to see additional open source value to come out for customers . "
With the Solaris 10/08 update , Sun is also making it even easier for its legacy Solaris 8 and 9 customers to migrate to a Solaris 10 system .
In the update , Sun has embedded Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 container technology directly into the Solaris 10 operating system .
" It 's now part of the operating system , so you do n't need a separate set of configurations , " Roberts said .
" And it 's easier to take a snapshot of a running Solaris 8 or 9 application and bring it over and have it run on Solaris 10 . "
That news marks the latest move in Sun 's long history of throwing resources behind Solaris 8 , which the company has supported for nearly 12 years at this point .
Most recently , in the last Solaris 10 update that came out in April , Sun added Solaris 8 support in its container virtualization technology .
Cruel dog owner who starved German Shepherd Hobo to the point on death banned from owning pets for 25 years
Joy Battison has been banned from owning animals for 25 years after neglecting her German Shepherd Hobo
A cruel dog owner whose German Shepherd lost more than half his body weight and was days away from death has been banned from owning an animal for 25 years .
Joy Battison starved Hobo to the point where his weight plummeted to 40 lbs .
Covered in mange , suffering from severe malnutrition and with claws so long he could n't walk Hobo was given just three days to live .
But Hobo has fought back and the 12 - year - old now faces the new year with a spring in his paws happy in his new home with animal - lover owners Peter and Val Butcher .
Yesterday 56 - year - old Battison was banned from owning another animal for 25 years and was also given a 12 - month supervision order .
She admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal when she faced Northhampton Magistrates Court after initially denying to vets that she was Hobo 's owner .
How Hobo came to be dropped off at the PDSA Pet Aid Hospital in Northampton in such a terrible condition last summer remains unclear .
Weighing just 40lb , Hobo 's condition was so bad vets could not tell what breed he was
Vets there wanted to put him down straight away , but gave him three days to see if he improved .
Student vet nurse Ruth Bates , one of the first nurses to look after him , said : ' None of us thought he was going to make it but we thought we 'd give him a few days .
' It was really bad , I had never seen anything like that before and I have been in the veterinary practice for about six years . '
This is Hobo now .
His claws clipped , his coat groomed
She said the neglect must have been going on for months and months and months .
Ms Bates said : ' We started by feeding him up , he was always happy to eat and that 's what gave us hope .
' We could n't treat him for the mange straight away because he was just too weak for the chemicals but he soon got stronger . '
Hobo was treated at the hospital for several weeks , until he came to the attention of the Butchers in July through local media .
Mrs Butcher , a fan of the German Shepherd breed , said : ' I cried , his condition was so awful .
For days I could only think of him .
' We both wanted him and knew we would have the time , patience and love to help him recover . '
Mr Butcher said : ' We do a lot of work with the RSPCA and we home dogs as well , so I phoned them up and arranged for us to take Hobo .
' We got him on August 29 and that 's what we class as his birthday now . '
Hobo's new home on the couple 's farm in Shillington , Bedfordshire , has seen him move in with an array of other animals including ten dogs , ten alpacas , seven goats , 17 ponies , and 240 parrots .
He has been on courses of antibiotics , skin treatments and painkillers and is now up to his maximum weight of 66lb .
This is Val Butcher who nursed Hobo back to health .
At this point the German Shepherd was still in the process of recovering and had not yet reached the level of health he enjoys today
The average weight of a German Shepherd Hobo's age is between 57 and 66lb .
Mr Butcher said : ' At the moment he 's in perfect health and perfect condition .
' To be honest now we class him as a perfect dog .
It 's very rare that he's in the house , he just wanders about on the farm .
' He is happy , perfect to train , all he wants to do is to please you .
' He had never been trained before he came to us and now he does a perfect sit , a stay , he walks on the lead properly .
I only ever have to tell him off once .
' You would never know he 's gone through everything that he has . '
Mrs Butcher said Hobo still took medication for pain caused by arthritis and antibiotics for his skin but has made ' wonderful ' progress .
She said : ' Hobo enjoys life .
He is so bright , he loves to help us and he loves to play .
' Hobo is a special dog who has gone through hell but still loves and trusts people .
' We love him to bits and know without a doubt that we are so lucky to have him . '

Wine
Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X , OpenGL , and Unix .
Think of Wine as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs .
Wine does not require Microsoft Windows , as it is a completely free alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100 % non-Microsoft code , however Wine can optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available .
Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code to Unix as well as a program loader , allowing many unmodified Windows programs to run on x86 - based Unixes , including Linux , FreeBSD , Mac OS X , and Solaris .
VirtualBox
VirtualBox is an x86 virtualization software package , originally created by German software company innotek , now developed by Sun Microsystems as part of its Sun xVM virtualization platform .
It is installed on an existing host operating system ; within this application , additional operating systems , each known as a Guest OS , can be loaded and run , each with its own virtual environment .
Supported host operating systems include Linux , Mac OS X , OS / 2 Warp , Windows XP or Vista , and Solaris , while supported guest operating systems include FreeBSD , Linux , OpenBSD , OS / 2 Warp , Windows and Solaris .
Qemu
QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer .
When used as a machine emulator , QEMU can run OSes and programs made for one machine ( e.g. an ARM board ) on a different machine ( e.g. your own PC ) .
By using dynamic translation , it achieves very good performances .
When used as a virtualizer , QEMU achieves near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU .
A host driver called the QEMU accelerator ( also known as KQEMU ) is needed in this case .
The virtualizer mode requires that both the host and guest machine use x86 compatible processors .
Bochs
Bochs is a highly portable open source IA - 32 ( x86 ) PC emulator written in C++ , that runs on most popular platforms .
It includes emulation of the Intel x86 CPU , common I/O devices , and a custom BIOS .
Currently , Bochs can be compiled to emulate a 386 , 486 , Pentium / PentiumII / PentiumIII / Pentium4 or x86-64 CPU including optional MMX , SSEx and 3DNow ! instructions .
Bochs is capable of running most Operating Systems inside the emulation including Linux , DOS , WindowsÂ ® 95/98 and WindowsÂ ® NT /2000 / XP or Windows Vista .
Bochs was written by Kevin Lawton and is currently maintained by this project .
rdesktop
rdesktop is an open source client for Windows Terminal Services , capable of natively speaking Remote Desktop Protocol ( RDP ) in order to present the user ’s Windows desktop .
Supported servers include Windows 2000 Server , Windows Server 2003 , Windows Server 2008 , Windows XP , Windows Vista and Windows NT Server 4.0 .
Rdesktop currently runs on most UNIX based platforms with the X Window System , and other ports should be fairly straightforward .
Xen
The XenÂ® hypervisor , the powerful open source industry standard for virtualization , offers a powerful , efficient , and secure feature set for virtualization of x86 , x86_64 , IA64 , PowerPC , and other CPU architectures .
It supports a wide range of guest operating systems including WindowsÂ® , LinuxÂ® , SolarisÂ® , and various versions of the BSD operating systems .
The Xen hypervisor is a unique open source technology , developed collaboratively by the Xen community and engineers at over 20 of the most innovative data center solution vendors , including AMD , Cisco , Dell , HP , IBM , Intel , Mellanox , Network Appliance , Novell , Red Hat , SGI , Sun , Unisys , Veritas , Voltaire , and Citrix .

A female graduate student at Virginia Tech was killed Wednesday night when a man she knew attacked her with a knife and decapitated her , a school spokesman said .
Virginia Tech police Chief Wendell Flinchum talks about the first slaying on campus since the 2007 shootings .
Virginia
Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said Thursday that Xin Yang 's killing was the first on the campus since April 16 , 2007 , when a shooter killed 32 people before turning a gun on himself .
Yang , 22 , from Beijing , China , was killed at the Au Bon Pain restaurant in the Graduate Life Center at around 7 p.m. , school spokesman Larry Hincker said in a written statement .
Campus police took Haiyang Zhu , 25 , into custody at the scene .
The Ningbo , China , native has been charged with first - degree murder and is being held without bail at a local jail , Hincker said .
Zhu did not say anything to the arresting officers , said campus police Chief Wendell Flinchum .
" There was blood on him , " Flinchum said .
The young woman and the suspect " were not seen arguing , or anything of that nature , " he added , citing witness statements .
Authorities said the two students knew each other .
" Based on emergency contact records maintained by the university , it is known that Zhu and Yang knew each other , " Hincker said .
No other details were provided .
The young woman arrived at the university two weeks ago to begin studies in accounting , he said in the statement .
Zhu is a graduate student pursuing a doctorate in agricultural and applied economics .
He began studies at Virginia Tech in fall 2008 , Hincker said .
" Our hearts go out to the victim and her family , " President Charles W. Steger said in a letter to the campus community .
" An act of violence like this one brings back memories of the April 16 tragedy and I have no doubt that many of us feel especially distraught . "
Authorities say on April 16 , 2007 , Seung - Hui Cho killed 32 students and professors before killing himself .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
More than half of teenagers mention risky behaviors such as sex and drugs on their MySpace accounts , U.S. researchers said on Monday .
They said many young people who use social networking sites such as News Corp ’s MySpace do not realize how public they are and may be opening themselves to risks , but the sites may also offer a new way to identify and help troubled teens .
“ We found the majority of teenagers who have a MySpace account are displaying risky behaviors in a public way that is accessible to a general audience , ” said Dr. Dimitri Christakis of Seattle Children ’s Research Institute , whose studies appear in the journal Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine .
In one of two studies , Christakis and Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 500 randomly chosen MySpace profiles of 18 - year - olds in 2007 .
Overall , 54 percent of the publicly available accounts they checked contained information about high - risk behaviors : 41 percent mentioned substance abuse , 24 percent sexual behavior and 14 percent violence .
Christakis said many teens are unaware of how public and permanent Internet information can be , while parents often do not know what their kids are up to .
“ No one says , “ Whoa !
Why are you putting that up there ? ’ ” Christakis said .
In a second study , the researchers identified 190 individuals aged 18 to 20 whose MySpace accounts displayed multiple risky behaviors .
Half were sent a message from “ Dr. Meg ” from Dr. Moreno ’s MySpace profile .
The message warned about the risks of disclosing personal details online and offered a link to a site with information about testing for sexually transmitted diseases .
Three months after this single message , many of the young people had withdrawn references to sex and substance abuse and tightened security controls .
“ It really provides the opportunity to reach millions of potential at - risk teens and try to modify their behaviors or at least prevent them from disclosing them to the entire world , ” Christakis said in a telephone interview .
The e-mail was most effective at curtailing references to sex , with 13.7 percent of profiles in the group that received the warning deleting all references , compared with 5.3 percent of those who were not sent the message .
Christakis said displaying sexual information online can expose a teen to advances from sexual predators .
Employers and universities may also check those sites .
The Girl Skate Company , which was co-founded by Where the Wild Things Are director Spike Jonze , has posted an interview with Jonze , a promo photo from the film and this first look at skateboard series that include photos of the monsters in the movie .
Based on Maurice Sendak ’s classic book , the Warner Bros. release hits theaters on October 16 , 2009 .
The front page of the Beirut daily As - Safir said it all yesterday .
Across the top was a terrible photograph of the bloated body of a Palestinian man newly discovered in the ruins of his home while two male members of his family shrieked and roared their grief .
Below , at half the size , was a photograph from Israel of Western leaders joking with Ehud Olmert , the Israeli Prime Minister .
Olmert was roaring with laughter .
Silvio Berlusconi , arms on the back of Olmert 's shoulders , was also joshing and roaring – with laughter , not grief – and on Olmert 's right was Nicolas Sarkozy of France wearing his stupidest of smiles .
Only Chancellor Merkel appeared to understand the moral collapse .
No smiles from Germany .
Europe laughs while Palestinians mourn their dead .
No wonder that in the streets of Beirut , shops were doing a flourishing trade in Palestinian scarves and flags .
Even some of Palestine 's most serious enemies in Lebanon wore the Palestinian keffiyeh in solidarity with the people of Gaza .
Over and over again , Al - Jazeera television strapped headlines on to their news reports of Palestinians carrying the decomposing corpses of their dead : " More than 1,300 dead in Gaza , 400 of them women and children – Israeli dead in the war 13 , three of them civilians . "
That , too , said it all .
All day , the Arabs also had to endure watching their own leaders primping and posing in front of the cameras at the Arab summit in Kuwait , where the kings and presidents who claim to rule them also smiled and shook hands and tried to pretend that they were unified behind a Palestinian people who have been sorely betrayed .
Even Mahmoud Abbas was there , the powerless , impotent leader of " Palestine " – where is that precisely , one had to ask ?
– trying to suck some importance from the coat - tails and robes of his betters .

Slipping and sliding on the corpses of Gaza , these assembled supreme beings should perhaps be pitied .
What else could they do ?
Saudi King Abdullah announced £ 750,000 to rebuild Gaza ; but how many times have the Arabs and the Europeans been throwing money at Gaza only to see it torn to shreds by incoming shell - fire ?
It has to be said that the two cowled Hamas gunmen who announced that they had won a " victory " in the ruins of Gaza were only fractionally less hypocritical .
Still they had not understood that they were not the Hizbollah of Lebanon .
Gaza was no longer Beirut .
Now , it seemed , Gaza was Stalingrad .
But whose uniforms did Hamas think they were wearing : German or Soviet ?
" Israel has to understand , " the good king said – as if the Israelis were listening – " that the choice between war and peace will not always stay open and that the Arab initiative ( for Arab recognition in return for an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders of Israel ) that is on the table today will not stay on the table . "
He knew that " an eye for an eye ... did not say an eye for the eyes of a whole city " .
But how many times – how many bodies have to be pulled from the ruins – before the Saudis realise that time has run out ?
The Israelis briskly dismissed land for peace in 2002 but yesterday they suddenly showed their interest again .
" We continue to be willing to negotiate with all our neighbours on the basis of that initiative , " the Israeli government spokesmen said – as if his own country 's original rejection had never been thrown at the Arabs .
President Bashar al - Assad of Syria , of course , dismissed the whole initiative in Qatar last week as dead , insisting that Israel be declared a " terrorist entity " .
But Mahmoud Abbas stepped further into humiliation yesterday by announcing that the " only option " for Arabs was to make peace with Israel .
It was Arab " shortcomings " that led to the failure of the 2002 Arab initiative .
Not Israel 's rejection , mark you .
No , it was all the fault of the Arabs .
And this from the leader of " Palestine " .
No wonder America 's man in Egypt – a certain Hosni Mubarak – repeated the tired old slogan that " peace in the Middle East is an imperative that cannot be delayed " .
And then the Emir of Kuwait invited Bashar and Hosni and King Abdullah of Jordan and the other King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to have lunch together – the menu was not disclosed – to end their feuding .
Al - Jazeera showed the ever - more putrid bodies being tugged from beneath cross-beams and crushed concrete as these mighty potentates debated their little disputes .
There was really no adequate comment for this charade .
Set in Our Ways : Why Change Is So Hard
Millions of us dream of transforming our lives , but few of us are able to make major changes after our 20s .
Here 's why
HE LEAVES the White House as one of the least popular and most divisive presidents in American history .
At home , his approval rating has been stuck in the 20s for months ; abroad , George Bush has presided over the most catastrophic collapse in America 's reputation since the second world war .
The American economy is in deep recession , brought on by a crisis that forced Mr Bush to preside over huge and unpopular bail - outs .
America is embroiled in two wars , one of which Mr Bush launched against the tide of world opinion .
The Bush family name , once among the most illustrious in American political life , is now so tainted that Jeb , George 's younger brother , recently decided not to run for the Senate from Florida .
A Bush relative describes family gatherings as “ funeral wakes ” .
Few people would have predicted this litany of disasters when Mr Bush ran for the presidency in 2000 .
True , the 2000 election was likely to be divisive because of the peculiar arithmetic of the outcome ( Mr Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore by 500,000 votes , then won a disputed recount in Florida by a few hundred ) .
But for most people Mr Bush was a pretty acceptable choice , and certainly not a crusader - in - waiting .
He came across as an affable chap , particularly when compared with his uptight rival .
Frank Bruni , who covered his election campaign for the New York Times , wrote in 2002 that “ the Bush I knew was part scamp and part bumbler , a timeless fraternity boy and heedless cutup , a weekday gym rat and weekend napster . ”
And the then governor of Texas presented himself as a centrist — a new kind of “ compassionate conservative ” , a “ uniter rather than a divider ” , an advocate of a “ humble ” and restrained foreign policy .
The Economist liked this mixture enough to endorse him in 2000 .
How did all this change ?
How did the uniter become a divider ?
How did Mr Bush 's governing style shape American politics over the next eight years ?
And what legacy has the 43rd president left for the 44th ?
His supporters — the few that remain — point out that this was a presidency knocked sideways by the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 , which no one foresaw .
The huge expansion of government and executive power under Mr Bush , and the prosecution of a disastrous war , all unrolled in the wake of those attacks .
The financial crisis , which began with overvalued homes and sloppily underwritten mortgages , was the product of numerous forces and failures in which Mr Bush was not a major contributor ; they included low interest rates , bankers ' reckless risk - taking , flawed regulation and consumers ' bubble mentality , all of which spanned borders .
Yet Mr Bush 's presidency was also poisoned by his own ambition .
Mr Bruni's “ timeless fraternity boy ” wanted to be a great president .
He not only wanted to win the second term that Bill Clinton had denied to his father — though that mattered to him enormously .
He also wanted to usher in a period of prolonged Republican hegemony , much as William McKinley had done for his party in the late 19th century .
After the September 11th attacks he not only itched to destroy al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
He also wanted to tackle the root causes of terrorism in the Middle East .
Mr Bush frequently spoke about how much he hated anything that was “ small ball ” .
His close advisers repeatedly described him as a “ transformative president ” .
Mr Bush 's role model throughout his presidency was not his father but the patron saint of the modern conservative movement , Ronald Reagan .
He regarded Reagan as a man who had unleashed free - enterprise and defeated the Soviet Empire , and he tried to do the same with his huge tax cuts and his global war on terror .
He mimicked Reagan 's Western style , even relaxing on a Texas ranch where Reagan had taken his holidays on a Californian one ; and he echoed Reagan 's enthusiastic use of the word “ evil ” .
Other facets of Mr Bush 's personality mixed with his vaulting ambition to undermine his presidency .
Mr Bush is what the British call an inverted snob .
A scion of one of America 's most powerful families , he is a devotee of sunbelt populism ; a product of Yale and Harvard Business School , he is a scourge of eggheads .
Mr Bush is a convert to an evangelical Christianity that emphasises emotion — particularly the intensely emotional experience of being born again — over ratiocination .
He also styled himself , much like Reagan , as a decider rather than a details man ; many people who met him were astonished by what they described as his “ lack of inquisitiveness ” and his general “ passivity ” .
This led Mr Bush to distrust the Washington establishment , and even to believe that establishment wisdom was probably wrong simply by virtue of what it was .
Fred Barnes , a conservative journalist , entitled his book on Mr Bush “ Rebel in Chief ” .
He quotes one Bush confidante as saying : “ One tux a term .
That 's our idea of outreach to the Washington community . ”
Lack of curiosity also led Mr Bush to suspect intellectuals in general and academic experts in particular .
David Frum , who wrote speeches for Mr Bush during his first term , noted that “ conspicuous intelligence seemed actively unwelcome in the Bush White House ” .
The Bush cabinet was “ solid and reliable ” , but contained no “ really high - powered brains ” .
Karen Hughes , one of his closest advisers , “ rarely read books and distrusted people who did ” .
Ron Suskind , a journalist , has argued that Mr Bush created a “ faith - based presidency ” in which decisions , precisely because they were based on faith , could not be revised subsequently .
For the good of the party
Mr Bush relied heavily on a small inner core of advisers .
The most important of these was Dick Cheney , who quickly became the most powerful vice - president in American history .
Mr Cheney used his mastery of bureaucracy to fill the administration with his protégés and to control the flow of information to the president .
He pushed Mr Bush forcefully to the right on everything from global warming to the invasion of Iraq ; he also fought ruthlessly to expand the power of the executive branch , which he thought had been dangerously restricted since Watergate .
The two other decisive figures were Karl Rove , Mr Bush 's longtime political guru , and Donald Rumsfeld , his defence secretary .
Mr Rove was obsessed by pursuing his dream of a rolling Republican realignment , subordinating everything to party politics .
Mr Rumsfeld regarded the Iraq war not , like his boss , as an exercise in democracy - building , but as an opportunity to test the model of an “ agile military ” that he was pioneering at the Pentagon .
The fruit of all this can be seen in the three most notable characteristics of the Bush presidency : partisanship , politicisation and incompetence .
Mr Bush was the most partisan president in living memory .
He was content to be president of half the country — a leader who fused his roles of head of state and leader of his party .
He devoted his presidency to feeding the Republican coalition that elected him .
The most important legislation of his first year in office was a $ 1.35 trillion tax cut that handed an extra $ 53,000 to the top 1 % of earners .
At his farewell press conference on January 12th Mr Bush called his tax cuts the “ right course of action ” , as if they were an unpopular but heroic decision .
They were n't .
The budget was in surplus in 2000 , and both Mr Bush 's main Republican rival , John McCain , and his Democratic opponent , Mr Gore , also wanted to cut taxes , but by less , so as to pay down more debt and shore up Social Security ( public pensions ) .
Mr Bush 's much larger tax cut reflected his , and his party 's , belief that lower taxes restrain the size of government , empower individuals and are good for both growth and Republican prospects .

Cheney , the string - puller
Mr Bush sold his first tax cut , in 2001 , as recession insurance .
He did the same in 2003 ; and though the budget surplus was gone by then , he upped the ante by also lowering taxes on capital gains and dividends .
Lower taxes on capital boost investment , but , as one former senior administration official says , that thought was secondary : “ It was a political winner that happened to coincide with good economics . ”
Lower taxes on capital had the potential to bolster a growing “ investor class ” that tended to vote Republican .
Relentless partisanship led to the politicisation of almost everything Mr Bush did .
He used his first televised address to justify putting strict limits on federal funding for stem - cell research , and used the first veto of his presidency to prevent the expansion of that funding .
He appointed two “ strict constructionist ” judges to the Supreme Court , John Roberts and Samuel Alito , turned his back on the Kyoto protocol , dismissed several international treaties , particularly the anti-ballistic - missile treaty , loosened regulations on firearms and campaigned against gay marriage .
His energy policy was written by Mr Cheney with the help of a handful of cronies from the energy industry .
His lacklustre attorney - general Alberto Gonzales , who was forced to resign in disgrace , was only the most visible of an army of over - promoted , ideologically vetted homunculi .
Bumbling towards Baghdad
The Iraq war was a case study of what happens when politicisation is mixed with incompetence .
A long - standing convention holds that politics stops at the ocean 's edge .
But Mr Bush and his inner circle labelled the Democrats “ Defeaticrats ” whenever they were reluctant to support extending the war from Afghanistan to Iraq .
They manipulated intelligence to demonstrate that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and had close relations with al - Qaeda .
This not only divided a country that had been brought together by September 11th ; it also undermined popular support for what Mr Bush regarded as the central theme of his presidency , the war on terror .
Sean Wilentz , a historian at Princeton , remarks how unusual it is for a president to have politicised such a national catastrophe : “ No other president — Lincoln in the civil war , FDR in world war two , John F. Kennedy at critical moments of the cold war — faced with such a monumental set of military and political circumstances , failed to embrace the opposing political party to help wage a truly national struggle .
But Bush shut out and even demonised the Democrats . ”
The invasion of Iraq was like much else in the Bush years — an initial triumph that contained the seeds of disaster .
Thomas Ricks , the author of “ Fiasco ” , argues that “ the US - led invasion was launched recklessly , with a flawed plan for war and a worse approach to occupation . ”
Mr Rumsfeld 's decision to invade with too few troops led inexorably to the breakdown of law and order , which turned the Iraqi population against the Americans , and to the Abu Ghraib scandal , which solidified world opinion against America .
But Mr Bush responded to the unfolding disaster with a mixture of denial and stubbornness , refusing to force Mr Rumsfeld to adjust his plans .
He engaged in an absurd photo - op to declare “ Mission accomplished ” , and he also gave medals to three of the architects of the debacle , George Tenet , Tommy Franks and Paul Bremer .
Mr Bush 's weaknesses were on display again in the second great disaster of his administration , Hurricane Katrina , which struck New Orleans in August 2005 .
The hurricane exposed Mr Bush 's congenital passivity : he did not visit New Orleans until five days later , after first viewing the damage from the safety of Air Force One .
It also exposed the consequences of filling your administration with third - rate hacks .
The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , Michael Brown , a former commissioner for the International Arabian Horse Association , made a hash of dealing with the disaster but nevertheless received an encomium from the president — “ Brownie , you 're doing a heckuva job ” — that rang around the country .
The Truman hope
How will Mr Bush be judged in the light of history ?
“ Many historians ” , says Princeton 's Mr Wilentz , “ are now wondering whether Bush , in fact , will be remembered as the very worst president in all of American history . ”
A humbled Mr Bush counters his critics by pointing out that “ You never know what your history is going to be like until long after you 're gone . ”
He frequently invokes the name of Harry Truman as a president who was dismissed at the time , but is now regarded as one of the greats .
Mr Bush 's presidency is not without its merits .
He supported sensible immigration reform .
He proposed tighter regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the now - nationalised mortagage agencies .
Congress stymied him on both points .
He promoted more members of minorities than any previous president ; and he also stood up to the Dixiecrat wing of his party , edging Trent Lott , a Mississippi senator , out of his job as majority leader for segregation - favouring remarks .
He maintained good relations with India , Japan and , particularly , Africa , where he launched a $ 15 billion anti-AIDS programme .
On trade , too , Mr Bush 's heart was in the right place , though policy was at first subverted by political or strategic priorities .
In 2002 he approved tariffs on imported steel to fulfil a promise Mr Cheney made to steelworkers in West Virginia , a state crucial to his 2000 election .
That year he also signed a massive increase in farm subsidies so as not to antagonise farm - state congressmen facing election that autumn .
But these early protectionist impulses gave way to a more stalwart defence of trade .
Mr Bush resisted intense pressure from Congress to punish China for keeping its currency low .
After Congress narrowly granted him streamlined authority to negotiate treaties , he pushed the Doha global free - trade agreement and a free - trade area of the Americas .
These efforts failed in part because of other countries ' intransigence , notably India 's in the case of the Doha round .
In the absence of a broader framework , his administration pursued bilateral trade deals , although often with countries chosen for strategic rather than economic value : Oman and Bahrain , for example , which host American military bases .
His administration 's handling of the financial crisis alternated between shaky and competent .
Swallowing his visceral scorn for finance , Mr Bush delegated crisis management to Henry Paulson , his treasury secretary and a former investment banker .
Mr Paulson 's remedies were often blunted by complexity , inconsistency and his insistence that lenders and borrowers pay for their mistakes .
His decision to let Lehman Brothers fail significantly intensified the crisis .
Still , Mr Paulson regrouped by pouring hundreds of billions of government dollars into the tottering financial system , which has bought a measure of stability .
Mr Bush backed this , in violation of his own anti-interventionist impulses .
Mr Bush showed more ability to learn from his mistakes than his critics realise or than he himself might like to admit .
The second Bush administration was very different from the first .
He reached out to America 's allies , particularly through his second secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , establishing good relations with France 's Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany 's Angela Merkel ; and he also improved his administration 's profile in the world by firing Donald Rumsfeld and sidelining various neoconservatives .
The president 's legendary stubbornness paid off in one area : his decision to ignore Washington 's wise men and increase troop levels in Iraq , rather than preparing for withdrawal , probably averted disaster there and certainly increased stability .
There is even a possibility that Mr Bush 's most controversial decision may eventually be vindicated : if Iraq turns into a beacon of democracy in the Middle East , then he will look much better in a decade 's time than he does today .
But that is a big “ if ” .
Farewell to restraint
Meanwhile , his policy of cutting taxes while increasing spending — of simultaneously pursuing big government and small government — dramatically swelled the deficit .
He inherited a projected ten - year surplus of $ 5.6 trillion and bequeaths a ten - year deficit of $ 6 trillion , assuming his tax cuts remain in place .
Hardly the makings of a positive judgment from future historians .
In pursuit of his fiscal ambitions , Mr Bush helped roll over or sweep aside long - standing rules and conventions designed to keep the deficit in check .
Republicans in Congress pushed through his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts under a parliamentary manoeuvre called “ reconciliation ” previously reserved for measures that reduced , or did not increase , the deficit .
Doing so largely stripped Democrats of their ability to raise procedural obstacles in the Senate , but also required the tax cuts to expire after ten years .
As the projected surpluses melted away , Mr Bush cut the horizon in his budgets from ten years to five , masking the long - term impact of his policies .
For years the president refused to include the cost of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in his budget .
He also acquiesced in the expiry of 12 - year - old budget rules that made it difficult to cut taxes or increase spending if it raised the deficit .
In coming years deficit reduction will be hard enough , with the recession - induced collapse in tax collections and the cost of the bail - outs .
Jim Horney , a former Democratic congressional staffer now at the liberal Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities , a think - tank , says it has been made even harder by the disappearance of any culture of restraint in Congress .
Mr Bush 's biggest failure , however , is on entitlements .
The ageing of the population , coupled with rapidly rising health - care costs , means that in coming decades Social Security and Medicare benefits will outstrip workers ' payroll contributions by trillions of dollars .
Both programmes presented Mr Bush with a political opportunity .
To pry elderly voters away from the Democrats , he promised to add a prescription - drug benefit as part of any Medicare reform .
He did so in 2003 , winning the support of the AARP , the powerful pensioners ' lobby , which has long been seen as closer to the Democrats .
But in the end he achieved few cost savings , while adding a staggering $ 8 trillion to Medicare 's unfunded liability ( see chart ) .
Social Security , founded in the Depression to provide workers with a secure pension , has defied all recent attempts to make it solvent .
Although such an attempt was part of Mr Bush 's first election campaign , it was not solvency that animated him , but the prospect of workers diverting some of their Social Security contributions to private investment accounts .
Such accounts were intended as the centrepiece of the Republican Party 's “ ownership society ” .
Economists are divided on the merit of such accounts , but agree they do nothing to restore solvency : that requires slimmer benefits , higher taxes , or both .
Because of the political peril of touching Social Security , broad reform demands bipartisan support .
Yet David Walker , the federal government 's chief auditor from 1998 to 2008 , says Mr Bush doomed his own effort , launched after his 2004 re-election , by seeking to shape its outcome from the start .
He had appointed an advisory commission whose members first had to agree to support private accounts ( which many Democrats oppose ) .
He issued detailed proposals for private accounts while eschewing , until much later , solvency proposals .
His administration staged some 200 “ town hall ” events attended by pre-screened participants , Mr Walker says , yet at the end of it all support for Mr Bush 's proposal was lower than when it began .
Between the Medicare drug benefit and the failure to restore solvency to Social Security , the long - term unfunded cost of America 's programmes for the elderly had last year reached a stratospheric $ 43 trillion , or 5 % of future wages , compared with $ 13 trillion , or 3 % of future wages , in 2000 .
Mr Obama and Congress may still be able to mend entitlements .
But they start with a bigger and more imminent danger than Mr Bush did eight years ago , and one made even harder by the deep hole the current recession has created in the budget .
The costs of ambition
The neoconservatives who had such influence over Mr Bush argued that unintended consequences were usually more important than the intended ones .
The Bush presidency has proved them right in this , if in little else .
A president who laboured to produce Republican hegemony ended up dramatically weakening the Republican Party .
The Democratic Party is now in a more powerful position than it has been at any time since the second world war .
In the Senate , the Democrats have a majority of 59 seats to 41 ( including two independents who caucus with the Democrats ) ; in the House , they hold 256 seats to the Republicans ' 178 .
Americans who came of age during the Bush years identify with the Democrats by the largest majority recorded for any age cohort since the second world war .
A president who believed that America 's global supremacy was guaranteed by America 's unrivalled military power ended up demonstrating the limits of both .
Many of America 's closest allies in Europe refused to co-operate with the Iraq war .
Many of America 's rivals used America 's travails in Iraq to extend their power : Iran is more powerful than it was in 2000 , and closer to acquiring a nuclear bomb ; Russia and China have extended their web of alliances and strengthened their regional influence .
Mr Bush 's recalibration of his policies in his second term suggests that even he recognises that America 's loss of soft power has cost it dear .
The American military machine is under intense strain .
The demands of tackling the Iraq insurgency have forced America to short - change Afghanistan .
Deployments have grown longer and redeployments more frequent .
Recruitment standards are going down .
The neoconservative dream of a muscle - bound America knocking down the “ axis of evil ” and planting democracies from North Korea to Iran looks , more than ever , like an overheated fantasy cooked up in a think - tank .
Finally , Mr Bush also demonstrated the limits of capitalist triumphalism .
The Bush administration was as business - friendly as any in American history : Mr Bush was the first president with an MBA ( from Harvard ) and he appointed four CEOs to his cabinet , more than any previous president .
The administration was also wedded to the fundamental tenets of Reaganomics : cut taxes and free the supply side and everything else will take care of itself .
Mr Cheney even argued explicitly that “ Reagan taught us that deficits do n't matter . ”
Mr Bush now leaves behind a tax system in some ways less efficient than the one he inherited , in need of annual patches , and unable to fund the government even in good times .
He also leaves behind a broken budget process .
Any economic triumphalism is long gone .
Many of the CEOs , most notably Donald Rumsfeld and Paul O'Neill , proved to be dismal administrators .
Reaganomics helped to produce a giant deficit .
The financial crisis has made re-regulation rather than deregulation the mantra in Washington , while government has acquired a much bigger role in the economy through its backing of banks and car companies .

Next !
“ I inherited a recession , I 'm ending on a recession , ” he noted at his press conference on January 12th .
He was n't asking for pity , only to be judged on what happened in between .
Unfortunately , that economic legacy is littered with wasted opportunity , bad judgments and politicised policy .
The budget surplus he inherited is now a deficit , the fiscal hole in America 's retiree programmes is bigger than ever , the tax system is an unstable , patched - up mess .
It is not all his fault .
But for the most part , good policy repeatedly took a back seat to Mr Bush 's overweening political ambition .
Both the country and , ultimately , the Republican Party are left the worse for it .
She refused to cooperate so the police tazed the hell out of her .
Less -Lethal Weapons Are Portland 's Cops Changing Their Tune on Tasers ?
If you think you 've been hearing a lot about Tasers over the past year — you 're right .
The Mercury has run more stories about Tasers than any other type of force used by the Portland Police Bureau .
However , is Taser usage actually on the rise ?
Last Tuesday , November 18 , the City of Portland 's Independent Police Review Director Mary - Beth Baptista reconvened its " Use - of - Force Task Force " to begin looking at the police bureau 's use - of - force data from January 2007 to the present .
The Mercury asked if the press would be allowed into the meeting , but was told by Baptista the get - together was private .
Baptista 's group is likely to present its force findings to the public in spring 2009 .
But prompted by the rash of Taser stories printed this year — suggesting Portland Police may have been turning more to Tasers in certain situations than in years prior — the Mercury decided to get an early start and take a hard look into this aspect of the bureau 's use of force .
First , the Good News
Perhaps surprisingly , it appears Portland Police are actually deploying Tasers less than they used to .
When the Mercury filed a public records request to find out the number of cases where Tasers were deployed by Portland Police , the early numbers — which are yet to be formally audited by Baptista 's task force — show a steady drop : From 541 cases in 2006 , to 476 in 2007 , and in 2008 , we 're on course for a total of 392 cases , if you extrapolate November and December averages from the first 10 months ' total of 327 cases .
That 's a likely 27.5 percent drop in Taser use within three years .
Great news ?
Do n't celebrate yet : Remember , this is only the number of cases where Tasers were used — it 's possible Tasers may have been deployed more than once during the course of each case , so these numbers are only one indication of the way Tasers were utilized .
But the bureau could n't supply those broken - down deployment numbers for 2008 without charging big bucks to have an analyst extract them from all the use - of - force reports for each case — a task that will ultimately be fulfilled by the Use - of - Force Task Force in the spring .
In the meantime , we took what we could get .
A couple of explanations could account for the lower Taser numbers : Police Chief Rosie Sizer has made some significant changes to the bureau 's use - of - force policies over the last two years , issuing new use - of - force regulations in March 2008 , directing officers , " when practical , " to use " less force than the maximum allowed by law " to resolve confrontations with suspects .
She also expanded the bureau 's Crisis Intervention Training ( CIT ) program in early 2007 , which teaches de-escalation techniques to officers when dealing with those in mental health crisis .
At the same time , the number of officers injured in the line of duty has decreased , too — from 216 for the 2005 - 2006 fiscal year , to 196 for the 2006 - 2007 fiscal year , to 192 for the 2007 - 2008 fiscal year , according to the city 's Fire and Police Disability and Retirement Bureau .
That 's a drop of 11 percent over a broadly similar three - year period , suggesting officers are n't getting injured more in exchange for using their Tasers less , and police oversight activists are pleased .
" Any reduction in use of weapons is a good sign that community policing is occurring , " says Jason Renaud of the Mental Health Association of Portland .
" But we can't say that this reduction in Taser use comes from crisis intervention training or anything else , because the police bureau has n't released any information on the outcomes associated with that training . "
Now , the Bad News
Renaud touches on an important point , because while the Portland Police Bureau 's Taser stats appear to be dropping — perhaps as a result of crisis intervention training and changes to its use - of - force policies — it is difficult , without more information from the bureau , to pinpoint exactly why .
Meanwhile , there appears to be a separate trend emerging both here and across the country : Tasers are being used more often by officers to gain compliance from uncooperative subjects , and less often as a " less- lethal " alternative to deadly force in situations where a gun might otherwise have been used .
Perhaps the best example of this shift in the Taser 's place in America is the infamous " Do n't Tase Me , Bro ! " incident , captured on video at the University of Florida on September 17 , 2007 .
Toward the end of a contentious question - and - answer session with Senator John Kerry , police removed student Andrew Meyer from the audience microphone , restraining him and Tasering him in apparent retaliation for asking unusual questions and refusing to sit down .
Senator Kerry can be heard in the background urging everybody to " calm down , " shortly before Meyer screams in agony on application of the weapon .
The incident is quite funny to a casual observer — until you stop to think about what it might mean .
While Portland Police may be using their Tasers less often , there is alarming anecdotal evidence to suggest that — like the cops in Florida — they may well be using the weapons in a different manner than in previous years .
History Unrepeating
Tasers were first given to Portland Police officers in June 2002 , following the officer - involved shooting in 2001 of José Santos Victor Mejía Poot ( a man suffering from epilepsy ) , and subsequent recommendations made by the Police Assessment Resource Center to buy " less- lethal " weapons .
Former Police Chief Mark Kroeker bought just 12 Tasers back then , but as early as August 2002 , Portland Copwatch activist Dan Handelman was warning readers in the organization 's People 's Police Report that " the new devices , once readily available , will be misused as compliance , crowd control , or torture devices . "
Were the Tasers initially used simply as a new way to hurt people ?
In September 2004 , 71 - year - old Eunice Crowder received $ 145,000 in a legal settlement from the city after her glass eye fell out as she was struck on the head , and Tasered twice in the back and once in the breast by overzealous officers .
( The incident escalated after Crowder challenged a city employee who was forcibly cleaning her yard based on a search warrant . )
In October 2006 , Portland cops used a Taser on an 11 - year - old student " wielding a compass " at Buckman Elementary School , and in March 2006 , Tim Grant , 46 , actually died after being Tasered twice on NE 24th and Sandy ( the cause of death was listed as a cocaine overdose by the state medical examiner , Karen Gunson ) .
Later that year , a 15 - year - old boy with severe autism , Sir Millage , was Tasered at least 13 times by officers at the Pearl District end of the Broadway Bridge after failing to comply with their commands .
Perhaps the most controversial deployment of the Taser happened in September 2006 when officers Tasered 42 - year - old James Chasse Jr. on the sidewalk opposite the Bluehour restaurant at NW 13th and Everett .
Chasse , in the midst of an apparent mental health crisis , later died in police custody .
While cops are now less likely to injure people in such a manner , judging from the numbers , it appears the Taser is being used on a different kind of victim :
Young men , mostly , who do n't like doing what they 're told .
No Time to Comply
In October 2007 , Frank Waterhouse filed a $ 30,000 lawsuit against the cops for shooting him with a beanbag gun and Tasering him without a verbal warning — apparently in retaliation for videotaping their activities [ " Crowded Courthouse , " News , Oct 18 , 2007 ] .
At the deposition , " Some of the officers said they needed to escalate the situation because they were afraid that [ Waterhouse ] would run off to his right , " says Benjamin Haile , Waterhouse 's attorney .
" But other deposition testimony revealed that there was an officer standing to his right with a gun drawn , which suggests there was no danger of him running away .
" In a way it 's a classic example of how the availability of these so - called ' less - lethal ' weapons cause things to escalate quickly , " Haile continues .
" There was clearly no need for lethal force in this case .
Instead of taking the time to talk to or physically restrain Mr. Waterhouse , the officers quickly escalated to less - lethal weapons as a compliance tool .
It 's a massive escalation of force that does n't need to happen . "
In June 2008 , Phil Sano was Tasered on SE 7th and Alder , allegedly without warning after he failed to stop for an officer who noticed he did n't have a bike light [ " Night Light Fight , " News , June 19 ] .
Also in June this year , Dan Halsted was walking home from a bar along NE 26th when he was allegedly jumped and Tasered by police officers , again , without a verbal warning [ " Jumped , " News , July 3 ] .
On June 7 , Clifton Brooks was Tasered by police officers on SE Belmont after calling them to assist him at the scene of his earlier assault by two strangers .
" I approached them , but within seconds they were arresting me , and I did n't have a chance to tell them anything , " Brooks later told the Mercury [ " The Wrong Guy , " News , Oct 9 ] .
There is also disturbing evidence to suggest that while Portland 's cops now recognize the dangers of repeated Taser application , they may be finding new ways to cover for having accidentally Tasered someone more than once — like allegedly perjuring themselves on the witness stand [ " Taser Eraser , " News , Sept 4 ] or omitting a second Taser cycle in their arrest reports [ " Conflicting Reports , " News , Oct 30 ] .
" Tasers were initially introduced to provide police with an alternative to using lethal force in extremely high - risk incidents , " says a 114 - page report on global Taser use issued this month by the ombudsman 's office for the state of New South Wales , Australia .
" However , in many jurisdictions , Tasers are increasingly being used by police in situations where high levels of risk are not present , and police could likely manage the situation effectively without resorting to force . "
" Mission Creep "
The New South Wales report calls this phenomenon " mission creep . "
" For example , " the report continues , " On some occasions Tasers are being used in the first instance on people who are being uncooperative or non-compliant , but who are not acting in an aggressive or threatening manner . "
For some , like Dalia Hashad , director of the USA program for Amnesty International , this is the change that 's perhaps most worrying about Taser use over recent years .
" I think the entire discussion on how policing takes place is changing , and Taser is a huge part of that , " she says .
" If you look at the way police officers are using the weapon across the country , it 's not in situations that require use of lethal or deadly force .
I think instead we 're seeing police use it as a tool of compliance — as a weapon of first resort , not of last resort . "
Along with mission creep , it seems the public is becoming increasingly tolerant of Tasers as a part of everyday life .
At the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , for example , Taser introduced a personal " Taser C2 , " which can hold one gigabyte of music in its holster .
The weapons are available in " red hot , " " fashion pink , " and leopard print , according to the Associated Press .
In Arizona , Taser parties are being held at which women take turns firing the weapon over " light conversation and snacks . "
Respect My Authority
" If you have a uniformed police officer pointing a weapon at you , that is not the time to explain something , " says head of the Portland Police Association , Scott Westerman .
" The officer has clearly drawn their own conclusions based on what they 've perceived , and they 're very likely to be different from what the suspect has perceived in that situation . "
In other words , when an officer is pointing a weapon at you , that 's not the time to explain yourself , Westerman thinks .
That 's the time to comply with an officer 's commands .
" As more and more people mistakenly believe it 's socially acceptable to publicly challenge the police , it creates an environment where people think that it is okay to ignore a uniformed police officer giving them commands , " Westerman continues .
" The environment in Portland allows this more frequently than in other cities . "
" Citizens have the right not to give their names if they 're not suspected of any criminal activity , " counters Handelman , from Portland Copwatch .
" And if they are suspected of criminal activity , they do n't have to say anything else .
It 's a question of how we balance our rights as citizens to be free from unwanted police contact with the officers ' efforts to do their jobs .
If they 're not giving a legal command and then they escalate by introducing a level of force like the Taser to try to control a suspect , that 's highly inappropriate and very dangerous . "
Chief Sizer declined comment for this story .
" Without good governance , policies , and training , you are not going to have a good Taser program , " says Steve Tuttle , a spokesman for Taser International .
" We 're no stranger to controversy , but you can't forget about the planes landing safely .
The media tends to focus on the planes that crash .
" The Taser is such a misunderstood device right now because of the headlines out there that are really hard to combat , " Tuttle continues .
Tasers were initially introduced in Portland following a high - profile officer - involved shooting — suggesting the intention they would be used instead of drawing a gun .
However , another major city 's experience does beg the question : Are Tasers necessary at all ?
" We do n't have Tasers , " says Sergeant Lyn Tomioka , public information officer for the San Francisco Police Department , when I call to compare Portland 's statistics with theirs .
" The idea has been presented to us , but I guess the statistical research has not been worth spending that much money on them . "
Asked how many officer - involved shootings there have been in San Francisco over the past year , Tomioka says " two . "
The exact same number as Portland .
