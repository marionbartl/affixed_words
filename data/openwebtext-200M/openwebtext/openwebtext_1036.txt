ISRAELI Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's communications chief , Ron Dermer , has admitted that Israel faces a serious public relations problem .
In his first interview since the Netanyahu Government took office in March , the Prime Minister 's director of policy planning and communications has told The Age that it 's time Israel switched its PR strategy from defence to offence .
" We have to break out of the straitjacket , " Mr Dermer says .
" We have to defend our own right to defend ourselves .
It 's not for other people to do it for us . "
Despite launching a broadside at the way the foreign media and other organisations report events in Israel , Mr Dermer acknowledged that successive Israeli governments were also to blame for presenting a narrow argument .
" It is not enough for Israel to say that it wants peace .
You must also say that you are not a thief .
We did not steal another people 's land .
That is the core of this conflict , " he says .

This appears as an eye , but in reality is a trillion - mile - long tunnel of glowing gases , known as the Helix Nebula .
Just as we " see " visual objects that correspond to those that are familiar to us , we also ' hear ' phantom words and phrases that relate to our experiences .
In October 2008 , The Bolivar , Herald - Free Press ran the following story :
“ When Gary Rofkahr from Ossowo heard there was a baby doll on local store shelves that said , “ Islam is the light , ” he did n’t believe it .
He bought the Little Mommy Real Loving Baby Cuddle and Coo doll to see for himself , and was shocked to hear “ Islam is the light ” among other baby gibberish including “ Mama . ”
“ I have a 1 - year - old granddaughter , ” he said .
It makes me mad that someone is trying to indoctrinate our children with an innocent toy . ”
The Little Mama doll is only one of a long string of talking dolls that have shocked customers over the years .
On April 12 , 2000 , APB News reported :
“ Taylor , an unemployed office worker , told APBnews.com today that she bought a talking Tinky Winky doll a few weeks ago for her daughter 's second birthday .
When Taylor tugged at Tinky Winky 's left hand to make him talk , the doll spouted words that shocked Taylor .
" He was saying , ' I got a gun , I got a gun , run away , run away , ’ recalled Taylor , 22 .
" My gut just kind of dropped . ”
These incidents reflect a profound truth :
When listening to speech , the words and phrases that we " hear " are strongly influenced , not only by the sounds that reach our ears , but also by our knowledge , beliefs , and expectations .
This might seem surprising , as the process of speech communication generally appears effortless to us .
So from our subjective experience , it would be reasonable to assume that the sound signal simply travels from our ears up to our brain where , in a few simple steps , it is chopped up into small units that are then reassembled correctly so that the original message is perceived .
But for half a century , engineers have struggled to develop computer software that can understand conversational speech as well as humans can and so far they have n’t even come close to achieving their goal .
There are monumental problems involved in designing speech recognition software that can handle conversational speech effectively .
We can easily recognize speech when it occurs at a rate of , say , 15 or 20 phonemes per second .
( Phonemes are basic units of sound that are strung together to produce morphemes , which are the smallest meaningful components of words . )
Yet when we are presented with a sequence of clicks at a rate of 15 per second , rather than hearing them individually , we hear a single buzzing sound .
So to understand speech , the phonemes must at some point be stored in the brain as overlapping in time , and then somehow disentangled so that the speech stream can be correctly perceived .
We do n’t yet understand how this occurs .
As a further complexity , we can recognize words and phrases when they are spoken by different speakers , including those who speak in different dialects , and also when they are spoken by the same speakers when they are in different emotional states .
In addition , speech often occurs in the presence of other sounds , and those that we are trying to interpret the need to be separated out from the rest .
As an added complication , a recording of the sound spectrum produced by a speech signal , when analyzed by computer , can be quite different depending on where in the room the recording is taken , or even depending on the position of the speaker ’s head .
So how humans are able to understand normal conversational speech effectively is still a considerable mystery .
But where we have an advantage over computers ( and probably always will ) is that we can draw on all the information we have stored in our memories — not only our knowledge of grammatical structure , but also our beliefs and expectations based on an enormous amount of personal experience — in making inspired guesses concerning what is probably being said .
However , this very process of guesswork can lead us to perceive phantom words and phrases that are not , in fact , being spoken .
There are many examples here , such as the Mondegreens described by Jon Carroll in his column in the San Francisco Chronicle or the beliefs held by some people that they have received spoken messages from the spirit world , described by Michael Shermer in his column for Scientific American .
Some years ago I discovered a way to produce a large number of phantom words and phrases within a short period .
To obtain the best effect , find a time when you will not be disturbed , and sit comfortably in front of two loudspeakers , with one to your left and the other to your right .
( Headphones do n’t work as well . )
Make sure that your sound system is set for stereo , and that the two loudspeakers are reasonably balanced for loudness .
In a phantom words demonstration , each track contains two words or a single word composed of two syllables , and these are repeated over and over again .
The same sequence is presented through both loudspeakers , but the tracks are offset in time so that when the first sound ( word or syllable ) is coming from the loudspeaker on the left the second sound is coming from the loudspeaker on the right ; and vice versa .
Because the sounds coming from the two loudspeakers are mixed in the air before they reach your ears , you are given a palette of sounds from which to chose , and so can create in your mind many different combinations of sounds .
It works well to have a pen and paper in front of you so that you can jot down the words and phrases that you hear .
Often people initially hear a jumble of meaningless sounds , but after a while , distinct words and phrases suddenly emerge .
It often seems that the left and right loudspeakers are producing different words , which sometimes appear to be spoken by different voices .
So jot down separately the words that you hear as coming from the left , and those that you hear as coming from the right .
After a while , you will probably find that new words and phrases appear to be coming from one loudspeaker or the other .
When this happens , jot these down also .
In addition , it ’s not unusual to hear a third stream of words or phrases , apparently coming from some location between the loudspeakers .
Nonsense words , and musical sounds such as percussive sounds or tones , sometimes appear to be mixed in with the meaningful words .
People often report hearing words and phrases spoken in strange or foreign accents , presumably they are fitting the sounds from the loudspeakers into words and phrases that are meaningful to them , even if this causes the words to appear distorted .
If English is your second language , you may find that you hear some words and phrases in your native language .
I teach a course on illusions at the University of California , San Diego , and generally , I play some phantom words to my class .
The students at our university are linguistically very diverse , and taken together I ’ve received reports of phantom words in Spanish , Mandarin , Cantonese , Korean , Japanese , Vietnamese , Tagalog , French , German , Italian , Hebrew , and Russian , to name just a few .
It ’s not unusual for students in my class to feel strongly that such ‘ foreign ’ words have been inserted into the tracks , and sometimes they adamantly stick to this belief , despite my assurances to the contrary .
People appear to hear words and phrases that reflect what is on their minds , as in a Rorschach test , though it ’s my impression that the present effect is stronger .
I can bet who is likely to be on a , as they report words like I ’m hungry , diet coke , or feel fat .
And students who are tend to report words that are related to stress ; if I play these sounds close to exam time , some students may well hear phrases like I ’m tired , no brain , or no time .
Interestingly , female students often report the word ‘ love ’ , while male students are more likely to report sexually explicit words and phrases .
Here are three phantom words .
One is from my compact disc Musical Illusions and Paradoxes , and the other two are from my compact disc Phantom Words and Other Curiosities , which also contains four more examples .

Another Music Start - Up Sued : EMI Takes Grooveshark to Court
Digital music start - ups seem to come in two flavors these days :
Those being sued by the major music labels and those with expensive licensing deals they ca n’t afford .
But for some reason , plucky Grooveshark , which runs a very nice , free streaming music service , has stayed out of both of those buckets until now .
I ’ve confirmed that EMI Music Group is suing the site–whose motto is “ Play any song in the world , for free ! ” –for copyright violation .
The label filed suit against Gainesville , Fla. - based Grooveshark in a New York court on May 8 .
I do n’t have a copy of the complaint yet , but if you feel like sharing , hit me at peter@allthingsd.com or use the blind tip box here .
No comment from EMI , but Grooveshark sent me a very long statement , which I ’ve printed at the bottom of the post .
The takeaway : Grooveshark says it was working on a licensing deal with EMI and now finds itself in court instead .
The company does refer to deals with “ many artists , labels and publishers , ” but as far as I can tell , it does n’t have deals with any of the other three majors –Warner Music Group ( WMG ) , Universal Music Group , or Sony ( SNE ) –either .
Grooveshark started out as a peer - to - peer file - sharing start - up in 2006 , and has since morphed into a streaming model .
When I talked to marketing VP Joshua Bonnain in May , he told me the company was primarily funded by friends and family –most of the company ’s employees are either students at or graduates of the University of Florida , he said .
But he also said the company had received a “ substantial investment from a large party ” that he would n’t identify .
Bonnain said the site , which generates at least some ad revenue , planned on splitting half of it with the copyright owners of the music it played .
But I was never clear about how that was going to work since Grooveshark does n’t have deals with the majors .
Then again , Bonnain did n’t tell me that the company had been sued a few days before we talked , either .
In the music world , negotiations do n’t preclude suits and vice versa ; Warner was , at one point , suing iMeem , but then became an investor in the site .
Same thing with Universal and News Corp. ’s ( NWS ) MySpace .
The only real question I ’ve had is why the big guys have n’t gone after Grooveshark yet .
I ’ve been asking label folks about the start - up since November and I ’ve only gotten shrugs for an answer .
Anyway , as I said , it ’s very nice service , and it would be a shame if the labels can’t figure out a way to work with it or help it survive .
But the odds of that happening , based on the unpleasant history of digital music start - ups to date , are very low .
So enjoy this themed playlist I created with the site ’s help , which features music from all four majors , while you can .
Grooveshark ’s statement is below .
Not too long ago , the CTO at Dudley H.'s company had a startling revelation : there should never , ever be a need for technical support .
If a client has an issue using one of their products , then the problem is most certainly in the product .
Maybe the UI is a little confusing .
Maybe it 's not documented enough .
Maybe the documentation is n't clear enough .
Whatever the case , every client issue means that someone — be it the developer , tester , or helpdesk technician — did n't do their job properly and should strive to improve themselves .
Of course , the counterargument to the CTO 's revelation , lobbied primarily by the helpdesk staff , was that many users are simply lazy , stupid , or lazy and stupid , and no amount of improvement could ever change that .
Not that it mattered , though .
The CTO was determined and set a new policy that all client issues were to have " problem / improvement " reports written about them , and that all reports were to be reviewed at the higest level .
Being the loyal employees that they were , Dudley and his fellow helpdesk technicians began developing these reports .
-------------------------------------------------
ISSUE # 88274 -------------------------------------------------
Client Issue : " Has ANY person in your company ever Looked at or tryed to READ any maniual man u all something like thet that it 's funney even after 7 years I still LAUGH any way some people like Ta know I mean Ya know ! "
Problem Point :
We failed to provide the client with a version of their manual in garbled , unpunctuated non-english .
Improvement Goal : Many companies miss the garbled , unpunctuated non-english market segment completely , and we should not be one of them .
It 's important to remember that for every client that understands " Click the ' submit ' button to save your changes " , there 's another that only understands " klik tHe summit butt on two SAVE yer changez ya know ya know " .
-------------------------------------------------
ISSUE # 88279 -------------------------------------------------
Client Issue : " I understand the issues are on our end , but at least try to make me laugh while I am venting !
THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! "
Problem Point :
Our technician was not entertaining enough while the client complained about a matter unrelated to the company .
Improvement Goal : Instead of being professional and courteous , the technician should have known that the client was upset before taking the call so that he could have answered the phone in a funny squeaky voice and punctuated the conversation with circus sound effects .
-------------------------------------------------
ISSUE # 88304
-------------------------------------------------
Client Issue : " I STILL have a problem with my Hotmail account .
At the very least , tell them to e-mail me like they care and tell them to fix it .
Maybee TECH SUPPORT lost it ?
mabee they need a coster or something to wipe there as **^^ %? did I say that NA no way must have been a finger Slip ?
i get that a lot ! "
Problem Point :
Our technician was unable to solve a problem with a product produced by a different company , specifically Hotmail by Microsoft .
Improvement Goal :
Even though our technicians are not employees of Microsoft , they should have had the foresight to work for them for several years to become an expert on their products before gaining employment with our current company .
Our technicians are cutting corners , and that 's just sad .
-------------------------------------------------
ISSUE # 88311 -------------------------------------------------
Client Issue : " I read on a website that your softweare had a security breach .
( Provides a link to that website . )
Whan are you planning on fixing this security breach , as I refuse to use your software until this is fixed . "
Problem Point :
The technician assumed the client would read the next sentence in the website 's article , which mentioned that the security breach in question was fixed less than two days after it was discovered ... three years ago .
Improvement Goal : Begin every email , support ticket and phone conversation with by shouting " WELCOME TO ( COMPANY ) , WHERE WE FIXED A MINOR SECURITY ISSUE SEVERAL YEARS AGO ! "
-------------------------------------------------
ISSUE # 88318 -------------------------------------------------
Client Issue : " your getting than you used to be " ( That 's the entirety of the message from the client . )
Problem Point :
While it is unclear whether or not this is actually a complaint , what is clear is that the technician 's " getting " is in some way different than the technician himself was at some point in the past .
Improvement Goal : Each technician should take better care of his " getting " , to ensure that it stops differing from how the technician used to be .
That way , the technician will potentially be praised by the client with the commendation that , " your getting is now exactly the same as you are now " .
And those are the type of praises that result in raises .
-------------------------------------------------
ISSUE # 88334 -------------------------------------------------
Client Issue : " You 're wrong , check with Bob Williams .
I spoke with him last week , and his answer contradicted what you 're telling me now . "
Problem Point : Even though Bob Williams has n't worked for our company for two and a half years , the technician should have the names , addresses and phone numbers of all past employees committed to memory .
This would allow the technician to contact Bob while the client holds .
However , if Bob no longer works at the company because he is dead , then the technician will need to call upon his powers of transcending the mortal fabric of existence -- which should have been covered during his first week of training -- to contact Bob in an alternate dimension .
Improvement Goal : Transport backwards in time and confront Bob regarding the contradicting misinformation he has apparently been spreading to clients .
Then pinch him unmercifully .
Shortly after reviewing the first batch of reports , the CTO had another revelation : many users are simply lazy , stupid , or lazy and stupid , and no amount of improvement could ever change that .

追記
Even though Opera is the most popular mobile browser in the world , in the desktop market Opera is the most under - rated browser despite having created many innovative features .
Which were later copied by other browsers .
Its hard to understand why Opera has only ~ 2.2 % browser market share while IE6 still boasts a whopping ~ 14.5 % market share .
Maybe the Opera developers were so busy developing solid browser features that they forgot that they need to do some promotions in order for people to use it .
In contrast IE developers were so busy shoving their crap browser down peoples throat they forgot to make a half decent browser .
Whatever is the case , the internet is a better place today thanks to some of the innovations that started from the Opera camp .
Source ( with a grain of salt )
1 ) Speed Dial : First introduced by opera in 2007 , copied by Chrome since the beginning , added to Safari 4 since beta and can be added to Firefox in the form of an extension .
2 ) Tabbed Browsing :
There are some disagreements about who introduced tabbed browsing .
The first version of Opera in 1994 ( named MultiTorg Opera ) introduced MDI tab where each tabs could be resized , tiled , cascaded and moved .
But Netcaptor in 1997 was the first browser that offered the current form of simple fixed tabs that we are used in browsers ( but at the bottom ) .
Tabs on top of the browser ( unlike Netcaptor ) was also introduced by Opera in 2000 .
[ Tabs in general applications was first introduced by IBM and adobe holds some sort of patent for tab functions , but thats a different story ]
3 ) Sessions :
The ability to save browser session was introduced with Opera 2 in 1996 .
If you close your opera browser or it crashed you can go back to your last auto saved session including history of that session .
This feature has been since copied in one form or another by other browser but none of them are as extensive as Opera session , where you can save a whole session of browser history in to text file and transfer in to a different computer and resume from there .
4 ) Pop-up Blocking : Imagine a web experience without pop-up blocker .
What we take for granted today was first introduced by Opera 5 in 2000 .
Firefox picked it up soon and IE joined in the party in 2004 .
5 ) Full page Zoom : A better alternative to larger text , zooming increases the size of the page without distorting the layout by only increasing the text size .
Introduced by opera in 1996 , and now all major browsers have this feature .
6 ) BitTorrent : Opera was the first to have torrent support built - in to the browser since 2006 .
It uses its download manager to download a torrent file like a regular download .
7 ) Delete Private Data :
The ability to remove personal information from your browser was first introduced by Opera in 2000 .
We had to manually delete personal info BO ( before Opera ) .
8 ) Mouse gestures :
Using mouse gestures to perform repetitive tasks like scrolling tabs , closing tabs , back and forward button using gestures was meant as an alternative to keyboard shortcuts for maximum productivity .
This feature was introduced by opera in 2001 and now Firefox supports this functions with the help of an extension .
Conclusion :
This is not a complete list and Opera was not the only browser that had unique ideas and innovations that changed the way people use browser .
But no other browsers had so many innovative ideas that has been copied with great success by almost every other browsers .
Yet , Operas market share is still around 2 % while other browsers are benefitting from its ideas .
The Opera team will have to take some blame for not doing enough to promote their browser in desktop market ( they are big in mobile browser market ) , also for the longest time Opera has this stigma attached to it because it used to be a commercial trialware browser and later ad - sponsored .
But since 2000 they moved away from trialware and from 2005 they removed ad - sponsorship .
Will they ever be a major player in the browser market share , now that the competition is greater than ever ?
Difficult to predict , but hopefully we will continue to benefit from great ideas delivered by the Opera team .
Forget plasma and LCDs : How the 3 mm - thick , eco-friendly OLED is the TV of the future
Once they were a must - have for every living room .
But LCD and plasma
TVs could be about to go the way of the cathode ray tube .
A new generation of super - slim screens will revolutionise home entertainment , according to the makers .
The OLED sets boast the thinnest TV screen created .
At its narrowest point it is the width of a pound coin .
And technological advances make the image far sharper than on LCD and plasma screens .
The Sony XEL - 1 is currently the only OLED TV on the market and priced at £ 3,500 .
The screen is just 3 mm thick
The Organic Light - Emitting Diode TVs have a contrast rating of 1,000,000 to 1 , about ten times sharper than most LCD screens .
The first OLED TV to reach consumers was Sony 's 11in £ 3,489 Bravia XEL , which went on sale this year .
Sony recently unveiled a new Walkman music and video player using an OLED screen to take on Apple 's iTouch , while large - screen TVs , priced at £ 5,000 , could be in shops by Christmas .
Panasonic is expected to launch a 40in OLED television next year and , according to online speculation , Apple will make a 15in Oled notebook on which users will be able to download movies .
The Orgacon prototype is a flexible OLED lighting panel .
Companies such as Japan 's NHK are working on creating bendy TVs
Apple is also rumoured to be planning to include an OLED screen in the next generation of iTouch and iPhone devices , which could be unveiled within days .
The OLED TV uses display technology based on organic materials which emit light naturally , once an electric charge is passed through them , rather than being back - lit as in LCD and Plasma screens .
This means the screens are much thinner and use up to 40 per cent less energy .
Dark areas appear black rather than dark grey because the relevant cells are simply switched off .
OLED screens have a contrast rating of 1,000,000 to 1 , producing remarkably sharp images
Jim Clark , of retail analyst Mintel , predicted that OLED televisions would become the dominant television from 2012 , when cheaper models arrive in the shops in time for the World Cup .
However , the screens have a limited lifespan .
An OLED set will last 30,000 hours , about ten years for someone using the TV eight hours a day .
By contrast , a Sony LCD TV lasts twice that long .
An OLED ( organic light emitting diode ) is 200 times smaller than a human hair .
Two layers of organic material are sandwiched between two conductors .
When a current passes from the cathode to the anode a bright light is produced by the organic material
RESEARCHERS at Japan 's public broadcaster NHK have developed a flexible OLED display that 's 5.8in and can display moving images in colour .
The screen could one day be used as a light - weight television that could be rolled up after use .
It is currently in the early stages of development and the prototype on show at DHK shows lines that are stuck on one colour .
This is because connections are vulnerable to breaking due to the flexible screen .
A body found " hog- tied " and bound with tape in an air conditioning vent of a downtown building is believed to be that of a missing cleaning woman , according to reports .
The woman discovered stuffed in the 12th floor air conditioning duct at 2 Rector Street died from asphyxiation caused by the black and yellow construction tape that was wrapped around her head and face , the medical examiner said today .
The tape held a gold cricifix to her mouth , cops said .
Police believe the body is that of Eridania Rodriguez , a cleaning woman who worked at the building and disappeared five days ago .
The building ’s security tapes contained no footage of her leaving after her shift in the building on Tuesday .
" You could see what appeared to be someone in the hog - tied position , " Paul Browne , the NYPD spokesman , told the New York Post .
The Post reported the woman 's body was fully clothed except for her shoes , which had been placed neatly beside her .
She was hog -tied and had a cross over her mouth , the report said .
Medical examiner spokeswoman Ellen Borakove said an autopsy revealed the cause of death was homicide .
The identity of the body has not been released .
An elevator operator who worked in the building is under surveillance , police sources and published reports said .
The Post reports the man has a history of criminal behavior , including attacking a girlfriend 's car with a bowling ball .
Police had been searching landfills in Western Pennsylvania trying to find her body Friday night , but when the search turned up no results they relaunched a search of the building .
Rodriguez was last seen going into work .
She had punched in for work around 5 p.m .
She donned her blue uniform , chatted with other after - hours employees and was last seen on security cameras around 7 p.m. , according to a lawyer for her family , Daniel Ferreira .
Then , she disappeared .
Police will continue to search the landfills and relaunch a top - to - bottom search of the building where she disappeared .
The leading theory is that she was killed -- probably strangled -- on the 8th floor of the building where her hair clips and mop were discovered , said a law enforcement source .
Then , sources theorize , the killer stuffed her inside a garbage bag which was collected with the rest of the building 's garbage about 9:30 p.m .
Police have already questioned two men , but have released them both without charges .
One of the men reportedly harassed Rodriguez .
Family said she had complained about the man -- saying he watched her while she worked .
" She had been complaining about a guy at the building who made her kind of nervous , " Ferreira said .
" And she worked on floors that had been empty . "
The woman 's family is distraught and fears the worst , Ferreira said .
Rodriguez is married with several children .
One of her brothers is Victor Martinez , a top - ranked professional bodybuilder .
Police quietly sealed off the building Wednesday morning to hunt for clues .
They found no trace of the missing woman .
Workers were finally allowed back in shortly before noon .
" It 's a mind blower .
How do you go missing here ? " said Rob Ross , an executive assistant in the studio of architect Daniel Libeskind , who moved to the tower after getting the commission to redesign ground zero .
Security in the building is typical for the financial district .
Employees need identification cards to enter .
Security cameras cover every entrance and many public areas .
Every visitor is photographed before they are allowed up from the lobby .
Officials at the company that operates the building , Stellar Management , declined to comment .
Built in 1909 , the skyscraper has more than 400,000 square feet of interior space and rises 26 stories .
Besides Studio Daniel Libeskind , the building 's tenants include the architectural firm NBBJ , several law firms and , until recently , a division of the city 's transportation department .
Summary : Antitrust exhibit shows Microsoft ’s fear of GNU / Linux and StarOffice
THANKS to generous help from our reader wallclimber , we finally have a text version of valuable antitrust exhibits .
She has more coming .
Today ’s exclusive leak is Exhibit px08604 ( 2002 ) [ PDF ] , which shows Microsoft discussing the threat from GNU / Linux on the desktop and addressing this threat using FUD .
This whole exhibit may as well be known as “ Microsoft ’s Linux FUD presentation . ”
Bill Veghte and Brian Valentine ( from Windows ) are among the senior recipients of these instructions on how to ridicule GNU / Linux in public .
Here are a few highlights from the full text which is appended at the bottom .
Microsoft is quote - mining Red Hat in order to make it seem like GNU / Linux does not believe in itself .
For example :
“ I hope to see continued work on interoperability and integration between the various Linux desktop components Mozilla , OpenOffice , GNOME , and KDE Unifying the MIME subsystem is one task that Red Hat ca n’t take on alone , but we are actively working with community developers to find a solution … ” - Red Hat Corp Developer
Further down it also shows :
* WindowsXP has 35 + % lower TCO than Linux ( using Gartner model .
In study of 2 Finnish city governments )
Look back at the Microsoft - Gartner deal and accompanying antitrust exhibits .
Microsoft and Gartner invented a yardstick ( TCO ) with which to attack GNU / Linux based on perceived cost .
The term “ Cost of Ownership ” is repeated almost endlessly in this presentation , which is funny because it was more or less manufactured by Microsoft to favour Microsoft .
Microsoft and Gartner used these methods not so long ago to intercept GNU / Linux migrations across Europe . █

Subject : I a little concerned – Research Board desktop content Importance : High Per the meeting yesterday , I ’ve worked up a couple of slides for the desktop that are fairly hard hitting .
( attached ) .
My concern : on the desktop side , we ’ve been operating at about DefCon 2 ( to use a politically incorrect , national defense analogy ) because we do n’t think customers or partners and the overall business situation yet calls for a more public or proactive comparison on the desktop .
I think the RB could implicitly push us up to DefCon 4 and I want to make sure we ’ve considered the implications .
My assumption :
* the RB will use the slides in their analysis
* the content will become public at some point
* we will need to publicize the studies that underly the content – the eTesting Labs studies , etc .
Much of the content is available today for field / reactive use only .
We ’ll need the web sites , etc to organize and explain this in a way that is n’t alienating to customers and partners .
* we need to explain why we ’re being so public and proactive at this time .
My concern is that we ’re not ready to do the above yet , both operationally ( ie the web sites , the PR plans ) , nor have we said the customer environment is ready for this .
Options :
1. refute my assumptions ( please ! )
2. continue POR and get ready to react as quickly as possible – we have a month before the actual RB visits and when this would likely become public
3. water down the desktop content and risk that the RB wo n’t fully consider all the issues .
Net is , we have more to lose on the desktop and I want to make sure we ’ve thought through the issues .
Thx ,

Interview : Havoc Pennington
Systems Developer , Desktop / UI Tech Lead at RedHat http://www.redhat.com/advise/ask.html
“ Q : What advances in Linux desktop technology can we expect to see in future releases ?
A : Printing and multimedia are big areas that we want to tackle .
And we want to be looking at improving the security and manageability of Linux desktops — meeting the needs of administrators who are looking after a few hundred ( or a few thousand ) client workstations .
I hope to see continued work on interoperability and integration between the various Linux desktop components .
Mozilla , OpenOffice , GNOME , and KDE Unifying the MIME subsystem is one task that Red Hat ca n’t take on alone , but we are actively working with community developers to find a solution .
There should be one place to configure the applications and plugins for a given file type . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Mexican salamanders who can re-grow amputated legs are not pulling off quite as big a biological trick as scientists had first thought , which may help doctors trying to regenerate human limbs .
A salamander swims in an aquarium at Mexico City 's National Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) laboratory June 10 , 2009 .

The little buds that eventually produce a brand - new leg have not completely reverted to an embryo - like stage , the researchers reported in the journal Nature .
Instead , they seem to form a new leg from cells that partly remember how to make bone , muscle , or nerve tissue , Elly Tanaka of the Center for Regenerative Therapies in Dresden , Germany , and colleagues reported .
However , how the little animals called axolotls or water monsters do this is still a mystery .
“ How this is achieved in the salamander and why it does not occur in mammals remains an important question , ” the researchers wrote .
“ It gives you more hope for being able to someday regenerate individual tissues in people , ” Malcolm Maden of the University of Florida , who worked on the study , said in a statement .
“ If you can understand how they regenerate , then you ought to be able to understand why mammals do n’t regenerate . ”
All animals can regenerate to some degree .
A human fingertip can sometimes grow back and cuts often heal with minimal scarring .
In salamanders , the blood vessels contract quickly and limit bleeding when a limb is cut .
Skin cells quickly cover the wound and form what is called a blastema .
Researchers thought these cells must be pluripotent stem cells -- the body ’s master cells , which retain the ability to start growing into any kind of cell in the body .
These cells are found in days - old embryos , but quickly differentiate -- becoming the various cell types from muscle to nerve to skin or blood .
Tanaka ’s team found the blastema is not full of embryonic - like stem cells , but something slightly more mature .
“ It is likely that cells at the amputation plane are indeed undergoing reprogramming events that allow them to re-enter embryonic programs of tissue formation , even if they do not revert back to the earliest pluripotent state , ” they wrote .
But each cell in the blastema does not have the power to grow bone , muscle and nerve .
Instead , there appear to be small groups of predestined cells , the researchers found .
And at least some of the new tissue seems to come from ordinary skin .
It may be possible to replicate this some day in other animals and eventually people , researchers said .
“ Nonetheless , the adult salamander tissue uniquely generates these blastema cells to reconstitute an entire limb after amputation , a property that other systems do not have , ” the researchers noted .

… goes to ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie , who says :
I do not wish to defend every action of the News International empire , but Rupert Murdoch has been an overwhelming force for good in this country ’s life and politics .
Sky Sports has revolutionised English football .
…
Compared to the increasingly isolationist Daily Mail – which has consistently appeased foreign dictators since the 1930s – there is also something bracingly internationalist about News International .
That is so cringingly bad I think it deserves its own prize .
If Rupert Murdoch does not give Montgomerie a job or at least invests in CH then I shall be sorely disappointed .
It is funny though , that when Tories get caught in compromising positions then they scream revenge but when its the opposition doing it when they scream ‘ whataboutery ’ .
This takes arse - licking to a whole new level .
Hey , who cares about your phone being “ blagged ” , look at least you get footy on Sky Sports !
The five most ( potentially ) intriguing names on the MLB trade market
With the All - Star break quickly approaching , many MLB teams are trying to figure out whether or not they ’ll be buyers or sellers later this month .
It ’s a tricky game front offices must play , because they do n’t want to alienate their fans by suggesting that their club is already out of contention with half the season left to go , but teams also do n’t want to miss out on adding a piece for the future because they ’re hanging onto a veteran that wo n’t play a significant role down the line .
That said , I ’ve compiled a ranking of the five most intriguing names that either are on the trade market , or could be .
Granted , every player outside of guys named Pujols , Jeter and Howard could potentially be on the trade market , but I tried to keep the list to only those names that continue to pop up in the weekly rumor mill , whether their teams have officially those names as available or not .
Two names you wo n’t find on the list are Dan Haren and Jake Peavy , even though they have been brought up in various trade rumors .
The Diamondbacks are n’t going to trade Haren unless some team offers a ridiculous package ( as in multiple top prospects ) and Peavy ’s injury situation has all but killed his trade value .
I would be shocked if either player gets dealt this season .
1. Matt Holliday , OF , A’s
Even though he has n’t exactly set the league ablaze with his bat so far this season , Holliday is still an easy choice for No. 1 on this list .
He becomes a free agent at the end of this season and while the A’s are n’t going to give him up for a copy of Jose Canseco ’s book , they ’d certainly like to get something for him before he walks at the end of the year .
Holliday would probably be most successful moving back to the NL since he ’s struggled a bit since joining Oakland , so teams like the Cardinals and Giants ( two clubs desperate for bats and willing to part with prospects ) would be ideal fits .
At 29 , he still has years of production left in him and he ’s the best pure hitter available on the market .
2. Jermaine Dye , OF , White Sox
The Sox are one of those teams that are still trying to figure out if they ’re going to be buyers or sellers .
They ’re currently just three games back of the Tigers in the AL Central and it would n’t make sense to trade away one of their best hitters if a postseason berth is in sight .
But just three weeks ago , the Sox were in the midst of a funk and rumor had it that they were considering dealing Dye , Octavio Dotel and even Bobby Jenks for prospects .
If Chicago comes back from the All - Star break and starts slumping again , it might be difficult for GM Kenny Williams to pass on the opportunity to build for the future by trading the 35 - year old Dye to a potential contender desperate for offense like the Giants .
The problem is that Dye has a limited no - trade clause in his contract for the next two seasons and would have to waive that in order to join another club .
Would he be willing to waive his no - trade clause to join a contender ?
Or will he stick with the Sox hoping that in the end , they ’ll be a contender themselves .
Time will tell .
3. Yunel Escobar , SS , Braves
Truth be told , Escobar intrigues me more than Holliday and Dye because of his youth ( he ’s only 26 ) .
But I just do n’t know how likely it is that the Braves would deal him , even though his name surfaced in this trade rumor earlier this week .
Outside of getting a couple chances to pinch hit , Escobar has rode the pine the past five games .
Granted , that ’s mostly due to a hip injury , but the Braves are rumored to be willing to give Escobar up for a good hitter because they ’ve grown increasingly frustrated by his immaturity .
He had an incident last week where he pointed to the press box and mouthed an expletive after the official scorer charged with him an error during a game against the Yankees .
So if the Braves do n’t want him , why would anyone else ?
Because the kid can hit a little ( he ’s batting .293 with seven home runs and 40 RBI ) and he plays a premium position ( shortstop ) .
If Atlanta were willing to take a little less to ship him out of town , Escobar would be intriguing to a team like the Red Sox , who desperately want a shortstop .
4. George Sherrill , RP , Orioles
With the O ’s currently residing in the basement of the AL East , they ’re debating whether or not to make Sherrill ( who is garnering a lot of attention ) available .
The Marlins are reportedly interested and they would surely have the prospects to help Baltimore build towards the future .
The problem is that they do n’t currently have a replacement for Sherrill and they ’re not going to give him up for cheap .
He currently owns a 2.51 ERA and has 17 saves on the year .
He ’s also under team control through 2011 and has been fantastic in his last couple outings .
He would definitely bolster a contender ’s bullpen , although once again , he might command a steep package seeing as though Baltimore is n’t desperate to move him .
5. Garrett Atkins , 3B , Rockies / Nick Johnson , 1B , Nationals
I could n’t decide between these two because they both play corner infield positions and each bring something different to the table offensively .
Atkins was facing a possible demotion to Triple - A in early June , but is starting to see some regular at bats again .
Considering he ’s only hitting .224 , why would Colorado be putting him back in the lineup when Ian Stewart has already belted 14 home runs this season ?
One theory is that the Rox want to boost Atkins ’ trade value and the only way to do that is by playing him .
Colorado is in desperate need of bullpen help and would love to add a reliever so they can continue to push for the NL Wild Card .
If they can get Atkins hot , they can deal him for the bullpen help they sorely need .
One team that has already been mentioned as a possible suitor is the Red Sox , who just placed Mike Lowell on the DL .
Johnson is a middle - of - the - order bat , although he has n’t been hitting the long ball much this season .
He is , however , batting .295 with 20 extra base hits .
The Giants have been tied to Johnson , as they would love to add more protection for Pablo Sandoval and Bengie Molina in the order .
A super - master of miniatures Nikolay Aldunin is going to have a museum of his works in Moscow .
He was born in Tula , but after becoming popular all over the country and abroad for his fabulous works , he moved to the capital and continued creating his tiny things there .
He managed to shoe a flea , carved portraits of Russian authors on rice grains and constructed a microscopic miniature of the Eiffel Tower , and lots of other awesome things , which seem to be just impossible to make without special hi-tech equipment .
But he can do that !
Of course , Aldunin sells most of his works , but still there are some items in his collection , which he will never agree to put up to sale .
These ones are the flea and the Kalashnikov .
He has about one hundred works as for now .
Creating some of them takes him just a few hours , but making certain items takes half a year , like it was with the Kalashnikov .
He works only with a microscope , and says that all his imagination and vision is within it .
Aldunin started his art a decade ago , when he bought a microscope and decided to shoe a flea , like Levsha , a fictional character from a Russian satirical fairy - tale , who managed to do it “ 150 years ago ” .
He took the flea from a cat , and dried it .
After the flea was ready , he de-fuzzed its legs , cut the tiny claws and only then started his main work .
He shoed the dried insect and attached a saddle and a stirrup to it , all made of pure gold .
He believes that the most prominent thing he ’s ever done the T - 34 , a Soviet medium tank , 0.078 - inch length and made of 257 details , the contraction is placed on an apple seed and is a exact copy of the real tank .
He also has a camelcade in the eye of a needle and a 0.078 - inch length bike .
This works proves to be time - consuming not only when it comes to creating things , but also when you ’re getting the instruments ready for it .
Aldunin spends long hours on sharpening his special tiny tools .
One flea - shoe made by Aldunin weights 0.00000004419 grams , so if you have just one gram of gold , you get 11,314,772 pairs of these insect footwear , not a very expensive thing , really .
So , if you want your cats and dogs have really trendy parasites , you know whom to call now .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
The United States today spends some $ 400 billion a year importing oil from countries like Saudi Arabia , Nigeria , Mexico , Russia , and Venezuela .
Think for a moment what an incredible impact that same $ 400 billion a year could have on our country if that money were invested here and not abroad , in such areas as weatherization , energy efficiency , sustainable energies like wind , solar , geothermal , biomass , public transportation and automobiles that are energy efficient or do n’t use fossil fuels at all .
What we are talking about is an energy revolution that leads us toward energy independence , the cessation of support for foreign dictatorships and the ability to avoid Mideast wars fought over oil .
What we are talking about is an energy revolution that will substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable us to address the global warming crisis that threatens our planet with increases in floods , drought , extreme weather conditions , disease and wars fought over limited natural resources .
What we are talking about is an energy revolution that will result in cleaner air , water and food and make us a healthier nation .
And , as our nation struggles to recover from the worst economic times since the Great Depression , what we also are talking about is an energy revolution that has the capability of creating millions of good - paying green jobs .
These are jobs that will occur at every level of education and for every skill set .
These are jobs for scientists , engineers , machinists , and electricians .
These are jobs for workers who weatherize older homes and buildings and save consumers substantial sums on their fuel bills .
These are jobs for factory workers who produce advanced insulation material , energy - efficient windows , improved roofing materials and LED light bulbs .
These are jobs that build , distribute , install and maintain wind turbines , photovoltaic panels , solar hot water systems , geothermal heating and cooling systems , and biomass heating systems .
These are jobs on our farms and in our forests producing biofuels and converting farm waste to electricity .
I see a future where by 2025 , we are producing a quarter or more of our electricity from clean , sustainable energy sources .
I see a revitalized American manufacturing base where instead of importing 90 percent of the batteries used in hybrid vehicles , 46 percent of solar photovoltaic cells and modules , and half of all wind turbines used in the U.S. , those product are made right here at home .
I see a future where American companies lead the world in the production of hybrid- plug in cars and electric vehicles .
I see a future where instead of creating 330 jobs to build yet another fossil - fuel power plant , we create 4,000 jobs building a solar thermal plant that has no carbon dioxide emissions and does not pollute our air because the only fuel is endlessly renewed , no -cost sunlight .
These plants , according to the Interior Department secretary , could provide up to 29 percent of the electrical needs of our country .
I see a future where by 2020 our nation follows the example of a state like Vermont , which , in the last two years , has seen electricity demand lowered because of energy efficiency efforts .
Investing in energy efficiency is cost - effective ; it saves 3 cents per kilowatt hour compared to the 14 cents it costs to generate the same amount of power .
I see a future where states compete with one another to see which can be the most efficient , and where businesses seek out efficient states in which to locate so they can reap the economic and environmental benefits for their businesses and employees .
I see a future where getting to work , or to school , or to the store does not have to cause pollution .
I see a future where plug - in hybrid cars and electric vehicles are commonplace , producing a fraction of the emissions of conventional vehicles while providing the same mobility for drivers .
I see a future where we rebuild our mass transportation and rail systems .
For every $ 1 billion we invest in public transportation , we create 30,000 jobs , save thousands of dollars a year for each commuter , and dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions .
The bad news is that if we do not act boldly to address the global warming crisis , the consequences for our planet and future generations will be dire .
The good news is that we have the knowledge and technology today , which will only improve in the future , to address that crisis .
Yes , we can dramatically cut greenhouse gas emission .
Yes , we can create an energy independent nation .
Yes , we can create millions of good paying green jobs in the process .
Let ’s do it !
URUMQI , China ( Reuters ) - Chinese police dispersed 200 people gathering outside a mosque in the Silk Road city of Kashgar , the day after ethnic riots killed 156 in the capital of the Muslim Xinjiang region , state media said on Tuesday .
Calm had settled over Urumqi , capital of western Xinjiang region , after 20,000 police , troops and firefighters reclaimed the streets from rioters who burned and smashed vehicles and shops , and clashed with security forces over Sunday night .
Over 700 people had been detained , the official Xinhua news agency reported , although local residents told Reuters police were making indiscriminate sweeps of Uighur areas .
But despite heightened security some unrest appeared to be spreading in the volatile region , where long - standing ethnic tensions periodically erupt into bloodshed .
Police dispersed around 200 people “ trying to gather ” at the Id Kah mosque in the center of Kashgar city on Monday evening , the day after the Urumqi rioting , Xinhua said .
Kashgar is in the far west of Xinjiang .
The report did not say if police used force , but said checkpoints had been set up at crossroads between Kashgar airport and downtown .
Police also had “ clues ” about efforts to organize unrest in Aksu city and Yili prefecture , the latter a border region that was racked by unrest in the late 1990s , Xinhua said .
Along with Tibet , Xinjiang is one of the most politically sensitive regions in China and in both places the government has sought to maintain its grip by controlling religious and cultural life while promising economic growth and prosperity .
But minorities have long complained that Han Chinese reap most of the benefits from official investment and subsidies , while making locals feel like outsiders in their own homes .
Almost half of Xinjiang ’s 20 million people are Uighurs , while the population of Urumqi , which lies 3,270 km ( 2,050 miles ) west of Beijing , is mostly Han Chinese .
Chinese officials have already blamed the unrest on separatist groups abroad , who it says want to create an independent homeland for the Muslim Uighur minority .
A Xinjiang public security spokesman told Xinhua that people outside China used telephones to “ direct mobs in Xinjiang to stage the violence , ” and said calls for protests were posted Saturday evening on Internet forums by sympathizers .
Last year , Beijing also blamed unrest across Tibetan areas on a “ clique ” led by the exiled Dalai Lama .
But exile groups deny organizing the violence and say it was an outpouring of pent - up anger over government policies and Han Chinese economic dominance .
In Washington , the White House said it was concerned about the deaths but it would be premature to speculate on the circumstances .
“ We call on all in Xinjiang to exercise restraint , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
CHASM BETWEEN SIDES
Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese residents of Urumqi gave accounts of bloodshed that are likely to deepen the chasm between the two sides .
Slideshow ( 33 images )
Uighur residents , speaking softly in alleyways away from patrolling police and troops , complained about the growing Han Chinese presence .
Some said many of those arrested were youths caught up in indiscriminate police sweeps of the rundown concrete apartments where many Uighurs live .
“ They ’ve been taking away all the young people , going into our homes and taking them away , ” said Amina , a middle - aged woman in a Muslim headscarf sitting on the steps of a mosque .
She said her own son had been taken but did not want to give his name .
“ They do n’t care who they take , as long as you ’re between 17 and 20 and they do n’t like the look of you , ” she said as her neighbors shook their heads and clucked in sympathy .
Nearly all Uighurs traced the protests on Sunday back to their own anger over a confrontation in far southern China in late June , when Han Chinese fought Uighurs working in a factory in Shaoguan , leaving two Uighurs dead , after a false allegation that some of them had raped a Han Chinese woman .
Slideshow ( 33 images )
The government said two Uighurs died in that clash .
But many Uighur residents of Urumqi said they were sure that many more died at the factory , and gave vivid accounts of how 20 , 50 or a 100 of the workers were killed in their sleep -- stabbed , strangled or poisoned .
And some said a Uighur woman was raped .
There is no independent evidence to support those claims , but Uighur residents said they were angry the details of the factory clash were not more fully aired by the government .
“ We know that 100 workers were killed , ” said a young Uighur , who gave his name as Memet .
“ Now who cares about their deaths ?
Why all these police for us , but nothing when they died ? ”
Han Chinese residents said the toll from the riots was likely to rise and their deepened fears of the Uighurs were unlikely to abate .
Chen , a driver , said his wife who shares driving duties with him had suffered a badly cut eye when a Uighur youth attacked their car , and now she was afraid to venture far from home .
“ Why does n’t the United States classify them as terrorists ? , ” said Chen , who would not give his full name .
“ What they did to us is terrorism , is n’t it ? ”
He said the rioters appeared to be mostly Uighur men in their twenties , many of them unemployed .
Riot victims recovering in a Urumqi hospital described groups of men who targeted Han Chinese and attacked them with purposeful efficiency .
“ They did n’t really talk to you , ” said Huan Zhangzhao , with two broken ribs and a bloodied eye .
“ When they saw you , when they saw a Han person coming along , they started to attack .
When a bus came along , they started to attack . ”
斬新なファイアウォール - Palo Alto Networks
Palo Alto Networks社の方々に色々話を聞きに行く機会があったので、ユーザやアプリケーションを細かく識別するファイアウォールについて聞いてきました。
" It 's time to fix the firewalls " と言っているぐらいで、結構面白い機器でした。 国単位で同様の技術を利用するとネット検閲になりますが、企業単位だと社員管理というジャンルになるんだなぁと思いました。
Palo Alto Networks社とは
Palo Alto Networks社の標語 は「 It 's time to fix the firewalls 」です。 登場して か ら20 年近く経過するファイアウォールが実は使いにくくて、全部を再設計して根本的に作り直そうという思想で作られています。
Palo Alto Networksは、イスラエ ルCheck Point Software Technologies ( Firewall - 1で有名な会社 ) で開発者をしていたNir Zuk氏によって設立されたそうです。 設立は2005年で、最初の製品が出たのが2007年とのことでした。
かなり独自性が強いファイアウォールで、一部方面では注目されているようです。
（逆に言うと、まだ全然メジャーではない）
個人的には確かに非常に面白いファイアウォールだと思いました。
ユーザ識 別
まず、最初に凄く面白いと思ったのがユーザ識別機能です。
「 ネットワーク上で誰が何をしているのか」を嫌になるほど可視化してしまってます。
今までのファイアウォールだと、IPアドレスと通信履歴が残るぐらいだったのですが、paloalto社のファイアウォールでは、Active Directoryと連携することでIPアドレスとユーザ名を自動マッピングしてしまいます。
Active Directoryには、ユーザだけではなくグループという概念もあるので、グループでのアクセス制御やログ表示も可能になっています。
Web UI でのユーザ表示は以下のような感じです。 誰が大量の通信をしているかや、各ユーザが何を使っているかが一目瞭然になってしまっています。 各ユーザ名の部分をクリックすると、そのユーザが行っている通信の詳細まで見えてしまいます。
このようにユーザ情報をIPアドレス情報とマッチングするだけではなく、利用セッション数や利用帯域でランキング的に表示されるようなUIを備えた製品は今までになかったそうです。
Active Directory だけではなく、netbios name query を利用して情報を得る機能もあるとのことでした。
Web認 証
Active Directoryによる認証はWindowsをベースとしていますが、非Windows用にWeb認証によるユーザ管理も可能だそうです。 このWeb認証は 、Web通信をTransparent Proxy的にファイアウォールの認証ページに誘導し、そこで認証が完了するまでは、そのホストの通信が全て遮断されるような設定も可能とのことでした。
アメリカのホテルで良くあるアレと同じ仕組みですね。
なお 、Web認証用にRADIUSが利用できるそうです。
アプリケーション識 別
アプリケーション識別も非常に大きな特徴の一つであるそうです。
良くあるファイアウォールでは、プロトコル番号やポート番号などからフックした通信フローに対して別途定義されているチェック用の機能を起動していくそうです。 例えば、TCP port 80番だったらウィルスチェック機能を経由するという感じです。
一方 、 Palo Alto Networksのファイアウォールは、可能性がある全てのアプリケーションの識別検査処理を全通信フローに対して適用するとの事でした。
これによって、例えばファイアウォール超えのために別ポートで通信を行ったり、プロクシ経由での通信であったとしても、通信アプリケーション識別が可能になるようです。
時代とともにファイアウォール超えの技術が色々と発展し、それによってファイアウォールを中から突破するような事例が増えたため、このような方法が必要になったのだろうと思います。
現在、様々なアプリケーションを識別できるようです。 例えばBittorentやSkypeなどのP2Pアプリケーションや、hotmailやgmailなどのWebアプリケーションも識別可能であるとのことでした。
世 界60組織に置いているモニターから「最近のアプリケーション流行」を測定し、必要なものに関しては新たにパターンを定義するという方式で認識可能なアプリケーションが増えて行きます。
日本では、京都大学にアプリケーション発見用のモニター機器があるようです。
アプリケーション識別を行うために、アプリケーションのパターンを作るための専門部署というものがあるそうです。
必要と判断されたアプリケーションシグネチャを抽出し、作成されたパターンはアップデートとして既存機器に導入可能であるとのことでした。
日本に特化したアプリケーションとしては、例えばmixiや2chやニコニコ動画が挙げられます。
中でも、2chは閲覧と投稿の可否をユーザグループ毎に設定出来るそうです。
これは企業内で「○○という部署は閲覧まで可能。××という部署は投稿も可能。△△は閲覧も投稿も禁止」というニーズが多いからだそうです。
例えば企画部門やマーケティング部門などが2chから情報を得る事はありそうなので、確かに、そのようなニーズは多そうですね。
UTM的機能色々
そもそもファイアウォールとは、どのようなものでしょうか？ wikipediaによると、ファイアウォールとは以下のような物であるようです。
ファイアーウォール（防火壁）とは、ある特定のコンピュータネットワークとその外部との通信を制御し、内部のコンピュータネットワークの安全を維持することを目的としたソフトウェア、あるいはそのソフトウェアを搭載したハードウェアである。外部から内部のコンピュータネットワークへ侵入しようとするクラッキング行為を火事にたとえ、それを食い止めるものとして防火壁という表現を用いている。
ファイアウォールの本来の意味は外からの攻撃を守る防火壁です。
そのため、外からの攻撃を守るようなイメージがありますが、Palo Alto Networks社の製品は外からの攻撃よりも中の状況に関して着目している部分が強い感じがします。
色々と説明を伺って、ファイアウォールというよりもUTM( Unified Threat Management / 統合脅威管理 ) という側面が強い気がしました。
まず、データパターンから通信をブロックすることが可能とのことでした。
例えば、外部に未発表で社外秘なプロジェクト名が通信に含まれていると、その通信を遮断し、アラートを上げるという機能があります（日本語対応は、まだしていないそうです）。
さらに、クレジットカード番号を構成するアルゴリズムを確認することによって、数字列がクレジットカード番号かどうかを確認し、クレジットカード番号であればブロックできるようです。
さらに、通信の中身を見つつ、Webフィルタリングを行う機能や、ウィルス／スパイウェアなどに対する脅威防御機能もあるようです。
これらの機能は、ストリームベースの処理によってシングルエンジンで行われているとのことでした。
シングルエンジンであるために「何かがヒットしたら別のエンジンに渡す」というような処理が発生せずに高速化が可能であり、さらにストリームベースで必要最低限のパケット情報だけをバッファするだけなので、ファイル全体をダウンロードするまで待つ事による遅延は発生しないようです。
また、例えば、ダウンロードされるファイル全体をバッファするわけではないので、同時に処理出来るセッション数も多くなるとのことでした。
コントロールプレーン、データプレーン
Palo Alto Networksのファイアウォールは、コントロールプレーンとデータプレーンが分離されており、設定や情報取得のための処理によってパケット転送等が影響されないようなハードウェア構造になっているそうです。
このような構造になっているので 、Web UI 上でリッチな表現が出来るのだろうと予想しています。
通信性能
「 こんなに色々やってスループット出るの？」というのがネットワークエンジニアとしての普通の反応だと思いますが、スループットに関してはPalo Alto Networks社の資料で以下のように記述されていました。
PA -4020 F社 J社 N社 FWカタログスペック 2 Gbps with App - ID >6 Gbps > 650 Mbps 1.5 Gbps IPS カタログスペック 2 Gbps with AV , AS , WF 3 Gbps NA NA IPS テストデータ 1.6 Gbps 624Mbps 426Mbps 156Mbps AVテストデータ 1.6Gbps( -0％ ) 524Mbps( - 16 ％ ) 157Mbps( -63 ％ ) 54Mbps(-65 ％ ) IPS+AVテストデータ 1.6 Gbps( -0％ ) 520 Mbps( - 17 ％ ) 138 Mbps(-68％ ) 33 Mbps( -79 ％ )
Palo Alto Networks社のプレゼン資料に登場する、この表ですが、実は一部注意が必要な部分があります。
この表にあるデータは、2007年時点でのNetwork Worldでの測定結果を参考にしているのですが、Network Worldの測定に はPalo Alto Networks社は入っていません。

では 、Palo Alto Networks社の発表資料に含まれるPA-4020に関する数値データはどこから来ているかというと、Network Worldの2008年のNClearChoiceレポートから来ています。

Alto 's performance holds steady as security measures increase
この記事の中に、以下のような文があります。 数値はここから来ているようですね。
Tracking performance of the Palo Alto PA - 4020
Security features enabled for each test run Maximum Throughput ( in Gigabit / sec )
IPS only 1.627
AV only 1.628
IPS and AV 1.627
IPS , AV , Content Filtering 1.628
さらに 、Network Worldの記事には以下のような文もありました。
We also found that no matter which security features we enabled or disabled , the PA - 4020 turned in the same performance : approximately 1.627 Gbps of throughput .
This included intrusion - prevention systems ( IPS ) ( both enabled and disabled ) , antivirus ( both enabled and disabled ) , and content filtering ( both enabled and disabled ) , all on top of basic firewall and network address translation .
This behavior is quite different from what we saw in all other UTM tests we 've conducted recently , where performance varied based on which services were enabled .
要は「従来のUTM製品と違って、どんな機能をONにしてもスループットは変わらない」ということのようです。
これが何でだか非常に不思議に思うというのは、誰でも一緒であるようで、Network Worldの記事には以下のような文もありました。
We contacted Palo Alto to ask why performance was the same whether security features are enabled or not and were told that this was a side effect of how their application identification code works .
According to Palo Alto representative , because an HTTP applications can " change types " in the middle of a single TCP connection , all security features on the PA04020 are running at all times on HTTP applications .
Network World がPalo Alto Networks社に問い合わせてみたら、「 TCPコネクションの途中でアプリケーションが挙動を変える事もあるため( HTTPだと思っていた通信が別の物に変身することがあるため)
、PA04020はどっちみち毎回全てのセキュリティ機能を動作させている」という回答であったようです。
「 え？？？それだけ？？？というか、毎回可能性のあるあらゆる検査をして何故性能が出るの？？？」というのが個人的には非常に疑問でした。
取材時にも結構質問したのですが「そのような前提でハードウェアを設計し直してゼロから作ったから」という回答でした。
何か最後まで半分納得出来なかったのですが、そういうものなのでしょうか？？？
ということで、2007年と2008年に別々に測定した結果であるため注意が必要ではありますが、従来製品よりも動作が速そうだと思えるデータでした。
管理画面
写真では表現できないのですが、管理画面にとにかく凝っているというイメージがあります。 管理画面 のWeb UI が表示とともに 「うにょーん」と動いてからグラフを表示したりします。
その動くのも不快でゆっくりな動き方ではなく、短いちょっとした演出程度であるのもいい感じです。
様々な切り口でデータを表現できますが、一般的な所では、例えば通信種別での表示が挙げられます。
以下の例では、例えば「 Web browsing 」とか「 dns」とか「gnutella」とか「smtp(メール ) 」という項目が表示されていますが、それらのリンクをクリックするとさらに詳細な情報が表示されていきます。
地域別表示も可能です。 どの地域から、どの地域への通信が多いのかもわかります。
PDF でのレポートを定期的に出せるという機能もあるようです。
SSL 対応
SSL 復号機能もあるようです。 SSL 通信開始時に交換される証明書をファイアウォールが自前の物に置き換えて、一度手元で暗号データを復号することによって実現されています。
このとき、クライアント側に本来のサイトの証明書情報などがあると「不正なホストへの接続」とみなされてしまいます。
警告メッセージが毎回出るのを防ぐためには、各クライアントPCにファイアウォールが発行する証明書をインストールするか、自前の認証機関を組織内で運用する必要があります。
まあ、ここら辺は企業や組織内のネットワークでの運用が前提なので、「そういうものだ」といわれれば、まあ、そういうものかな、という感じですね。
冗長化
Active / Standbyによる冗長化機能もあるようです。
2台のファイアウォール同士をイーサケーブルで接続し、両方ファイアウォールのステート(状態)を同期させて、プライマリ側が落ちたらバックアップ側が起動するという構成です。
TAP/L1/L2/L3 mode
Palo Alto Networksのファイアウォールは4つのモードで動作可能です。
個人的に面白いと思ったのがTAPモードです。
以下の図のように、ルータかスイッチでポートミラーリングを行ってタッピングだけを行えます。
このようにタッピングだけを行い、組織内に流れるトラフィックを監視するためだけに利用できます。
この利用方法は購入前の「お試し期間」中に利用される事が多いようです。
組織内を流れるトラフィックの内容を可視化して見てもらって、社長が衝撃を受けてファイアウォールを購入という流れが多いとの事でした。（笑）
まあ、ありがちなパターンですよね。
L1/L2/L3モード
完全なL1として機能するVWireモードがあります。 このVWireモードでは、ファイアウォールが単なる「物理回線」の一部のように振る舞うため、L2的にSTPやVLAN IDなどを考える必要が無いという特徴があります。
変な通信を行うと突然切断される物理回線という感じでしょうかね。
次に 、L2モードがあります。 これはL2スイッチ的に使いながらファイアウォールとしても動作するというものですね。
L3モードは一番素直で、いわゆるルータとして機能するファイアウォールです。
IPv6
IPv6も使えるようです 。 IPv4と同等の性能が出るかどうかなどの質問をしようと思っていましたが、質問するのを忘れてしまいました。
IPv6関連は、次のお楽しみにしたいと思います。
まとめ
各機能を単体として見て行くと、目立って技術的に革新的な事をしているというわけでも無さそうだとも思えます。
とはいえ、ネットワーク機器として無限にあり得る機能リストを必要最低限に抑えつつ、かつ高機能と感じさせる匙加減で実現しているようなイメージがあります。
さらに、今まで「ファイアウォール」という分野では、あまり行われていなかったような事を色々と導入していったというところに、Palo Alto Networks社のファイアウォールの凄みがあるような気がします。
いや、でも、今はまだそんなに名前を聞かないベンダーですが、メチャメチャ凄いと思いました。
これはきっとファイアウォール業界の製品トレンドや流れを変えちゃうんじゃないでしょうか？
今後、各社から、同様のファイアウォールが増えて行くのかも知れないと思いました。
取材が実現した経 緯
今回の取材は 「 えxぺ 」という試みを一緒にやっているyasuyukiさん経由で実現しました。 yasuyukiさん に「 Palo Alto Networksさんは凄いよ」と教えて頂き、" えx ぺ " としてコンタクトして、まずは内容を伺うために取材をしました。
最初に説明した時には 「何でそんな事をしたいのですか？」的な反応を頂きましたが、「面白いと思う話を発見して、それを共有したいんです！」という感じで説明しました。
次は、えxぺでの無料講演をお願いしようとしています。
恐らく7月後半になると思います。 デモ等を見ると結構面白いので、お楽しみに！
なお、念のため明記しておきますが、お金や物品を受け取っているわけではありません。
純粋に興味があって、飛び込みでPalo Alto Networksさんにお願いしてみています。

If the thesis behind this web site is correct , something called Modern Perl or Enlightened Perl exists .
It 's definable .
A well - socialized member of the Perl community can look at a piece of code and say " That 's modern ! " or " That 's not modern ! "
Code has an aroma ; we speak of code smells as antipatterns .
Good Perl 5 code written in 2009 has identifiable characteristics which distinguish it from bad code written in 2009 or mediocre code written in 2004 or decent code written in 1999 .
Many of those differences are subtle .
Some come from Perl Best Practices .
Some do n't .
It 's interesting to me to consider some of the changes in the Perl community and in Perl 5 itself which contribute to the new Perl 5 renaissance .
This list is obviously subjective and perhaps incomplete in places , but I see these events as particular watersheds .
I may have missed a few spots along the road ; feel free to fill in any gaps you see .
I 've deliberately left off most of the events of the past several months .
Time will let us judge their efficacy and their legacies .
The ambitious title , initially released in 1996 , laid the groundwork for future Elder Scrolls games .
Taking place in the familiar world of Tamriel , Daggerfall allows players to complete quests at their own pace , exploring a landmass that has still yet to be equaled in size by any modern Elder Scrolls title .
As the game has not been modified in any way , and is not automatically emulated by Windows , it will require a DOS emulator such as DOSBox to run .
Bethesda has helpfully written instructions to get DOSBox newcomers up and running .
Click through for Bethesda 's installation instructions :
1 ) The first step is to install DOSBox .
Launch its setup program and install with default options .
2 ) After DOSBox is installed , navigate to its entry in the Start Menu ( DOSBox - 0.73 ) and then select " Configuration , " and then " Edit Configuration . "
If you have used DOSBox before , it may be best to run " Reset Configuration " first before running " Edit Configuration . "
3 ) This will open up Notepad with the config file displayed .
Look for the section [ dosbox ] .
In this section will be a setting " memsize=xx . "
Change the value of xx to 32 ( i.e. memsize=32 ) and then save and close the file .
4 ) The next step is to extract Daggerfall from the archive .
The archive is a zip file named " DFInstall.zip . "
Using a zip program such as Winzip or Winrar , open the archive and choose to Extract .
You want to extract the entire contents of the zip file to a directory on your C : , such as C:dosgames .
So , when you chose Extract , the program will ask for a path , enter C:dosgames .
This will create the folders C:dosgamesDFCD and C:dosgamesDAGGER .
5 ) Once the archive extraction is completed , DOSBox must be launched to start the installation process .
Use the DOSBox icon on your desktop or the entry in the Start Menu to launch it .
6 ) Once launched , you will be presented with a window containing a command prompt ( Z : > ) .
7 ) As DOSBox is a virtual environment , the locations to work with must be mounted within the virtual environment .
First , you must mount the location that contains Daggerfall 's files to a virtual C : within DOSBox .
8 ) To do this , type this line in at the command prompt : mount c c:dosgames - freesize 1000 .
Press enter to process the command .
This will map C:dosgames to virtual C : .
9 ) Next , you must emulate the Daggerfall CD - ROM for the installation and running of the game .
10 ) To this , type this line in at the command prompt : mount d c:dosgamesdfcd -t cdrom - label Daggerfall .
Press Enter to process the command .
This will map the files in C: dosgamesdfcd to to virtual D : , which is acting like a CD - ROM with the volume label of Daggerfall ( needed to run the game ) .
11 ) Once the two locations are mounted , at the command prompt type : D : , then push enter and the prompt will change to D : >.
12 ) Next , type : INSTALL .
Press Enter and the Daggerfall installation program will launch .
At this point you can move your actual mouse pointer into the DOSBox window and click once .
Mouse control will be handed off to DB and will work within the Daggerfall installer to select items .
13 ) Now , agree to the terms and then select " Install the Game to Your Hard Drive . "
Then select " Change the Install Size " and set it to " Huge . "
Next select " Yes , This Install Size is Fine . "
The installer will suggest C: Dagger as the installation directory .
Install the game to that location .
Select " Yes , I want to install the game here . "
Following this , confirm the choices by selecting " Go ahead and install the game . "
The install will begin .
14 ) After installation , Daggerfall will offer to configure the sound card .
At this point it is important that DOSBox be running in windowed mode and not full screen .
If DOSBox is in full screen , hit ALT +
Enter on the keyboard to place it back into windowed mode before choosing to configure the sound card .
15 ) Choose " Yes " to configure the sound card .
Another program will appear .
There is no mouse support in this program so the keyboard arrow keys and the Enter key will need to be used .
16 ) Press Enter while " Auto - Detect " is highlighted .
Next , press Enter while " Detect " is highlighted .
This will detect an emulated Sound Blaster 16 .
Navigate over to " OK " and press Enter .
17 ) Navigate down to " Select MIDI " and press Enter .
Select " Sound Blaster 16 " from the list and press Enter .
Press Enter again to select the default Port of " 388 . "
Navigate to " OK " and press Enter .
18 ) Navigate down to " OK " on the menu and press Enter twice .
This will save the config and return you to Daggerfall 's installer .
Select OK and the installer will exit and drop you off at C:DAGGER .
19 ) At the command prompt , type : DAG213 .
Press Enter .
This will launch the patch to update the game to 1.07.213 .
Answer " YES " to both prompts when the patch asks for confirmation .
20 ) Once the patch is done , the game may be started .
At the C: DAGGER > prompt , type : DAGGER .
Press Enter .
Daggerfall should now load .
21 ) Each time you want to run Daggerfall , you will need to start DOS - Box and enter these commands :
mount c c:dosgames - freesize 1000
mount d c:dosgamesdfcd -t cdrom - label Daggerfall
c :
cddagger
dagger
Each of the above commands is followed by a press of the Enter key .
As Congress prepares to adjourn for the August recess , health care reform enters into dangerous territory .
Does it feel like Obama and supporters of reform keep answering the same questions over and over ?
It should … because the current opposition strategy is to continue to ask the same questions , make the same accusations , and claim that no response has been provided to their concerns…even thought it repeatedly and thoroughly HAS .
And …it ’s going to get worse for two reasons :
1 ) Going into the recess , the senators and representatives , both Republican and Democrat , who have received the most money from the health care and insurance industries ( because they are in positions to affect health care legislation ) are trying to “ compromise out ” many of the important REFORM elements of the bill , to appease their corporate overlords .
2 ) The Republicans are spending MILLIONS over the break to engage in an all - out media / advertising BLITZ to attempt to make Americans afraid of changes to the health care system .
The ads will , of course , focus on three different fearmongering strategies : fear of paying more money , fear of government “ takeover , ” and fear of dying due to poor treatment .
As of today , here are where the battle lines are drawn :
I have said on previous occasions , I do not know why people defend a system that takes so much of their money and provides such poor service .
The truth of the matter is , Medicare and Veteran ’s Affairs BOTH provide health coverage that is consistently better rated in terms of customer satisfaction that ANY PRIVATE COMPANY ’S services ( more on that further down ) .
Have you heard of the practice of “ rescission , ” as used by the private insurance companies ?
This COMMON practice has resulted in personal horror stories for countless Americans .
The short version :
You fill out a lengthy and complicated insurance application … you pay your premiums for many moons … you get sick … you should be covered ….
the insurance company pulls out your application , reviews it , and sometimes even has its own private investigators do some digging .
If ANYTHING , that is any tiny little thing , on the form is incorrect … they refuse reimbursement and drop you from the plan .
Seeing as the form is DESIGNED so that it is easy for the average person to make a mistake … the insurance companies often find the “ errors ” they are looking for .
Forgot to put down that you have seasonal allergies because you thought it was n’t worth mentioning … you can quit paying your premiums right now because you are just throwing money away , and if push comes to shove you will be dropped .
Forgot to tell them about the cyst you had removed ?
Maybe you misreported your weight ?
You could well wind up falling victim to rescission .
The insurance company will call it “ fraud . ”
It is fraud … but they ’re the one ’s committing it .
More horror stories and underhanded techniques HERE .

You notice the “ we have to defeat this legislation so we can beat Obama ” rhetoric has died down ?
Even some Republicans have started to realize that their vocal willingness to “ beat ” health care reform just to take down Obama looks like petty , partisan obstructionism to most Americans .
When he was read aloud Senator DeMint ’s ( R - SC ) statements on the issue ( ie . “ This health care issue Is D - Day for freedom in America … If we ’re able to stop Obama on this it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him . “ ) and Senator James Inhofe ’s remarks ( ie . “ I just hope the President keeps talking about it , keeps trying to rush it through .
We can stall it .
And that ’s going to be a huge gain for those of us who want to turn this thing over in the 2010 election . “ ) , Senator Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) had this to say : “ I do n’t agree with that kind of language …
I do think that because the language has a political implication , it ’s unfortunate … “
“ ) and Senator James Inhofe ’s remarks ( ie . “ “ ) , Senator Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) had this to say : “ “ We discovered last week that Democrats in very powerful positions related to the health care debate have received huge amounts from the health care and insurance industries .
It should come as no surprise that Senator Baucus of the Senate Finance Committee was the TOP recipient of money from the industry … Rangel of the House Ways and Means Committee also received a lot of contributions .
And the “ Blue Dog ” Democrats have also been rewarded for their stubborn “ indecision ” over the bill with considerable monetary support from health care companies .
Of course …
Republicans have their hands out , too : Monday , the top Republican legislators involved in health care hosted their own “ Roundtable on Healthcare Issues “ … and charged $ 2000 a head for dinner , $ 5000 to have dinner and attend the roundtable .
Of course , when reporters attempted to attend the event to view the flagrant lobbying that would doubtlessly take place … they were told the event was “ closed . “
Many health care lobbyists , CEO’s , and representatives from other health - related special interests were in attendance … lobbyists representing the 30 million uninsured people in America : not so much .

Would you believe that THAT is exactly what the insurance companies would prefer ?
That is to say , they would prefer any plan that did n’t risk someone coming along and charging you less while providing better service … they just could n’t live with that .
I mean , they might have to charge less , provide better service , and even…oh God , no …sacrifice some of the multi-billion dollar annual profits that come from denying claims , rejecting people with pre-existing conditions , and dropping sick people ’s coverage .

ANOTHER SHOCKER : Blue Dog Democrat Dan Boren of Oklahoma has some issues with the “ public option ” which he admitted might be offered at a lower cost : “ The problem , is in a state like Oklahoma , where we have a lot of private insurers , you have a public option come in and it drives everything else out and the only thing left is the public option and then you have rationed care .
“ Two problems with this statement …
ONE : Boren is openly admitting that he is looking after the interests of the private insurers , because he ’d hate for them to have to compete with a plan that could wind up being cheaper and , perhaps , better …and TWO : The Congressional Budget Office has released its report , that should have put an end to the “ private insurance companies will all collapse and all that will be left is government health care ” scare tactic .
The report clearly shows that private insurance companies would not be driven out of business by a “ public option ” being offered .
Of course … this disagrees with the GOP study performed by a research group OWNED by a large health care company … which is a bit of like when they allowed cigarette companies to do the research on whether or not cigarettes were addictive and dangerous .

At the end of the day : Democrats are pushing back to make sure that too much is n’t conceded to Republicans ( who wo n’t vote for the bill no matter what compromises are made ) and politicians serving private health care interests to the detriment of the American people .
Also … there ’s progress : 4 of the 7 Blue Dog Democrats claim to have “ made peace ” with House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman of California , and Representative Mike Ross ( D - AR ) head of the Blue Dogs health care task force , stated that the agreement they reached “ cuts the cost of the bill significantly by over $ 100 billion .
It protects small businesses and it saves our rural hospitals and ensures that if there is a public option , it will be just that .
It will be an option providing consumers more choices .
It will not be mandated on anyone .
And it now will clearly be on a level playing field .
“ The members of the House will not vote on the bill , but will “ take it home ” over the recess to read and to present to their constituents .

President Obama is making the rounds in an attempt to dismiss certain attacks against the program .
In a town hall meeting with AARP , he was forced to address the same questions he has repeatedly answered about what is in the plan…and NOT in the plan .
Here ’s a clip …my favorite part is near the end where he tells the story of the letter he was sent from a woman who said , “ I do n’t want government - run health care … I do n’t want socialized medicine …and DON ’T TOUCH MY MEDICARE ! “
Speaking of Medicare :
It is curious that opponents to the reform plan like to say that “ the government ca n’t run anything right , ” or , “ do you really trust the government with your health ? “
They seem to forget that the government has run Medicare for years , and offers medical care and coverage to all veterans through Veterans Affairs .
And you know what ?
BOTH those program rate higher in customer / client satisfaction than ANY of the the members of the private health care industry .
Of course , conservative pundit Bill Kristol agrees that both these programs provide top notch care … but he takes the novel position that most Americans DON ’T DESERVE IT :
During the recess , I ’ll probably have to devote some time to addressing claims in some of the extreme ad campaigns that are sure to arise both in favor and opposed to the current plan .
Other than that …I ’ll try to focus on other topics as much as possible until Congress is back in session and addressing this issue once more .
Aora -Solar , an Israeli company , has constructed , licensed and launched the first solar thermal energy ( STE ) natural gas hybrid electric generator ( June 2009 ) .
At the time of this post , it is being tested in Kibbutz Samar in southern Israel .
Such hybrids can lower the carbon footprint of existing natural gas power plants .
The Israeli design is modular and permits small plants that can serve communities without long distance line losses .
Florida Power and Light is scheduled to launch their first hybrid in 2010 .
As I discussed in a previous post , electricity can be generated by high temperature or concentrated solar power ( Solar Thermal : The Other Solar Energy ) .
Basically , solar rays are concentrated and directed to a heat collector that transfers their heat to a heat engine ( usually a closed circuit steam engine ) that drives an electric generator .
Several schemes have been used to concentrate the sun ’s rays .
Curved mirrors or lenses or an array of plane ( flat ) mirrors direct the rays toward a collector .
Each scheme has particular advantages and disadvantages .
Aora - Solar design uses an array of plane mirrors on motor driven platforms .
These “ heliostats ” must steer their reflected beams onto the collector located on a thirty - meter high “ power tower . ”
Once this would have been a formidable task , but modern microcomputers have simplified it .
The power tower then provides heat to supplement natural gas used by an existing power plant .
One of the most popular STE schemes is to use mirrors having a parabolic curvature in one dimension and are long “ troughs ” in the other .
These mirrors focus the sun ’s rays on a tube that runs the length of the trough .
A fluid flowing through this tube carries the heat to the heat engine .
In this scheme the troughs are aligned parallel to the sun ’s daily path across the sky so that the rays are always focused on the tube .
The mirrors do need to be adjusted to accommodate seasonal changes , but these are slow and easily programmable .
Florida Power and Light uses troughs in its hybrid .
The advantage of troughs is that they can be combined to build almost unlimited “ solar thermal farms . ”
Their main disadvantages are that they produce lower temperature outputs and must be installed on flat terrain .
Typically , troughs produce about 600 C compared to 1000 C + for power towers .
Heat engines are more efficient when provided with higher input temperatures .
The economics of the Israeli design it exciting .
Natural gas plants are run as “ peaker plants . ”
That is , they only go online to provide surges of power when there is a sudden high demand for electricity .
Peaker plants are necessary to maintain the grid , but their infrequent use makes for expensive electricity .
Not only must the resulting electric power pay for fuel in such plants , but also it must pay for capital investment and the plant ’s standby workforce .
Hybridization of existing peakers can make them into base - load plants with peaking capability by taking advantage of unused capacity .
Natural gas would only be used for peaking .
Eventually , biofuels could replace natural gas .
The Aora -Solar power tower design allows existing plants to be retrofitted with 100KW modules .
Power towers can be installed on rough terrain .
These power towers ’ high temperature output permits driving natural gas plants directly without need for any fuel assist .
The flexibility of the Israeli design permits small community to tap into solar power while avoiding power wire loss from large distant generators .
These modules can be installed quickly and economically on almost any terrain .
Aora -Solar is negotiating with power companies in Jordan and Australia .

As I mentioned last week , I ’ve recently returned from Australia .
While I was there , I visited a eucalyptus forest that , in February , was the scene of an appalling wildfire .
Perhaps naively , I had expected to find that many trees had been killed .
They had n’t .
They had blackened bark , but were otherwise looking rather well , many of them wreathed in new young leaves .
This prompted me to consider fire and the role it plays as a force of nature .
Fossil charcoals tell us that wildfires have been part of life on Earth for as long as there have been plants on land .
That ’s more than 400 million years of fire .
Fire was here long before arriviste plants like grasses ; it pre-dated the first flowers .
And without wanting to get mystical about it , fire is , in many respects , a kind of animal , albeit an ethereal one .
Like any animal , it consumes oxygen .
Like a sheep or a slug , it eats plants .
But unlike a normal animal , it ’s a shape - shifter .
Sometimes , it merely nibbles a few leaves ; sometimes it kills grown trees .
Sometimes it is more deadly and destructive than a swarm of locusts .

The shape - shifting nature of fire makes it hard to study , for it is not a single entity .
Some fires are infernally hot ; others , relatively cool .
Some stay at ground level ; others climb trees .
Moreover , fire is much more likely to appear in some parts of the world than in others .
Satellite images of the Earth show that wildfires are rare in , say , northern Europe , and common in parts of central Africa and Australia .
( These days many wildfires are started by humans , either on purpose or by accident .
But long before our ancestors began to throw torches or cigarette butts , fires were started by lightning strikes , or by sparks given off when rocks rub together in an avalanche . )
Once a fire gets started , many factors contribute to how it will behave .
The weather obviously has a huge effect : winds can fan flames , rains can quench them .
The lie of the land matters , too : fire runs uphill more readily than it goes down .
But another crucial factor is what type of plants the fire has to eat .
It ’s common knowledge that plants regularly exposed to fire tend to have features that help them cope with it — such as thick bark , or seeds that only grow after being exposed to intense heat or smoke .
But what is less often remarked on is that the plants themselves affect the nature and severity of fire .
For example , dead branches burn more readily than living branches , so a tree that keeps dead branches ( rather than letting them fall ) makes it easier for a fire to climb into a forest canopy : the dead branches provide a ladder for the fire .
Deadwood also allows fires to get hotter .
Leaves that are high in cellulose , or that contain oils , also stoke the flames .
Resins and gums are highly flammable .
And as any girl scout knows , twigs catch light more readily than branches , so a twiggy sort of plant can catch fire more readily than its non-twiggy sister .
Olivia Judson
But here ’s the odd thing .
Many plants that live in places prone to fire are highly flammable — more flammable than plants that live elsewhere .
This has led some to speculate that these plants have actually evolved to cause fires : that they “ want ” fire , and have evolved features that make it more likely that a spark will become a flame , and a flame will become a fire .
I call this the torch - me hypothesis .
The argument goes like this .
Many plants depend on fire for their propagation .
Indeed , without fire , these plants disappear .
If , for example , longleaf pine forests do not burn regularly , the pines will be replaced by water oaks and other species .
So — runs the argument — fires are desirable because they kill the competition .
Plants that enhance fires may thus have an evolutionary advantage : they murder the competition while creating the right circumstances for their own seeds to sprout .
This idea has sparked a heated debate .
The problem is , showing that a trait has evolved because it enhances fire is difficult .
Yes , oily leaves are more flammable ; but perhaps the real advantage of oily leaves is that insects do n’t enjoy eating them .
Then , their flammability may be a by - product of tasting terrible .
The best evidence that some plants may have evolved to promote fire comes from pines .
Some species of pine keep their dead branches ; others tend to self - prune .
As you would expect under the torch - me hypothesis , the more flammable species — the ones with the dead wood — also tend to have seeds that are released by fire .
In short , the two traits go together .
Which is suggestive .
But without more data from other plants , the evidence remains thin .
If a tree were put in the dock and charged with being an accessory to arson , the jury would , for now , have to return the verdict , “ Not proven . ”
Yet as I think of that great eucalyptus forest in Australia , I ca n’t help wondering .
Have the trees actually evolved to make the fires worse ?

Book Art Photography by Thomas Allen
American photographer Thomas Allen constructs witty and clever dioramas using figures cut from the covers of old pulp paperbacks .
Using salacious pulp art drawing ’s of the ’40s and ’50s that covered books such as ” I Married a Dead Man ” and ” Marihuana Girl ’ , Allen constructs one set of pictures up close while obscuring another , and in the process creates a different context .
Each piece is given a brand new storyline , though never quite strays from their cheeky origins .
( CNN ) -- Questions abound about how to best inoculate the world against swine flu as health officials plan for a campaign that could dwarf any previous flu vaccination effort .
Researchers in Taiwan sort through eggs for a swine flu vaccine .
Companies worldwide are working on vaccines .
Among the issues to be resolved are the amount of vaccine likely to be available , the timing of the vaccine 's availability , how it would be distributed , who would provide the shots , who would pay for them and whether it will be possible to track potential side effects .
At a recent meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , health officials said U.S. demand could reach 600 million doses of vaccine , enough for two doses for each of the approximate 300 million people in the United States .
That 's in case two doses are required for children and adults under 50 , CDC representatives said .
That would come on top of the 115 million doses of seasonal flu that are distributed annually , health officials said Friday .
Although there has been no official decision to undertake a major vaccination campaign , senior officials are hinting strongly that they would recommend such an effort .
Congress passed a supplemental appropriation for $ 7.5 billion , which President Obama recently signed , to cover the costs of preparing for the virus , which includes a vaccination campaign , CDC spokesman Thomas Skinner said .
Small studies in ferrets at the CDC suggest that when compared with seasonal flu , the virus appears to cause more severe disease but also seems to spread less easily .
Ferrets are often used in flu research because the animal 's respiratory tract responds to flu viruses in much the same way as a human's .
Still , it 's too soon to draw any conclusions , said Nancy Cox , director of the CDC 's influenza division .
More detailed results will be published in the journal Science this week .
The World Health Organization declared the virus , also known as the novel influenza A( H1N1 ) , a global pandemic June 11 .
More than 70 countries have reported cases of human infection with the virus , and more than 70,000 cases have been documented worldwide , according to the WHO .
There are 27,717 cases in the United States , according to the CDC .
As the first pandemic strain to emerge since 1968 , the novel H1N1 virus has attracted interest from pharmaceutical companies around the world .
Samples have been sent to dozens of potential vaccine makers , said Michael Shaw , lab team leader for the novel H1N1 response at the CDC .
Most vaccine production will involve the traditional route of growing a modified virus in eggs , but demand is so high that newer methods are getting a serious look .
One comes from a small company called Protein Sciences Corp. , based in Meriden , Connecticut , which recently received a $ 35 million contract from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pursue a new vaccine technology .
" The technology has advanced in recent years to a point that we believe it could help meet a surge in demand for U.S. - based vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu , " HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement last week .
The company is producing 100,000 doses of vaccine per week , said Daniel Adams , CEO of Protein Sciences Corp .
The technology involves caterpillar ovary cells , which were isolated 20 years ago , and a virus called baculovirus that infects insects but does not harm humans , Adams said .
Scientists inject a protein of the novel H1N1 virus into the baculovirus , which can multiply quickly in insect cells .
Making large quantities of this vaccine is faster than with traditional production methods because the basic cells are able to be frozen and stored , the company said in a statement .
Protein Sciences Corp. will have the vaccines ready for use in clinical trials in a month , Adams said .
They will also be ready for human use if the FDA issues an emergency authorization to start distributing swine flu vaccines .
" We 'll be paving the way for everybody , because the data that 's generated in those trials will allow other people to get any idea of what it 's going to take , how to make an effective vaccine , " Adams said .
But the researchers do not know what is the appropriate dose size for this vaccine or whether it should be given once or twice , he said .
These are issues that may be resolved in clinical trials .
A more established player in the vaccine arena is Sanofi Pasteur , which could have vaccines for the novel H1N1 virus available for clinical investigation in humans this summer , spokeswoman Donna Cary said .
Supplies could become available to public health authorities in four to six months , and the FDA is reviewing the final clinical trial design , she said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Your best bet for avoiding influenza
Novartis AG , another large pharmaceutical company , announced June 12 that it had produced the first batch of H1N1 vaccine weeks ahead of expectations , using cell - based manufacturing technology .
The company plans for clinical trials to start in July and expects licensure in the fall .
Abroad , the United Kingdom 's department of health has signed contracts with pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter .
The advance purchase agreement allows for up to 130 million doses , but there is flexibility in the contract , spokesman James Hotson said .
The UK health department expects that 75 million doses will be produced before the end of the year , with the first supplies arriving in August , Hotson said .
GlaxoSmithKline spokesman Jeff McLaughlin said his company 's first doses are expected to be available in four to six months .
Baxter has just gone into full - scale production of its novel H1N1 vaccine and is hoping to deliver it for clinical trials as early as July , said Kim White , spokesperson for the company .
The clinical work for this vaccine is based on the H5N1 avian flu , she said .
" The clinical trials [ part ] is a little tricky , given that this is a brand new virus , " she said .
" No one has done clinical trials with this particular virus . "
In planning , U.S. health officials are taking into account the experience of the 1976 swine flu vaccine campaign , which strove to immunize against the strain found at Fort Dix , New Jersey .
More than 40 million people received the vaccine before the campaign ended because some recipients developed Guillain - Barre syndrome , which causes temporary paralysis .
There 's still no good working theory on what caused it , Cox said .
Comparisons between the two episodes are limited in value , she said , because genetic analysis shows that the current H1N1 virus is very different from the 1976 swine flu virus .

While a huge number of us have been persuaded by advertisers that we need our daily ' nutraceutical ' dose , the benefits they claim have yet to be verified by the European Food Standards Agency
The following correction was was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday 28 July 2009
In the article below we reported that the European Food Safety Authority had yet to verify the claims made by most of those marketing " nutraceutical " foods , including those said to promote digestion .
A subheading mistakenly referred to that body as the European Food Standards Agency .
I recently came across an advert for a probiotic product .
" Improves weight gain by 10 % , " it said , " … proven in more than 40 scientifically designed and controlled trials . "
A probiotics manufacturer boasting about weight gain ?
Surely some mistake ?
But the advert was insistent : " Maintaining the integrity of the gastro - intestinal flora effects increased weight gain , " it went on .
I had strayed on to a farmers ' website .
This is how probiotics are marketed for pigs .
Teenagers taking their biology GCSE this summer have had to parrot a different characterisation of probiotics , as I discovered when helping one with revision .
As part of their syllabus they learn that probiotics " strengthen the immune system " , a phrase disconcertingly close to the pitch used by manufacturers to sell probiotics such as Yakult and Actimel to ordinary consumers .
Speedier fattening , needless to say , is not a promise for which many of us are prepared to pay a premium .
It is not clear who coined the word probiotics – which simply comes from the Greek " for life " .
Nor is it clear how the word spread into UK school science teaching .
In fact , probiotics – the name given to specialised bacteria added to foods that are said to improve digestion or general health – seemed to emerge out of nowhere in the 1990s .
The live cultures or bacteria in plain live yoghurt have been said for generations to boost beneficial gut microflora , particularly when you have taken antibiotics .
But plain old live yoghurt is cheap ; probiotics like these are highly packaged and highly processed with the high margin for growth manufacturers need .
They are part of a whole category of heavily marketed new foods , variously called nutraceuticals or functional foods , making claims to promote our health .
Human beings have managed without them for millennia , but in just 10 years an extraordinary number of us have been persuaded by the food industry that we need them for the sake of our health .
Nearly 60 % of UK households now regularly buy probiotic drinks .
The market is worth £ 164 m a year in this country alone .
How and why that happened is a fascinating commentary of the nature of advanced capitalism and its genius for making consumers want whatever it has to sell .
The food market in affluent countries is saturated .
Growth cannot come just from making us eat more , since there is a limit to our physical needs .
But tap into our deep - seated emotional needs and , as political commentator Neal Lawson points out in his new book All Consuming , there is no limit to what we can be persuaded to buy .
Yakult , a yoghurt drink made by the Japanese company of the same name , was the pioneer .
It burst on to the European market in the 1990s as a fermented milk drink with an added strain of healthy bacterium , Lactobacillus casei Shirota .
It was launched in the UK in 1996 in a heavily sweetened drink in what look like little toy milk bottles .
The utilitarian design and miniaturisation of its packaging managed to give it both an aura of healthy , almost medicinal , purpose and to make it as attractive to children as doll 's house furniture .
Sales took off , helped considerably by a marketing campaign worth £ 40 m in the UK alone .
Danone was quick to follow with Actimel , also packaged in dinky bottles ; it now has 64 % of the UK market , outselling Yakult .
Danone subsequently formed a strategic alliance with Yakult and owns 20 % of its shares .
So how did these drinks gain such a hold ?
Thanks to a detailed submission about Actimel by Danone 's advertising agency to the industry 's advertising effectiveness awards in 2006 , I was able to gain an inside view of how the marketers managed to persuade us to buy their probiotics on a mass scale .
In 1999 , that submission explains , Danone had set its sights on the UK market for yoghurt and " Actimel was chosen as lead foot soldier " with the aim of getting us " drinking Actimel every day " .
Persuading us that we needed to have a daily dose of this sort of premium - priced functional food was not plain sailing .
Actimel spent millions on a TV advertising campaign in Britain in 2001 , but by 2002 it was clear the British public was not entirely convinced by Actimel .
" Forty per cent of Actimel 's advertising audience [ held ] a highly sceptical view as to its benefit … " the submission explained .
Undeterred , the company and its ad agency set out to find a solution .
Consumer research showed that if they could claim in TV advertising that Actimel 's Lactobacillus casei Imunitass worked to " balance the body 's intestinal flora thereby strengthening the body 's natural defences " they could get people trying it .
Unfortunately the ad industry 's self - regulating body was n't impressed .
" The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre did not accept Danone 's scientific evidence supporting its natural defences claim , " the submission admits .
It goes on : " So the question became how could we build penetration , and justify a relative price premium , among sceptics without telling them what the product does or illustrating the biological function ? "
It was back to the drawing board , or to a " strategic hothouse " in summer 2002 , the submission continues .
They were determined to find a " strong emotive brand benefit " to get the mass market buying it as often as possible .
Yet more research showed how they could lead consumers down a certain thought process to get them to buy .
They worked out that " immune system " was the catch - all phrase to sum up the body 's natural defences to disease .
So the logic was as follows : Actimel contains friendly live bacteria called L.c. Imunitass ( note the cod Latin ) therefore L.c.
Imunitass is involved with the immune system ; a strong immune system means feeling healthy .
The feeling healthy " hot button " , as the submission puts it , was pressed when represented as freedom from fatigue and resistance to catching coughs and colds … in short , feeling good .
Over the next two to three years Danone spent nearly £ 22 m advertising Actimel in the UK .
The ads used subliminal clues such as bad weather and people with coughs and colds to infer its " strengthen natural defences " and " helps your immune system " messages and showed supercharged women running around after drinking Actimel for two weeks to imply that it gave you energy .
Sales rose 426 % .
According to the ad agency , the profit margins on this low - cost high - price little yoghurt drink are about 40 % .
It reckoned Danone would have made over £ 36 m profit as a result , getting back £ 1.67 for every £ 1 it spent on advertising .
At this time , while we were being first persuaded to buy into this new category of probiotics , there was no independent assessment by our regulators of whether probiotic products do what they claim .
What independent work there was had not been encouraging .
The respected Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin said when it reviewed the scientific literature in 2004 and 2005 that the evidence as to whether probiotics actually work was patchy in relation to the gut and unreliable in terms of improving general wellbeing or helping with allergies .
The evidence was strongest for helping those with diarrhoea caused by antibiotics or with flare - ups of inflammatory bowel disease .
People suffering from these problems might find them useful , but what the food industry needs is for as many of us as possible to believe we need to eat them as often as possible , to take them as though they were a daily dose of medicine .
I asked Danone and Yakult back in 2006 how they could justify their claims .
Yakult , which markets its products as " self - defence for your gut … where the majority of your immune system is located " , said it had its own independent research to support them and the fact that its bacteria survived digestion .
It pointed out that Yakult is categorised as " a food for specified health use " by the Ministry of Health in Japan .
" To achieve this status foods must be rigorously and independently examined to verify that consumption of the product can have a beneficial effect , " it said .
Danone said it too had done extensive research on the value of its probiotics and that various further studies were underway to show that its bacteria survived .
" Many beneficial effects for probiotics in general have either been demonstrated or investigated by the scientific community as a whole , " it said .
It added that its probiotics were developed after more than 10 years of clinical research , it had conducted over 25 scientific studies on its bacteria , showing that Actimel had a measurable beneficial effect for healthy people when taken on a daily basis and was doing substantial further research .
In 2007 I asked the Food Standards Agency what advice it would give to consumers who wanted to know whether it was worth paying extra for probiotic products , but was told that it did not issue advice regarding the consumption of legally marketed foods products such as these .
It had conducted laboratory tests on probiotics and found in simulated digestion that overall the addition of these bacteria did not affect the number of total bacteria in the gut and the supposedly healthy Lactobacillus bacteria – the good ones you are paying all that money to get into your digestive system – remained " subdominant " in laboratory conditions in a 10 - day experimental period .
In other words , the composition of the gut flora was not significantly changed .
But , it said , these tests were to check whether probiotics were safe rather than whether they worked , since other foods eaten at the same time and what they were digested with would make a big difference .
Until 2007 there had been pretty much a free - for - all over functional foods ' marketing slogans in Europe .
But that year new EU regulations were finally agreed , largely as a result of pressure from consumer groups who demanded that food companies should be prevented from using health claims to sell products unless they have proved them first and unless the products are healthy enough overall to merit carrying a health claim .
Under the new rules , member states were asked to submit health claims from their manufacturers with dossiers of scientific evidence to be independently assessed by European Food Safety Authority ( Efsa ) .
The UK Food Standards Agency collected over 4,000 claims from industry , weeded out half of them , and submitted about 2,000 for the new approvals process .
Across Europe some 44,000 claims were submitted .
Efsa scientists , stunned by the volume of claims , managed to whittle these down to 4,000 for detailed assessment .
This week , it emerged that Efsa has now rejected some of the claims made for high - profile functional food products by mainstream manufacturers .
In fact , the authority 's scientists have assessed about 70 health claims so far and have rejected 66 – the overwhelming majority .
They ruled , for example , that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support the health claim made by Unilever that its Lipton Tea helps increase alertness , or by Ocean Spray that its cranberry juice helps protect against urinary tract infections .
So what about probiotics ?
To date , Efsa has published five opinions on probiotics ' claims , although the claims of the leading brands have yet to be assessed .
Efsa scientists " avoid using the term probiotics " , a spokeswoman told me , but confirmed that all five opinions on probiotics published so far have been negative .
The leading manufacturers of probiotics , Danone and Yakult , both told me this week that they are confident that the scientific evidence for their claims is robust and that they will be approved by Efsa .
But the fact is , nearly a decade after they achieved mass consumption , we are still waiting to hear whether Efsa 's scientists think they work or not .
Following the stream of negative opinions from Efsa for other health claims , the food industry as a whole has been quietly getting more and more concerned .
Its trade groups have called for urgent meetings with Efsa about how the process is working , and it has accused the authority in the trade media of using " gold standards " to assess the health - supporting dossiers that are more appropriate to new pharmaceuticals .
It has also complained of lack of clarity in technical aspects of the process .
Danone withdrew its applications for approval of the health claims it makes for Actimel ( helps strengthen the body 's natural defences ) and Activia ( improves digestive comfort ; improves slow transit ) in April .
It says , however , that it will resubmit them when technical confusions have been sorted out and that it is absolutely confident that they are well supported by science and will win Efsa approval .
" The three health claim applications are related to Danone 's fresh dairy products Activia and Actimel , that are among the probiotic products with the most extensive scientific documentation .
Their efficacy has been shown in many different studies and the results have been published in highly reputed international scientific journals , " Danone told us in a statement .
" We welcome the new process and remain committed to working with Efsa . "
The company declined to give a date for its resubmission or to comment on the fact that its US arm , Dannon , earlier this year reached an out of court settlement in one of several class actions brought against it over its probiotic health claims .
Dannon vigorously denied the accusation originally made in the action that it was misleading consumers with a multimillion - dollar advertising campaign that claimed its probiotics had been clinically proven to help regulate the digestive system and strengthen the body 's defences when consumed daily .
The plaintiffs claimed compensation for the 30 % premium over other dairy products paid by consumers and a corrective advertising campaign .
The new EU regulations will not be fully implemented until 2020 .
Whether Efsa in the end rules that the leading manufacturers ' claims about probiotics are indeed supported by the scientific evidence they submit or not , even Danone has conceded to me in the past that " results reported by individual Actimel users can be as individual as their gut flora profile and overall diet and other lifestyle factors " .
In other words , there is no silver bullet food ingredient that will make us feel healthy and well .
But perhaps even the fattening pigs could have told us that .

Editor 's Note :
This article is the second in a three - part series .
In the first part of this article series , I made the case that scanning for malicious software ( malware ) is best done from outside the infected operating system .
This negates whatever defenses the malware may have , by not letting it run at all .
We treat the C disk as a data disk rather than as a bootable system disk .
The downside , however , is that this approach is harder than simply installing anti-malware inside the infected system and letting it scan away .
One approach to scanning from outside the infected system is to remove the infected hard drive and connect it another computer .
But there is a simpler way to accomplish the same thing : boot the infected computer from an operating system on a CD or USB flash drive .
This lets us treat the infected hard drive as a data disk without moving it or touching it .
Many Linux distributions can boot and run from a CD or USB flash drive , but my preference is to use a CD - resident copy of Windows .
One reason is that anyone with an infected computer is running Windows and thus they are already familiar with it .
Two Choices
Even having narrowed down the decision tree to booting Windows from a CD there are still two choices to be made .
The first is which bootable Windows CD to use .
I know of two programs that can be used to create a bootable copy of Windows , Bart 's Preinstalled Environment ( BartPE ) and the Ultimate Boot CD for Windows ( UBCD4WIN ) .
This article is about using Benjamin Burrows ' Ultimate Boot CD for Windows .
The second choice is whether to run anti-malware software directly from the CD or from another computer over a network .
This article is about the network option for a couple reasons .
For one , it lets you run any anti-malware software .
Both BartPE and UBCD4WIN are limited in the anti-malware software that can be included on the CD .
Also , the anti-malware programs run and update themselves normally .
The only thing that 's different is pointing them to a shared network drive ( more on this below ) .
Running software from a CD is somewhat different from the normal Windows environment and takes a bit of getting used to .
That said , no matter what your approach to removing malicious software from a Windows computer , I strongly suggest starting off by making a disk image backup .
Something can always go wrong .
Even the best software , written with the best of intentions , can delete a critical file that Windows needs to run properly .
A disk image backup copies everything on the hard drive and most imaging software lets you restore individual files from the image backup .
Hopefully that wo n't be necessary , but it 's good to be prepared .
As noted in Part 1 of this article , I 'm not going to cover the process of creating the UBCD4WIN CD .
( Instructions are available on the web site . )
What follows are instructions for booting from a UBCD4WIN CD and sharing the infected C drive over the network .
Then , from a clean machine with anti-malware software installed , safely scan the infected C disk .
The screen shots are from version 3.50 of UBCD4WIN , which is the latest version .
Networking with the Ultimate Boot CD for Windows
The first screen you see when booting from an Ultimate Boot CD for Windows disc offers many choices .
Experienced UBCD4WIN users can press Enter to start the system booting .
If you are new to this , feel free to read the other options .
The system will continue booting in 30 seconds if you do n't touch the keyboard .
Be patient , booting from the CD is slow ( there are instructions for creating a USB flash drive rather than a CD , but I have n't tried it ) .
During the startup you will prompted about starting network support .
Say yes .
Next Page : The Network Profiles window
This brings up a Network Profiles window .
The default mode of operation , DHCP , should work for most people , so just click on the OK button .
There will be a few messages about assorted services starting up and then you 'll see the PE Network Configurator .
Every computer on a network is assigned a unique number .
On networks running TCP / IP ( which almost all do ) the number is referred to as an IP address .
The DHCP mode of operation means that something on each network ( often the router ) is in charge of handing out numbers .
If you click on the DHCP Details button , you can see the IP address that was assigned to the computer running UBCD4WIN .
A sample of the DHCP details is shown below .
Make a note of the IP address , we 'll use it later .
Next , we need to enable file sharing , so click on the File Sharing tab at the top .
To enable file sharing , simply click on the Start Sharing button at the bottom of the window .
Fairly quickly , the yellow " Stopped " tab in the black status window above the button should change to a green " Started . "
The last thing we need to do on this computer is assign a password to the administrative account .
This is done in the middle of the window .
Enter your chosen password twice and click on the Set Password button .
There is no need for a complicated password , as this is a temporary network connection .
I found that " abc " worked just fine .
We 'll need to enter the password in a minute , so you may want to write it down .
Now , it 's time to shift over to the clean computer , the one with your favorite anti-malware software installed .
The screen shots below are from a Windows XP machine but Vista should work just as well .
The first step in connecting to the infected machine running UBCD4WIN is to ask it for a list of resources it 's sharing on the network .
The only shared resource we care about is the infected C disk .
To do this , click Start ->
Run and in the Open box enter the IP address of the infected machine preceded by a pair of backslashes ( see below ) .
Then click the OK button .
At first nothing happens , but shortly you are prompted for a user name and password .
The default user name of " administrator " does not need to be changed .
Enter the password you just specified for file sharing and click OK .
There is no need to remember the password .

Then , as now , people registered their defiance by calling " Allahu Akbar " from windows at rooftops at night .
They also used the " martyrdom " of their comrades as a clarion call for further action - turning out in huge numbers to mourn the dead .
Derived from the distilled oil of the eucalyptus tree , eucalyptus oil has historical origins dating back for many centuries .
It has many , impressive properties , that mean it is a great natural product to use for health reasons and for cleaning in the home , avoiding too many chemicals .
Eucalyptus , evolving from the Greek term that means “ well covered , ” is an incredible plant that is native to Australia .
The eucalyptus plant itself is categorized in the myrtle family of plants , located in the broad and larger genus of “ flowering trees . ”
While there are over 700 different species of eucalyptus , Australia contains the greatest variety of eucalyptus species , with more than 691 species .
In fact , scientists have found that there are only 15 species in the world that are found , naturally , outside Australia .

The USG Open Source Center translates a communique of Shiite leader Muqtada al - Sadr of Iraq , calling for continuous demonstrations .
You have to wonder whether he is inspired by the big demonstrations in Iran . :
Text of report by Higher Media Commission of Martyr Sayyid Al - Sadr ’s Office on 17 July
[ Statement by Al - Sadr Trend Leader Muqtada al - Sadr
dated 15 July ]
In the name of God ,
There are three issues that the Iraqi people must express their opinions on through continuous peaceful demonstrations and protests , and they are :
1. Every zealous Iraqi is obligated to demonstrate in support of Iraqi prisoners and detainees facing torment in prison , especially the men of the resistance and those who have not been convicted , for every detainee is innocent until proven guilty , and not vice versa .
2. Public pressure must be exerted on the government to end terrorism , particularly in Mosul and other downtrodden cities , and especially with regards to the [ Mojahedin -e ]
Khalq traitors , for unless they are expelled from Iraq , the government will be derelict before God , the people , and the great religious authorities , for my father had banned all dealings with them , and allowing them to remain in Iraq is prohibited as well .
3 . The electricity issue has become quite complex and difficult .
I therefore ask the dear brothers concerned with this issue to present us with plans and programmes for improving and developing the Iraqi electricity sector , from the north of the country to the south , so that they may be presented to the government .
I hope the brothers expedite this request so that we may lift the injustice being done to our downtrodden people .
Furthermore , I ask the people to demand that power be restored by staging continuous demonstrations and protests , for they might work .
[ Signed ] Muqtada al - Sadr

Gestern die US - Botschaft in Berlin : “ Die US - Botschaft empfiehlt allen Amerikanern in Deutschland , ihre Wachsamkeit zu verstärken und angemessene Schritte zur Erhöhung ihrer persönlichen Sicherheit zu unternehmen “ .
Der deutsche Innenminister Wolfgang Schäuble gestern über die „ Terrorgefahr “ gegenüber seiner Presse in Luxemburg : “ Die deutschen Sicherheitsbehörden teilen diese Sorge , sie ist auch nicht neu “ , so Schäuble .
„ “ Wir arbeiten seit längerer Zeit sehr eng mit der US - Seite , gerade auch in Bezug auf diese Sorgen zusammen , um alle geeigneten Maßnahmen sicherzustellen “ , so Schäuble in Luxemburg .
Er sprach davon , dass sich die Gefährdungslage für US - Einrichtungen in Deutschland konkret erhöht habe .
Gleichzeitig zu den Erklärungen der US - Botschaft und des deutschen Innenministers Schäuble erscheinen im Berliner Tagesspiegel Meldungen , die bald überall weltweit abgedruckt abgedruckt werden .
Sie drehen sich um die irakische Gruppe Ansar al - Sunna .
„ Aus ihrem Umfeld “ soll diese Anschläge in Deutschland planen , äusserst gefährlich und mit der Al Qaeda verbandelt sein , so Reuters gestern ( 1 ) .
Ebenfalls gestern : der konservative Blog hotair.com wundert sich , dass der Sprecher der US - Streitkräfte im Irak , Lt. Col.
Keith Gogas , die Ansar al - Sunna als „ moderat “ bezeichnet und davon schwärmt , dass diese nun mit diversen anderen sunnitischen Gruppen die Al Qaeda / Al Kaida / al - qaida / etc bekämpfen würde .
Auch wird erstaunt konstatiert , dass ein gewisser Maj. Gen. Michael Barbero der US - Besatzungsmächte nun meint wissen zu können , dass die Autobomben , die angeblich von irakischen Selbstmordattentätern gesteuert fast täglich dutzende oder hunderte Iraker im Irakkrieg töten , nun ausgerechnet aus dem schiitischen Iran ausgerüstet und unterstützt werden , obwohl die Selbstmörder angeblich Sunniten sind .
( 2)
Interessanterweise ist es die deutsche Bundesstaatsanwaltschaft unter Monika Harms , die nun laut bloomberg.com Informationen darüber haben soll , dass sich die Gruppe Ansar al - Islam ausgerechnet im September 2001 im Irak unter Saddam Hussein gegründet haben und ausgerechnet 2003 nach der US - Invasion im Irak in Ansar al - Sunna umbenannt haben soll ( 7 ) .
Auf die Ansar al - Sunna und die angeblichen Terrordrohungen gegen Deutschland angesprochen , sagt gestern , also AM GLEICHEN TAGE , ein Sprecher des US - Ministeriums , er habe nie davon gehört ( 8 ) .
„ Dies ist ein grosser Wendepunkt “ , so wiederum ein U.S. Maj .
David Baker am Freitag über diese „ Entwicklung “ und die angebliche Tatsache , dass die Ansar al - Sunna und diverse andere Aufständische nun ein Bündnis GEGEN die Al Qaeda schmieden würden .
„ Wenn sie sich gegenseitig bekämpfen , ist das besser , als wenn sie uns bekämpfen “ ( 3 )
Ein Satz , den man sich merken muss .
Man denke da ein einziges
Mal vielleicht etwas weiter und auch mal an die deutsche Geschichte …
DIE „ TEA PARTY “ MIT TERRORISTEN DES PENTAGON UND DER TOD VON STEPHEN VINCENT
Basra , britisch - besetzte Zone , Südirak , 19 .
September 2005 :
2 als Araber bzw .
„ Al - Qaeda “ ( „ El Kaida “ / “ al Qeada “ ) - Terroristen verkleidete britische SAS - Agenten werden in einem Toyota Cressida von einer regulären irakischen Polizei - Patrouille bei der Vorbereitung von Terroranschlägen überrascht , die Mitglieder der Elite - Einheit eröffnen das Feuer auf die Iraker , ein Polizist stirbt .
Dennoch können die 2 Briten festgesetzt werden um dann wenig später durch eine blutige Militäraktion der Besatzungsmacht mit Panzern wieder befreit zu werden .
Tags darauf ziehen wütende irakische Polizisten bewaffnet durch Basra und verlangten eine Verurteilung der britischen Agenten als „ Terroristen “ .
Basra , britisch - besetzte Zone , Südirak , 2.August :
der US - Journalist Steven Vincent wird kurz nach Mitternacht ermordet am Straßenrand aufgefunden , seine weibliche Vertrauensperson und Dolmetscherin überlebt seltsamerweise die Entführung durch „ Männer in Polizeiuniformen “ und in einem Polizeiauto .
Steven Vincent , ein konservativer , eher zurückhaltend - christlicher Reporter , war kurz nach seiner Ankunft von „ Sicherheitskräften “ verübten Massakern auf die Spur gekommen und nannte die von Rumsfeld persönlich bestätigten Treffs der US - Militärs , Kongressabgeordneten und mindetens einem Vertreter der US - Botschaft mit Terrorgruppen wie Ansar al - Sunna , the Islamic Army in Iraq , the Iraqi Liberation Army , Jaish Mohammed , Thawarat al - Ishreen , the Shoura Council of Mujahideen , am 1.Juli 2005 in einem Washington Times - Artikel eine „ Tea Party “ mit Terroristen .
Bald darauf war er tot .
Er berichtete im NYTimes - Artikel „ Switched off in Basra “ von einem „ Todesauto “ , einem Toyota Mark II , das in Basra unterwegs sei und von dem alle Einwohner wüßten , daß es irakische Polizisten außer Dienst als Söldner und Todesschwadronen zu ihren Zielen bringe .
Der Toyota Mark II und der Toyota Cressida sind ein und dasselbe Fahrzeug ( 4 ) .
In einem Artikel „ Back in Basra “ vom 09 .
Juni 2005 hatte Steven Vincent die Eindrücke eines Einwohners der Stadt geschildert :
„ `Dies ist eine iranische Stadt geworden` , schimpft Salaam Wendy , hier geboren und nach seiner Flucht 1986 nach Kanada erst kürzlich zum ersten Mal hierher zurückgekehrt .
` In den 70 ern und 80 ern gab´s hier Bars , Nachtklubs , Kasinos – und keine Frau trug Kopftuch .
Heute kannst
Du nicht mal säkulare ( Anm : nichtreligiöse )
Bücher oder CDs finden , so eine Macht haben die religiösen Parteien über die Stadt .
Dies ist nicht die Stadt an die ich mich erinnere .
`“
Stephen Vincent interviewt damals auch einen gewissen Alaa Tarej , Sprecher der SCIRI .
Dieser macht folgende Aussage :
„ Unsere Beziehungen zu den Briten sind ziemlich gut .
Wir glauben , sie helfen den Irakern “ .
( 5 )
Dann berichtet Stephen Vincent von einem Gespräch mit einem alten sunnitischem Scheich .
Dieser erzählt , so schreibt der konservative Journalist Vincent , daß die USA seit langem hinter dem Öl Irak´s her seien , daß sie nicht nur Saddam installiert , die Kriege mit dem Iran und Kuwait angeleiert und eine illegale Invasion gegen den Irak gestartet hätten .
Der sunnitische Geistliche berichtet außerdem , daß es die Amerikaner selbst sind , die hinter den Bombenanschlägen auf die schiitischen Moscheen stecken , und daß sie einen fiktiven Feind namens „ al - Zarkawi “ erfunden hätten , um ihre repressiven Maßnahmen zu rechtfertigen ( 5 ) .
In seinem letzten Artikel „ Switched Off in Basra “ berichtet der Freelancer Stephen Vincent dann von der schleichenden Übernahme der Stadt durch die religiösen Gruppen , allen voran die SCIRI ( „ Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution “ ) , der Unterwanderung der irakischen „ Sicherheitskräfte “ durch Todesschwadronen des Predigers Muqtada al - Sadr ( Muktada el - Sadr ) , von endlosen Morden denen die britischen Besatzer einfach zuschauen , und vom „ Todesauto “ Basra´s , dem weißen Toyota .
Bald darauf ist er tot .

DAS ZIEL DES KRIEGS GEGEN DEN IRAK – ZERSCHLAGUNG UND AUFTEILUNG
Washington , 08 .
September 2006 : In Deutschland werden Pläne des US - Militärs bekannt , die eine komplette ethnische Neuordnung des Nahen und Mittleren Ostens vorsehen .
Die enthüllten Dokumente konkretisieren Umsturz - und Kriegspläne , die praktisch keinen einzigen Staat der dortigen Region unverändert lassen sollen ( 5 ) .
Jordanien , 17 .
November 2006 : Während eines Besuches in Jordanien wird gegen den einflussreichsten Sunniten - Führer des Landes , Scheich Harith al - Dhari , ein Haftbefehl durch das US - gestützte Maliki - Regime erlassen .
Das wird umgehend von Maliki dementiert , man wolle al - Dhari nur zur Vernehmung vorladen , weil er mit seinen Äußerungen den Hass zwischen Schiiten und Sunniten sowie den Terrorismus fördere .
Al - Dhari entgegnet seinerseits :
„ Ich bin nur bereit , mich wegen des Vorwurfs der Förderung des Terrorismus vernehmen zu lassen , wenn auch gegen ( den schiitischen Ministerpräsidenten ) Nuri al - Maliki und ( den kurdischen Staatspräsidenten ) Dschalal Talabani ermittelt wird . “
Am 25 .
November in Kairo sagt Harith al - Dhari dann , die USA und die Maliki - Regierung wollten den Irak in einen Bürgerkrieg stürzen , um es dann aufteilen zu können . ( 5 )
DER STURZ DER 1.DEUTSCHEN REPUBLIK – DIE INSTALLATION DES ERMÄCHTIGUNGSGESETZ
Nach dem damals vorherrschenden rechtspositivistischen Verständnis konnte ein mit verfassungsändernder Mehrheit beschlossenes Gesetz die Verfassung abändern , ohne dass in den Wortlaut der Verfassung eingegriffen werden musste .
Als oberster Grundsatz galt das Demokratieprinzip , d. h. Beschlüssen der Mehrheit sollte unbedingt
Rechnung getragen werden ; dass dies sich auch gegen den freiheitlichen Charakter der Verfassung als Ganzes richten konnte , wurde von den Vätern der Weimarer Verfassung nicht bedacht .
Die Erfahrung , dass durch das Ermächtigungsgesetz mit einer parlamentarischen Mehrheit die freiheitliche Verfassung ausgehebelt werden konnte ( die Legalität dieses Vorgangs ist bis heute umstritten ) , war nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg Anlass , gegen derartige Fälle ausdrücklich Vorsorge zu treffen .
( 6 )
Mit einem Ermächtigungsgesetz konnte der deutsche Reichstag gemäß der Verfassung von 1919 der Reichsregierung die befristete Befugnis zur Gesetzgebung übertragen .
Diese Übertragung war von einer Zwei- Drittel - Mehrheit im Reichstag abhängig .
Die ersten drei Ermächtigungsgesetze gab es in den Krisenjahren 1919 bis 1924 .
So wurde in der Hälfte der Amtszeit von Reichspräsident Friedrich Ebert mit Ermächtigungsgesetzen regiert .
Wenn im Deutschen ohne nähere Kennzeichnung vom Ermächtigungsgesetz gesprochen wird , ist normalerweise jenes gemeint , das am 23 .
März 1933 beschlossen und am 24 .
März verkündet wurde .
Es ist das Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich .
Da die unter diesem Vorzeichen von der Regierung beschlossenen Gesetze weder vom Reichsrat ratifiziert , noch vom Reichspräsidenten gegengezeichnet werden mussten , wurde mit diesem Ermächtigungsgesetz de facto die nationalsozialistische Diktatur etabliert .
Die Gültigkeit des Gesetzes wurde zwar auf vier Jahre begrenzt , aber 1937 und 1941 um weitere vier Jahre verlängert ( 6 ) .
***
Originalauszug [ 1 ] : Ermächtigungsgesetz vom 24 .
März 1933
Der Reichstag hat das folgende Gesetz beschlossen , das mit Zustimmung des Reichsrats hiermit verkündet wird , nachdem festgestellt ist , dass die Erfordernisse verfassungsändernder Gesetzgebung erfüllt sind :
Art. 1 . Reichsgesetze können außer in dem in der Reichsverfassung vorgesehenen Verfahren auch durch die Reichsregierung beschlossen werden . [… ]
Art. 2 . Die von der Reichsregierung beschlossenen Reichsgesetze können von der Reichsverfassung abweichen , soweit sie nicht die Einrichtung des Reichstags und des Reichsrats als solche zum Gegenstand haben .
Die Rechte des Reichspräsidenten bleiben unberührt .
Art. 3 . Die von der Reichsregierung beschlossenen Reichsgesetze werden vom Reichskanzler ausgefertigt und im Reichsgesetzblatt verkündet .
Sie treten , soweit sie nichts anderes bestimmen , mit dem auf die Verkündung folgenden Tage in Kraft . [… ]
Art. 4 . Verträge des Reichs mit fremden Staaten , die sich auf Gegenstände der Reichsgesetzgebung beziehen , bedürfen nicht der Zustimmung der an der Gesetzgebung beteiligten Körperschaften .
Die Reichsregierung erlässt die zur Durchführung dieser Verträge erforderlichen Vorschriften .
Art. 5 . Dieses Gesetz tritt mit dem Tage seiner Verkündung in Kraft .
Es tritt mit dem 1 .
April 1937 außer Kraft ; es tritt ferner außer Kraft , wenn die gegenwärtige Reichsregierung durch eine andere abgelöst wird .
***
Das bedeutete , dass neue Gesetze nicht mehr verfassungskonform sein , insbesondere die Grundrechte nicht wahren mussten , dass Gesetze neben dem verfassungsmäßigen Verfahren auch allein von der Reichsregierung erlassen werden konnten ( damit bekommt die Exekutive auch legislative Gewalt ) und die Gültigkeit des Gesetzes vier Jahre betrug .
Es wurde vom Reichstag , bei dem es sich dann aber nicht mehr um eine demokratische Institution handelte , am 30 .
Januar 1937 um weitere vier Jahre bis zum 1 . April 1941 , am 30 .
Januar 1939 bis zum 10 .
Mai 1943 und dann ohne Zeitbeschränkung „ verlängert “ ( 6 ) .
DIE ZIELE DER FEINDE DER REPUBLIK
Erstes Ziel war die Ausschaltung des Parlaments .
Deutschland sollte von Hitler allein regiert werden .
Zweites Ziel war die De- facto- Außerkraftsetzung der bis zuletzt unverändert gebliebenen Verfassung .
Drittens sollte der Schein von Legalität gewahrt bleiben .
Damit hatte man im Rahmen des damals unter Juristen vorherrschenden Rechtspositivismus , der zwischen Gesetz und Recht keinen Unterschied sah , überwiegend Erfolg .
Auch das Ausland sprach angesichts der Begleitumstände von einem staatsrechtlichen Notstand im Deutschen Reich ( 6 ) .
DIE KOLLABORATION DER BÜGERLICHEN UND DER LIBERALEN MIT HITLER UND DEM FASCHISMUS
Aufgrund der Änderung der Geschäftsordnung bei Abstimmungen des Reichstags über das Ermächtigungsgesetz hing die nötige Zweidrittelmehrheit vom Verhalten des Zentrums und der Bayerischen Volkspartei ( BVP ) ab .
Die Verhandlungen mit den Nationalsozialisten im Vorfeld der Reichstagssitzung hatten die Zentrumsfraktion einer Zerreißprobe ausgesetzt .
Schließlich setzte sich der Parteivorsitzende Prälat Ludwig Kaas , Verfechter einer autoritären nationalen Sammlungspolitik , gegen die Minderheit um Heinrich Brüning und Adam Stegerwald durch .
Kaas vertrat die Meinung , das ein Widerstand des Zentrums an der Herrschaft Hitlers als politische Realität nichts ändern würde .
Man würde lediglich die Chance auf die Einhaltung der von Hitler zugesicherten Garantien verspielen :
* Weiterbestehen der Länder
* Sicherung des christlichen Einflusses in Schule und Erziehung
* Respektierung der Länderkonkordate und der Rechte der christlichen Konfessionen
* Unabsetzbarkeit der Richter
* Beibehaltung des Reichstags und des Reichsrats
* Wahrung der Stellung und der Rechte des Reichspräsidenten
Diese Haltung ist auch im Lichte jenes Traumas zu betrachten , das die Partei im Kulturkampf gegen Bismarck erlitt , der mit der Einführung der Alleingültigkeit der Zivilehe und der staatlichen Schulaufsicht den Einfluss der Kirche auf das öffentliche Leben wesentlich eingeschränkt hatte .
Man wollte nicht noch einmal in die Rolle eines Reichsfeindes geraten .
Darüber hinaus würden gemäß Kaas weite Teile der Partei ein besseres Verhältnis zur NSDAP wünschen und seien kaum noch daran zu hindern , in das Lager Hitlers zu wechseln .
Im Anschluß an seine Rede folgt die Begründung der Bayerischen Volkspartei durch den Abgeordneten Ritter von Lex .
Sowohl die Abgeordneten des Zentrums als auch die Abgeordneten der Bayerischen Volkspartei stimmten ohne Ausnahme für das Ermächtigungsgesetz .
Die Zentrumspartei soll ihre Reichstagsabgeordneten unter Fraktionszwang gesetzt haben .
Umstritten und nicht belegbar ist die Vermutung , dass bei der Entscheidung des Zentrums für das Ermächtigungsgesetz auch konkrete Zusagen bezüglich eines Reichskonkordates eine Rolle gespielt haben , das in der Tat einige Wochen später verhandelt und abgeschlossen wurde .
Nebenbei mag auch noch die Vorstellung eine Rolle gespielt haben durch einen Konsens den organisatorischen Kern des katholischen Lagers , nämlich das Verbandsleben , retten zu können .
Es sollte sich im nachhinein zeigen , dass man im Bestreben , noch „ Schlimmeres “ zu verhindern , die treulose Handschlagmentalität der Nationalsozialisten falsch eingeschätzt hatte .
Auch die Liberalen der Deutschen Staatspartei stimmte ohne Ausnahme dem Ermächtigungsgesetz trotz warnender Stimmen zu .
Die zustimmende Begründung der DStP trug der liberale Abgeordnete Reinhold Maier vor .
Der Schlußsatz seiner Rede lautete :
„ Im Interesse von Volk und Vaterland und in der Erwartung einer gesetzmäßigen Entwicklung werden wir unsere ernsten Bedenken zurückstellen und dem Ermächtigungsgesetz zustimmen . “
DAS BEUGEN
Prälat Ludwig Kaas , Vorsitzender des katholischen Zentrums , am 23 .
März 1933 vor dem deutschen Reichstag über das „ Ja “ seiner Partei zum „ Ermächtigungsgesetz “ :
„ Die gegenwärtige Stunde kann für uns nicht im Zeichen der Worte stehen , ihr einziges , ihr beherrschendes Gesetz ist das der raschen , aufbauenden und rettenden Tat .
Und diese
Tat kann nur geboren werden in der Sammlung .
Die deutsche Zentrumspartei , die den großen Sammlungsgedanken schon seit langem und trotz aller vorübergehenden Enttäuschung mit Nachdruck und Entschiedenheit vertreten hat , setzt sich zu dieser Stunde , wo alle kleinen und engen Erwägungen schweigen müssen , bewusst und aus nationalem Verantwortungsgefühl über alle parteipolitischen UND SONSTIGEN GEDANKEN HINWEG …
Im Angesicht der brennenden Not , in der Volk und Staat gegenwärtig stehen , im Angesicht der riesenhaften Aufgaben , die der deutsche Wiederaufbau an uns stellt , im Angesicht vor allem der Sturmwolken , die in Deutschland und um Deutschland aufzusteigen beginnen , reichen wir von der deutschen Zentrumspartei in dieser Stunde allen , auch früheren Gegnern , die Hand , um die Fortführung des nationalen Aufstiegswerkes zu sichern . “
„ IDEEN , EWIG .. UNZERSTÖRBAR “
Der Sozialdemokrat Otto Wels spricht am 23 .
März die letzten freien Worte im Deutschen Reichstag ( 9 ) :
„ Die Wahlen vom 5 .
März haben den Regierungsparteien die Mehrheit gebracht und damit die Möglichkeit gegeben , streng nach Wortlaut und Sinn der Verfassung zu regieren .
Wo diese Möglichkeit besteht , besteht auch die Pflicht .
Kritik ist heilsam und notwendig .
Noch niemals , seit es einen Deutschen Reichstag gibt , ist die Kontrolle der öffentlichen Angelegenheiten durch die gewählten Vertreter des Volkes in solchem Maße ausgeschaltet worden , wie es jetzt geschieht und wie es durch das neue Ermächtigungsgesetz noch mehr geschehen soll .
Eine solche Allmacht der Regierung muss sich umso schwerer auswirken , als auch die Presse jeder Bewegungsfreiheit entbehrt …
Aber dennoch wollen Sie vorerst den Reichstag ausschalten , um Ihre Revolution fortzusetzen .
Zerstörung von Bestehendem ist aber noch keine Revolution .
Das Volk erwartet positive Leistungen .
Es wartet auf durchgreifende Maßnahmen gegen das furchtbare Wirtschaftselend , das nicht nur in Deutschland , sondern in aller Welt herrscht .
Wir deutschen Sozialdemokraten bekennen uns in dieser geschichtlichen Stunde zu den Grundsätzen der Menschlichkeit und der Gerechtigkeit , der Freiheit und des Sozialismus .
Kein Ermächtigungsgesetz gibt Ihnen die Macht , Ideen , die ewig und unzerstörbar sind , zu vernichten …
Auch aus neuen Verfolgungen kann die deutsche Sozialdemokratie neue Kraft schöpfen .
Wir grüßen die Verfolgten und Bedrängten .
Wir grüßen unsere Freunde im Reich .
Ihre Standhaftigkeit und Treue verdienen Bewunderung . “

I used to be afraid to write .
Because I knew I would write badly .
I could n’t commit my words to the page because I was sure I would use the wrong ones not to mention incorrect grammar and punctuation .
I forgot about how much progress I ’ve made in this area until a friend dropped by the other day and , like an excited kid on Christmas morning , I handed him a bound galley ( looks like a paperback version of a book , printed for publicity reasons before the book comes out ) of my book , “ Beyond Blue , ” because I still ca n’t believe I actually wrote my story , something that I ’ve always wanted to do since I was a young girl .
My friend works in the book business and wants to write more , too , but is sure he ’s bad at it .
Positive .
“ Do you feel like you ’ve made it past that hurdle ? ” he asked me , “ of always questioning and doubting yourself ? ”
I laughed out loud .
“ Ah ….. no , ” I responded .
“ The insecurities do n’t disappear once you ’re published .
They simply change .
So instead of getting ding letters from publishers , you are getting royalty statements printed in red , and let me tell you , they hurt just as bad as the rejection letters . ”
“ So how do you work around that and still produce ? ” he asked me .
I thought about that for awhile and then came up with these three steps .
1 . You need people in your life that believe in you .
I think that ’s really the most important ingredient .
Because Lord knows I ca n’t count on my self - appraisals .
They would have me much too scared to put anything down on paper .
And it ’s best if your cheerleaders can also guide and teach you in a field , like publishing .
I credit my mentor , Mike Leach , for so much of what I do because he was on the phone with me back when I was in the psych ward telling me that he believed in me .
And he can also give me valuable feedback on ways I could improve my writing .
2. Simply do it .
Do the thing that you most afraid of .
And look for a gig ( or possibly a writing class ? ) where you have to do it often , a job that involves deadlines , so by every Sunday you need to have written two pieces .
As I have mentioned before , writing Beyond Blue has been immensely helpful in handcuffing the self - doubter in me , because when your contract stipulates that you produce two to four posts a day , you cannot afford to tinker with each one forever , trying to make it perfect .
You have to press several times a day , and that ’s an important exercise in firing the perfectionist .
After you start to do something over and over again , you begin to see the results , and that gives you the confidence to continue putting yourself out there .
3. Quiet the critics .
Both the silent critics who yell obnoxious things from inside your brain and the real critic who insists that you suck and should not go near a keyboard .
Like my eighth - grade teacher who read aloud my paper as an example of how NOT to write , and my college professor who refused to write a letter of recommendation for me because he said I “ did n’t know how to use words correctly . ”
The real critics ?
I simply ca n’t read them … like the mean comments I get on Beyond Blue … they are too toxic .
So if I see that a comment is very negative in the first two lines , I wo n’t read the rest .
The silent crtics are harder to address , which is why you need a self - esteem file .

If you follow some basic rules BitTorrent is without a doubt the best way to share large files online .
Interestingly , BitTorrent 's inventor Bram Cohen recently noted that torrents with more peers are not always faster .
We give some pointers on what torrents will guarantee the best download speeds .
In the past we ’ve written many articles on how BitTorrent users can speed up their downloads .
In most of these we focused on tweaking the client ’s options such as the max upload speed and the maximum number of incoming and outgoing connections .
Many BitTorrent users are looking for the holy grail that will boost their download speeds to the maximum , and tweaking your client can indeed help a bit .
However , selecting the right torrents is far more important , and those are not necessarily the torrents with the most peers .
Bram Cohen , the inventor of the BitTorrent protocol addresses this common misconception in a recent blog post .
“ Cohen designed BitTorrent to be able to download files from many different sources [… ] the more popular a file is , the faster a user will be able to download it , since many people will be downloading it at the same time , and these people will also be uploading the data to other users , ” writes Cohen while quoting an erroneous article .
This is indeed an explanation we often hear – the more people who download a file the better – but unfortunately it ’s not very accurate .
Or to put it in Cohen ’s words , this description of BitTorrent is “ somewhere between grossly misleading and wrong . ”
Cohen goes on to explain why : “ There ’s a classic fallacy because if one person stands up during a concert they get a better view , then if everybody stood up during a concert they ’d all get a better view .
This is of course is not true – they wind up slightly worse off by all standing , because they all compete with each other for a view . ”
So how do you get the most out of BitTorrent then ?
Or to put it differently , what torrents perform the best and generally give you the fastest download times ?
We ’ll try to explain it as simply as possible leaving math out as much as possible .
The fastest torrents will be those where downloaders ( leechers ) can tap into the most upload capacity .
If you have a swarm ( seeders and leechers ) with a hundred people in total it will be faster when there are relatively more seeders .
Why ?
Very simply it ’s because seeders do n’t download while their upload capacity is available for the leechers .
Many people understand these basics .
A torrent with 30 seeders and 70 leechers ( 30 % seeders ) will go faster than one with 10 seeders and 90 leechers ( 10 % seeders ) .
However , it get confusing when you compare swarms of different sizes .
For example , a torrent with 30 seeders and 70 leechers ( 30 % seeders ) will generally be faster than one with 500 seeders and 2500 leechers ( 20 % seeders ) .
Why ?
Simply because the swarm has a smaller percentage of seeders .
When picking the right torrents to download , the percentage of seeders that a swarm consists of is the most important thing to look at .
A higher percentage of seeders means that the average upload capacity available to the leechers will be higher .
The fact that leechers also upload themselves is irrelevant because all peers have more download capacity than upload capacity .
The seeders make the difference .
This is one of the reasons why private trackers generally have such great download speeds .
Since users are required to seed as much as possible , they have torrents with 100 seeders and only two or three leechers .
So what can we learn from this ?
If you ’re looking for fast torrents pick those with the best seeder / leecher ratio or the highest percentage of seeders .
Or when you do n’t have a choice , do n’t complain about slow speeds when there are only a few seeders in a large swarm .
Perhaps even more importantly , remember to seed as much as possible if you do n’t need your upload speed for something else .

In April 2005 , the World Food Programme and the Chinese government jointly announced that food aid shipments to China would stop at the end of the year .
For a country where a generation ago hundreds of millions of people were chronically hungry , this was a landmark achievement .
Not only has China ended its dependence on food aid , but almost overnight it has become the world ’s third largest food aid donor .
As noted in Plan B 3.0 : Mobilizing to Save Civilization , the key to China ’s success was the economic reforms in 1978 that dismantled its system of agricultural collectives , known as production teams , and replaced them with family farms .
In each village , the land was allocated among families , giving them long - term leases on their piece of land .
The move harnessed the energy and ingenuity of China ’s rural population , raising the grain harvest by half from 1977 to 1986 .
With its fast - expanding economy raising incomes , with population growth slowing , and with the grain harvest climbing , China eradicated most of its hunger in less than a decade — in fact , it eradicated more hunger in a shorter period of time than any country in history .
While hunger has been disappearing in China , it has been spreading throughout much of the developing world , notably sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Indian subcontinent .
As a result , the number of people in developing countries who are hungry has increased from a recent historical low of 800 million in 1996 to over 1 billion today .
Part of this recent rise can be attributed to higher food prices and the global economic crisis .
In the absence of strong leadership , the number of hungry people in the world will rise even further , with children suffering the most .

Dealing with this problem requires addressing the long - term trends leading to growth in demand for food outpacing growth in supply .
One key to the threefold expansion in the world grain harvest since 1950 was the rapid adoption in some developing countries of high - yielding wheats and rices ( originally developed in Japan ) and hybrid corn ( from the United States ) .
The spread of these highly productive seeds , combined with a tripling of irrigated area and an 11 - fold increase in world fertilizer use , tripled the world grain harvest .
Growth in irrigation and fertilizer use essentially removed soil moisture and nutrient constraints on much of the world ’s cropland .
Now the outlook is changing .
Farmers are faced with shrinking supplies of irrigation water , a diminishing response to additional fertilizer use , rising temperatures from global warming , the loss of cropland to nonfarm uses , rising fuel costs , and a dwindling backlog of yield - raising technologies .
At the same time , they also face fast - growing demand for farm products from the annual addition of 79 million people a year , the desire of some 3 billion people to consume more livestock products , and the millions of motorists turning to crop - based fuels to supplement tightening supplies of gasoline and diesel fuel .
Farmers and agronomists are now being thoroughly challenged .
The shrinking backlog of unused agricultural technology and the associated loss of momentum in raising cropland productivity are found worldwide .
Between 1950 and 1990 , world grain yield per hectare climbed by 2.1 percent a year , ensuring rapid growth in the world grain harvest .
From 1990 to 2008 , however , it rose only 1.3 percent annually .
This is partly because the yield response to the additional application of fertilizer is diminishing and partly because irrigation water is limited .
This calls for fresh thinking on how to raise cropland productivity .
One way is to breed crops that are more tolerant of drought and cold .
U.S. corn breeders have developed corn varieties that are more drought - tolerant , enabling corn production to move westward into Kansas , Nebraska , and South Dakota .
Kansas , the leading U.S. wheat - producing state , has used a combination of drought - resistant varieties in some areas and irrigation in others to expand corn planting to where the state now produces more corn than wheat .
Another way of raising land productivity , where soil moisture permits , is to increase the area of multicropped land that produces more than one crop per year .
Indeed , the tripling in the world grain harvest since 1950 is due in part to impressive increases in multiple cropping in Asia .
Some of the more common combinations are wheat and corn in northern China , wheat and rice in northern India , and the double or triple cropping of rice in southern China and southern India .
The spread in double cropping of winter wheat and corn on the North China Plain helped boost China ’s grain production to where it rivaled that of the United States .
Winter wheat grown there yields 5 tons per hectare .
Corn also averages 5 tons .
Together these two crops , grown in rotation , can yield 10 tons per hectare per year .
China ’s double cropped rice annually yields 8 tons per hectare .
Forty years ago , North India produced only wheat , but with the advent of the earlier maturing high - yielding wheats and rices , wheat could be harvested in time to plant rice .
This wheat / rice combination is now widely used throughout the Punjab , Haryana , and parts of Uttar Pradesh .
This practice yields a combined 5 tons of grain per hectare , helping to feed India ’s 1.2 billion people .
A concerted U.S. effort to both breed earlier maturing varieties and develop cultural practices that would facilitate multiple cropping could substantially boost crop output .
If China ’s farmers can extensively double crop wheat and corn , then U.S. farmers could do the same if agricultural research and farm policy were reoriented to support it .
Elsewhere , Western Europe , with its mild winters and high - yielding winter wheat , might also be able to double crop more with a summer grain , such as corn , or with a winter oilseed crop .
Brazil and Argentina have an extended frost - free growing season that supports extensive multicropping , often wheat or corn with soybeans .
In many countries , including the United States , most of those in Western Europe , and Japan , fertilizer use has reached a level where using more has little effect on crop yields .
There are still some places , however , such as most of Africa , where additional fertilizer would help boost yields .
Unfortunately , sub -Saharan Africa lacks the infrastructure to transport fertilizer economically to the villages where it is needed .
As a result of nutrient depletion , grain yields in much of sub-Saharan Africa are stagnating .
One encouraging response to this situation in Africa is the simultaneous planting of grain and leguminous trees .
At first the trees grow slowly , permitting the grain crop to mature and be harvested ; then the saplings grow quickly to several feet in height , dropping leaves that provide nitrogen and organic matter , both sorely needed in African soils .
The wood is then cut and used for fuel .
This simple , locally adapted technology , developed by scientists at the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry in Nairobi , has enabled farmers to double their grain yields within a matter of years as soil fertility builds .
Despite local advances , the overall loss of momentum in expanding food production is unmistakable .
It will force us to think more seriously about stabilizing population , moving down the food chain , and using the existing harvest more productively .
Achieving an acceptable worldwide balance between food and people may now depend on stabilizing population as soon as possible , reducing the unhealthily high consumption of animal products among the affluent , and restricting the conversion of food crops to automotive fuels .
It also calls for a concerted effort to raise water use productivity , similar to the gains achieved for land use , and to stabilize climate to avoid crop - withering temperatures and more frequent droughts .
These efforts combined can help put us on the path to ensuring enough food for all .

" If I fancy a pint I have to travel three miles to the only pub in my area that does n't have it .
I can't just go to the shops because huge parts of the high street affect me .
I just took a poly for a top secret clearance FBI job .
When I was first told I would have to take one , I was ok with it , b/c I have nothing to hide , but then started worrying more and more since I 've heard so much negative , and so went online to see what kinds of questions they would ask , etc .
That got me extremely nervous , and then I started questioning myself about some of the answers I 'd filled in during the hiring process - minor stuff , but I started worrying myself into exhaustion .
Everybody told me I was overthinking everything , and I know I was , but I have a high guilt conscience thanks to strict parents .
There was one question that has been bothering me the way I answered it , so when I went for the poly and was asked if there was anything I needed to say regarding my application process , I told him about it and he said that was something minor and nothing to worry about in regards to the poly .
There were 2 parts to the test - # 1 was the honesty questions and # 2 was the top secret questions .
He told me that my background came up very clean and that there were no red flags in any areas , and then told me the common areas there usually are - that being alcohol , then drugs and credit issues .
No problems there with me .
The basic significant questions asked were :
Did I intend to answer all the questions honestly
Alcohol issues
Drug issues
Have I ever spread lies or vicious rumors about my close friends , co-workers or bosses
Did I intentionally not disclose something during the application process
Those were the basic questions , put to me in various ways .
After he stopped that part he told me the poly showed I was having trouble with the question about intentionally not disclosing something during the app process .
He then said I failed it , but he had the discretion with that question to pass me and let me continue on to top secret questions or to fail me right then .
I absolutely did not intentionally leave anything off , and even feel like I put down more than was necessary during all the app processes .
He told me my answer would be the deciding factor about him passing me or not , so he asked me why that question bothered me .
I re-iterated to him about the answer I gave on one of the questions during the interview , and how that had really eaten at me , but I 'd disclosed it to him before the poly .
We went over it several times , and I went more into depth , but he kept telling me that could not be the reason and would n't accept that answer as the real reason I was nervous about that question .
I have racked and racked my brain , and there is just nothing else but that one thing and it bothered me that I felt I should have answered it differently during the application interview .
He unhooked me , and anytime I tried to say something he would tell me this was n't up for debate .
He got really ugly and accusatory .
He also told me that was the only question I 'd " failed " .
That meant that I passed the question that I intended to answer every question honestly and I started to bring that up , but that " was n't up for debate " .
He told me that lie dectors never lie .
Right .
The job was a great opportunity and one I feel I would fit into so well , but not getting it does n't bother me , I knew when I first applied it was a long shot , but to get this far and then be accused of lying .
There 's such a stigma attached and it's quite embarrassing , and especially for those close family members who have been rooting me on .
I 'm going to try to appeal it if I can , I do n't know how to do that , but if there 's any way to right this , I want to .
The Palestinian gays feel safer on the other side of the border
According to some estimates , there are now 300 gay Palestinian men secretly living and working in Israel .
Their willingness to live there - despite the risk of being detained and deported as a security threat - is due to Palestinian attitudes towards gay men , they claim .
One 22 - year - old gay man who fled from Gaza into Israel four years ago told BBC World Service 's Outlook programme he was almost killed when his family found out about his sexuality .
He says that when he was 18 , he was caught with his boyfriend by his brother .
" [ My brother ] brought a stick and hit us , " he said .
" He tied us up with an iron rope and went to call my dad , and tell my partner's .
Then he came back and hit us again . "
Illegal status
The man said he escaped after his brother went out and told his mother and sister - in - law to make sure they did not run away .
Jerusalem has had two Gay Pride marches in the last two years
The man said he ran away and , when he discovered his family were hunting for him , fled to Israel .
There , he says , he was placed under virtual house arrest because he was viewed as a potential security risk .
Shaul Gonen , of Israel 's main gay rights lobbying group , Agudah , told Outlook that under international law Israel is obliged to offer asylum to those that seek it .
But , he says , it can refuse if the applicants are from an area the state is in conflict with .
In practice , Palestinian gays end up being placed under virtual house arrest because of the fear that they may be potential suicide bombers .
" They are unable to find proper help , " said Mr Gonen .
" Everybody blames them for being something dangerous .
" The Palestinians say if you are gay , you must be a collaborator , while the Israelis treat you as a security threat . "
Coercion
However , many Palestinian gays say they would still rather live under house arrest in Israel , where homosexuality is not considered a crime , than at home .
The 22 - year - old who fled his home in Gaza alleged that those who do stay in the occupied territories are often coerced into working for the Palestinian police .
The gays are afraid of militant retribution if they return
The man alleged that after he refused , the Palestinian police had tortured him .
" They hit me .
They put me in a pool of water with just my head sticking out , " he claimed .
However , the Israeli secret service also often exploit gay Palestinians , said Mr Gonen .
He says this usually involves coercing them into working undercover , to gather information about other Palestinians .
The precarious status of the gay community means gay men often end up working for the secret service or as targets for exploitation by Israeli men .
" They work as prostitutes , selling their bodies unwillingly because they have to survive , " said Mr Gonen .
" Sometimes the Israeli secret police try to recruit them , sometimes the Palestinian police try to recruit them .
" In the end they find themselves falling between all chairs .
Nobody wants to help them , everybody wants to use them . "
' Against Allah '
Gay Palestinians say they are mainly persecuted at home because of religious attitudes .
Many Muslims claim that homosexuality is strictly against the Koran .
" From my point of view as a Muslim , this phenomenon is rejected completely , " one Palestinian in Gaza told Outlook .
" The Islamic religion is merciful - we should try to help them to eliminate this bad phenomenon .
" It has a lot of bad things , a lot of disadvantages , a lot of bad sides - regarding their health , regarding their sociability , regarding their association with people around them . "

Putting the 9 in S9FES
Scheme 9 from Empty Space ( s9fes ) is a work - in - progress implementation of Scheme , only experimentally ported to Plan 9 .
The compilation is simple enough , issuing ‘ mk ’ in the root source directory .
However , properly making use of all of the libraries it comes with requires five minutes of configuration .
For the sake of organisation ,
term % mkdir $ home / path/to/s9fes/sys # a rose by any other name ... term % cp $ home / path/to/s9fes/s9.^( scm image ) $ home / path/to/s9fes/sys term % mkdir $ home/lib/s9fes
then making use of such , we do the following because s9fes uses environment variables , in the spirit of modern UNIX , to find its essential files ( i.e. , libraries and images ) :
term % echo '#!/bin/rc s9inst=$home / path/to/s9fes for( i in lib contrib sys ) bind - a $ s9inst / $ i $ home/lib/s9fes S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH=$home/lib/s9fes $ s9inst/s9 ' > $ home/bin/rc/s9 term % chmod +x $ home/bin/rc/s9
and invoke the script s9 for actual use .
Aside from the creation of lib / s9fes , which is a trade - off for organisation , this configuration is noninvasive and upgrade withstanding , for use until the Plan 9 port is finalised .
N.B. :
In the above script , it might be necessary to define LIBDIR=$ S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH – on modern UNIX systems , $ S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH is a colon - separated list of paths containing scm and image files for s9fes , while $ LIBDIR is the specific system - wide copy of s9fes / lib .
On Plan 9 , however , we do n’t require the distinction due to the use of binds ( and all library file names have to be distinct anyways , due to the way they are loaded from within s9fes ) .

The first big victory against coal power plants in Virginia came a few days ago in a town of about 300 .
In a statement of independence , environmental justice , and the power a few people can have on the biggest issues facing our environment today , town councilors voted 3 - 2 to retain their zoning rights regarding a coal power plant proposal and essentially prevent the plant from being built ( at least for now ) .
Big coal brought in all their artillery of propoganda , promises for jobs and a better living environment , and tax revenues for the town , but small groups of informed and regional activists , along with residents willing to listen and think for themselves , helped to stop this process from moving forward in its normal way in the small town of Dendron , VA .
They came up with clever tactics and got enough support from the people in the area to make the decision - makers not only listen but vote in a significant and landmark way .
The councilors were leaning towards allowing coal supporters and the coal industry to take away their rights and their cherished environment a month before , but with the support of the Coalition to Keep Surry Clean , Wise Energy for Virginia , and students from the nearby College of William and Mary , the vote swung back to the side of mindful green activists .
The following video documents a portion of the story and clever , strong - willed activists in this landmark vote :

This is a great example of what a few people and some engaged regional groups can do to take control of their own future .
It is an inspirational example that people in many other regions can look to and perhaps it will help others to launch their own “ anti-coal ” or “ wise energy ” or “ climate change action ” groups .

One of Britain 's most respected conductors , Sir Edward Downes , and his wife , Joan , a choreographer and TV producer , have died at an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland , their family said today .
Downes , 85 , was almost blind when he and his 74 - year - old wife , who had become his full - time carer , travelled to Switzerland to end their lives , a family statement released to the BBC said .
Born in Birmingham , Downes had a long and distinguished career , including conducting the first performance at the Sydney Opera House .
He worked with the BBC Philharmonic and the Royal Opera House in London .
The statement from the couple 's son and daughter , Caractacus and Boudicca , said they " died peacefully , and under circumstances of their own choosing " .
The statement continued : " After 54 happy years together , they decided to end their own lives rather than continue to struggle with serious health problems . "
The couple died at a clinic run by Dignitas , the Swiss organisation that operates a specialist euthanasia service .
The Downes family said : " Our father , who was 85 years old , almost blind and increasingly deaf , had a long , vigorous and distinguished career as a conductor .
" Our mother , who was 74 , started her career as a ballet dancer and subsequently worked as a choreographer and TV producer before dedicating the last years of her life to working as our father 's personal assistant .
" They both lived life to the full and considered themselves to be extremely lucky to have lived such rewarding lives , both professionally and personally . "
Downes was knighted in 1991 .
A Metropolitan police spokesman said Greenwich CID had launched an investigation .
" We continue to investigate the circumstances of their deaths .
[ There are ] no further details at this stage , " he said .
In the past , police have investigated cases in which British people have travelled to the Dignitas clinic .
Anyone assisting a person to end their life could face up to 14 years in prison .
Prosecutors have not pushed forward cases against families and friends of the growing numbers of Britons who have travelled to Dignitas to die , however , and there is fierce debate about whether the law should be changed to protect people from prosecution .
Last December , the Crown Prosecution Service announced it would take no action against the family of 23 - year - old Daniel James , who travelled to Switzerland to die after being paralysed from the chest down in a rugby accident .
The police did not investigate the deaths earlier this year of Peter and Penelope Duff , who became the first terminally ill British couple to be helped to die together in Switzerland .
Last week , the House of Lords voted against an attempt by the former lord chancellor Lord Falconer to relax the law on assisted suicide .
His amendment to the coroners and justice bill would have allowed people to help someone with a terminal illness travel to a country where assisted suicide is legal .
Debbie Purdy , who has multiple sclerosis , is seeking to clarify the law in the House of Lords .
She wants a ruling that her husband will not be prosecuted if he helps her travel abroad to die .
Some people fear that relaxing the law on assisted suicide would lead to an increase in cases , and put people at risk of being pushed into taking their own lives .
Gordon Brown is against a change in the law .
( CNN ) --
A fight over books depicting sex and homosexuality has riled up a small Wisconsin city , cost some library board members their positions and prompted a call for a public book burning .
A washing machine was part of a July 4 parade float made by a group seeking changes at West Bend 's library .
The battle has stirred much of West Bend , a city of roughly 30,000 people about 35 miles north of Milwaukee .
Residents have sparred for months on blogs , airwaves and at meetings , including one where a man told the city 's library director he should be tarred and feathered .
The row even spread to this year 's Fourth of July parade , which included a float featuring a washing machine and a sign that read " keep our library clean . "
" If you told me we would be going through a book challenge of this nature , I 'd think , ' Never in a million years , ' " said Michael Tyree , director of the West Bend Community Memorial Library .
The strife began in February when West Bend couple Jim and Ginny Maziarka objected to some of the content in the city library 's young - adult section .
They later petitioned the library board to move any sexually explicit books -- the definition of which would be debated -- from the young - adult section to the adult section and to label them as sexually explicit .
Ginny Maziarka , 49 , said the books in the section of the library aimed at children aged 12 to 18 included homosexual and heterosexual content she thought was inappropriate for youths .
She and her husband also asked the library to obtain books about homosexuality that affirmed heterosexuality , such as titles written by " ex- gays , " Maziarka said .
" All the books in the young - adult zone that deal with homosexuality are gay - affirming .
That 's not balance , " she said .
The library did not agree with the Maziarkas ' suggestions , and the couple appealed to the library board .
Ginny Maziarka , a mother of four , began blogging about the issue and the local newspaper picked up the dispute , sparking the opposition .
Maria Hanrahan , also a West Bend mom , set up a rival blog to argue the other side .
" I 'm against any other party telling me what 's appropriate for my child and what is n't , " said Hanrahan , 40 , who also created a West Bend Parents for Free Speech group .
" We do n't mean to say these are appropriate for everyone , but we do n't feel they should be set apart from other materials or restricted from the young - adult section . "
By this time , many more people had become caught up in the issue , which was generating heat .
When Hanrahan appeared on a local radio , callers attacked her views , she said .
" People were being very passionate on both sides of the issue .
I think it divided the community a little bit , " she said .
With the debate raging , the city council voted in April against renewing the terms of four library board members , in part because council members thought the board was dragging its feet , library director Tyree said .
The Maziarkas were still fighting to have books moved , having identified 82 questionable titles -- more than double their original list .
Then they stopped targeting a list of books and circulated a petition that asked the board to label and move to the adult section any " youth - targeted pornographic books " -- including books that describe sex acts in a way unsuitable for minors .
The books could still be checked out freely by anyone .
" We 're not talking about educational material .
We 're talking raunchy sex acts , " Maziarka said .
One book she objects to is " The Perks of Being a Wallflower , " in which a fictional teenage boy tells about his freshman year in high school , including rape and homosexual and heterosexual sex between teens .
Tyree said book excerpts found on Maziarka 's blog had been taken out of context and , in the case of " Wallflower , " the criticism missed some of the book 's points .
" In this book , there were consequences of ... rape , of indiscriminate sex .
Those were not portrayed so glowingly , " he said .
By the time the library board met on June 2 , each side had collected more than 1,000 signatures backing their position .
Dozens of residents spoke at the meeting before the board -- still including the outgoing members -- unanimously voted to keep all policies the same .
The demand to move the books was always going to be problematic because no authority has determined that any of the titles are pornographic or obscene , Tyree said .
Book challenges are n't new .
More than 500 were reported in the United States in 2008 , mostly in schools and public libraries , Deborah Caldwell - Stone of the American Library Association said .
But this one was attracting extra attention .
Caldwell - Stone , who monitored the dispute , said moving any young - adult book to the adult section would have been a form of censorship , even if teens were free to check them out .
" The whole intent was shelving books not on the basis of age or reading ability , but because they disapprove of the content with the intent of restricting access .
That 's a burden on First Amendment rights , " Caldwell - Stone said .
Outside West Bend , the fight caught the attention of Robert Braun , who , with three other Milwaukee - area men , filed a claim against West Bend calling for one of the library 's books to be publicly burned , along with financial damages .
The four plaintiffs -- who describe themselves as " elderly " in their complaint --- claim their " mental and emotional well - being was damaged by [ the ] book at the library . "
The claim , unconnected to the Maziarkas , says the book " Baby Be- bop " -- a fictional piece about a homosexual teenager -- is " explicitly vulgar , racial and anti-Christian . "
Braun , who says he is president of a Milwaukee group called the Christian Civil Liberties Union , said he singled out the book because it " goes way over the line " with offensive language and descriptions of sex acts .
The call for burning the book showed his passion , Braun , 74 , said .
" I do n't sit on the fence when I do these things .
When I make a decision to speak up on something , I go for it . "
The ALA will help the library oppose the claim if it goes forward , Caldwell - Stone said , adding she felt that was unlikely because " it has very little basis in law . "
Back in West Bend , the Maziarkas and their supporters are gearing up for another go at the library , in part because the board now has its four new members .
They do not want books burned , but they do want action .
" We want parents to decide whether they want their children to have access to these books ... and we want the library 's help in identifying [ them through labeling and moving ] , " Maziarka said .
" It 's just common sense . "

Caught in the act : a mountain mouse - deer photographed swimming underwater in Sri Lanka .
If you startled a deer , you might not expect it to jump into the nearest pond and submerge itself for minutes .
But that is exactly what two species of mouse - deer in Asia do when confronted by predators , scientists have found .
One other African mouse - deer species is known to do the same thing , but the new discovery suggests all ruminants may once have had an affinity with water .
It also lends support to the idea that whales evolved from water - loving creatures that looked like small deer .
There are around 10 species of mouse - deer , which are also called ' chevrotains ' .
All belong to the ancient ruminant family Tragulidae , which split some 50 million years ago from other ruminants , the group that went on to evolve into cattle , goats , sheep , deer and antelope .
Deer are supposed to walk on land and graze not swim underwater
Zoologist Erik Meijaard
Each is a small , deer - like creature that unusually does not have antlers or horns .
Instead they have large upper canine teeth , which in the males project down either side of the lower jaw .
The largest species , which stands no more than 80 cm tall , lives in Africa and is thought to be the most primitive of all mouse - deer .
Known as the water - chevrotain , this animal likes to live in swampy habitats .
When alarmed , it dashes for the nearest river where it submerges and swims underwater to safety .
All of the other species of mouse - deer , which live in southeast Asia and India and Sri Lanka were thought to be dry - land animals .
Diving deer
That was until researchers witnessed some remarkable behaviour during two separate incidents .
The first occurred in June 2008 during a biodiversity survey in northern Central Kalimantan Province in Borneo , Indonesia .
During the survey , observers saw a mouse - deer swimming in a forest stream .
When the animal noticed the observers it submerged .
Over the next hour , they saw it come to the surface four or five times , and maybe more unseen .
But it often remained submerged for more than five minutes at a time .
Eventually the observers caught the animal , which they identified as a pregnant female , then released it unharmed .
Among the survey team was the wife of Erik Meijaard , a senior ecologist working with the Nature Conservancy in Balikpapan , Indonesia .
Meijaard knew of anecdotal reports by local people who described deer hiding in creeks and rivers when chased by their dogs .
When he saw photos of the deer he identified it as a greater mouse - deer ( Tragulus napu ) .
Coming up for air
The same year , Meijaard also heard reports of a mouse - deer in Sri Lanka that had also been seen swimming underwater .
Three observers saw a mountain mouse - deer ( Moschiola spp ) run into a pond and start to swim , hotly pursued by a brown mongoose .
The mouse - deer submerged itself , and eventually the mongoose retreated .
The deer left the water only to be chased straight back into it by the mongoose .
" It came running again and dived into the water and swam underwater .
I photographed this clearly and it became clear to me at this stage that swimming was an established part of its escape repertoire , " says Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne , who saw the incident .
" Seeing it swim underwater was a shock .
Many mammals can swim in water .
But other than those which are adapted for an aquatic existence , swimming is clumsy .
The mouse - deer seemed comfortable , it seemed adapted , " he says .
Origins of whales Meijaard , Wijeyeratne and Umilaela , who saw the submerged Bornean mouse - deer , describe both incidents in the journal Mammalian Biology .
" This is the first time that this behaviour has been described for Asian mouse - deer species , " says Meijaard .
" I was very excited when I heard the mouse - deer stories because it resolved one of those mysteries that local people had told me about but that had remained hidden to science . "
" The behaviour is interesting because it is unexpected .
Deer are supposed to walk on land and graze not swim underwater .
But more interestingly for the zoologist are the evolutionary implications , " he says .
The behaviour bolsters one leading theory regarding the origin of whales .
In 2007 , scientists led by Hans Thewissen of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in Ohio published details of a remarkable fossil called Indohyus .
This fossil was of a ruminant animal that looked like a small deer , but also had morphological features that showed it could be an ancestor of early whales .
A mouse - deer in Borneo caught having spent 60 minutes trying to hide underwater Although speculative , that suggests that all early ruminants may also have led a partially aquatic lifestyle .
The discovery that two Asian species of mouse - deer are comfortable underwater shows that at least three species of modern tragulid share an aquatic escape behaviour .
Because these species diverged at least 35 million years ago , their ancestor also likely behaved in the same way , again bolstering the the idea that a deer - like ruminant may have evolved to produce the modern cetacean group of whales and dolphins .
Hippos , the closest modern relative of whales , also dive for water when threatened , a behaviour that may have been lost over time by other modern species such as sheep and antelope .

A dash cam video shows the deputy with his arms around the Stogner ’s neck after he was suspect of trying to swallow drugs .
Stogner died along Interstate 12 .
Preliminary results from the coroner show that Stogner died from “ severe coronary artery disease , an enlarged heart , and a fracture of the hyoid bone in his neck . ”

According to Michelle Malkin , Fox News should be free to include hate speech in its “ reporting , ” but liberal partisans should restrain themselves from pointing this out .
She considers calling abortion doctors , like George Tiller , “ murderers ” and “ baby killers ” to be simply part of the “ debate ” in the media .
Like her buddy , Fox News counterpart , Bill O’Reilly , she apparently believes that the real zealots are liberals against members of the media inciting violence .
How about that …

In a statement made to Digital Daily yesterday , Palm acknowledges firing yet another salvo in the ongoing dispute between Apple and Palm over the Palm Pre 's ability to sync iTunes media by emulating an iPod , claiming that it has reported Apple to the USB Implementers Forum for improper use of the Vendor ID used to identify devices using the USB interface .
" Palm has released webOS 1.1 , which , along with offering more robust EAS support for business users , re-enables Palm media sync , " said company spokesperson Lynn Fox .
" Palm believes that openness and interoperability offer better experiences for users by allowing them the freedom to use the content they own without interference across devices and services , so on behalf of consumers , we have notified the USB Implementers Forum of what we believe is improper use of the Vendor ID number by another member . "
Palm 's webOS 1.1 update issued yesterday restores the syncing connectivity broken by Apple last week with the release of iTunes 8.2.1 .
As PreCentral points out , the move is a bold statement by Palm given the company 's apparent misuse of Apple 's USB Vendor ID in order to permit iTunes media syncing .
I just plugged my 1.1 Pre into my Mac in Media Sync mode and sure enough , it 's identifying itself with an Apple USB Vendor ID :
Product ID : 0x8002
Vendor ID : 0x05 ac ( Apple Inc. )
Version : 0.16
Manufacturer : Palm Inc .
Such use of another manufacturer 's Vendor ID is " strictly prohibited " by the USB Implementers Forum :
When you apply for a USB Vendor ID , you sign a form that explicitly states that :
" Unauthorized use of assigned or unassigned USB Vendor ID Numbers and associated Product ID Numbers are strictly prohibited . "
Based on Palm 's actions , it appears that the company believes that Apple 's refusal to allow open access to iTunes via USB is a severe enough violation of the relatively open nature of the USB standards that it is willing to violate standards itself in order to work around Apple 's restrictions .
We can make a guess : USB being a relatively open ( albeit opt - in ) ' standard , ' either Palm thinks it 's improper for iTunes to only allow connectivity with certain Vendor IDs .
Since they feel they 're in the right there , I guess they do n't mind wading into the gray area of spoofing another company 's USB Vendor ID .
Rush Limbaugh tried to lie about George Allen 's racist " macaca " remark that cost him his Senate seat by claiming that it was all made up out of thin air by Democrats trying to destroy him .
Yeah , we just knew that Allen was waiting to utter a racial slur and call S.R. Sidarth a type of monkey , and then pounced and took it out of context .
How did we do that , RushBo ?
That 's more lying nonsense , but then he went off on Judge Sonia Sotomayor , saying that what she said was much worse than that .
What a guy that Limbaugh .
I mean , this is all they have to work with and I thank you .
Limbaugh is re-digging a ditch to throw George Allen back into and burying him in the process .
Thanks Media Matters :
LIMBAUGH : So Russ Feingold : A couple of words that Sonia Sotomayor said taken out of context .
You mean , like , macaca ?
George Allen saying macaca -- we heard about that for weeks and months as The Washington Post and the Democrats sought to destroy Allen ; he'd been a congressman , a governor , and a senator .
Sotomayor 's comments are much worse than macaca ; and they 're frequent , and they are long - held .
You see how this race thing works , folks .
If you 're a liberal , nothing you say can be held against you . "
I think Limbaugh is feeling the heat from DenounciaRush .
Presente Action released this statement today : " Rush Limbaugh has no shame -- launching more racist attacks on Judge Sotomayor during a historic week when her credentials are on full display and our community is beaming with pride .
Our elected leaders cannot remain silent in the face of these inflammatory comments polluting the public discourse .
We demand that Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee denounce Limbaugh 's latest remarks immediately . "
Allen was thought to be the great right - wing hope to run for president in 2008 , but being a racist was n't very helpful to him now was it ?

Philosophical Clerihews
By Dean Zimmerman
I 've wasted an inordinate amount of time on the lowest verse form in existence , the Clerihew .
Here 's the cream or the dregs , depending on how you look at it .
The first one ever written ( 1890 , by the 16 - year - old E. Clerihew Bentley ) went like this :
Sir Humphry Davy
Detested gravy .
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered Sodium .
Here 's a really good one by Maurice Hare :
Alfred de Musset
Used to call his cat Pusset .
His accent was affected .
That was to be expected .
The Poet 's Manual and Rhyming Dictionary of Frances Stillman defines the clerihew as " a humorous pseudo - biographical quatrain , rhymed as two couplets , with lines of uneven length more or less in the rhythm of prose .
It is short and pithy , and often contains or implies a moral reflection of some kind .
The name of the individual who is the subject of the quatrain usually supplies the first line . "
Bentley himself wrote a few on philosophers .
W. H. Auden has a book of clerihews with ones on Kierkegaard , Hegel , and a couple of others .
Paul Horgan 's book of clerihews has a few as well .
By and large the ones on philosophers are n't very good .
The best I know of are these :
Desiderius Erasmus
Suffered from one of the rare asthmas .
His worst wheezes
Were caused by over - ripe cheeses .
( Paul Horgan )
John Stuart Mill ,
By a mighty effort of will ,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote Principles of Political Economy *
*- `With some of their Applications to Social Philosophy ' .
It was a weakness of Voltaire's
To forget to say his prayers ,
And one which to his shame
He never overcame .
Sir James Jeans
Always says what he means ;
He is really perfectly serious
About the Universe being Mysterious .
( all by Bentley )
But the largest batch of philosophical clerihews follows ...

CAT COMMUNICATION - BODY LANGUAGE
Cats which communicate mostly with other cats use mainly on body language and scent - this is their " native language " .
Their body language is subtle , but many owners and cat workers learn to read the more obvious cues .
A BRIEF SUMMARY OF FELINE VOCALISATIONS
There are at least nineteen different types of " miaow " which differ in pitch , rhythm , volume , tone , pronunciation and the situations in which they are used .
The familiar purr may be used for contentment , self - reassurance or an invitation for close contact .
Injured or sick cats ( and even dying cats ) may purr because the sound frequency has been shown to soothe the cat and to promote healing .
The " miaow " and purr are just two of at least thirteen different categories of sound made by cats : caterwaul , chatter , chirrup ( chirp ) , cough - bark ( rare in pet cats ) , growl , hiss ( with or without spit ) .
meow , mew ( of kittens ) , purr , scream , squawk , yowl and idiosyncratic sounds ( i.e. sounds peculiar to an individual cat ) .
There are probably over 30 different sounds .
The number of sounds a cat makes depends on how much the cat communicates with ( a ) other cats and ( b ) other non-cats e.g. humans .
Cats which communicate with humans a lot have a wider spoken vocabulary because they learn that humans understand sounds but cannot easily understand feline body language .
Cats learn which sounds elicit the desired response from their human companions and some cats have a wider " vocabulary " than others .
Purring and vocal communication is discussed in detail in " Cat Communication - Vocal Language ( Cat Chat ) " .
You may also wish to read " Do Cats have Emotions "
HOUSECATS , FERAL CATS AND BIG CATS .
Housecats develop a wide variety of sounds to alert humans to their needs and intentions .
Many are variations on mother / kitten meow or chirp sounds which the cat has adapted in order to " speak " to non-cats .
This is quite logical since the cosseted housecat remains dependent on humans i.e. a permanent kitten .
Others are adult sounds such as the caterwaul ( used in a sexual or territorial context ) or the cough - bark ( a fear / anger sound usually accompanied by a front paw stamp ) .
Cats kept with other cats are communicating with each other all the time through body language and scent .
They are communicating with their owners all the time too , it 's our problem that we can't understand their language .
Cats work out which sounds elicit suitable responses from humans ( positive feedback ) and learn to make those sounds in order to achieve a particular aim e.g. for a door to be opened .
Since humans are in charge , it makes sense for the cat to learn to communicate vocally though it must sometimes be frustrating to a cat which has clearly communicated its mood using facial expression to have to explain things vocally to humans .
It is the feline equivalent of speaking slowly and loudly to a foreigner !
Cats have different personalities and this affects how much they want to " speak " to humans .
Personalities are partly controlled by genetics and partly by upbringing so both factors contribute to how much an individual cat talks .
Like some humans , some cats probably have nothing much they want to say !
Also , some owners are good at reading cat body language and the cat simply does n't need to vocalise quite so much .
Most cats tend not to vocalise with strangers unless the stranger approaches them ( less often the cat approaches a stranger for food or fuss ) .
The vocalisation then depends on whether the cat is fearful or friendly .
If fearful the cat may hiss or growl and thrash its tail ( agitation ) to warn the stranger not to approach any closer .
If friendly it will meow or purr and its tail will stick upwards ( greeting ) inviting attention , or possibly begging for food .
Stray cats living around restaurants learn to beg appealingly to diners - this is linked to food begging , though some do enjoy interaction and a fuss .
Cats also learn to communicate with other household animals e.g. dogs .
They are less likely to vocalise because dogs can interpret scent signals and can learn some feline body language .
Sometimes the cat must reinforce its unspoken message with a hiss if the other animals ignores or fails to understand body language .
Like cats , dogs also rely greatly on body language .
In a household setting , cats and dogs are in close enough proximity for long enough that they can learn each other 's body language to some degree .
Feral cats rely more on their native body language .
They do n't need so many variations of " meow " .
They use all the " major sounds " e.g. yowl , growl , etc but they rely much more on non-verbal communication to convey meaning - posture , gesture , facial expression , tail position , whisker position , ear position , scent - marking - with vocalisation often being a last resort to augment or reinforce the non-verbal communication or when they can't see each other properly .
Feral cats with little or no contact with humans do n't learn so much " spoken " language as do housecats .
They have no need to learn a vocalised " second language " because they are communicating with native speakers of " cat body language " .
Details of big cat vocalisation is out of scope of this article .
Big cats have their own repertoire of sounds e.g. the rumbled greeting of lionesses and the distinctive " chuff " of tigers .
Two important differences are that big cats such as lions , tigers , jaguars and leopards cannot purr because their throats are built for roaring .
Conversely , the small cats , puma and cheetah , screech or yowl rather than roar ( this is discussed in Cat Chat - Can Cats Talk " ) .
Although there are a few reports of purring - type sounds ( a breathy groaning sound rather than an in - and - out purr ) from lions and tigers , it seems that a cat can either purr or roar , but not both .
Purring is also found in the cheetah , puma and most small cats such as the serval and ocelot .
Cubs may " mew " , but adult big cats do not " meow " .
Individual big cats are sometimes tamed e.g. if hand - reared , but big cat species have never been domesticated in the same way as the housecat .
" Cat Chat - Can Cats Talk " suggests that living alongside humans has meant that the process of evolving a domestic subspecies from a wild ancestor went hand - in - hand with increased vocalisation in domestic cats .
Big cats have not been through thousands of years of evolving a domestic subspecies and have not needed to communicate with humans .
THE LANGUAGE OF SMELL
The first language a kitten learns is that of smell .
It is blind , deaf and defenceless but it has well - developed senses of smell and touch ( including warmth detection ) to guide it to the mother cat 's nipple .
A kitten recognises its own scent on the nipple and aims for the same nipple each feeding time .
The mother identifies her kittens by their individual scent and by her own scent on them .
This then is the first mode of communication the kitten learns .
Scent will play an important role all through the cat 's life .
Cats have scent glands on the chin , lips ( in the corners ) , temples and at the base of the tail .
Each cat has its own scent signature .
When it washes , a cat transfers its scent from these glands to its fur .
This scent is then transferred to objects the cat rubs against - a fencepost , twiggy plants , a doorway or a person 's legs .
For example , most of my doors have a grey greasy mark at cat 's cheek level where Cindy marks them over and over again .
They use this scent to mark areas and objects around them , other cats , humans and other animals in the household .
This helps create a communal smell .
A new cat must literally rub up to superior members of the group to mix their scents before becoming an accepted member of the group .
Its home territory also has a smell profile and any new smell - another cat or even a new piece of furniture or a scent carried in your shoes or clothing - can cause insecurity and lead to a frenzy of marking activity !
When a cat scratches it leaves both a visual marker and a scent marker from its paw - pads .
It will mark its territory by rubbing its chin or cheeks onto upright objects ( posts , chair - legs , door edges etc ) and also by spraying or depositing faeces .
Scent is so important that blind cats can navigate around their indoor territories using a combination of memory and scent trails .
Cats who are familiar and friendly with each other often have a greeting ritual .
They use a similar ritual to greet their humans or other household animals .
They rub their head , flank and tail against the other cat or person to exchange odours .
They hold the tail straight up so that the other cat can sniff the anal glands .
When stroked , cats raise their rumps even higher ( almost standing on tiptoe ) to invite you to sniff their anal glands !
The language of smell manifests itself in a less pleasant - to humans - way as well .
Tomcats spray pungent urine to mark their territories and to advertise their sexual status .
It 's the equivalent of a human marking out boundaries with flags advertising his age , healthiness and his readiness to service fertile females .
The urine is sprayed roughly at nose level , making it unmisable to other cats - and unmissable to humans if it is sprayed on doorposts , dustbins or indoors !
In areas where territories overlap , tomcats try to spray over other cats ' scent markings as well as refreshing their own scent markings .
An unfortunate side effect is that some spray indoors in response to scents carried in on shoes or clothing .
Female cats also spray and for the same reasons , though less commonly than males .
Neutered and unneutered cats of both sexes will spray and Siamese cats ( either sex , neutered or entire ) are often notorious sprayers .
Faeces is also a scent - laden marker .
Although common wisdom is that cats fastidiously bury their wastes , they may use faeces to mark territory - a behaviour known as middening .
Middening cats deposit their faeces in a prominent spot ( often on top of a tuft of grass or the middle of a path ) , often choosing the same place again and again to advertise their continued presence .
Middens are usually located at disputed areas of territory where challenges are likely to occur .
Sometimes this is indoors , the usual place being the bed .
A cat which has been upset by an intruder or unusual event middens in the place which smells most strongly of its human family , reinforcing the family bond .
Humans do n't see it the same way .
When a cat scratches a tree , scratching post , wallpaper or doormat ( or even the furniture ) this does several things .
As well as stropping the claws and exercising the leg muscles , it deposits scent from the paws onto the object .
The height of the scratch marks may be important in communicating the cat 's size and strength to any potential challenger .
The height of scratch markings above the ground appears to be important to tigers in advertising their age , size and strength and the same may be true of domestic cats .
Spraying , middening and scratching ensure that cats are communicating with each other even when not physically present .
Though these behaviours may be annoying to owners , to cats these scent laden markers are signposts , boundary markers and personal advertisements .
BODY LANGUAGE
Unlike dogs , cats do not generally co-operate to hunt or form cohesive packs .
Cat colonies are much looser groupings than the strictly hierarchical wolf - pack .
They have n't needed to evolve the social rules for pack living .
They mix with other cats when mating , raising kittens and in sociable groups such as feral colonies or multi-cat households .
Feline body - language is complex and subtle with ate least twenty - five different visual signals used in sixteen combinations .
There are doubtless many other , more subtle , nuances which we do n't notice .
Most owners can learn to recognise at least some of their cats ' visual signals .
The most dramatic body language occurs when rival males meet , during courtship or over fiercely protected territory ( in general , cats are happy to let other cats pass through their territory or even time - share it , but the core territory may be fiercely protected ) .
Neutered cats generally have less extreme interactions .
Many visual signals are displayed when cats play , either on their own , with other cats or with humans .
The aim of body language is to convey a message and to avoid or end physical confrontation .
The aggressor or challenger would prefer to win its case without resorting to teeth and claws since it could be badly injured in a fight .
Many disputes are resolved by staring each other down and yelling .
Sometimes it is so subtle that humans cannot tell there was potential conflict - the dominant cat , having won the confrontation , simply walks away from the loser , sits down and looks in another direction ( or start grooming - a favourite feline activity ) .
Body language has to be read by looking at the whole body - the face , the posture and the tail position .
Looking at one of these in isolation is misleading since they all combine into an overall message .
For example when a cat arches its back , is it upset or is it friendly ?
The same basic posture means two very different things depending on the facial expression , whether the fur is bristling and the eyes and the ears .
THE HEAD
A cat 's head position tells us several things .
If its head is stretched forward , the cat is encouraging touch or trying see its owners or another cat ’s facial expressions .
This is a greeting message .
In conflict , an assertive or confident cat may raise its head , but an aggressive cat will lower its head .
An inferior or submissive cat will also lower its head submissively .
An inferior cat which is fearful and defensively aggressive will raise its head though .
To understand the message , you have to look at the other end of the cat - its tail !
If the cat keeps its head down , pulls in its chin and turns sideways to prevent eye contact it is conveying a lack of interest and the fact that it is not threatening .
It will also pull in its chin when relaxed .
To understand the whole message you have to look at the way it holds its body .
Friendly cats will head - but or head rub and will extend this into a full body rub .
Cats will also head - butt and body - rub their humans .
The nose - bump is another friendly greeting .
When cats meet , they sniff each other 's faces - sniffing the scent glands around the lips to determine the identity of the other cat and whether it is a family member or not .
Sara and Ginny head - butting .
This is a friendly action and often ends up as a whole body rub and maybe also tail - twining .
The back - turned ears and the posture ( pulling away , but head turned to face the person approaching it ) shows that this young cat is flinching away ( see later for details on posture ) .
It had just arrived at a shelter and was friendly but nervous of its new surroundings .
THE EYES
Humans love eye contact - it is friendly .
For a cat , prolonged eye contact is an assertive , or even threatening , signal .
The classic case is when several people are in a room for a social occasion and the host 's cat walks in .
It unerringly goes towards the person who does n't like cats .
Is it simply being perverse ?
The answer is in eye contact .
Cat lovers will be watching the cat , hoping it goes to greet them .
Those who do n't particularly like cats will ignore it , hoping it will leave them alone .
For the cat , the eye contact made by the cat lovers is somewhat threatening .
It avoids them .
The people who do n't particularly like cats are not making eye contact - to the cat , they are signalling that they pose no threat .
They are being polite in cat terms , so it goes to socialise with them .
Rival cats try to out - stare each other to resolve conflicts .
When a cat realises it is being watched or stared at , it may stop whatever it is doing , assess the " threat " and then continue with its activity , but in a far more self - conscious way .
The cat knows it is being watched and becomes uncomfortable .
Only when it is no longer being watched , does it relax again .
This is one reason it is hard to study cats !
Slowly blinking breaks up an aggressive stare and is a reassuring signal between cats and between owners and cats .
Yawning is even more reassuring !
When relaxed , most cats have their eyes half - open , giving the appearance of being half - asleep .
Cats have excellent peripheral vision and tend not to stare directly at something unless they are getting a fix on a moving object in preparation for pouncing .
When a cat sits day - dreaming , it appears to be not looking at anything in particular .
It is actually taking in a great deal of information with its peripheral vision .
Some owners deliberately engage in " blink kissing " with their cats - when looking directly at a cat the owner blinks in a slow and deliberate manner .
This uses the cat 's own language to say " I am not threatening you , you can relax " .
The cat often blinks in response and then acts in a self conscious way , perhaps fluffing itself up or grooming .
While some owners claim " blink kissing " helps the cat - owner bond , the cat would no doubt prefer the owner to politely gaze into the middle distance and observe the cat using peripheral vision instead of a direct gaze .
Interestingly , behaviourists have tried the " gaze and blink " trick with big cats in zoos and have reported that lions and tigers will blink back at them .
A few readers have emailed me having tried the same .
This is not recommended since a direct gaze is a challenge and a big cat has no real need to reassure us of its friendly intentions - it sees us as potential prey .
The pupils of the eyes convey part of a cat 's message .
As well as dilating or contracting according to the amount of light around , they contract or dilate to indicate mood .
Dilated pupils accompany fear , aggressive excitement and also the mild excitement of seeing its owner , a feline friend or even dinner !
The more fearful a cat is , the wider its pupils expand - it is as if the eyes are trying to take in as much information as possible .
An angry , confident cat has narrowed pupils .
It may be ready to provoke a fight and by narrowing the pupils it can focus better on detail and also reduce the risk of damage to that part of the eye .
Nutmeg , the cat in the photo is alert and interested ( whiskers pricked forwards ) , but her dilated pupils indicate apprehension .
She was , in fact , rather apprehensive of the strange apparatus ( the camera ) pointed at her at relatively close range .
However her pricked whiskers indicate that she is not actually frightened .
The eyes alone cannot convey a whole message and if the cat is blind , its permanently dilated pupils cannot convey a message at all .
It is necessary to look at the rest of the cats face to piece together what it is saying .
This sounds like a lot of work , but most humans read human expressions instinctively .
If you can read human body language and facial expression , a little practice is all that is needed to learn the cat 's facial language .
THE EARS Cats ' ears are extremely mobile .
With 20 - 30 muscles controlling them .
They can swivel through 180 degrees and move up and down .
They can be pricked forward or flattened sideways or backwards .
The Scottish Fold cat , with its permanently folded ears , is at a slight disadvantage here .
A cat can move its ears independently of each other .
Not only do they pan around like radar dishes , scanning for any sound , the ears are important instruments of communication - they act like semaphores signals .
Some wild cats species have dark ears with white or pale markings on the back .
The make the ear signals even more visible , especially at dusk and dawn when cats are most active .
Ear tufts , such as seen in the lynx and caracal , also emphasise the movement and position of the ears and may help short - tailed species ( e.g. lynx ) compensate for their lack of tail .
Note : in experiments with caracals , the ear tufts also help pick up sound vibrations , caracals whose ear tufts were trimmed off were less able to hunt small prey in long grass .
When content and relaxed , a cat sits with its ears facing forward but tilted slightly back .
However , its ears demonstrate that the cat is alert even when it appears half asleep .
If the cat 's attention is caught by a noise or a movement , its pricks its ears more upright , maybe swivelling one or both to track the source of the noise .
If the cat grows anxious , its ears move slightly back and flatten down .
An fearful cat has lowered ears .
The more anxious or fearful the cat is , the flatter the ears until they are lying straight backwards , flat to the skull .
If the cat is fearful but aggress , the ears flatten sideways - a combination of the forward pointing " alert " ears and the flattened / lowered " fearful " ears .
If one ear is flattened and the other is n't , the signal is more ambivalent and the cat is n't yet sure how to react to what is going on around it .
Generally it will withdraw a short way in order to consider the situation .
While considering , the ears shift and change as it processes stimuli and possible responses .
A similar highly mobile state occurs when the ears are panning round to catch noises , but the cat 's entire demeanour will be one of alertness or interest , probably with a slightly twitching tail .
Ear flicking or " ear flagging " ( flattening and horizontally moving one ear ) has been reported by some of my readers .
John Whitehead , a biology teacher in the UK , suggests it is also used as a way of pointing in a certain direction .
This , he believes , can be seen when a cat is on a " walk through " of another cat 's territory and encounters the resident feline .
After a pause and some facing down , the visiting cat is signalled in a direction by the resident cat flicking one ear .
He believes that some pet cats extend this to communicate with humans , for example when a door is opened and the cat given a choice of in or out , it may signal its intention to stay indoors by ear flicking towards its favourite chair .
I am not convinced about ear flagging , but it merits further study .
A more usual explanation is that the cat is in two minds about something and its uncertainty results in ambiguous ear signals .
THE WHISKERS AND MOUTH
The whiskers are not just for judging the width of gaps or the proximity of objects .
They are also mobile and help to indicate the cat 's mood .
In a normal relaxed " neutral " state , they are held slightly to the side .
As the cat becomes more interested in something around it , the whiskers perk forwards , ultimately coming forwards in front of the muzzle ( a good position for the shorter whiskers to detect the bite point on the prey 's neck ) .
The cheek pads also seem to swell out as the muscles pull the whiskers into position .
If the cat is fearful , it pulls its whiskers back alongside its cheeks to signal that it is non-threatening .
This also makes its face look smaller .
A cat rarely uses its mouth to signal aggression .
An open - mouthed yawn may signal non-threat .
An open - mouthed snarl or hiss show that the cat feels threatened and defensive .
Growls are delivered with the mouth only slightly open .
The teeth - bared grimace is not a dog - like snarl , it is the cat 's flehmen reaction - one way in which a cat analyses scent signals .
Flower is yawning .
Her whiskers are pricked outwards and slightly forwards .
Her ears are pricked ( the flattened one is actually listening to a sound ! ) indicating alertness .
She is neither aggressive nor defensive and though relaxed , it is still alert to its surroundings .
When reading a cat 's expression , be aware of its surroundings .
Affy may look angry ( narrow pupils , ears back ) but she is actually yawning .
Many cats partly flatten their ears when they yawn widely .
Flower , the cat in the photo is yawning - its whiskers are pricked slightly forward , its ears are pricked ( the flattened one is actually listening to a sound ! ) indicating alertness .
The cat is at ease - neither aggressive nor defensive and though relaxed , it is still alert to its surroundings .
Some cats sit with their tongue sticking out a little .
This seems to show relaxation and contentment or that the cat has become interested in something .
On the one hand it gives the cat a rather daft look .
On the other hand it gives the cat a look of concentration .
Licking the lips may indicate anxiety or anticipation depending on what is happening around it .
Cats may lick their lips slightly as food is presented ( as part of the flehmen action where it is sniffing what 's on offer ) , but reserve real lip - licking to clean away food debris after eating .
Cats may also lick their lips when they are about to vomit .
When cats yawn they are not so much bored as signalling reassurance and contentment .
Sometimes yawning at a timid cat ( and blinking slowly while gazing into space ) will help it to relax .
Cats also yawn during their waking - up routine e.g. as they stretch .
When a cat yawns its whole face appears to split open !
THE TAIL
The tail is an organ of balance , a rudder / counterbalance for manoeuvring at high speed and a means of communication .
While hunting or stalking , the tail is kept almost horizontally behind the cat .
This prevents it from fouling in low - hanging shrubs and prevent the prey from seeing a telltale tail .
It may spring upright during the final rush .
The tail also conveys a cat ’s interest and concentration with a twitching movement as it corners its prey .
You can also see this twitching movement , usually just the tip of the tail , when a cat sees something interesting through a window .
When a cat is crouched low to the ground , edging forward towards prey , the slight twitch of its tail indicates how hard it is concentrating .
The tail is an important tool for communicating with other cats and with humans .
It is highly mobile : side to side , up and down , graceful and slow , thrashing and whip - like .
It can be a sleep coil folded around a sitting or sleeping cat , a fluffy scarf across a curled cat 's nose or an erect bristling bottlebrush when the cat is frightened .
A mother cat may also use it - deliberately or accidentally - as a toy for her kittens .
Relaxed , alert and confident - ears pricked , whiskers slightly drooping , tail drooping from horizontal .
Shampoo is off to greet a friendly person .
These two ferals first greet each other by stretching and then by rubbing and tail - twining to mix scents to reinforce their bond .
When a cat is relaxed , confident and alert , it walks with its tail horizontally behind it or even slightly drooping .
This prevents the tail from becoming snagged in undergrowth .
If it meets a friendly cat or friendly human , the tail goes up like a flag - pole to convey its friendliness .
If it is friendly but cautious of the other cat or person , the upright tail is hooked over at the tip indicating a degree of uncertainty .
A mother cat 's upright tail is a signal for her kittens to follow and their upright tails may help littermates or their mother to spot their whereabouts .
A spraying cat also adopts the tail up posture , tail a -quiver and treading / dancing with the hind feet , trying to lift its rump higher .
When a cat meets its owner and wants to extend a friendly greeting , the tail goes up and quivers , but there is no spray of urine .
It is the cat 's version of " I am SO happy to see you , I am overcome with emotion . "
Many owners refer to this as " feather - dancing " because the upright tail resembles a quivering feather .
It may pull its upright tail slight forwards over the back , kinked down a little at the tip and give a little chirp at the same time .
This invites the cat / person it is greeting to sniff the anal glands and confirm its identity as a group member .
When kittens greet their mother , they run to her with their tails upright like small flag - poles .
They droop , twine or rub their tails around their mother 's rump or tail to solicit food from her .
Adult cats also tail - twine .
They entwine tails with friendly cats as they rub against each other ( the tail has scent from the anal glands on it from where the cat has washed it ) .
They also wrap their tails around human legs or objects .
This both marks the leg or object and , if they are tail - wrapping part of the owner , is an attempt to get attention , fuss and food !
When a cat is at rest , but readying itself for action , it sweeps its tail erratically from side to side .
It seems to accompany the feline thought process of " do I or do n't I ? " .
As it becomes more alert or more emotionally charged , the tail swishes faster , wider and in a more regular manner .
If the cat is lying on its side , the tail will be thumping on the floor , often loudly .
Though this is most often associated with anger , it may also indicate another highly charged emotion - some cats thrash their tail in ecstasy when being groomed .
Violent thrashing therefore indicates high excitement or imminent aggression .
A swishing or thumping tail is sometimes an invitation for another cat to join in a bout of play .
Very few cats wag their tails in happiness like dogs .
The other easily recognisable tail signal is the upright bottle - brush tail .
This indicates that the cat feels seriously threatened and has become defensively aggressive i.e. it would rather get away , but if provoked it will defend itself .
The tail doubles in size and the hair on the cat 's spine also stands erect ( pilo- erection ) .
As well as indicating the cat 's state of mind , it makes the cat look bigger than it really is in an attempt to make the aggressor leave it alone .
The " inverted L " is a sign of conflict .
The first inch or so of the tail is horizontal and the remainder points straight downwards .
The " Inverted U " or " Horseshoe " tail , often with the fur erect , is defensive aggression , but can also be seen during the " mad half hour " when the cat rushes around as though it has the wind under its tail .
Kittens frequently use the inverted horseshoe during play and mock - battle .
When the cat stretches its forelegs , its tail may come right forward over the head .
When it stretches the back legs , the tail may end up upright and hooked over .
Sometimes the upright tail is jerked suddenly and briefly forwards .
This seems to be the feline version of the human " two fingers " obscene gesture .
It denotes mild irritation or derision .
You might see this if you address your cat as it is walking around - the cat acknowledges you , but has its mind set on other things and is making a " So what ! " exclamation .
POSTURE
As previously mentioned , a defensive cat erects its fur to appear bigger than it really is .
A dominant cat will also try to look bigger than it really is , perhaps swaggering a little .
In both cases , the cats are bluffing to try to avoid conflict .
An aggressive cat will straighten its legs ( the hind legs are longer than the forelegs , so its rear end will be higher than its shoulders ) and erect the hair along its spine and tail into a ridge to make itself look more impressive .
A defensive cat erects not only a ridge of fur , but all of its fur , puffing itself out .
It arches its back and positions itself side - on to its aggressor to make itself look larger still .
It wants the attacker to think twice about attacking it .
If the attacker pauses , the victim may move sideways in a crab - like fashion ( frequently seen in playing kittens ) ; it moves slowly away from its aggressor , watching for any sign of attack .
The slow retreat is an attempt to avoid provoking a sudden or instinctive attack .
In contrast , a submissive cat wants to appear small and unthreatening .
It may shrink into a crouch indicating that it wants only to be left alone .
If this does n't work , it may sink down on one side demonstrating its submissiveness .
If the other cat still threatens , the victim will roll over onto its back , turning its head to face its attacker .
This is an appeasement gesture .
Unlike the dog , which will go belly - up in full submissive mode , a cat on its back is still a formidable opponent .
It has done its utmost to avoid conflict , but if the aggressor continues to press the attack , the victim is able to fight back with all four sets of claws and with teeth .
In this position , if the aggressor jumps on its victim , victim 's fore legs can clasp the aggressor close to the victim 's teeth .
Meanwhile , the hind legs are especially dangerous as they may disembowel the other animal ( and are sometimes used in this way against same - size prey such as rabbits which have not been killed outright - something which can be seen when a cat plays with a stuffed toy ) .
There are other reasons a cat rolls over .
Playful cats roll over in order to use all four paws , claws sheathed , to " defend " itself , sometimes mock - biting the other cat or the owner .
Some cats roll over to greet their owners - this appears to be leftover kitten behaviour when it invited mother cat to " groom " her kitten 's belly .
Owners often misinterpret " belly up " as being submissive , or an open invitation for tummy - tickles , and wonder why their cat bites or scratches them .
In adult cats , “ belly up ” is an expression of trust . . . and your cat is trusting you to NOT touch its belly .
To return the greeting , a head rub or just offering your hand to be sniffed tells the cat you ’ve understood its greeting .
Of course , some cats enjoy having their bellies rubbed , but unless you know your cat is one of these , do n’t cause offence by assuming every display of furry tummy is an invitation to tickle .
Oestrus females roll wantonly in front of males to solicit their attention .
Cats also roll as a way of scratching their backs , often rolling on hot pavements or in dust - baths .

The trial has n't even started yet , but the record labels appear to have had their fill of the crazy antics of Team Tenenbaum .
As the second US trial against a file - sharing defendant approaches ( it starts July 27 ) , the labels have asked the judge for limited summary judgment — they want a ruling that Joel Tenenbaum 's alleged P2P use is not " fair use . "
Tenenbaum does n't come across as a particularly sympathetic defendant in the motion , especially since he appeared to admit to doing the deed during his initial deposition .
" The list of P2P networks that Defendant has used over the years reads like an entry from a P2P encyclopedia : Napster , AudioGalaxy , iMesh , Morpheus , KaZaA , and LimeWire , among others , " say the labels .
Even though Tenenbaum was notified in 2005 that the labels intended to file suit against him , his " Gateway computer contains evidence that Defendant was using the LimeWire file sharing program in February 2007 , and possibly as late as May 2008 , long after this case was filed , to distribute thousands of music files to other LimeWire users . "
Gutsy ( or really stupid ) — but if true , the charge meshes perfectly with the behavior of Tenenbaum 's own legal team .
One member of that team uploaded some of the songs at issue in the case to a file - hosting service , and Harvard Law's Charles Nesson ( who leads the Tenenbaum defense team ) posted the site password on his public blog .
Arguing that Tenenbaum " did n't do it " looks like a losing strategy .
Instead , Nesson & Co. have decided to claim that Tenenbaum 's file - sharing was simply a permitted " fair use " of copyrighted material under US copyright law .
That law contains four factors used to make such a determination , but since all four go quite obviously against Tenenbaum , he has proposed using a few more factors of his own devising .
( The law only says that " the factors to be considered shall include ... " the four listed , implicitly allowing additional factors in some cases . )
The labels have nothing but scorn for these extra factors .
" In his recent deposition on fair use issues , Defendant explained that his fair use defense also relies on factors such as how much music he later purchased , whether he discussed his downloads with friends , whether he downloaded a whole album or just one song off of an album , whether he profited from his distribution , his state of mind ( i.e. , did he know whether it was illegal ) , the extent to which he ' identified ' with a song , whether a song ' expresses ' who he is , and whether P2P use benefits ' obscure ' songs . "
The labels can also thank Nesson 's " radical transparency " for one of their own arguments — one in which they point out that not even Nesson 's own group of free culture warriors agree with the fair use claim being made here .
In the labels ' view , Tenenbaum 's action poses no real question about fair use .
" Defendant downloaded complete copies of Plaintiffs ' sound recordings for free , and then distributed them to others without alteration .
Whether he ' identifies ' with a song or not , Defendant added nothing creatively .
He took copyrighted music without paying for it , kept it on his computer for his own benefit , and then distributed it to others without doing anything that could remotely be considered transformative .
Defendant ’s purpose was to avoid the cost of buying the music — which he concedes was widely available to him from legitimate sources , including both physical retailers and online sources ... "
" No conceivable set of facts exists that would allow Defendant ’s unlawful copying and distribution to be considered fair use , and every court to rule on the issue on facts nearly identical to those presented here has rejected any claim of fair use by infringers like Defendant . "
The labels argue that there is no disputed fact to decide on this issue ( and therefore no jury is required ) , so they want Judge Nancy Gertner to rule that fair use does not apply in the case .
If the labels win on this matter , it 's easy to envision the trial going very , very badly for Team Tenenbaum .
Tenenbaum has until Friday to respond .
JULY 8-- A teenage cheerleader stole $ 187 from a wheelchair - bound boy who had earned the money selling t- shirts for a charity , police charge .
Chelsea Steele , 17 , was arrested last Friday , a few hours after she allegedly robbed Joseph Green at a Marietta , Georgia community pool house where Green was ' selling t- shirts and hats ... for charity , ' according to a criminal warrant .
Steele , who attends Sprayberry High School , is listed as a member of the school 's varsity cheerleading squad in a roster available for downloading from the school 's web site ( though it appears that her name was scrubbed elsewhere from the site following her July 3 bust ) .
Steele , pictured here in a Cobb County Sheriff 's Office mug shot , is facing a felony robbery count ( she was also hit with an underage alcohol possession rap ) .
Police are investigating whether Steele had accomplices , since she was spotted fleeing the pool house in the company of a friend , with whom she departed the area in a Ford Taurus .

A Russian programmer named Sergey Aleynikov was picked up this past Friday by the FBI for allegedly stealing and passing along code that , if circulating out in the wild , could expose US markets to manipulation and cost Aleynikov 's former employer , Goldman Sachs , millions .
Bloomberg quotes assistant US Attorney Facciponti saying that " there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways .
The copy in Germany is still out there , and we at this time do not know who else has access to it . "
So how could a 32 MB compressed source code archive pose a threat to markets and to America 's most powerful investment bank ?
The story is actually less complex than it may sound .
Recovering the black box
In a nutshell , the " black box " trading platforms of Goldman and other banks use a combination of proprietary , secret algorithms and the fastest hardware available to take in a torrent of news and other market data and generate a stream of trades that are timed to the millisecond .
So , instead of operating on the old stock market adage , " buy on the rumor , sell on the news , " a high - frequency trading platform like Goldman 's will buy a few milliseconds after the news hits , then sell moments later at a very small premium to other traders and platforms who did n't get the news in ( or their trades out ) quite as fast .
Do this billions of times a day , and voila , you 're printing money .
Obviously , to make a scheme like this work , you need a few things , one of which is hardware that 's at least a few milliseconds faster than everyone else 's ( see my previous post on the high - frequency trading " arms race " ) .
The second main ingredient is software that , given a set of data inputs , can figure out which trades everyone else is likely to make in response to those same inputs , so that the platform can get there first and be holding those assets when everyone else suddenly decides they want them .
If you have your hands on the code that runs on Goldman 's trading platform — again , one of the largest in the world — then you know with 100 percent accuracy which trades Goldman 's computers are going to make in response to a given set of inputs .
All you need then is even faster hardware so that you can get to those trades just a few milliseconds before Goldman , and you 'll always beat the bank and therefore be able to sell to Goldman at a slight premium .
Goldman will therefore make less on every trade , since you 'll essentially be usurping their place in the pecking order .
When US government prosecutors claim that the release of Goldman 's secret sauce could potentially expose markets to manipulation , what they 're really saying is that some unknown party could use it to out - manipulate Goldman , and possibly even do something more ambitious like frustrate Goldman 's platform so that it fails while simultaneously finding some way to short it .
Given that Goldman 's platform is one of the main providers of liquidity to the market ( i.e. , it fills a market function by holding assets that everyone will want shortly , and then selling them to all comers ) , it would ostensibly be a bad thing if it suddenly blew up .
How Aleynikov did it
The FBI 's complaint ( PDF ) in the case describes how Aleynikov pulled off his heist of the code .
During the first five days in June , the programmer , whose Linked In profile describes him as VP of Equity Strategy , ran some scripts via a bash shell that copied and compressed a bunch of source code , then sent it out via HTTPS to a German server — about 32 MB total over four separate occasions , which is actually quite a lot of compressed ASCII source code .
Aleynikov tried to cover his tracks by having the script erase his bash history , but Goldman 's machines actually keep a backup of everyone 's bash history , which is how they figured out what he had done .
The bank was tipped off by the HTTPS transfers , which seem to have set off some sort of alarm that invited further scrutiny .
The programmer had informed Goldman that he was quitting and going to work for Chicago - based Teza Technologies , LLC , another high - frequency trading shop that has now suspended his employment in the wake of his arrest .
He was released on a $ 750,000 bond today and now awaits trial .
This story is still developing , and I encourage you to read the second half of Matthew Goldstein 's Reuters story , which is where the arrest first came to light , to get a sense of where it 's headed .
( Zero Hedge is also on top of this ) .
In particular , there are a number of very odd twists here , the latest of which makes the New York Stock Exchange look particularly bad .
The NYSE puts out a weekly list of the top program traders by volume , and Goldman typically tops this list by a country mile .
Then last week 's list came out , and Goldman 's name was shockingly absent .
And today , now that the code theft story is out , the NYSE has put out a statement claiming that Goldman 's absence on the list was the result of a " system error ; " it has also released a revised list showing Goldman once again dominating program trading activity .
Needless to say , many econ bloggers are incredulous that the top entrant in the weekly program trading list suddenly went missing last week and nobody at the NYSE caught the error before now , especially given the Aleynikov news and the timing of the " error . "
Conspiracy theories are legion , and even if none of them are true , it 's hard to shake the feeling that this story is about to blow up into a major scandal .

Careless Twitterers are in for a healthy dose of Web 2.0 reality with the advent of a site that shows it 's not really possible to purge errant tweets , as the microblogging site might have them believe .
It has long been plenty easy for world + dog to find a user 's deleted posts by using Twitter 's advanced search page .
Now , a site called Tweleted offers an interface that makes it even simpler .
Plug in the name of any Twitter user and it will display all recently deleted items .
It 's the latest wakeup call to Web 2.0 aficionados that once they reveal personal information online , there 's no taking it back - no matter what anyone tells you .
British television star Jonathan Ross got an object lesson in the permanence of web postings on Monday when he Tweeted his personal email address , apparently by accident .
He quickly deleted the post , but his email address remains available in public searches .
The same thing goes for the legions of Twitterers who got duped into revealing their " porn star name , " which is said to consist of the name of one 's first pet followed by the street name where one grew up ( or the name of one 's first teacher ) .
As Sarah Palin and others can attest , the online availability of such information makes it much easier for scammers to glean details that facilitate password stealing and identity theft .
Plenty of Twitterers who played the game later realized their folly and deleted the posts .
Of course , the ill - advised tweets are still available on Tweleted .
The discovery has prompted Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at anti-virus provider Sophos , to call on Twitter to actually purge deleted tweets from its system .
While that 's not a bad idea , the move would have no bearing on search engine caches and , more importantly , any private firms that may monitor and cache material posted to Twitter , Facebook , and other Web 2.0 properties . ®
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Ford Motor Co. reported a net profit in the second quarter thanks to efforts to reduce its debt .
But the company posted another operating loss during the second quarter due to a continued slump in sales .
Still , that loss was much smaller than a year ago and Wall Street 's forecasts .
The company converted much of its debt to equity during the period through an offer to shareholders .
Ford reduced its automotive debt by $ 10.1 billion .
That debt reduction caused Ford to post a one - time gain of $ 2.8 billion , which allowed the company to report net income of $ 2.3 billion , or 69 cents a share in the quarter .
Ford posted a net loss of $ 8.7 billion a year ago .
But Ford , the only U.S. automaker not to file for bankruptcy during the second quarter , reported an operating loss of $ 638 million , or 21 cents a share in the period , excluding special items .
That 's an improvement over the 63 cents a share Ford lost on that basis in the year ago period .
Analysts surveyed by earnings tracker Thomson Reuters were predicting an operating loss of 48 cents .
Shares of Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) gained more than 9 % in early morning trading following the report .
Ford said that total revenue fell 29 % to $ 27.2 billion , as global vehicle sales volume tumbled 25 % in the quarter .
But Ford 's revenue also beat forecasts .
Analysts were expecting a drop of 36 % to $ 24.8 billion .
CEO Alan Mulally told investors he expected industrywide sales to stay sluggish around the globe for at least the rest of this year .
" Clearly the road ahead remains challenging .
The recovery is likely to be more modest than many of us had hoped , " he said on a conference call .
" Despite the challenges , Ford 's underlying business is getting progressively stronger . "
Reduced cash burn and improving market share helping results
The company 's auto operations burned through $ 1 billion in the period , but that too was better than the $ 3.7 billion in cash it burned through in the first quarter of the year .
Executives said the company 's cash burn could top $ 1 billion in the third quarter but that they did not expect to go through more cash in the second half of the year than the company did in this year 's first six months .
Ford said it finished the quarter with about $ 21 billion in cash on hand following its debt - for - equity swap and decision to tap a $ 10 billion line of credit in the first quarter .
That cash position allowed the automaker to avoid a government bailout at the same time that the Treasury Department was pumping billions of dollars into rivals General Motors and Chrysler Group to keep those companies alive throughout their bankruptcy reorganizations .
Mulally said that he believes the fact that Ford did not need a government bailout was one factor that helped it improve its U.S. market share in the first half of the year .
Through the first six months of 2009 , Ford accounted for 16.1 % of U.S. auto sales , up from 15.5 % in the year - earlier period .
" We are getting a very positive response for creating a strong long - term business , which people think about when they buy a car , " he said .
Ford , which has been trailing GM and Toyota Motor ( TM ) in annual U.S. sales for the past few years , has been pulling closer to Toyota recently .
In fact , Ford sold more vehicles in the U.S. than Toyota in the second quarter .
The company said it expects to continue gaining market share in Europe this year as well , and that it remains on track to track to achieve or beat all of its 2009 financial targets , including $ 4 billion in cost cuts this year .
Ford also reiterated that it expected its North American auto operations would break even or make money by 2011 and stop burning through cash by that time .
Analysts impressed by Ford 's performance
Shares of Ford have soared more than 340 % in the past five months , prompting speculation that the company will soon sell additional shares as a way to raise cash and further reduce its debt .
When questioned about whether there would be such a stock sale , Mulally would only say that " clearly our plan is to continue to improve our balance sheet as we did in the second quarter . "
Prior to the second quarter report , analysts were still forecasting more operating losses for Ford in the third and fourth quarters of this year .
Company officials did not give earnings guidance for the third quarter or the full year , but Ford 's chief financial officer seemed to hint that higher production levels in the third and fourth quarters could help boost results .
" Volumes do drive our profits , " said Ford CFO Lewis Booth .
Analysts said they were impressed by Ford 's financial performance in the quarter , considering the weak sales .
Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy said during the conference call that he calculated Ford 's North American plants ran at just a bit above 50 % of capacity in the second quarter .
" That 's a horrifically low level , and the losses are pretty good performance in the face of that , " he said .

One of the black box flight recorders from the Yemeni plane which crashed in the Indian Ocean on Tuesday has been located , a French official has said .
Efforts to retrieve the recorder will begin during the day , the official added , quoted by AFP news agency .
Meanwhile doctors say the only survivor of the crash , teenage girl Baya Bakari , is recovering and in no danger .
Find out more about the black box
The plane , flying from the Yemeni capital Sanaa to the Comoros , came down in bad weather with 153 on board .
There were 66 French nationals among the passengers .
Most of the rest were Comorans .
See large map and timeline Most of the passengers had flown on a different Yemenia aircraft from Paris or Marseille before boarding flight IY626 in Sanaa .
" The black box 's signal was located yesterday [ Tuesday ] at 1630 local time ( 1230 GMT ) by an aerial patrol , 40 km [ 25 miles ] from Grande Comore , " a spokeswoman for Co-operation Minister Alain Joyandet said .
Most aircraft have a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder .
It was not clear which of the two from the Yemeni plane had been located .
' Still hope ' A French vessel has been sent to the site to start recovery operations , she added .
French rescue teams are already involved in the search for survivors .
She 's a very timid girl , I never thought she would escape like that

But AFP news agency quoted hospital sources in the Comoros capital Moroni as saying they were preparing to receive another child survivor who had been found early in the morning .
Sources close to the Comoran rescue team say the only confirmed survivor , who has been named as Baya Bakari , was being treated in Moroni and her condition had improved .
The Associated Press news agency quoted her father as saying she had been travelling with her mother to the Comoros from Paris to visit family .
Kassim Bakari said she had been ejected from the plane when it came down and clung to debris for several hours until she was rescued .
" She 's a very timid girl , I never thought she would escape like that , " he said , describing her as " fragile " and barely able to swim .
He added that he was mourning the loss of his wife whilst overjoyed at his daughter 's extraordinary escape .
Doctors at the hospital said she had cuts to her face and a fractured collarbone , but was not in danger .
" She is very calm given the shock she suffered , " surgeon Ben Imani told Reuters .
Angry protest
France said the plane had been banned from its airspace The French transport ministry had earlier said the Airbus 310 plane which crashed had been banned from France because of " irregularities " .
But Yemenia responded by criticising " false information and speculation about technical problems " on the plane .
Several Comoran expatriates angry with what they see as the poor state of the company 's aircraft tried to stop passengers from checking in for another Yemenia flight leaving Paris Charles de Gaulle airport for Sanaa .
About 60 people failed to check in , reports said , but it was not clear how many did so as a result of the protest .
The crash was the second involving an Airbus aircraft in recent weeks .
On 1 June an Air France Airbus 330 travelling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris plunged into the Atlantic , killing all 228 people on board .
Clarification Thursday 23 July 2009 : A French minister later the same day denied the report that the " black box " signal had been found , and said that the sound picked up by rescuers had come from a distress signal .
HOW THE BLACK BOX WORKS
Flight data recorders , or " black boxes " , are in fact orange or red , and are located at the tail end of the aircraft .
Commercial aircraft carry two .
One logs performance and condition of aircraft in flight , another records conversations of crew and their contact with Air Traffic controllers during the flight .
The Crash Survivable Memory Unit ( CSMU ) contains a memory board surrounded by thermal insulation and steel armour that can withstand a crash impact thousands of times the force of gravity and survive in the sea at depths of 20,000 ft ( 6,096 m ) .
The CSMU is insulated to sustain temperatures up to 1,100C for up to an hour or " low " temperature fires of around 260C for 10 hours .
An underwater locator beacon fitted on recorders emits continuous ultrasonic " ping " when they come into contact with water .
The signal can reach the surface from depths of 14,000ft .

Dot Earth often had the feel of an accelerating hamster wheel ( see posts marked with the fire hose image ) .
But it was a wheel of my own creation , given the broad question I chose to pursue starting back in October , 2007 – how do humans navigate this century with the fewest regrets ?
Countless relevant developments and insights slipped by before I could note them , which is why Twitter and Facebook , in the end , became my real web log – my way of assessing , relating and sharing consequential nuggets crossing my screen .
( I hope you ’ll continue to follow me there ; just click on the preceding links . )
Before this blogging adventure ends this weekend , there ’s one sad development that I feel compelled to catch up with — the untimely death in August 2015 of Linda J. Gormezano — a tireless Arctic - focused field biologist from the American Museum of Natural History .
I first wrote about Gormezano ’s innovative work studying coyote and polar bear populations with the help of her scat - sniffing Dutch shepherd , Quinoa , back in 2007 .
But I kept track of the important batch of studies she produced in subsequent years , and the healthy debate they had prompted .
Her work showed that polar bears , while best known for their life at sea or on sea ice pursuing seals , have been able , at least in some circumstances , to gain significant nutrition on land as well , scarfing down geese and goose eggs , grasses and other fare when sea ice is in retreat .
There have been substantial , sometimes rancorous , debates among polar bear researchers about this predator ’s prospects in a warming climate with less summer sea ice .
Robert F. Rockwell , a Museum of Natural History population biologist and ecologist who was one of Gormezano ’s mentors since she started at the museum as a grad student , made no secret of his frustration with what he felt was agenda - driven resistance to publishing some of her findings .
After her death ( from natural causes unrelated to her work ) , he persisted at finding a home for her final paper , co-written with him and colleagues Scott R. McWilliams and David T. Iles .
The paper was published in September in the journal Conservation Physiology .
You can read it here : “ Costs of locomotion in polar bears : when do the costs outweigh the benefits of chasing down terrestrial prey ? ”
Rockwell has posted an inspiring written and pictorial tribute to Gormezano .
I hope you ’ll click and read and pass it around .
He starts out describing her , as a spirited and talented student , as “ every professor ’s dream . ”
In this excerpt , you can read how she quickly became much more than that , steering the museum ’s research program in new directions : Read more …
of lunar exploration and irate astrologers
Astrologers are irate because , apparently , we did n't ask the Moon for its consent to be probed .
There ’s a reason why your horoscope is usually in the entertainment section of your local paper or the search portal you use for a quick rundown of the headlines .
Astrologers , it seems , can be a source of immense and unexpected amusement as shown by Phil Plait .
Though amusement may not be the right word in this case .
In her post for the National Examiner , Satya Harvey was very upset about the idea of crashing a robot into the surface of our natural satellite to end its fruitful mission with a final burst of data gathering …
There is a Japanese lunar orbiter named Kaguya that is scheduled to crash into the moon today at 2:30 pm ET .
Scientists hope to learn something about the moons composition by observing the debris that is kicked up .
Did these scientists talk to the moon ?
Tell her what they were doing ?
Ask her permission ?
Show her respect ?
Now , where to begin here ?
Probably to ask how exactly the Moon ’s sex was determined .
Sure the tradition in New Age spiritualities is that the Moon has a connection to the feminine , but I think it might be a good idea to check before we start assigning genders to celestial bodies .
Of course since we ’ve been to the Moon , we are well aware that it ’s a huge , sexless , lifeless rock .
Which brings us to another question .
How exactly do you get a huge spherical boulder to give permission for , well … anything ?
And that ’s not the only insight into the wonderful world of woo that our impassioned astrologer can provide .
As it turns out , she also intends to play celestial PETA to those inconsiderate scientists .
Purposefully crashing something into the moon just to watch what happens is akin to a schoolboy cutting a live frog to see what makes it jump .
It is an example of the domination of the left - brained rational scientific approach over the intuitive .
Funny enough , when I talked to Greta Christina about New Ageism in some progressive communities , she voiced a concern that those spiritually focused practitioners seem to see science and empirical studies done in a clinical way as tools of The Establishment and reject them in favor of the intuitive .
But the problem here is that evidence - based science and clinical , left - brained ways to look at the world are very useful and to throw an important part of how humans see and process their world out the window on a personal whim , is a bad idea .
And I completely agree with Greta in that regard .
If anything , I ’d rather see left - brained rational science trump self - important spiritual meanderings intended to elicit warm fuzzies than the other way around for the same , exact reason .
Last thing I want to see on the news is scientists voicing concerns over violating Pluto ’s privacy with the New Horizon ’s spacecraft since its position on the outer edge of the solar system must be a sign that it does n’t want to be disturbed by overly curious humans .
Today there was the dayli protest against the discussion on parliement about the Icesave saving accounts in Europe .
The goverment is about to put inot law , that the goverment will pay the debt , that the Banks made .
That means , in the amount of 650 billion kronas .
People belive that , if it will be payed by the goverment , then taxes will have to rise , and the welfare system in Iceland will go down .
The protest started peacefully , but then a few protesters sat down on the street in front of the parliement .
That was not acceptable by the police , and the protesters did not obey the police , so 8 where arrested .

Breaking news from the New York Times :
The Central Intelligence Agency withheld information about a secret counterterrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from former Vice President Dick Cheney , the agency ’s director , Leon E. Panetta , has told the Senate and House intelligence committees , two people with direct knowledge of the matter said Saturday .
The report that Mr. Cheney was behind the decision to conceal the still - unidentified program from Congress deepened the mystery surrounding it , suggesting that the Bush administration had put a high priority on the program and its secrecy .
This is incredibly damning news about the power that Bush / Cheney and the executive branch usurped from the supposed " separation of powers " enshrined in our Constitution .
CIA Director Leon Panetta is now saying that the CIA did not even , as required to by law , report to the so - called Gang of Eight ( leaders in Congress and from the intelligence committees ) about this covert anti-terrorism unit :
If the President determines that it is essential to limit access to the finding to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States , the finding may be reported to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the congressional intelligence committees , the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives , the majority and minority leaders of the Senate , and such other member or members of the congressional leadership as may be included by the President .
Sources told the New York Times that this specific intelligence program was not interrogation - oriented , nor was it a domestic surveillance program , so this is not directly related to the Bush administration 's role in torturing suspected terrorists , but it is quite possible and somewhat likely , in my opinion , that the sheer amount of evidence of illegal actions piling up is what 's prompting AG Eric Holder 's newfound willingness to look into torture prosecutions of ex-Bush administration officials :
Holder , 58 , may be on the verge of asserting his independence in a profound way .
Four knowledgeable sources tell NEWSWEEK that he is now leaning toward appointing a prosecutor to investigate the Bush administration 's brutal interrogation practices , something the president has been reluctant to do .
While no final decision has been made , an announcement could come in a matter of weeks , say these sources , who decline to be identified discussing a sensitive law - enforcement matter .
We shall see as more is revealed .
Our laws recognize a number of legal ages for various activities .
You need to be 16 - years old to get a driver ’s license , 18 - years old to enlist in the armed forces , and 21 - years old to drink .
One can argue that the various legal ages should be adjusted up or down , but everyone generally agrees that there needs to be minimum legal ages for some types of activities .
I think we need to extend that concept .
Once you reach the age of 80 , a new set of legal rights should kick in .
Specifically , you should be able to imbibe any drug you want , and you should have the right to doctor - assisted euthanasia .
A typical 80 - year old might need a little chemical boost to make life tolerable .
There is n’t much chance an 80 - year old will join a street gang or shorten his lifespan by much .
Perhaps the law could require a full - time nurse or family caretaker to be around if the oldster wants to drop acid .
I could see some restrictions on the activity , but it seems cruel to force grandpa to have a crappy last few years when science provides options .
Likewise , euthanasia should be legal after the age of 80 .
The cost of keeping people alive in the last months of their lives is a huge part of overall healthcare costs , and a big deal to the economy .
I say if you ’re 80 - years old , and you want to spare yourself , and society , from a painful and expensive last act , that should be your legal right .
Meet Australia 's answer to velociraptor .
Nicknamed Banjo he had three large slashing claws on each hand and is the most complete meat - eater ever found in Australia .
His remains were discovered near those of two other dinosaurs - new species of giant plant eaters - at Winton , in western Queensland .
Dubbed Clancy and Matilda , they lived about 100 million years ago and were titanosaurs , the largest kind of dinosaurs ever to have lived .
Two weeks ago , Michael Pachter , an analyst at Weedbush Morgan , laid out a case that would see Apple transforming its just - good - enough - to - stay - afloat Apple TV into a full - fledged gaming console .
Building on the immense popularity of the iPhone as a handheld gaming device , Pachter predicts that it ’s only a matter of time before Apple makes a play for gaming in the living room .
I think Apple has a deliberate strategy .
They want to see what they can do with the handhelds ( iPod Touch and iPhone ) first , then move into console games .
Apple TV is the device that they can turn into a console , and they have essentially the same goals as Microsoft–to turn Apple TV into an entertainment and Internet hub .
If they can get enough iPod users to download games , it ’s a natural that they can ultimately convince a large number of these users to buy a game - enabled Apple TV .
I ’d guess a 2012 or 2013 launch …
I ’m not sure how Apple would proceed initially .
It ’s possible that they open the architecture and go for an Apple TV “ App store ” to allow anyone to develop games .
We ’d get cool stuff like World of Goo or Geometry Wars , but probably not super cool stuff like Gears of War until they bought a few developers …
What Apple cares about is getting into the living room , and an Apple TV with games has a higher likelihood of succeeding than an Apple TV without .
Wow .
That ’s certainly a lot to digest , and it seems that Pachter has taken a rather simplistic approach in addressing the complex and often times unpredictable world of gaming .
Developing a successful gaming platform is n’t nearly as straight forward or simple as Pachter makes it out to be , and while Apple may certainly try to leverage gaming as a means to make a push into the living room , there are a number of challenges and considerations it needs to be keenly aware of .
Why gaming is popular on the iPhone
All games and gaming platforms are not created equal , and it ’s astounding how frequently analysts tend to lump all gaming discussions under the same umbrella .
Games are undoubtedly the most popular app category on the iTunes App Store and this is in large part due to the fact that games on the iPhone and iPod Touch are more or less like the mini- games you would ordinarily waste a few minutes on while browsing around the web .
The reason people enjoy gaming on the iPhone is because many of the games are simple and can often be played in quick spurts , as opposed to the more intensive and drawn out titles commonly found on the Sony PSP and Nintendo DS .
There are , of course , a number of console style iPhone games , but by and large , the surprising success of gaming on the iPhone is the result of games like Flight Control and Flick Fishing , both of which are iTunes best sellers that require basically little or no instruction , and can be played for either 2 minutes or 2 hours .
The point is , people who play games on the iPhone are n’t really “ gamers ” in the true sense of the word , and that ’s an important distinction people need to be acutely aware of when discussing any possible and potential future gaming initiatives from Apple .
The viability of gaming with an Apple TV
The success and popularity of gaming on the iPhone makes a similar app store for games on the Apple TV seem like an obvious idea .
But living room console gaming is an entirely different monster , and Apple would have an incredibly tough time taking on Nintendo , Microsoft , and Sony all at the same time .
Unlike many of the other markets Apple competes in ( the MP3 player market , the smartphone market ) , companies in the video game world actually innovate and churn out pretty solid products that customers are happy with .
Apple ’s bread and butter , though , is entering a stagnant market and spicing it up a bit , but when it comes to video games , spice is already the name of the game .
To get a better idea of Apple ’s chance for success should it decide to turn the Apple TV into a gaming platform , it makes sense to explore the two different approaches to gaming Apple would have to choose from .
Specifically , Apple could turn the Apple TV into a serious gaming platform , similar to the Xbox 360 and PS3 , or it could angle it as a fun and laid back platform , much like the Nintendo Wii .
Unfortunately for Apple , both choices pose a number of challenges .
1. Apple TV vs. the Xbox 360 and PS3
Competing against the Xbox 360 and PS3 seems like an idea doomed from the start .
Both are mature platforms that offer a deep repository of games and features that the Apple TV would have a difficult , if not , impossible time keeping up with .
Take the Xbox for example .
Microsoft may not know how to make an MP3 player , but it ’s Xbox division is pretty on the ball .
What makes the Xbox so great is that the system is so much more than simply a gaming platform .
In addition to playing games and DVD ’s , Microsoft ’s Xbox live service allows users to download game demos , while also giving them the ability to stream HD movies and purchase games online .
One of the more appealing things about the Xbox live service is that it lets users play games either against or with other Xbox live users across the world .
Xbox live has been around for almost 7 years , has a simple and easy to navigate user interface ( though some might say it was copied from Nintendo ) , and should see a number of improvements by this fall , such as the ability to stream 1080 p movies via Netflix .
How in the world can the Apple TV compete with that ?
Why would a serious gamer even consider an Apple TV gaming device when there ’s not really much Apple can do to differentiate it from the consoles that are already out there ?
2. Apple vs. the Nintendo Wii
A more sane approach would have Apple position the Apple TV against a gaming platform like the Nintendo Wii .
Much like gaming on the iPhone , gaming on the Wii is extremely popular precisely because it attracts a different breed of gamer .
The Wii wo n’t sell you on its graphics but rather the fun gameplay achieved through the use of its accelerometer enabled controller .
While serious and in - depth video game titles are indeed available for the Wii , it ’s the “ soft ” titles like Wii Sports and Mario Kart that push systems out the door .
As an example , Madden ’09 on the Wii might not have killer graphics , but the joy derived from using the controller to mimic football movements more than makes up for that fact in the eyes of many Wii owners .
Given Apple ’s relative inexperience when it comes to gaming , positioning the Apple TV against the Wii would seem to make the most sense , at least on paper .
But again , Apple would encounter a number of significant roadblocks .
Nintendo is a video game juggernaut , and the success of the Wii has not only surprised analysts , but has put a significant dent into sales figures for both the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 .
As far as we can tell , there ’s nothing that Apple can offer with an Apple TV app store that could rival what ’s already available for the Wii .
Conclusion
The battle for the living room has been going on for years now , and no company has quite figured out how to deal a fatal blow to everyone else in the marketplace .
Sales of the Apple TV have been brisk , but ultimately disappointing relative to the other products Apple typically sells .
It ’s no coincidence that Steve Jobs refers to the Apple TV merely as a hobby .
The Apple TV undoubtedly has a lot of potential , and it may very well become a standard device in living rooms across the country , but we sincerely doubt that turning it into a gaming console will have anything to do with it .
When it comes to serious gaming , the Xbox and PS3 would destroy the Apple TV , and when it comes to more laid back iPhone style gaming , the Nintendo Wii is already out to a commanding and arguably insurmountable lead .
Gaming on the go is completely different from gaming in the living room .
If Apple wants to control the living room , it makes a lot more sense for them to build an Apple branded HDTV , as has already been rumored .
And as a final point , Steve Jobs has even noted that the market for game consoles is relatively puny when measured against the market for other devices like smartphones and MP3 players , let alone HDTV’s .
Why would Apple go after a market that is n’t that big to begin with ?
Why would it set its sights so low ?
That ’s simply not Apple ’s style .
Apple does n’t try to just get on base , it trys to hit the ball out of the park every time it steps up to the plate .
The Apple TV is currently a hobby , and transforming it into a gaming console would do nothing to change that fact .
On the flip side , an Apple branded HDTV with Apple TV functionality built right ( and perhaps the ability to download basic mini- games ) could potentially be a major move by Apple .
And that ’s the only move that Apple really knows how to make .
Why go for gaming in the living room when you can make a move for the entire living room ?
Europe minister Glenys Kinnock today reinforced speculation that Tony Blair wants to be Europe 's first president .
She said the entire Government fully supported Mr Blair 's " candidature " although the former prime minister has refused to confirm that he is bidding for the post .
There is no official list of contenders for a new Euro - job which will only exist if the Lisbon treaty is fully approved and ratified by all EU countries .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But Mrs Kinnock , visiting the European Parliament in Strasbourg , made clear the Government would be pushing him as the man to run Europe for up to five years under new treaty arrangements .
" The UK Government is supporting Tony Blair 's candidature for president of the Council ( of EU governments ) , " she told a press conference .
Asked if the prospect of being Europe 's president had been discussed with Mr Blair , she said : " It is the Government 's position .
I am sure they would not do that without asking him " .
Speculation has been mounting for years that Mr Blair would be the obvious choice to represent the EU under the new arrangements .
The post - with an undefined remit but with a mission to be the global face of the EU - would run for two and a half years and be renewable once .
That would give Mr Blair a possible five - year term to help shape the EU , chairing summits of EU leaders and setting the agenda in all key policy areas .
Mr Blair has kept away from the debate about his future , aware that bidding too soon could scupper any chances of getting the necessary consensus amongst EU leaders .
There would also be attacks from eurosceptics if there were official discussions about a job based on the assumption the controversial Lisbon treaty will come into force .
In any case , no formal announcement of a candidacy would be made until after the Irish referendum on the treaty in the autumn - and only if the voters say " yes " .
Mrs Kinnock said Mr Blair would be a good choice because he was perceived by many as having the right qualities .
She said : " He is someone with strength of character , status , people know who he is , and he could step into this new role with a lot of respect and he would be generally welcomed . "
It was pleasant experience & every body from our family was delighted & very much happy with this great experience .
Thank you very much for everything .

Although I briefly flirted with the idea of going into science ( before wisely coming to accept my inner English major ) , I never planned to become a science teacher .
But I enjoyed reading about science in books written for popular audiences .
And , without realizing it , I was picking up attitudes about science education that have shaped how I do science with my own kids .
One of my first literary science mentors was the late Nobel Prize - winning physicist Richard Feynman .
Feynman had worked on the Manhattan Project , but became famous as a member of the committee which reported to Congress after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster .
It was Feynman who dipped a rubber O - ring into a glass of ice water to show how it became brittle – a simple but devastating demonstration .
His lectures at Caltech , which are still studied today in book form , are considered classics .
Recently , I happened to pick up his 1985 memoir Surely You ’re Joking , Mr. Feynman for the first time in many years .
And I was surprised to see how many of the beliefs I hold today came directly from this book .
Here are five of them :
1. Science is Something Anyone Can Do .
Feynman credited his father with encouraging his interest in science by constantly asking him questions designed to make him think about how the world worked .
( His mother , he complained , was constantly kicking him out of the house to play . )
When he was 12 , Feynman built an electrical “ lab ” in his room , with fuses made of tin foil and bells and lights that he could wire together in different configurations .
He also became a whiz at fixing busted radios and soon had a thriving sideline as a neighborhood repairman .
2. Science Can be Playful .
Even when he was working on the Manhattan Project , Feynman liked to tinker and play around with science and math .
He and his wife ( who was hospitalized with TB ) would devise codes just to drive the censors who opened all their mail crazy .
He studied safecracking and began breaking into the facility ’s file cabinets – which , of course , contained the secrets of the atomic bomb .
( Instead of making the file cabinets more secure , bumbling officials simply banned Feynman from their offices . )
After the war at Caltech , Feynman continued to indulge what he called his “ puzzle drive ” by becoming an expert on Mayan hieroglyphics .
3. Scientific Curiosity Can be Applied to Other Areas .
Feynman liked to challenge himself in areas besides math and science as well .
He learned to play Latin drums well enough to perform with a ballet company .
Although he did n’t consider himself artistic , he learned how to draw well enough to sell several works and had a one man show at a campus gallery .
4. Science Education Should be More than Memorizing Definitions
When Feynman was a graduate student at Princeton , he was allowed to sit in a biology course if he agreed to do the assignments .
One involved giving a report on research that had been done on cats .
He was unfamiliar with the names of the muscles mentioned , so he went down to the library to get “ a map of the cat . ”
Then he gave his report , beginning with an explanation of the cat ’s anatomy .
The biology students immediately stopped him , saying they already knew all that .
“ Oh , ” he replied , “ you do ?
Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you ’ve had four years of biology . ”
As he wrote , “ They had spent all their time memorizing stuff like that , when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes . ”
5. Science Textbooks Stink
Asked to evaluate math and science textbooks for the California Board of Education , Feynman ’s temper exploded over books that were “ universally lousy . ”
One tried to apply math to science with a problem that involved adding up the temperatures of red stars , yellow stars , green stars , and violet stars – even though there are no green or violet stars , and there ’s no purpose in adding their temperatures .
“ All it was was a game to get you to add , and they did n’t understand what they were talking about . ”
Talking about a science textbook which stated that a wind - up toy moved because “ energy makes it go , ” he pointed out that “ you could say ‘ energy makes it stop ’ just as well . ”
( If you think his evaluation is outdated , check out some of the links in an essay I wrote on textbooks in general . )
I ’ve now passed Feynman ’s book on to my older son , with the hope that he ’ll enjoy it as much as I have .
( Parental alert :
The book contains a few sections on Feynman ’s retro interest in strip clubs . )
But even if he ’s not ready – it may be a book that needs a little distance from childhood to appreciate – it ’s been nice to have my ideas about science education reaffirmed .

Please check out my editorial in response to the Franken election , as published at the UK's Guardian yesterday just after the MN Supreme Court verdict .
Here 's a taste ...
When ballots are counted in secret ( or , in many cases , not counted at all ) , democracy is dangerously imperiled .
Lucky for Minnesotans , that was n't the case up there , even if it meant some eight months without proper representation in the US Congress .
It was worth the wait .
Transparency was no match for the conspiracy theorists , including the RSCC , the head of the Republican party and even the Republican National Lawyers Association , who embarrassingly joined the black helicopter crowd in touting evidence - free claims of Franken 's " efforts to steal a seat in the United States Senate . "
...
When democracy is visible to all , it works .
When it becomes buried behind secrecy , insider tabulations and computerized black boxes , the very basis of our system of government is put dangerously at stake .
Transparency wins again .
Along with the voters of Minnesota .
Nice to see the voters win one for a change .
Check out the whole thing , if only for some of the whacky comments posted by some of the wingnut dead - enders over there .
One of them , " MikeMichigan " wrote in response to my piece , channeling every nutball with a primetime show over in Crazy Land ( aka Fox " News " ) ...
Oh , and Franken stole the election .
The recount was a sham .
Coleman was almost 800 votes ahead before the democrat lawyers got involved and started manufacturing votes for Franken and eliminating legal votes for Coleman .
To which I was happy to reply ... with some handy info from MN Supremes decision yesterday , as helpfully highlighted today by Media Matters :
The 5 to 0 unanimous ruling of the bi-partisan Minnesota Supreme Court noted " [ n] o claim of fraud in the election or during the recount was made by either party " and that " Coleman 's counsel confirmed at oral argument that Coleman makes no claim of fraud on the part of either voters or election officials . "
Other than that , yeah , " Franken stole the election , " but apparently the Republicans forgot to mention any of that , or present any evidence whatsoever for it in their 8 month long contest .
Enjoy your lonely world , MichiganMike ...
Good times ...
And , oh , yeah , I was also able to point out in the article that of the more than 42,000 voters registered in MN alone by ACORN last year , not a single instance of " voter fraud " was noted by the Coleman / GOP team in their 8 - month long election contest and court case .
" With all the claims of voter fraud being committed by the group , " I noted , " surely this election , of all elections , would be where evidence of all that fraud would finally be revealed for all to see , no ?
Um , no .
Apparently not . "
Treasury countered by noting that banks , including JPMorgan Chase , think the department 's asking prices are too high .
Unable to agree on a price , some institutions are letting the department sell the warrants in public auctions .
While risky for both sides , the auctions give Treasury political cover amid growing criticism that its policies are too easy on big banks .
The shortfall estimated by the Congressional Oversight Panel concerns warrants , financial instruments that allow Treasury to buy shares of the firms at a set price in 10 years .
If the stock prices of the banks go up , as they are expected to do , taxpayers could reap a healthy profit .
Treasury obtained the warrants when it began injecting billions into the nation 's largest financial institutions in October .
They were considered a " deal - sweetener " — a way to help taxpayers benefit from the upside of a financial recovery that depended on billions of federal dollars .
Many large banks received permission to exit the program far earlier than was initially expected .
Last month , Treasury announced that 10 of the nation 's largest banks — including JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — could repay about $ 68 billion of bailout money .
Treasury on Friday said the first large bank has completed negotiations with the government and repurchased its warrants .
The government this week received $ 60 million from State Street of Boston to pay for the stock warrants .
State Street had received $ 2 billion in bailout support from the government and repaid that money on June 17 .
Twenty - two smaller banks already have repaid their bailout money , and 11 of those have repurchased their warrants .
If the warrants for those firms " had been sold for their true market values , taxpayers would have recovered $ 10 million more , " according to a report Friday from the Congressional Oversight Panel , which was created by Congress to oversee the $ 700 billion bailout fund .
The warrants were sold at a one - third discount over their true prices , according to the panel 's study .
If warrants in the more than 600 banks participating in the bailout were sold at such a discount , that would mean taxpayers received $ 2.7 billion less than the panel estimates the warrants are worth .
Treasury last month announced a method for valuing the warrants through negotiation with the banks .
The agency 's offers reflect financial modeling and surveys of market participants .
The government also can sell the warrants in auctions instead of negotiating the prices .
The panel said Treasury should consider holding open , public auctions to stop " any speculation about whether Treasury has been too tough or too easy on the banks . "
Treasury disputed the panel 's findings .
Department spokesman Andrew Williams said the estimates are based on assumptions , so they may be higher or lower than the actual market prices of the warrants .
" For that reason Treasury is using a more comprehensive approach to valuing the warrants , " including obtaining quotes from investors who buy and sell similar securities , he wrote in a statement .
As evidence , Williams pointed JPMorgan 's decision to let Treasury sell its warrants at auction — an indication the bank thought Treasury was asking for too much .
" We 've taken this action , which is consistent with Treasury 's process ... and which allows Treasury to find the true market price , " said JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti .
Banks have been eager to exit the bailout quickly to avoid the stigma and exempt themselves from restrictions , including limits on executive compensation .
Repurchasing the warrants is a necessary step , but has been challenging because of disagreement about the prices .
The oversight panel 's analysis was reviewed by three finance professors from Harvard Business School .
The panel is headed by Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren .
She was the first to propose a new consumer protection agency for financial products , which has become a cornerstone of the Obama administration 's reform efforts .
One of the group 's Republicans , Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling , warned against interpreting the report as critical of Treasury 's approach to the warrants .
" It is exceedingly difficult to predict the value of financial securities and time the markets over the short term much less the 10 - year term of the TARP warrants , " he wrote .
Derek Zoolander is VH1's three time male model of the year , but when Hansel wins the award instead , Zoolander 's world becomes upside down .
His friends disappear , his father is disappointed in him , and he feels that he 's not good as a model anymore .
But when evil fashion guru Mugatu hires Zoolander , he thinks his life has turned back round again , that is until he finds out that Mugatu has actually brainwashed him to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia .
Can Zoolander and his new friends find out how to prevent the incident before it 's too late ?

My USA TODAY cover story on the proliferation of scareware — and the ostentatious profits earned by top scareware affiliates — has struck a nerve .
Readers ’ comments include musings about why banks and credit card companies do n’t do more to police the online payment systems they supply for use by scareware traffickers .
Some consumers bedeviled by obnoxious scareware promos are beginning to wonder why big media websites and the online advertisingÃ‚Â agencies do n’t do more to curtail ordinary - looking online ads , many of which carry invisible triggers forÃ‚Â scareware promos .
LastWatchdog believes these are all valid questions .
It ’s up to consumers , equipped with some knowledge , Ã‚Â to demand answers .
My cover story recounts how a steadily - growing , highly - lucrative criminal industry has evolved into a majorÃ‚Â driver ofÃ‚Â cybercrime .
Ã‚Â
At the top of the heap are 10 to 12 murky scareware distribution groups that run highly - efficientÃ‚Â “ affliliate ” programs .
TrafficConverter .
Biz was one of the most active and visible .
It was shut down last November , thanks in large part to bold investigative reports by Washington Post security blogger extraordinaire , Ã‚Â Brian Krebs.Ã‚Â
It ’s a safe bet that TrafficConverter .
Biz has reconstituted under a new name and is back in operation .
The money to be made is just too good .
How top - level suppliers orchestrate affiliate campaigns
I got the idea to illuminate how the nuts - and - bolts of the scareware industry work after speaking off - the - cuff with F - Secure researchers Mikko Hypponen and Patrik Runald at the RSA security conference last April .
We discussed how the top level suppliers , like TrafficConverter , produce the fake dialogue boxes that appear on your computer and that try to scare you into spending $ 30 - 80 to buy fake protection .
They also supply the Visa , MasterCard and PayPal payment mechanisms that enable consumers to pay them .
And , finally , the top - level groups supply the “ product ” that is delivered to the duped purchaser : fake scanners , bogus cleanup tools and worthless antivirus / antispyware protection .
In some cases , the fake software you buy may actually provide you with some nominal protection .
But mostly for your $ 30 to $ 80 the only thing you get is temporary relief from the obnoxious dialogue boxes , and misleading hard drive scans .
TheÃ‚Â top level suppliersÃ‚Â compensate productive affiliates handsomely .
Hypponen showed me this Ã‚Â screen shot of a contest held by TrafficConverter .
Biz offering a $ 36,000 Lexus to the affiliate who sold the most fake AV .
He believes the winner took home the car .
“ The TrafficConverter gang is obviously continuing their operations , looking at the amount of their rogue samples we keep getting , ” says Hypponen .Ã‚Â
“ But we have n’t found their new website . ”
LastWatchdog also reviewed some impressive undercover work by Finjan CTO Yuval Ben-Itzhak and SecureWorks ’ ace virus hunter Joe Stewart that detailsÃ‚Â how top affiliates routinely earn six - figure weekly incomes .
Yes , weekly !
You can see Finjan ’s report on affiliate compensation schemes here and SecureWorks ’ report here .
SEO scareware attacks
Finjan infiltrated a gang that specialized in “ search engine optimization ” attacks .
In an SEO caper , the bad guys create web pages and fill them with words and phrases that are likely search queries , such as “ NBA finals ” or “ American Idol winner . ”
Next they hack into a popular , legit website and insert a tiny , almost invisible copy of their web page on as many pages of theÃ‚Â high - traffic site as they can .
Ã‚Â
Then they sit back and rely on SEO technology to do the rest .
SEO automates the process by which search engines rank web pages and prioritize search results , based on relevance .
When the legit site turns up as the no .
1 or no .
2 search result for the popular search query , the hackers ’ corrupted link turns up as no .
4 or no .
6 . Anyone who clicks on this link will get a fake security pitch .
PandaLabs recently infiltrated another gang of SEO hackers out to spread scareware and tallied up the malicious links they managed to insert into Google search results .
PandaLabs counted 16,000 malicious links appearing in search results for the search query “ YouTube ; ” 10,500 bad links for “ France Airline Crash ” ; 8,930 bad links for “ Microsoft Project Natal ” ; 3,380 bad links for “ E3 ” ; 2,900 bad links for “ Eminem MTV Awards Bruno Incident ” ; and 2,850 bad links for “ Sony . ”
The SEO hacking group infiltrated by Finjan got paid $ 172,800 — 9.6 cents for each of the 1.8 million corrupted links people clicked on , says Ben-Izthak .
Only a tiny fraction those clicks resulted in the purchase of a fake $ 50 program .
Still , the total revenue generated was $ 193,320 .
After paying the affiliate , the top - level supplier pocketed $ 20,520 .
Google spokesman Andrew Kovacs says the search giant works hard to preserve the integrity of search results .
“ We make constant improvements to our systems , ” says Kovacs .
“ This issue is not specific to one company , and we encourage people to be vigilant about checking the URLs ( web links ) of the websites they visit . ”
Scareware affiliates earn big bucks
The top - level groups typically work with one hundred or more affiliates , who can earn commissions many different ways .
Last fall , SecureWorks researcher Stewart infiltrated a Russian group known as the Baka Software gang .
He accessed documentation showing one affiliate earned $ 146,525 in ten days by spreading promotions for a worthless program , called Antivirus XP 2008 , to more than 154,000 people , and closing sales to 2,772 of them .
Another record showed five top Baka Software affiliates earning weekly commissions averaging $ 107,604 .
Top - level scareware distributors continue to operate with impunity , mainly based in Russia .
And new affiliates crop up everyday , full of fresh ideas to spread increasingly invasive promotions .
“ Bakasoftware is just one of many affiliate programs , ” says Stewart .
“ The sheer amounts of money involved in installing just one rogue program are mind - boggling . ”
Botnets are integrally involved .
Botnets allow the automation and scaling up of all of these shenanigans .
Some affiliates are major botnet controllers , who deploy their botnets some of the time to spread scareware .
Some are specialists who lease botnets to spread scareware .
St. Petersburg connection
All of this got me thinking about how the thriving scareware industry is really the natural progression what Andrej Sporaw set into motion when he was tooling around St. Petersburg in 2004 - 2005 in his black Mercedes S600 running iframecash .
biz website , one of the original top - level scareware distributors .
You can read about Sporaw ’s exploits in this excerpt from my award - winning book , Zero Day Threat : The Shocking Truth of How Banks and Credit Bureaus Help Cyber Crooks Steal Your Money and Identity .
Sporaw was one of the first to offer commissions to anyone who helped him spread the SpySheriff fake antivirus program .
Freelancer hackers began to taint legitimate Web sites so that pop-up ads for SpySheriff would launch on the PC of anyone who visited a corrupted web page .
I ’ve always wondered if Sporaw , who must be in his late 20s by now , stayed active .
It would make sense that he is a leader of top - level group today .
Finjan ’s Ben-Itzhak , who tracked Sporaw in his iframecash .
biz days , says there is little evidence connecting Sproraw to the SEO hackers .
“ The look & feel of the command and control server is different .
The location of the server is in Ukraine and not Russia .
As I do not want to speculate without having simple evidences to support my claims , I cannot conclude that these are the same people .
Affiliations like these are very popular on the web today , there is a high chance that these are two different groups , ” he says .
Granted , but the SEO hackers operate more like affiliates .
And my suspicion is that Sporaw , if he ’s still active , would be heading up one of the main top - level groups .
Cutting - edge Twitter scareware attacks
Fast forward to June 2009 .
Last week , PandaLabs threat researcher Sean - Paul Correll logged on to his Twitter profile page and noticed “ phish ” was one of the Top 10 “ trending topics ” being Tweeted about by Twitterers .
It seems a music fan figured out a way to use an iPhone to stream music from the floor of the Phish concert in Wantagh , New York , generating a ton of Tweets .
Correll clicked to a webpage listing real - time Tweets about this cultural milestone — and immediately spotted a suspicious one .
It suggested clicking to a Web link to view a “ phishtube ” video on YouTube .
You guessed it : the Tweeted link was tainted .
Click on it and you ’d be prompted to download a fake Adobe Flash player update .
Click on the fake update , and you ’d get sucked into a promotion for worthless “ Privacy Center ” antivirus protection .
Correll wondered how many of the other Top 10 trending topics might be similarly corrupted .
He quickly discovered all Top 10 trending topics included Tweets with links to the same scareware promotion .
“ They were targeting every trending topic on Twitter , ” says Correll .
Correll did n’t have to use any fancy forensic techniques to figure this out .
He simply used the free search and sorting tools Twitter makes available to everyone , and some common sense .
He tallied the number of different Twitter accounts sending out the bad links , discovering about 50 different accounts sending out more than 3,000 Tweets with scareware links .
Each malicious
Tweet keyed off of a Top 10 trending topic .
‘ Assumed goodness ’
This particular attack shut down two days later .
But Correll notes that Twitter has made it child ’s play for anyone with a modicum of tech savvy to replicate it .
It ’s free and simple to create one , a dozen or 100 new Twitter accounts , which can then be used to broadcast malicious Tweets .
What ’s more , Twitter makes it very easy to automate the process of sending out malicious Tweets .
“ It ’s pretty trivial to make something that interfaces with Twitter , ” says Correll .
“ It does n’t take a lot of knowledge . ”
The attackers probably created a simple program , called a script , that automatically kept track of the top trending topics and then dispersed malicious
Tweets with slightly differing text corresponding to each hot topic .
The bad guys thus were able to leverage the high trust quotient associated with fast - changing Tweets .
“ Sites like Twitter work in real time and create open dialogues with everyone in the world , ” says Correll .
“ People tend to trust the links they see on Twitter because they view it as real - time communication .
They assume goodness . ”
Crippling machines to cash in
In fact , scareware promotions can be very bad , indeed .
In a similar Twitter attack tracked by Kaspersky Lab virus hunter , Roel Schouwenberg , the bad guys created new Twitter accounts and began broadcasting Tweets declaring “ Best video ” with a web link .
Clicking on the link launched a sequence that replicated the message to everyone on the victim ’s friends list .
Schouwenberg says anyone who clicked on http://juste.ru got directed to a particularly egregious promotion .
It shut down — and locked out — all other software programs , and insisted on purchase of a two - year license , for $ 49.95 , to unlock the programs .
A lifetime license cost $ 79.95 .
Here ’s a screen shot of a similar lock - out attack :
“ They ’re beginning to cripple machines to make it more likely that you will pay up , ” he says .
Risk vs. reward
A few scareware affiliates have been slowed by regulators .
Last year , Microsoft and the Washington State Attorney General Rob McKennaÃ‚Â filed several lawsuits against companies for allegedly marketing fake security products .
And the Federal Trade Commission last December obtained restraining orders prohibiting Innovative Marketing and ByteHosting Internet Services , which the FTC says tricked more than one million consumers into buying WinFixer , WinAntivirus , DriveCleaner , ErrorSafe , and XP Antivirus , all worthless .
While affiliates risk encounters with law enforcement , the top - level suppliers are cagey .
Most shape agreements with affiliates to deflect liability , and supply rudimentary protection upon payment .
That way they can argue that they are selling providing something of value , says Dan Hubbard , chief technical officer of Websense Security Lab .
“ The legal boundaries are gray at best , ” says Hubbard .
“ They may not be breaking any laws based on where they operate from . ”
It took a few days to get Twitter to respond .
But spokeswoman Jenna Sampson did finally send me an email acknowledging Twitter was aware of the attacks tracked by PandaLabs and Kaspersky .
She noted that the company keeps users abreast of cyber threats at its Status blog .
“ We take the security of our users extremely seriously and are very open with them when we discover new threats , ” says Sampson .
“ We share the information with them , and have a team that proactively mines for threats and shuts them down immediately . ”
Maybe so .
But LastWatchdog believes that a USA TODAY reader commenting today ’s cover story may have summarized it best : “ Scareware is the very definition of terrorism for the 21st Century .
Soon many will be pondering getting rid of their Internet access completely .
It is almost to that point now .
Whether you pay bills online or bank online do you really know that the website you are visiting is actually legit ? ”

The effort to allow severely ill New Jerseyans to use medical marijuana gained momentum today as an Assembly committee cleared a revamped bill that would also set strict limits on who can grow , distribute or get the drug .
The bill , which would make New Jersey the 14th state to allow marijuana use for medical purposes , includes restrictions lawmakers added in response to criticism that a measure the Senate passed in Feburary was too lax because it would have allowed patients to grow their own .
Medical marijuana
" When all other medical conventional treatments do not work , this will at least give an opportunity for patients and their doctors to explore other methods of treatment , but in a responsible way , " said Assemblyman Reed Gusciora ( D - Mercer ) , one of the sponsors .
The bill cleared the Assembly Health Committee after supporters said the drug eases pain for severely ill patients , and opponents countered that legalizing marijuana for any use sends the wrong message to young people .
The vote prompted a wave of applause and a chorus of " thank - yous " in the packed committee room .
The amended " New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act , " would not permit people to grow their own marijuana , instead creating licensed " alternative treatment centers " to produce the drug .
It would also have tougher restrictions on who would be allowed to legally acquire marijuana .
The Senate bill would have made people eligible for medical marijuana based on symptoms , such as chronic pain and muscle spasms .
The bill approved yesterday restricts eligibilty to people who suffer from specific diseases .
" This bill will be the most restrictive in the United States , " said Sen. Nicholas Scutari ( D - Union ) , sponsor of the original bill who admitted this version is stricter than he would have liked .
" But this is real progress ...
We do owe a special duty to our ill and infirm . "
The illnesses that would qualify patients for the program are cancer , multiple sclerosis , HIV / AIDS , seizure disorder , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and " any other medical condition " approved by the state health department , according to the bill .
Assembly Health Committee Chairman Herb Conaway ( D - Burlington ) , a physician , repeatedly said the bill would pass , although there may be more changes .
Diane Riportella of Egg Harbor Township , sitting in a wheelchair , wept during yesterday 's hearing as she described how the fatal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , often referred to as Lou Gehrig 's Disease " has taken away my life and my independence . "
" It saddens and enrages me that I have to fight for the right to use and safely access the medicine that relieves my suffering , " she said .
Nancy Fedder of Hillsborough told the committee she has secretly acquired the drug to help her cope with severe leg and back pain caused by multiple sclerosis .
She consumes only a modest amount through an inhaler , " without getting high , and without disrupting my work " as a database programmer .
Nearly a dozen law enforcement officers , school officials , family and anti-drug activists strongly urged the committee to postpone the vote to allow more time for people to digest the re-drawn legislation .
Barbara McCullough , a school counselor and member of the Association of Student Assistance Professionals - New Jersey , said the committee ought to be more concerned with how kids perceive this bill .
" The message they are getting is that marijuana is already legal -- that 's what the tell me , " she said .
After the vote , Mt. Olive Police Officer Joseph T. Abrusci , a member of a group of 300 law enforcement officers trained to detect drivers under the influence , said the bill still concerns him because it does not say physicians should recommend medical marijuana as a last resort when legal drugs have failed .
He worries the roads will be more crowded with unfit drivers .
" There are a lot of loopholes , " Abrusci said .
The measure would require a licensed physician with whom the patient has an existing relationship to first recommend medical marijuana .
The state Department of Health and Senior Services would then have to give its approval before the patient could obtain up to one ounce of marijuana per month .
It also would require people approved for medical marijuana to personally get it from a producing center , or have a courier deliver it to them .
The panel 's vote on the revised bill was 7 - 1 vote with three abstentions .
It now advances to the Assembly , and would then have to return to the Senate before it can be considered by Gov. Jon Corzine .
" My friend phoned me up to say ' have you seen your cat on the telly " , she said .
" I 'd been doing something else at the time but rewound it and there he was .

While many iPhone owners hail Apple as saving them from greedy cellular carriers , an analyst now says the company has overturned AT&T and the entire wireless industry — and not always for the better .
Analyst Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research likens the relationship between Apple and AT&T as that between the former and music labels dating as far back as 2001 , when Apple first had to ingratiate itself with labels as it incorporated music CD ripping into iTunes .
Apple at first won important concessions and praise from its partners , only for them to regret it later as the iPod maker 's popularity left these companies at the supposedly smaller company 's mercy .
When it comes to carriers , particularly AT&T , the researcher sees them as just now realizing the bad bargain they 'd struck for themselves .
As late as this spring , AT&T has continued to praise the iPhone as virtually saving the company from the US economy 's fallout by driving customers to its network and encouraging them to spend more on data plans .
But with the launch of the iPhone 3GS in June and the 3G congestion problems in the months leading up to the handset 's debut , AT&T was increasingly cast as Apple 's anchor — keeping a good device locked to a carrier that does n't enable features like MMS and tethering .
" Apple has stolen the march , and in the process has recast AT&T from hero to villain , " Moffett says .
" At Appleâs June developer conference in San Francisco , where Apple unveiled its new [ iPhone 3GS ] , AT&T was roundly jeered at every mention by the more than 5,000 application developers in attendance ... even Apple itself seemed uncomfortable talking about its U.S. partner . "
The attack is such that Apple has all but taken control of the partnership , according to the analyst .
Now , the Cupertino company has " radically tilted " the normal balance of power against AT&T and cellular networks as a whole .
If Apple preferred another carrier , many iPhone owners would switch to preserve the experience they already have ; an incentive that forces carriers to keep the handset maker happy .
At times , though , it also has the caustic effect of suggesting an conspiracy at the carrier to limit useful services , such as voice over IP calls , when cost or technical reasons are the real motivators .
And while the US government may be close to investigating exclusivity deals as possibly anti-competitive , Moffett argues that Apple 's presence in the marketplace has actually helped competition by forcing companies to keep reasonable service rates and let apps dictate business rather than network services .
Government intervention could paradoxically hurt the industry by telling providers how much they could discount a phone and hardware developers which networks they would have to support .
Leaving Apple to pursue its usual path with corporate partners is considered the best route as it may keep those firms honest .
In a move that may well earn them a spot on one of those " world 's dumbest criminals " lists circulating online , Somali pirates mistook a French naval ship for a commercial vessel on Sunday and tried to attack it , according to a Reuters report .
Whoops .
It did n't take long for the French to correct this case of mistaken identity :
They seized 11 suspected pirates 600 miles off the coast of Somalia .
The Nivose , which last month captured 11 presumed pirates off the coast of Kenya , is part of the European Union 's operation to protect shipping in the area .
The question of jurisdiction
So , what will the French do with the bumbling brigands ?
" For the moment we do n't have any indication of what the European Union forces want to do with these pirates , " said the spokesman .
Pirates captured by a Canadian NATO ship last month were immediately released , because they could not be tried under Canadian law .
Other captured pirates have been sent for trial in Kenya or to Somalia 's semi-autonomous region of Puntland , or to France .
And , in probably the most highly publicized case , a suspected pirate brought from the Indian Ocean to New York City for his alleged role in attacking a US - flagged ship and holding it hostage last month will escape hanging .
That 's right , Abduwali Muse will not face death by rope , reports Bloomberg .
In a fit of modern - day leniency , US authorities decided life in prison would be punishment enough if Muse is convicted of piracy .
Some pirate success
Other pirates this weekend did a better job of identifying their targets .
On Saturday a Greek - owned ship with a Ukrainian crew was hijacked by Somali pirates south - west of the Seychelles .
Another group of pirates said they captured a Pakistani - owned ship full of goods destined for Somali traders on Sunday , reports Agence France - Presse .
I have been anxiously awaiting the determination by the State Dept. on the status of Uzi Arad ’s visa and suffice it to say , there is not a whole lot of info .
out there , which says a lot in and of itself .
Then , last night , I found some info .
over at Tikun Olam , and it ’s disheartening :
Uzi Arad is Bibi Netanyahu ’s national security advisor .
He is also an Israeli spy .
He officially worked for the Mossad for 23 years achieving senior status .
But his real claim to fame as far as Israel - U.S. relations is his intimate involvement , along with Naor Gilon , in the Rosen - Weissman spy scandal …
[ snip ]
As a result , Arad ’s U.S. visa was revoked and the Bush administration refused to allow him entry since 2007 .
That was before Bibi promoted him , before Barack Obama became president , and before the administration dropped the Aipac Two spy case .
Even though visa decisions are not subject to legal challenge or standards , I ’m guessing Obama figured that with no case against Rosen and Weissman , it ’s decision to label Arad persona non grata was moot .
Haaretz reports that Arad ’s visa has been restored and that he plans to meet with his U.S. counterpart , James Jones , in Washington to lay the groundwork for Bibi ’s first meeting as prime minister with Obama in June .
What is curious is that no one has written about the restoration of Arad ’s visa .
Interestingly , Haaretz and Eli Lake wrote about this subject when Arad was first appointed to his post and noted how problematic his lack of ability to travel to the U.S. would be .
But not a word since .
I ’m guessing that the Obama folks told the Israelis that they wanted total silence on this subject .
A congressional commission that reviews economic and security relations between the United States and China held a hearing last month on Chinese intelligence activities that impact national security .
During this hearing , security expert Kevin G. Coleman of the Technolytics Institute think tank gave a presentation ( PDF ) on Chinese cyber -espionage efforts .
He warned that the United States is falling behind in technological defense capabilities and is largely unprepared for what he characterizes as the start of a cyber - warfare arms race .
Coleman attempts to describe the threat posed by China 's cybersecurity build - up , but how much of it is a sham ?
Some of his facts are misleading .
Coleman discussed several prominent threat vectors and outlined some areas where he believes that the US military needs to take action in order to boost its cyber - warfare preparedness .
One of the topics that he addressed during the panel is the risk of hardware tampering .
Much of the hardware used in computers and consumer electronics in the United States is manufactured in China and other parts of the world .
Experts are concerned that foreign governments could integrate undetectable kill switches and backdoor access systems directly into hardware components .
" We need to examine in detail and further quantify the risk that the global supply of components , sub- assemblies , assemblies , sub-systems and systems pose to the integrity of our critical information infrastructure and our highly computerized military , " Coleman said .
" If we are not going to build everything we need here at home , then we need to advance the current testing and validation tools and techniques as well as our system covert compromise monitoring and detection capabilities . "
When we covered the manchurian chip problem last year , we looked at a DARPA research program called Trust in IC which aimed to find a consistently reliable method for detecting when circuitry has been compromised .
This program is ongoing , and is scheduled for completion in 2010 .
Coleman also emphasized the need for continuous investment in cyberwarfare capabilities .
He contends that China 's rapid economic growth and increasing technological sophistication will give the country " global electronic dominance " within the next 10 to 40 years , enabling it to " outspend the United States and the rest of the world much as we outspent the Soviet Union in the cold war . "
In order to combat this threat , he said that the US government must acknowledge that " we are in the early stages of a cyber arms race and need to respond accordingly " by developing new cyber - warfare weapons and defense systems .
One particular area where he believes that improvement is needed is the military 's capacity to detect the origin of cyberattacks .
The growing use of zombie botnets by sophisticated attackers is making it harder to determine who is orchestrating attacks and where those attacks are originating .
He suggested that one possible solution is to catalog the characteristics of malicious code and use that as a kind of " digital DNA " to help trace the software back to its creator .
The large number of virus variants and the extensive sharing of code between malicious software programs makes it seem unlikely to me that such an approach will be tenable .
An overreaction ?
Coleman warned that the Chinese are hardening their technical infrastructure and using new technologies that are believed to be more resistant to infiltration .
He cited Kylin , an operating system that is allegedly unique and not based on mainstream platforms .
" This race was intensified when China created Kylin , their own hardened server operating system and began to convert their systems back in 2007 , " he said .
" This action also made our offensive cyber capabilities ineffective against them given the cyber weapons were designed to be used against Linux , UNIX and Windows .
Refer to our report - RED SOS . "
This statement was widely reported by the press , but much of the coverage ( and Coleman himself ) appears to be of dubious accuracy .
Kylin is not a new top - secret operating system , it 's a publicly available FreeBSD derivative that was created by academics for research purposes with funding from the Chinese government .
Contrary to Coleman 's assertion that it is immune to cyber weapons designed to target Linux and UNIX , Kylin is actually designed to comply with UNIX standards and has a Linux binary compatibility layer .
Certain aspects of Kylin 's design are documented in mainstream computing journals like IEEE .
Its hardening features include filesystem encryption and access control frameworks .
In fact , its security features appear to be roughly equivalent with those of the average commercial Linux distribution .
Coleman 's mischaracterization of Kylin raises questions about his agenda .
He references his own studies for virtually every major statement that is included in his presentation , but not all of these studies — such as the one about Kylin — are publicly available .
There is no way to verify his facts or determine if his policy recommendations are based on sound principles .
NEW YORK / BANGALORE ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge on Sunday approved General Motors Corp ’s bankruptcy sale in a move that will allow the company ’s most profitable assets to exit bankruptcy protection under government ownership .
Judge Robert Gerber of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan said the sale was GM ’s only option and that completing it would “ prevent the death of the patient on the operating table . ”
He approved the sale just over one month after GM filed for bankruptcy , in the largest U.S. manufacturing bankruptcy in history .
Under the deal brokered by the Obama administration , “ New GM ” will emerge as a more streamlined automaker operating the best parts of the old company , including its Chevrolet and Cadillac brands , with a cheaper workforce , smaller dealer network , and much less debt .
The rest of the company will be liquidated .
Gerber issued a four - day stay of the order approving the sale , which should allow it to close as early as Thursday .
Such stays are typical and allow for possible appeals .
One group of consumers objecting to the sale has already filed court papers for an appeal , but the dissenting bondholder group said it would drop its challenge to the sale .
The sale marks the second big victory for the Obama administration ’s auto task force .
It helped broker the disposal of Chrysler LLC to a group led by Italy ’s Fiat SpA last month .
GM , which has struggled with a sharp decline in U.S. auto sales amid the recession this year , filed for bankruptcy protection on June 1 .
The company had warned of “ catastrophic ” consequences to the auto industry if the sale were blocked , and the U.S. government said it could walk away from funding the iconic U.S. automaker if a deal were not approved by July 10 .
‘ BUSINESS DECISION ’
“ GM cannot survive with its continuing losses ... and without the governmental funding that will expire in a matter of days , ” Gerber wrote in the 95 - page opinion .
Gerber shot down objections to GM ’s sale from dealers whose contracts are being terminated , groups of consumer and asbestos claimants that argued they will now be unable to sue GM for their injuries , and a group that calls itself the “ Unofficial Committee of Family & Dissident GM Bondholders . ”
Gerber said the dissenting bondholders ’ argument that GM could have restructured itself under a more traditional Chapter 11 reorganization plan , in which creditors would have been able to vote , was unrealistic .
“ As nobody can seriously dispute , the only alternative to an immediate sale is liquidation -- a disastrous result for GM ’s creditors , its employees , the suppliers who depend on GM for their own existence , and the communities in which GM operates , ” Gerber wrote .
“ In the event of a liquidation , creditors now trying to increase their incremental recoveries would get nothing . ”
He also rejected arguments that the U.S. government , which has loaned GM billions of dollars before and during the bankruptcy , had been overbearing in its negotiations to restructure the automaker .
“ The U.S. Treasury , in making hard decisions about where to spend its money and make New GM as viable as possible , made business decisions that it was entitled to make , ” Gerber wrote .
The “ old GM , ” which includes unpopular brands and unneeded factories and liabilities , will remain behind in bankruptcy court to be liquidated .
The bondholder group on Monday said it will likely forgo an appeal to challenge the sale , largely due to the costs of pursuing an appeal .
“ The entirely new and expensive level of commitment that would be needed is regrettably beyond our means , ” Hal John , chairman of the Unofficial Committee of Family & Dissident GM bondholders , said in a statement .
More than 50 percent of GM ’s bondholders had supported the deal , and the dissenting group was composed of only 3 individual bondholders , who said they represented the interest of more than 1,000 bondholders who felt left out of the process .
An attorney for a group of individual consumers with product liability claims against GM filed papers with the bankruptcy court to appeal the sale order early on Monday .
While “ New GM ” has agreed to take on future claims from such victims , the sale would leave these current lawsuits with little recourse .
In his opinion , Judge Gerber said the liability objection was the only “ truly debatable ” issue in the case ; but citing Chrysler ’s sale as a precedent , he ultimately agreed with GM that it was necessary to allow the company to leave such claims behind it .
TREASURY FUNDING
The U.S. Treasury has agreed to provide $ 60 billion in financing to the new company , including a proposed $ 50 billion giving it a 60 percent stake in the company .
The UAW would gain a 17.5 percent stake , the Canadian government about 12 percent and GM bondholders about 10 percent of the new company .
At a three - day sale hearing that concluded July 2 , the dissenting bondholder group and some individual bondholders representing themselves had objected to the deal , but no bidders presented an alternative .
An auto task force official said earlier this month that the government could conduct an initial public offering for the “ New GM ” as soon as 2010 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama nominated an Alabama country doctor who has three times resurrected her clinic in a fishing village after disasters to be U.S. surgeon general on Monday and help him advocate for healthcare reform .

Dr. Regina Benjamin promised to advocate for Obama ’s healthcare agenda as “ America ’s doctor ” if she gets the job as chief public spokesperson on health issues , saying her own family and patients have been victims of the failing U.S. system .
“ Through floods and fire and severe want , Regina Benjamin has refused to give up .
Her patients have refused to give up , ” Obama said in a White House Rose Garden announcement .
U.S. surgeons general in the past have issued influential reports on topics including smoking , AIDS and mental health .
Benjamin said she not only wanted to serve in the traditional role of surgeon general , encouraging healthy habits , but press to make medical care more easily available .
“ My hope , if confirmed as surgeon general , is to be America ’s doctor , America ’s family physician , ” she said .
“ As we work toward a solution to this healthcare crisis , I promise to communicate directly with the American people to help guide them through whatever changes may come with healthcare reform , ” she added .
“ I want to ensure that no one , no one falls through the cracks as we improve our healthcare system . ”
Benjamin won a MacArthur Foundation “ genius ” grant in 2008 for founding and nurturing the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic to serve a Gulf Coast fishing community in 1990 .
It was devastated by Hurricanes Georges in 1998 and Katrina in 2005 , and a third time by fire .

Obama used the Rose Garden news conference to step up pressure on Congress , seemingly bogged down in battles over the $ 1 trillion , 10 - year cost of healthcare reform .
“ We do n’t have to deal with hurricanes , we do n’t have to deal with floods and we do n’t have to deal with fires .
All we have to do is pass a bill , ” he said .
MAXED OUT CREDIT
Obama praised Benjamin for passing on personal profit to care for her patients .
“ When Hurricane Katrina destroyed ( her clinic ) again and left most of her town homeless , she mortgaged her house and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second time , ” Obama said .
As surgeon general , Benjamin will lead the 6,000 - member uniformed public Health Services Commissioned Corps , public health specialists and doctors who work for the federal government and include many experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Benjamin , born in 1956 , is a protegee of two prominent black health officials : Dr. Louis Sullivan , a former Health and Human Services secretary who founded the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta to educate black doctors , and former surgeon general Dr. David Satcher .
She attended Morehouse , got her medical degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and has an MBA from Tulane University in New Orleans .
Her family is an example of why healthcare reform is vital , Benjamin said .
“ My father died with diabetes and hypertension .
My older brother and only sibling died at age 44 of HIV - related illness , ” she said .
“ My mother died of lung cancer because as a young girl she wanted to smoke , just like her twin brother could , ” she added .
“ While I can not change my family ’s past , I can be a voice in the movement to improve our nation ’s healthcare and our nation ’s health for the future . ”
Two American soldiers were killed in a Taliban attack on a US base in relatively quiet eastern Afghanistan on Saturday , far from the front lines of a major US offensive in southern Helmand province , an extremist stronghold .
The surprise attack took place in the Zerok district of Paktika province , hundreds of miles from where US forces expected to engage the Taliban , highlighting the group 's resilience in the face of US efforts to stabilize the country in the run up to the presidential election in August .
The Los Angeles Times reports that the base came under a " sophisticated " and " multi- pronged " attack from as many as 100 militants armed with rockets , mortars , white phosphorus , and a truck bomb .
The Times says the attack " [ forced ] the defenders to call in airstrikes to avoid being overrun . "
It is unclear how many US and Afghan troops were injured or how many insurgents were killed .
The Associated Press reports that seven US and two Afghan soldiers were wounded and 30 militants killed , but the LA Times reports that US officials " declined to reveal the number . "
In Helmand , the US push to extend the reach of the Afghan central government " has faced generally light resistance , " reports Agence France - Presse .
But one company of Marines has been in constant battle with insurgents since Thursday , when they seized a key canal and road junction at Mian Poshteh .
The 200 Marines fighting to hold the position arrived at dawn on Thursday , and they were still engaged in fierce combat through the weekend , Major Dan Gaskell told AFP at nearby Camp Delhi .
" Echo company landed by the canal intersection and set up shop , " he said late Saturday .
" They have been fighting to hold that position .
" The enemy really wants it back , and have been doing everything they can to dislodge Echo .
That continues . "
The US has called in helicopter gunships three times to help the Marines , Gaskell said , including one attack using a Hellfire missile .
He said about 40 Taliban fighters were using small arms , rocket - propelled grenades and rockets against the Marines , who have based themselves in a walled compound .
Helmand is " criss - crossed " with canals like the one at Mian Poshteh , says AFP .
The canals were built with US aid money to boost agriculture in the 1950s and 1960s .
Today , the region is a center of cultivation , but for a crop the US probably did not have in mind : opium .
Helmand is a center for the opium trade , says the Pakistani daily newspaper , Dawn .
Opium is a major breadwinner for the Taliban .
Dawn says the province 's financial significance to the group is just one of several reasons why Operation Khanjar is so important to the war effort :
Begun on Thursday , the operation is significant in many ways .
One , it is the first major offensive after Barack Obama moved into the White House and appears to reflect his keenness to turn the tide of a war that has dragged on for nearly eight years without producing any significant results .
Two , it aims at capturing the Taliban heartland which — and this is the third point — is a poppy - growing area .
Helmand 's capture could be a blow to the Taliban , for Afghanistan 's booming drug trade is the biggest source of funding and arms for the militants .
Crop destruction has failed to work so far .

( Ephesians 6:13 )
April 15 , 2011
For twelve years , you have been asking : Who is John Galt ?
This is John Galt speaking .
I am the man who loves his life .
I am the man who does not sacrifice his love or his values .
I am the man who has deprived you of victims and thus has destroyed your world , and if you wish to know why you are perishing - you who dread knowledge - I am the man who will now tell you . ”
The chief engineer was the only one able to move ; he ran to a television set and struggled frantically with its dials .
But the screen remained empty ; the speaker had not chosen to be seen .
Only his voice filled the airways of the country - of the world , thought the chief engineer - sounding as if he were speaking here , in this room , not to a group , but to one man ; it was not the tone of addressing a meeting , but the tone of addressing a mind .
“ You have heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis .
You have said it yourself , half in fear , half in hope that the words had no meaning .
You have cried that man ’s sins are destroying the world and you have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded .
Since virtue , to you , consists of sacrifice , you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster .
In the name of a return to morality , you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of your plight .
You have sacrificed justice to mercy .
You have sacrificed independence to unity .
You have sacrificed reason to faith .
You have sacrificed wealth to need .
You have sacrificed self - esteem to self - denial .
You have sacrificed happiness to duty .
“ You have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that which you held to be good .
Why , then , do you shrink in horror from the sight of the world around you ?
That world is not the product of your sins , it is the product and the image of your virtues .
It is your moral ideal brought into reality in its full and final perfection .
You have fought for it , you have dreamed of it , and you have wished it , and I - I am the man who has granted you your wish .
“ Your ideal had an implacable enemy , which your code of morality was designed to destroy .
I have withdrawn that enemy .
I have taken it out of your way and out of your reach .
I have removed the source of all those evils you were sacrificing one by one .
I have ended your battle .
I have stopped your motor .
I have deprived your world of man ’s mind .
“ Men do not live by the mind , you say ?
I have withdrawn those who do .
The mind is impotent , you say ?
I have withdrawn those whose mind is n’t .
There are values higher than the mind , you say ?
I have withdrawn those for whom there are n’t .
“ While you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice , of independence , of reason , of wealth , of self - esteem - I beat you to it , I reached them first .
I told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of that moral code of yours , which they had been too innocently generous to grasp .
I showed them the way to live by another morality - mine .
It is mine that they chose to follow .
“ All the men who have vanished , the men you hated , yet dreaded to lose , it is I who have taken them away from you .
Do not attempt to find us .
We do not choose to be found .
Do not cry that it is our duty to serve you .
We do not recognize such duty .
Do not cry that you need us .
We do not consider need a claim .
Do not cry that you own us .
You do n’t .
Do not beg us to return .
We are on strike , we , the men of the mind .
“ We are on strike against self - immolation .
We are on strike against the creed of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties .
We are on strike against the dogma that the pursuit of one ’s happiness is evil .
We are on strike against the doctrine that life is guilt .
“ There is a difference between our strike and all those you ’ve practiced for centuries : our strike consists , not of making demands , but of granting them .
We are evil , according to your morality .
We have chosen not to harm you any longer .
We are useless , according to your economics .
We have chosen not to exploit you any longer .
We are dangerous and to be shackled , according to your politics .
We have chosen not to endanger you , nor to wear the shackles any longer .
We are only an illusion , according to your philosophy .
We have chosen not to blind you any longer and have left you free to face reality - the reality you wanted , the world as you see it now , a world without mind .
“ We have granted you everything you demanded of us , we who had always been the givers , but have only now understood it .
We have no demands to present to you , no terms to bargain about , no compromise to reach .
You have nothing to offer us .
We do not need you .
“ Are you now crying : No , this was not what you wanted ?
A mindless world of ruins was not your goal ?
You did not want us to leave you ?
You moral cannibals , I know that you ’ve always known what it was that you wanted .
But your game is up , because now we know it , too .
“ Through centuries of scourges and disasters , brought about by your code of morality , you have cried that your code had been broken , that the scourges were punishment for breaking it , that men were too weak and too selfish to spill all the blood it required .
You damned man , you damned existence , you damned this earth , but never dared to question your code .
Your victims took the blame and struggled on , with your curses as reward for their martyrdom - while you went on crying that your code was noble , but human nature was not good enough to practice it .
And no one rose to ask the question : Good ?- by what standard ?
“ You wanted to know John Galt ’s identity .
I am the man who has asked that question .
“ Yes , this is an age of moral crisis .
Yes , you are bearing punishment for your evil .
But it is not man who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will take the blame .
It is your moral code that ’s through , this time .
Your moral code has reached its climax , the blind alley at the end of its course .
And if you wish to go on living , what you now need is not to return to morality - you who have never known any - but to discover it .
“ You have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social .
You have been taught that morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim , the whim of a supernatural power or the whim of society , to serve God ’s purpose or your neighbor ’s welfare , to please an authority beyond the grave or else next door - but not to serve your life or pleasure .
Your pleasure , you have been taught , is to be found in immorality , your interests would best be served by evil , and any moral code must be designed not for you , but against you , not to further your life , but to drain it .
“ For centuries , the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your neighbors - between those who preached that the good is self - sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self - sacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth .
And no one came to say that your life belongs to you and that the good is to live it .
“ Both sides agreed that morality demands the surrender of your self - interest and of your mind , that the moral and the practical are opposites , that morality is not the province of reason , but the province of faith and force .
Both sides agreed that no rational morality is possible , that there is no right or wrong in reason - that in reason there ’s no reason to be moral .
“ Whatever else they fought about , it was against man ’s mind that all your moralists have stood united .
It was man ’s mind that all their schemes and systems were intended to despoil and destroy .
Now choose to perish or to learn that the anti-mind is the anti-life .
“ Man ’s mind is his basic tool of survival .
Life is given to him , survival is not .
His body is given to him , its sustenance is not .
His mind is given to him , its content is not .
To remain alive , he must act , and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action .
He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it .
He cannot dig a ditch - or build a cyclotron - without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it .
To remain alive , he must think .
“ But to think is an act of choice .
The key to what you so recklessly call ‘ human nature , ’ the open secret you live with , yet dread to name , is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness .
Reason does not work automatically ; thinking is not a mechanical process ; the connections of logic are not made by instinct .
The function of your stomach , lungs or heart is automatic ; the function of your mind is not .
In any hour and issue of your life , you are free to think or to evade that effort .
But you are not free to escape from your nature , from the fact thatreason is your means of survival - so that for you , who are a human being , the question ‘ to be or not to be ’ is the question ‘ to ’ think or not to think . ’
“ A being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior .
He needs a code of values to guide his actions .
‘ Value ’ is that which one acts to gain and keep , ‘ virtue ’ is the action by which one gains and keeps it .
‘ Value ’ presupposes an answer to the question : of value to whom and for what ?
‘ Value ’ presupposes a standard , a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an alternative .
Where there are no alternatives , no values are possible .
“ There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe : existence or non-existence - and it pertains to a single class of entities : to living organisms .
The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional , the existence of life is not ; it depends on a specific course of action .
Matter is indestructible , it changes its forms , but it cannot cease to exist .
It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative : the issue of life or death .
Life is a process of self - sustaining and - self - generated action .
If an organism fails in that action , it does ; its chemical elements remain , but its life goes out of existence .
It is only the concept of ‘ Life ’ that makes the concept of ‘ Value ’ possible .
It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil .
“ A plant must feed itself in order to live ; the sunlight , the water , the chemicals it needs are the values its nature has set it to pursue ; its life is the standard of value directing its actions .
But a plant has no choice of action ; there are alternatives in the conditions it encounters , but there is no alternative in its function : it acts automatically to further its life , it can not act for its own destruction .
“ An animal is equipped for sustaining its life ; its senses provide it with an automatic code of action , an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil .
It has no power to extend its knowledge or to evade it .
In conditions where its knowledge proves inadequate , it dies .
But so long as it lives , it acts on its knowledge , with automatic safety and no power of choice , it is unable to ignore its own good , unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer .
“ Man has no automatic code of survival .
His particular distinction from all other living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of volitional choice .
He has no automatic knowledge of what is good for him or evil , what values his life depends on , what course of action it requires .
Are you prattling about an instinct of self - preservation ?
An instinct of self - preservation is precisely what man does not possess .
An ‘ instinct ’ is an unerring and automatic form of knowledge .
A desire is not an instinct .
A desire to live does not give you the knowledge required for living .
And even man ’s desire to live is not automatic : your secret evil today is that that is the desire you do not hold .
Your fear of death is not a love of life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it .
Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking , which nature will not force him t9 perform .
Man has the power to act as his own destroyer - and that is the way he has acted through most of his history .
“ A living entity that regarded its means of survival as evil , would not survive .
A plant that struggled to mangle its roots , a bird that fought to break its wings would not remain for long in the existence they affronted .
But the history of man has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind .
“ Man has been called a rational being , but rationality is a matter of choice - and the alternative his nature offers him is : rational being or suicidal animal .
Man has to be man -by choice ; he has to hold his life as a value - by choice : he has to learn to sustain it - by choice ; he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtues - by choice .
“ A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality .
“ Whoever you are , you who are hearing me now , I am speaking to whatever living remnant is left uncorrupted within you , to the remnant of the human , to your mind , and I say :
There is a morality of reason , a morality proper to man , and Man ’s Life is its standard of value .
“ All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good ; all that which destroys it is the evil .
“ Man ’s life , as required by his nature , is not the life of a mindless brute , of a looting thug or a mooching mystic , but the life of a thinking being - not life by means of force or fraud , but life by means of achievement - not survival at any price , since there ’s only one price that pays for man ’s survival : reason .
“ Man ’s life is the standard of morality , but your own life is its purpose .
If existence on earth is your goal , you must choose your actions and values by the standard of that which is proper to man - for the purpose of preserving , fulfilling and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life .
“ Since life requires a specific course of action , any other course will destroy it .
A being who does not hold his own life as the motive and goal of his actions , is acting on the motive and standard of death .
Such a being is a metaphysical monstrosity , struggling to oppose , negate and contradict the fact of his own existence , running blindly amuck on a trail of destruction , capable of nothing but pain .
“ Happiness is the successful state of life , pain is an agent of death .
Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one ’s values .
A morality that dares to tell you to find happiness in the renunciation of your happiness - to value the failure of your values - is an insolent negation of morality .
A doctrine that gives you , as an ideal , the role of a sacrificial animal seeking slaughter on the altars of others , is giving you death as your standard .
By the grace of reality and the nature of life , man-every man - is an end in himself , he exists for his own sake , and the achievement of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose .
“ But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims .
Just as man is free to attempt to survive in any random manner , but will perish unless he lives as his nature requires , so he is free to seek his happiness in any mindless fraud , but the torture of frustration is all he will find , unless he seeks the happiness proper to man .
The purpose of morality is to teach you , not to suffer and die , but to enjoy yourself and live .
“ Sweep aside those parasites of subsidized classrooms , who live on the profits of the mind of others and proclaim that man needs no morality , no values , no code of behavior .
They , who pose as scientists and claim that man is only an animal , do not grant him inclusion in the law of existence they have granted to the lowest of insects .
They recognize that every living species has a way of survival demanded by its nature , they do not claim that a fish can live out of water or that a dog can live without its sense of smell - but man , they claim , the most complex of beings , man can survive in any way whatever , man has no identity , no nature , and there ’s no practical reason why he cannot live with his means of survival destroyed , with his mind throttled and placed at the disposal of any ordersthey might care to issue .
“ Sweep aside those hatred - eaten mystics , who pose as friends of humanity and preach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of no value .
Do they tell you that the purpose of morality is to curb man ’s instinct of self - preservation ?
It is for the purpose of self - preservation that man needs a code of morality .
The only man who desires to be moral is the man who desires to live .
“ No , you do not have to live ; it is your basic act of choice ; but if you choose to live , .
you must live as a man -by the work and the judgment of your mind .
“ No , you do not have to live as a man ; it is an act of moral choice .
But you cannot live as anything else - and the alternative is that state of living death which you now see within you and around you , the state of a thing unfit for existence , no longer human and less than animal , a thing that knows nothing but pain and drags itself through its span of years in the agony of unthinking self - destruction .
“ No , you do not have to think ; it is an act of moral choice .
But someone had to think to keep you alive ; if you choose to default , you default on existence and you pass the deficit to some moral man , expecting him to sacrifice his good for the sake of letting you survive by your evil .
“ No , you do not have to be a man ; but today those who are , are not there any longer .
I have removed your means of survival - your victims .
“ If you wish to know how I have done it and what I told them to make them quit , you are hearing it now .
I told them , in essence , the statement I am making tonight .
They were men who had lived by my code , but had not known how great a virtue it represented .
I made them see it .
I brought them , not a re-evaluation , but only an identification of their values .
“ We , the men of the mind , are now on strike against you in the name of a single axiom , which is the root of our moral code , just as the root of yours is the wish to escape it : the axiom that existence exists .
“ Existence exists - and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms : that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness , consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists .
“ If nothing exists , there can be no consciousness : a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms .
A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms : before it could identify itself as consciousness , it had to be conscious of something .
If that which you claim to perceive does not exist , what you possess is not consciousness .
“ Whatever the degree of your knowledge , these two - existence and consciousness - are axioms you cannot escape , these two are the irreducible primaries implied in any action you undertake , in any part of your knowledge and in its sum , from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widest erudition you might acquire at its end .
Whether you know the shape of a pebble or the structure of a solar system , the axioms remain the same : that it exists and that you know it .
“ To exist is to be something , as distinguished from the nothing of non-existence , it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes .
Centuries ago , the man who was - no matter what his errors - the greatest of your philosophers , has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and the rule of all knowledge : A is A . A thing is itself .
You have never grasped the meaning of his statement .
I am here to complete it : Existence is Identity , Consciousness is Identification .
“ Whatever you choose to consider , be it an object , an attribute or an action , the law of identity remains the same .
A leaf can not be a stone at the same time , it can not be all red and all green at the same time , it cannot freeze and burn at the same time .
A is A .
Or , if you wish it stated in simpler language :
You cannot have your cake and eat it , too .
“ Are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world ?
All the disasters that have wrecked your world , came from your leaders ’ attempt to evade the fact that A is A .
All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain you have ever endured , came from your own attempt to evade the fact that A is A .
The purpose of those who taught you to evade it , was to make you forget that Man is Man .
“ Man can not survive except by gaining knowledge , and reason is his only means to gain it .
Reason is the faculty that perceives , identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses .
The task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence , but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason , his senses tell him only that something is , but what it is must be learned by his mind .
“ All thinking is a process of identification and integration .
Man perceives a blob of color ; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch , he learns to identify it as a solid object ; he learns to identify the object as a table ; he learns that the table is made of wood ; he learns that the wood consists of cells , that the cells consist of molecules , that the molecules consist of atoms .
All through this process , the work of his mind consists of answers to a single question :
What is it ?
His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic , and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists .
Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification .
A contradiction cannot exist .
An atom is itself , and so is the universe ; neither can contradict its own identity ; nor can a part contradict the whole .
No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge .
To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one ’s thinking ; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one ’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality .
“ Reality is that which exists ; the unreal does not exist ; the unreal is merely that negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when it attempts to abandon reason .
Truth is the recognition of reality ; reason , man ’s only means of knowledge , is his only standard of truth .
“ The most depraved sentence you can now utter is to ask : Whose reason ?
The answer is : Yours .
No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest , it is your own mind that has to acquire it .
It is only with your own knowledge that you can deal .
It is only your own knowledge that you can claim to possess or ask others to consider .
Your mind is your only judge of truth - and if others dissent from your verdict , reality is the court of final appeal .
Nothing but a man ’s mind can perform that complex , delicate , crucial process of identification which is thinking .
Nothing can direct the process but his own judgment .
Nothing can direct his judgment but his moral integrity .
“ You who speak of a ‘ moral instinct ’ as if it were some separate endowment opposed to reason - man ’s reason is his moral faculty .
A process of reason is a process of constant choice in answer to the question : True or False ? - Right or Wrong ?
Is a seed to be planted in soil in order to grow - right or wrong ?
Is a man ’s wound to be disinfected in order to save his life - right or wrong ?
Does the nature of atmospheric electricity permit it to be converted into kinetic power - right or wrong ?
It is the answers to such questions that gave you everything you have - and the answers came from a man ’s mind , a mind of intransigent devotion to that which is right .
“ A rational process is a moral process .
You may make an error at any step of it , with nothing to protect you but your own severity , or you may try to cheat , to fake the evidence and evade the effort of the quest - but if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality , then there is no greater , nobler , more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking .
“ That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness , and that which you call ‘ free will ’ is your mind ’s freedom to think or not , the only will you have , your only freedom , the choice that controls all the choices you make and determines your life and your character .
“ Thinking is man ’s only basic virtue , from which all the others proceed .
And his basic vice , the source of all his evils , is that nameless act which all of you practice , but struggle never to admit : the act of blanking out , the willful suspension of one ’s consciousness , the refusal to think - not blindness , but the refusal to see ; not ignorance , but the refusal to know .
It is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment - on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it , that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict ‘ It is . ’
Non -thinking is an act of annihilation , a wish to negate existence , an attempt to wipe out reality .
But existence exists ; reality is not to be wiped out , it will merely wipe out the wiper .
By refusing to say ‘ It is , ’ you are refusing to say ‘ I am . ’
By suspending your judgment , you are negating your person .
When a man declares : ‘ Who am I to know ?’- he is declaring : ‘ Who am I to live ? ’
“ This , in every hour and every issue , is your basic moral choice : thinking or non-thinking , existence or non-existence , A or non-A , entity or zero .
“ To the extent to which a man is rational , life is the premise directing his actions .
To the extent to which he is irrational , the premise directing his actions is death .
“ You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality on a desert island - it is on a desert island that he would need it most .
Let him try to claim , when there are no victims to pay for it , that a rock is a house , that sand is clothing , that food will drop into his mouth without cause or effort , that he will collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his stock seed today - and reality will wipe him out , as he deserves ; reality will show him that life is a value to be bought and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it .
“ If I were to speak your kind of language , I would say that man ’s only moral commandment is :
Thou shalt think .
But a ‘ moral commandment ’ is a contradiction in terms .
The moral is the chosen , not the forced ; the understood , not the obeyed .
The moral is the rational , and reason accepts no commandments .
“ My morality , the morality of reason , is contained in a single axiom : existence exists - and in a single choice : to live .
The rest proceeds from these .
To live , man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life : Reason - Purpose - Self - esteem .
Reason , as his only tool of knowledge - Purpose , as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve - Self - esteem , as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness , which means : is worthy of living .
These three values imply and require all of man ’s virtues , and all his virtues pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness : rationality , independence , integrity , honesty , justice , productiveness , pride .
“ Rationality is the recognition of the fact that existence exists , that nothing can alter the truth and nothing can take precedence over that act of perceiving it , which is thinking - that the mind is one ’s only judge of values and one ’s only guide of action - that reason is an absolute that permits no compromise - that a concession to the irrational invalidates one ’s consciousness and turns it from the task of perceiving to the task of faking reality - that the alleged short - cut to knowledge , which is faith , is only a short - circuit destroying the mind - that the acceptance of a mystical invention is a wish for the annihilation of existence and , properly , annihilates one ’s consciousness .
“ Independence is the recognition of the fact that yours is the responsibility of judgment and nothing can help you escape it - that no substitute can do your thinking , as no pinch - hitter can live your life - that the vilest form of self - abasement and self - destruction is the subordination of your mind to the mind of another , the acceptance of an authority over your brain , the acceptance of his assertions as facts , his say - so as truth , his edicts as middle - man between your consciousness and your existence .
“ Integrity is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness , just as honesty is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence - that man is an indivisible entity , an integrated unit of two attributes : of matter and consciousness , and that he may permit no breach between body and mind , between action and thought , between his life and his convictions - that , like a judge impervious to public opinion , he may not sacrifice his convictions to the wishes of others , be it the whole of mankind shouting pleas or threats against him - that courage and confidence are practical necessities , that courage is the practical form of being true to existence , of being true to one ’s own consciousness .
“ Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value , that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud - that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victims to a position higher than reality , where you become a pawn of their blindness , a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions , while their intelligence , their rationality , their perceptiveness become the enemies you have to dread and flee - that you do not care to live as a dependent , least of all a dependent on the stupidity of others , or as a fool whose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling - that honesty is not a social duty , not a sacrifice for the sake of others , but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice : his refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness of others .
“ Justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature , that you must judge all men as conscientiously as you judge inanimate objects , with the same respect for truth , with the same incorruptible vision , by as pure and as rational a process of identification - that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly , that just as you do not pay a higher price for a rusty chunk of scrap than for a piece of shining metal , so you do not value a totter above a hero - that your moral appraisal is the coin paying men for their virtues or vices , and this payment demands of you as scrupulous an honor as you bring to financial transactions - that to withhold your contempt from men ’s vices is an act of moral counterfeiting , and to withhold your admiration from their virtues is an act of moral embezzlement - that to place any other concern higher than justice is to devaluate your moral currency and defraud the good in favor of the evil , since only the good can lose by a default of justice and only the evil can profit - and that the bottom of the pit at the end of that road , the act of moral bankruptcy , is to punish men for their virtues and reward them for their vices , that that is the collapse to full depravity , the Black Mass of the worship of death , the dedication of your consciousness to the destruction of existence .
“ Productiveness is your acceptance of morality , your recognition of the fact that you choose to live - that productive work is the process by which man ’s consciousness controls his existence , a constant process of acquiring knowledge and shaping matter to fit one ’s purpose , of translating an idea into physical form , of remaking the earth in the image of one ’s values - that all work is creative work if done by a thinking mind , and no work is creative if done by a blank who repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from others - that your work is yours to choose , and the choice is as wide as your mind , that nothing more is possible to you and nothing less is human - that to cheat your way into a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear - corroded ape on borrowed motions and borrowed time , and to settle down into a job that requires less than your mind ’s full capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another kind of motion : decay - that your work is the proce ss of achieving your values , and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition to live - that your body is a machine , but your mind is its driver , and you must drive as far as your mind will take you , with achievement as the goal of your road - that the man who has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any boulder to crash in the first chance ditch , that the man who stifles his mind is a stalled machine slowly going to rust , that the man who lets a leader prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap , and the man who makes another man his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should ever pick up - that your work is the purpose of your life , and you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to stop you , that any value you might find outside your work , any other loyalty or love , can be only travelers you choose to share your journey and must be travelers going on their own power in the same direction .
“ Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your own highest value and , like all of man ’s values , it has to be earned - that of any achievements open to you , the one that makes all others possible is the creation of your own character - that your character , your actions , your desires , your emotions are the products of the premises held by your mind - that as man must produce the physical values he needs to sustain his life , so he must acquire the values of character that make his life worth sustaining - that as man is a being of self - made wealth , so he is a being of self - made soul - that to live requires a sense of self - value , but man , who has no automatic values , has no automatic sense of self - esteem and must earn it by shaping his soul in the image of his moral ideal , in the image of Man , the rational being he is born able to create , but must create by choice - that the first precondition of self - esteem is that radiant selfishness of soul which desires the best in all things , in values of matter and spirit , a soul that seeks above all else to achieve its own moral perfection , valuing nothing higher than itself - and that the proof of an achieved self - esteem is your soul ’s shudder of contempt and rebellion against the role of a sacrificial animal , against the vile impertinence of any creed that proposes to immolate the irreplaceable value which is your consciousness and the incomparable glory which is your existence to the blind evasions and the stagnant decay of others .
“ Are you beginning to see who is John Galt ?
I am the man who has earned the thing you did not fight for , the thing you have renounced , betrayed , corrupted , yet were unable fully to destroy and are now hiding as your guilty secret , spending your life in apologies to every professional cannibal , lest it be discovered that somewhere within you , you still long to say what I am now saying to the hearing of the whole of mankind : I am proud of my own value and of the fact that I wish to live .
“ This wish - which you share , yet submerge as an evil - is the only remnant of the good within you , but it is a wish one must learn to deserve .
His own happiness is man ’s only moral purpose , but only his own virtue can achieve it .
Virtue is not an end in itself .
Virtue is not its own reward or sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil .
Life is the reward of virtue - and happiness is the goal and the reward of life .
“ Just as your body has two fundamental sensations , pleasure and pain , as signs of its welfare or injury , as a barometer of its basic alternative , life or death , so your consciousness has two fundamental emotions , joy and suffering , in answer to the same alternative .
Your emotions are estimates of that which furthers your life or threatens it , lightning calculators giving you a sum of your profit or loss .
You have no choice about your capacity to feel that something is good for you or evil , but what you will consider good or evil , what will give you joy or pain , what you will love or hate , desire or fear , depends on your standard of value .
Emotions are inherent in your nature , but their content is dictated by your mind .
Your emotional capacity is an empty motor , and your values are the fuel with which your mind fills it .
If you choose a mix of contradictions , it will clog your motor , corrode your transmission and wreck you on your first attempt to move with a machine which you , the driver , have corrupted .
“ If you hold the irrational as your standard of value and the impossible as your concept of the good , if you long for rewards you have not earned , for a fortune , or a love you do n’t deserve , for a loophole in the law of causality , for an A that becomes non -A at your whim , if you desire the opposite of existence - you will reach it .
Do not cry , when you reach it , that life is frustration and that happiness is impossible to man ; check your fuel : it brought you where you wanted to go .
“ Happiness is not to be achieved at the command of emotional whims .
Happiness is not the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly attempt to indulge .
Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joy - a joy without penalty or guilt , a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not work for your own destruction , not the joy of escaping from your mind , but of using your mind ’s fullest power , not the joy of faking reality , but of achieving values that are real , not the joy of a drunkard , but of a producer .
Happiness is possible only to a rational man , the man who desires nothing but rational goals , seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions .
“ Just as I support my life , neither by robbery nor alms , but by my own effort , so I do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others , but earn it by my own achievement .
Just as I do not consider the pleasure of others as the goal of my life , so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the lives of others .
Just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts among my desires - so there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among rational men , men who do not desire the unearned and do not view one another with a cannibal ’s lust , men who neither make sacrifice nor accept them .
“ The symbol of all relationships among such men , the moral symbol of respect for human beings , is the trader .
We , who live by values , not by loot , are traders , both in matter and in spirit .
A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved .
A trader does not ask to be paid for his failures , nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws .
A trader does not squander his body as fodder or his soul as alms .
Just as he does not give his work except in trade for material values , so he does not give the values of his spirit - his love , his friendship , his esteem - except in payment and in trade for human virtues , in payment for his own selfish pleasure , which he receives from men he can respect .
The mystic parasites who have , throughout the ages , reviled the traders and held them in contempt , while honoring the beggars and the looters , have known the secret motive of their sneers : a trader is the entity they dread - a man of justice .
“ Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men ?
None - except the obligation I owe to myself , to material objects and to all of existence : rationality .
I deal with men as my nature and their demands : by means of reason .
I seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care to enter of their own voluntary choice .
It is only with their mind that I can deal and only for my own self - interest , when they see that my interest coincides with theirs .
When they do n’t , I enter no relationship ; I let dissenters go their way and I do not swerve from mine .
I win by means of nothing but logic and I surrender to nothing but logic .
I do not surrender my reason or deal with men who surrender theirs .
I have nothing to gain from fools or cowards ; I have no benefits to seek from human vices : from stupidity , dishonesty or fear .
The only value men can offer me is the work of their mind .
When I disagree with a rational man , I let reality be our final arbiter ; if I am right , he will learn ; if I am wrong , I will ; one of us will win , but both will profit .
“ Whatever may be open to disagreement , there is one act of evil that may not , the act that no man may commit against others and no man may sanction or forgive .
So long as men desire to live together , no man may initiate - do you hear me ?
no man may start - the use of physical force against others .
“ To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his perception of reality , is to negate and paralyze his means of survival ; to force - him to act against his own judgment , is like forcing him to act against his own sight .
Whoever , to whatever purpose or extent , initiates the use of force , is a killer acting on the premise of death in a manner wider than murder : the premise of destroying man ’s capacity to live .
“ Do not open your mouth to tell me that your mind has convinced you of your right to force my mind .
Force and mind are opposites ; morality ends where a gun begins .
When you declare that men are irrational animals and propose to treat them as such , you define thereby your own character and can no longer claim the sanction of reason - as no advocate of contradictions can claim it .
There can be no ‘ right ’ to destroy the source of rights , the only means of judging right and wrong : the mind .
“ To force a man to drop his own mind and to accept your will as a substitute , with a gun in place of a syllogism , with terror in place of proof , and death as the final argument - is to attempt to exist in defiance of reality .
Reality demands of man that he act for his own rational interest ; your gun demands of him that he act against it .
Reality threatens man with death if he does not act on his rational judgment : you threaten him with death if he does .
You place him into a world where the price of his life is the surrender of all the virtues required by life - and death by a process of gradual destruction is all that you and your system will achieve , when death is made to be the ruling power , the winning argument in a society of men .
“ Be it a highwayman who confronts a traveler with the ultimatum : ‘ Your money or your life , ’ or a politician who confronts a country with the ultimatum : ‘ Your children ’s education or your life , ’ the meaning of that ultimatum is : ‘ Your mind or your life ’- and neither is possible to man without the other .
“ If there are degrees of evil , it is hard to say who is the more contemptible : the brute who assumes the right to force the mind of others or the moral degenerate who grants to others the right to force his mind .
That is the moral absolute one does not leave open to debate .
I do not grant the terms of reason to men who propose to deprive me of reason .
I do not enter discussions with neighbors who think they can forbid me to think .
I do not place my moral sanction upon a murderer ’s wish to kill me .
When a man attempts to deal with me by force , I answer him - by force .
“ It is only as retaliation that force may be used and only against the man who starts its use .
No , I do not share his evil or sink to his concept of morality : I merely grant him his choice , destruction , the only destruction he had the right to choose : his own .
He uses force to seize a value ; I use it only to destroy destruction .
A holdup man seeks to gain wealth by killing me ; I do not grow richer by killing a holdup man .
I seek no values by means of evil , nor do I surrender my values to evil .
“ In the name of all the producers who had kept you alive and received your death ultimatums in payment , I now answer you with a single ultimatum of our own :
Our work or your guns .
You can choose either ; you ca n’t have both .
We do not initiate the use of force against others or submit to force at their hands .
If you desire ever again to live in an industrial society , it Will be on our moral terms .
Our terms and our motive power are the antithesis of yours .
You have been using fear as your weapon and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality .
We offer him life as his reward for accepting ours .
“ You who are worshippers of the zero - you have never discovered that achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death .
Joy is not ‘ the absence of pain , ’ intelligence is not ‘ the absence of stupidity , ’ light is not ‘ the absence of darkness , ’ an entity is not ‘ the absence of a nonentity . ’
Building is not done by abstaining from demolition ; centuries of sitting and waiting in such abstinence will not raise one single girder for you to abstain from demolishing - and now you can no longer say to me , the builder : ‘ Produce , and feed us in exchange for our notdestroying your production . ’
I am answering in the name of all your victims : Perish with and in your own void .
Existence is not a negation of negatives .
Evil , not value , is an absence and a negation , evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us .
Perish , because we have learned that a zero cannot hold a mortgage over life .
“ You seek escape from pain .
We seek the achievement of happiness .
You exist for the sake of avoiding punishment .
We exist for the sake of earning rewards .
Threats will not make us function ; fear is not our incentive .
It is not death that we wish to avoid , but life that we wish to live .
“ You , who have lost the concept of the difference , you who claim that fear and joy are incentives of equal power - and secretly add that fear is the more ‘ practical ’- you do not wish to live , and only fear of death still holds you to the existence you have damned .
You dart in panic through the trap of your days , looking for the exit you have closed , running from a pursuer you dare not name to a terror you dare not acknowledge , and the greater your terror the greater your dread of the only act that could save you : thinking .
The purpose of your struggle is not to know , not to grasp or name or hear the thing .
I shall now state to your hearing : that yours is the Morality of Death .
“ Death is the standard of your values , death is your chosen goal , and you have to keep running , since there is no escape from the pursuer who is out to destroy you or from the knowledge that that pursuer is yourself .
Stop running , for once - there is no place to run-stand naked , as you dread to stand , but as I see you , and take a look at what you dared to call a moral code .
“ Damnation is the start of your morality , destruction is its purpose , means and end .
Your code begins by damning man as evil , then demands that he practice a good which it defines as impossible for him to practice .
It demands , as his first proof of virtue , that he accept his own depravity without proof .
It demands that he start , not with a standard of value , but with a standard of evil , which is himself , by means of which he is then to define the good : the good is that which he is not .
“ It does not matter who then becomes the profiteer on his renounced glory and tormented soul , a mystic God with some incomprehensible design or any passer - by whose rotting sores are held as some inexplicable claim upon him - it does not matter , the good is not for him to understand , his duty is to crawl through years of penance , atoning for the guilt of his existence to any stray collector of unintelligible debts , his only concept of a value is a zero : the good is that which is non-man .
“ The name of this monstrous absurdity is Original Sin .
“ A sin without volition is a slap at morality and an insolent contradiction in terms : that which is outside the possibility of choice is outside the province of morality .
If man is evil by birth , he has no will , no power to change it ; if he has no will , he can be neither good nor evil ; a robot is amoral .
To hold , as man ’s sin , a fact not open to his choice is a mockery of morality .
To hold man ’s nature as his sin is a mockery of nature .
To punish him for a crime he committed before he was born is a mockery of justice .
To hold him guilty in a matter where no innocence exists is a mockery of reason .
To destroy morality , nature , justice and reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched .
Yet that is the root of your code .
“ Do not hide behind the cowardly evasion that man is born with free will , but with a ‘ tendency ’ to evil .
A free will saddled with a tendency is like a game with loaded dice .
It forces man to struggle through the effort of playing , to bear responsibility and pay for the game , but the decision is weighted in favor of a tendency that he had no power to escape .
If the tendency is of his choice , he cannot possess it at birth ; if it is not of his choice , his will is not free .
“ What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his Original Sin ?
What are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection ?
Their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge - he acquired a mind and became a rational being .
It was the knowledge of good and evil - he became a mortal being .
He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor - he became a productive being .
He was sentenced to experience desire - he acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment .
The evils for which they damn him are reason , morality , creativeness ; joy - all the cardinal values of his existence .
It is not his vices that their myth of man ’s fall is designed to explain and condemn , it is not his errors that they hold as his guilt , but the essence of his nature as man .
Whatever he was - that robot in the Garden of Eden , who existed without mind , without values , without labor , without love - he was not man .
“ Man ’s fall , according to your teachers , was that he gained the virtues required to live .
These virtues , by their standard , are his Sin .
His evil , they charge , is that he ’s man .
His guilt , they charge , is that he lives .
“ They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man .
No , they say , they do not preach that man is evil , the evil is only that alien object : his body .
No , they say , they do not wish to kill him , they only wish to make him lose his body .
They seek to help him , they say , against his pain - and they point at the torture rack to which they ’ve tied him , the rack with two wheels that pull him in opposite directions , the rack of the doctrine that splits his soul and body .
“ They have cut man in two , setting one half against the other .
They have taught him that his body and his consciousness are two enemies engaged in deadly conflict , two antagonists of opposite natures , contradictory claims , incompatible needs , that to benefit one is to injure the other , that his soul belongs to a supernatural realm , but his body is an evil prison holding it in bondage to this earth - and that the good is to defeat his body , to undermine it by years of patient struggle , digging his way to that gorgeous jail - break which leads into the freedom of the grave .
“ They have taught man that he is a hopeless misfit made of two elements , both symbols of death .
A body without a soul is a corpse , a soul without a body is a ghost - yet such is their image of man ’s nature : the battleground of a struggle between a corpse and a ghost , a corpse endowed with some evil volition of its own and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to man is nonexistent , that only the unknowable exists .
“ Do you observe what human faculty that ’ doctrine was designed to ignore ?
It was man ’s mind that had to be negated in order to make him fall apart .
Once he surrendered reason , he was left at the mercy of two monsters whom he could not fathom or control : of a body moved by unaccountable instincts and of a soul moved by mystic revelations - he was left as the passively ravaged victim of a battle between a robot and a dictaphone .
“ And as he now crawls through the wreckage , groping blindly for a way to live , your teachers offer him the help of a morality that proclaims that he ’ll find no solution and must seek no fulfillment on earth .
Real existence , they tell him , is that which he cannot perceive , true consciousness is the faculty of perceiving the non-existent - and if he is unable to understand it , that is the proof that his existence is evil and his consciousness impotent .
“ As products of the split between man ’s soul and body , there are two kinds of teachers of the Morality of Death : the mystics of spirit and the mystics of muscle , whom you call the spiritualists and the materialists , those who believe in consciousness without existence and those who believe in existence without consciousness .
Both demand the surrender of your mind , one to their revelation , the other to their reflexes .
No matter how loudly they posture in the roles of irreconcilable antagonists , their moral codes are alike , and so are their aims : in matter - the enslavement of man ’s body , in spirit - the destruction of his mind .
“ The good , say the mystics of spirit , is God , a being whose only definition is that he is beyond man ’s power to conceive - a definition that invalidates man ’s consciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence .
The good , say the mystics of muscle , is Society - a thing which they define as an organism that possesses no physical form , a super - being embodied in no one in particular and everyone in general except yourself .
Man ’s mind , say the mystics of spirit , must be subordinated to the will of God .
Man ’s mind , say the mystics of muscle , must be subordinated to the will of Society .
Man ’s standard of value say the mystics of spirit , is the pleasure 0f God , whose standards are beyond man ’s power of comprehension and must be accepted on faith .
Man ’s standard of value , say the mystics of muscle , is the pleasure of Society , whose standards are beyond man ’s right of judgment and must be obeyed as a primary absolute .
The purpose of man ’s life , say both , is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he does not know , for reasons he is not to question .
His reward , say the mystics of spirit , will be given to him beyond the grave .
His reward , say the mystics of muscle , will be given on earth - to his great - grandchildren .
“ Selfishness - say both - is man ’s evil .
Man ’s good - say both - is to give up his personal desires , to deny himself , renounce himself , surrender ; man ’s good is to negate the life he lives .
Sacrifice - cry both - is the essence of morality , the highest virtue within man ’s reach .
“ Whoever is now within reach of my voice , whoever is man the victim , not man the killer , I am speaking at the deathbed of your mind , at the brink of that darkness in which you ’re drowning , and if there still remains within you the power to struggle to hold on to those fading sparks which had been yourself - use it now .
The word that has destroyed you is ‘ sacrifice . ’
Use the last of your strength to understand its meaning .
You ’re still alive .
You have a chance .
“ ‘ Sacrifice ’ does not mean the rejection of the worthless , but of the precious .
‘ Sacrifice ’ does not mean the rejection of the evil for the sake of the good , but of the good for the sake of the evil .
‘ Sacrifice ’ is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which you do n’t .
“ If you exchange a penny for a dollar , it is not a sacrifice ; if you exchange a dollar for a penny , it is .
If you achieve the career you wanted , after years of struggle , it is not a sacrifice ; if you then renounce it for the sake of a rival , itis .
If you own a bottle of milk and gave it to your starving child , it is not a sacrifice ; if you give it to your neighbor ’s child and let your own die , it is .
“ If you give money to help a friend , it is not a sacrifice ; if you give it to a worthless stranger , it is .
If you give your friend a sum you can afford , it is not a sacrifice ; if you give him money at the cost of your own discomfort , it is only a partial virtue , according to this sort of moral standard ; if you give him money at the cost of disaster to yourselfthat is the virtue of sacrifice in full .
“ If you renounce all personal desire and dedicate your life to those you love , you do not achieve full virtue : you still retain a value of your own , which is your love .
If you devote your life to random strangers , it is an act of greater virtue .
If you devote your life to serving men you hate - that is the greatest of the virtues you can practice .
“ A sacrifice is the surrender of a value .
Full sacrifice is full surrender of all values .
If you wish to achieve full virtue , you must seek no gratitude in return for your sacrifice , no praise , no love , no admiration , no self - esteem , not even the pride of being virtuous ; the faintest trace of any gain dilutes your virtue .
If you pursue a course of action that does not taint your life by any joy , that brings you no value in matter , no value in spirit , no gain , no profit , no reward - if you achieve this state of total zero , you have achieved the ideal of moral perfection .
“ You are told that moral perfection is impossible to man-and , by this standard , it is .
You cannot achieve it so long as you live , but the value of your life and of your person is gauged by how closely you succeed in approaching that ideal zero which is death .
“ If you start , however , as a passionless blank , as a vegetable seeking to be eaten , with no values to reject and no wishes to renounce , you will not win the crown of sacrifice .
It is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted .
It is not a sacrifice .
It is not a sacrifice to give your life for others , if death is your personal desire .
To achieve the virtue of sacrifice , you must want to live , you must love it , you must burn with passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can give you - you must feel the twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away from your reach and drains your love out of your body ,
It is not mere death that the morality of sacrifice holds out to you as an ideal , but death by slow torture .
“ Do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth .
I am concerned with no other .
Neither are you .
“ If you wish to save the last of your dignity , do not call your best actions a ‘ sacrifice ’ : that term brands you as immoral .
If a mother buys food for her hungry child rather than a hat for herself , it is not a sacrifice : she values the child higher than the hat ; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of mother whose higher value is the hat , who would prefer her child to starve and feeds him only from a sense of duty .
If a man dies fighting for his own freedom , it is not a sacrifice : he is not willing to live as a slave ; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of man who ’s willing .
If a man refuses to sell his convictions , it is not a sacrifice , unless he is the sort of man who has no convictions .
“ Sacrifice could be proper only for those who have nothing to sacrifice - no values , no standards , no judgment - those whose desires are irrational whims , blindly conceived and lightly surrendered .
For a man of moral stature , whose desires are born of rational values , sacrifice is the surrender of the right to the wrong , of the good to the evil .
“ The creed of sacrifice is a morality for the immoral - a morality that declares its own bankruptcy by confessing that it can’t impart to men any personal stake in virtues or value , and that their souls are sewers of depravity , which they must be taught to sacrifice .
By his own confession , it is impotent to teach men to be good and can only subject them to constant punishment .
“ Are you thinking , in some foggy stupor , that it ’s only material values that your morality requires you to sacrifice ?
And what do you think are material values ?
Matter has no value except as a means for the satisfaction of human desires .
Matter is only a tool of human values .
To what service are you asked to give the material tools your virtue has produced ?
To the service of that which you regard as evil : to a principle you do not share , to a person you do not respect , to the achievement of a purpose opposed to your own - else your gift is not a sacrifice .
“ Your morality tells you to renounce the material world and to divorce your values from matter .
A man whose values are given no expression in material form , whose existence is unrelated to his ideals , whose actions contradict his convictions , is a cheap little hypocrite - yet that is the man who obeys your morality and divorces his values from matter .
The man who loves one woman , but sleeps with another - the man who admires the talent of a worker , but hires another - the man who considers one cause to be just , but donates his money to the support of another - the man who holds high standards of craftsmanship , but devotes his effort to the production of trash - these are the men who have renounced matter , the men who believe that the values of their spirit cannot be brought into material reality .
“ Do you say it is the spirit that such men have renounced ?
Yes , of course .
You can not have one without the other .
You are an indivisible entity of matter and consciousness .
Renounce your consciousness and you become a brute .
Renounce your body and you become a fake .
Renounce the material world and you surrender it to evil .
“ And that is precisely the goal of your morality , the duty that your code demands of you .
Give to that which you do not enjoy , serve that which you do not admire , submit to that which you consider evil - surrender the world to the values of others , deny , reject , renounce your self .
Your self is your mind ; renounce it and you become a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow .
“ It is your mind that they want you to surrender - all those who preach the creed of sacrifice , whatever their tags or their motives , whether they demand it for the sake of your soul or of your body , whether they promise you another life in heaven or a full stomach on this earth .
Those who start by saying : ‘ It is selfish to pursue your own wishes , you must sacrifice them to the wishes of others ’- end up by saying : ‘ It is selfish to uphold your convictions , you must sacrifice them to the convictions of others .
“ This much is true : the most selfish of all things is the independent mind that recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth .
You are asked to sacrifice your intellectual integrity , your logic , your reason , your standard of truth - in favor of becoming a prostitute whose standard is the greatest good for the greatest number .
“ If you search your code for guidance , for an answer to the question : ‘ What is the good ? ’- the only answer you will find is ‘ The good of others . ’
The good is whatever others wish , whatever you feel they feel they wish , or whatever you feel they ought to feel .
‘ The good of others ’ is a magic formula that transforms anything into gold , a formula to be recited as a guarantee of moral glory and as a fumigator for any action , even the slaughter of a continent .
Your standard of virtue is not an object , not an act , not a principle , but an intention .
You need no proof , no reasons , no success , you need not achieve in fact the good of others - all you need to know is that your motive was the good of others , not your own .
Your only definition of the good is a negation : the good is the ‘ non - good for me . ’
“ Your code - which boasts that it upholds eternal , absolute , objective moral values and scorns the conditional , the relative and the subjective - your code hands out , as its version of the absolute , the following rule of moral conduct :
If you wish it , it ’s evil ; if others wish it , it ’s good ; if the motive of your action is your welfare , do n’t do it ; if the motive is the welfare of others , then anything goes .
“ As this double - jointed , double - standard morality splits you in half , so it splits mankind into two enemy camps : one isyou , the other is all the rest of humanity .
You are the only outcast who has no right to wish to live .
You are the only servant , the rest are the masters , you are the only giver , the rest are the takers , you are the eternal debtor , the rest are the creditors never to be paid off .
You must not question their right to your sacrifice , or the nature of their wishes and their needs : their right is conferred upon them by a negative , by the fact that they are ‘ non - you . ’
“ For those of you who might ask questions , your code provides a consolation prize and booby - trap : it is for your own happiness , it says , that you must serve the happiness of others , the only way to achieve your joy is to give it up to others , the only way to achieve your prosperity is to surrender your wealth to others , the only way to protect your life is to protect all men except yourself - and if you find no joy in this procedure , it is your own fault and the proof of your evil ; if you were good , you would find your happiness in providing a banquet for others , and your dignity in existing on such crumbs as they might care to toss you .
“ You who have no standard of self - esteem , accept the guilt and dare not ask the questions .
But you know the unadmitted answer , refusing to acknowledge what you see , what hidden premise moves your world .
You know it , not in honest statement , but as a dark uneasiness within you , while you flounder between guilty cheating and grudgingly practicing a principle too vicious to name .
“ I , who do not accept the unearned , neither in values nor in guilt , am here to ask the questions you evaded .
Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others , but not your own ?
If enjoyment is a value , why is it moral when experienced by others , but immoral when experienced by you ?
If the sensation of eating a cake is a value , why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach , but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others ?
Why is it immoral for you to desire , but moral for others to do so ?
Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it , but moral to give it away ?
And if it is not moral for you to keep a value , why is it moral for others to accept it ?
If you are selfless and virtuous when you give it , are they not selfish and vicious when they take it ?
Does virtue consist of serving vice ?
Is the moral purpose of those who are good , self - immolation for the sake of those who are evil ?
“ The answer you evade , the monstrous answer is :
No , the takers are not evil , provided they did not earn the value you gave them .
It is not immoral for them to accept it , provided they are unable to produce it , unable to deserve it , unable to give you any value in return .
It is not immoral for them to enjoy it , provided they do not obtain it by right .
“ Such is the secret core of your creed , the other half of your double standard : it is immoral to live by your own effort , but moral to live by the effort of others - it is immoral to consume your own product , but moral to consume the products of others - it is immoral to earn , but moral to mooch - it is the parasites who are the moral justification for the existence of the producers , but the existence of the parasites is an end in itself - it is evil to profit by achievement , but good to profit by sacrifice - it is evil to create your own happiness , but good to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others .
“ Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by opposite rules : those who may desire anything and those who may desire nothing , the chosen and the demand , the riders and the carriers , the eaters and the eaten .
What standard determines your caste ?
What passkey admits you to the moral elite ?
The passkey islack of value .
“ Whatever the value involved , it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon those who do n’t lack it .
It is yourneed that gives you a claim to rewards .
If you are able to satisfy your need , your ability annuls your right to satisfy it .
But a need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives of mankind .
“ If you succeed , any man who fails is your master ; if you fail , any man who succeeds is your serf .
Whether your failure is just or not , whether your wishes are rational or not , whether your misfortune is undeserved or the result of your vices , it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards .
It is pain , regardless of its nature or cause , pain as a primary absolute , that gives you a mortgage on all of existence .
“ If you heal your pain by your own effort , you receive no moral credit : your code regards it scornfully as an act of self - interest .
Whatever value you seek to acquire , be it wealth or food or love or rights , if you acquire it by means of your Virtue , your code does not regard it as a moral acquisition : you occasion no loss to anyone , it is a trade , not alms ; a payment , not a sacrifice .
The deserved belongs in the selfish , commercial realm of mutual profit ; it is only the undeserved that calls for that moral transaction which consists of profit to one at the price of disaster to the other .
To demand rewards for your virtue is selfish and immoral ; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral right .
“ A morality that holds need as a claim , holds emptiness - non - existence - as its standard of value ; it rewards anabsence , a defeat : weakness , inability , incompetence , suffering , disease , disaster , the lack , the fault , the flaw - thezero .
“ Who provides the account to pay these claims ?
Those who are cursed for being non-zeros , each to the extent of his distance from that ideal .
Since all values are the product of virtues , the degree of your virtue is used as the measure of your penalty ; the degree of your faults is used as the measure of your gain .
Your code declares that the rational man must sacrifice himself to the irrational , the independent man to parasites , the honest man to the dishonest , the man of justice to the unjust , the productive man to thieving loafers , the man of integrity to compromising knaves , the man of self - esteem to sniveling neurotics .
Do you wonder at the meanness of soul in those you see around you ?
The man who achieves these virtues will not accept your moral code ; the man who accepts your moral code will not achieve these virtues .
“ Under a morality of sacrifice , the first value you sacrifice is morality ; the next is self - esteem .
When need is the standard , every man is both victim and parasite .
As a victim , he must labor to fill the needs of others , leaving himself in the position of a parasite whose needs must be filled by others .
He cannot approach his fellow men except in one of two disgraceful roles : he is both a beggar and a sucker .
“ You fear the man who has a dollar less than you , that dollar is rightfully his , he makes you feel like a moral defrauder .
You hate the man who has a dollar more than you , that dollar is rightfully yours , he makes you feel that you are morally defrauded .
The man below is a source of , your guilt , the man above is a source of your frustration .
You do not know what to surrender or demand , when to give and when to grab , what pleasure in life is rightfully yours and what debt is still unpaid to others - you struggle to evade , as ‘ theory , ’ the knowledge that by the moral standard you ’ve accepted you are guilty every moment of your life , there is no mouthful of food you swallow that is not needed by someone somewhere on earth - and you give up the problem in blind resentment , you conclude that moral perfection is not to be achieved or desired , that you will muddle through by snatching as snatch can and by avoiding the eyes of the young , of those who look at you as if self - esteem were possible and they expected you to have it .
Guilt is all that you retain within your soul - and so does every other man , as he goes past , avoiding youreyes .
Do you wonder why your morality has not achieved brotherhood on earth or the good will of man to man ?
“ The justification of sacrifice , that your morality propounds , is more corrupt than the corruption it purports to justify .
The motive of your sacrifice , it tells you , should be love - the love you ought to feel for every man .
A morality that professes the belief that the values of the spirit are more precious than matter , a morality that teaches you to scorn a whore who gives her body indiscriminately to all men- this same morality demands that you surrender your soul to promiscuous love for all comers .
“ As there can be no causeless wealth , so there can be no causeless love or any sort of causeless emotion .
An emotion is a response to a face of reality , an estimate dictated by your standards .
To love is to value .
The man who tells you that it is possible to value without values , to love those whom you appraise as worthless , is the man who tells you that it is possible to grow rich by consuming without producing and that paper money is as valuable as gold .
“ Observe that he does not expect you to feel a causeless fear .
When his kind get into power , they are expert at contriving means of terror , at giving you ample cause to feel the fear by which they desire to rule you .
But when it comes to love , the highest of emotions , you permit them to shriek at you accusingly that you are a moral delinquent if you ’re incapable of feeling causeless love .
When a man feels fear without reason , you call him to the attention of a psychiatrist ; you are not so careful to protect the meaning , the nature and the dignity of love .
“ Love is the expression of one ’s values , the greatest reward you can earn for the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person , the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of another .
Your morality demands that you divorce your love from values and hand it down to any vagrant , not as response to his worth , but as response to his need , not as reward , but as alms , not as a payment for virtues , but as a blank check on vices .
Your morality tells you that the purpose of love is to set you free of the bonds of morality , that love is superior to moral judgment , that true love transcends , forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object , and the greater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved .
To love a man for his virtues is paltry and human , it tells you ; to love him for his flaws is divine .
To love those who are worthy of it is self - interest ; to love the unworthy is sacrifice .
You owe your love to those who do n’t deserve it , and the less they deserve it , the more love you owe them - the more loathsome the object , the nobler your love - the more unfastidious your love , the greater the virtue - and if you can bring your soul to the state of a dump heap that welcomes anything on equal terms , if you can cease to value moral values , you have achieved the state of moral perfection .
“ Such is your morality of sacrifice and such are the twin ideals it offers : to refashion the life of your body in the image of a human stockyard , and the life of your spirit in the image of a dump .
“ Such was your goal - and you ’ve reached it .
Why do you now moan complaints about man ’s impotence and the futility of human aspirations ?
Because you were unable to prosper by seeking destruction ?
Because you were unable to find joy by worshipping pain ?
Because you were unable to live by holding death as your standard of value ?
“ The degree of your ability to live was the degree to which you broke your moral code , yet you believe that those who preach it are friends of humanity , you damn yourself and dare not question their motives or their goals .
Take a look at them now , when you face your last choice - and if you choose to perish , do so with full knowledge of how cheaply so small an enemy has claimed your life .
“ The mystics of both schools , who preach the creed of sacrifice , are germs that attack you through a single sore : your fear of relying on your mind .
They tell you that they possess a means of knowledge higher than the mind , a mode of consciousness superior to reason - like a special pull with some bureaucrat of the universe who gives them secret tips withheld from others .
The mystics of spirit declare that they possess an extra sense you lack : this special sixth sense consists of contradicting the whole of the knowledge of your five .
The mystics of muscle do not bother to assert any claim to extrasensory perception : they merely declare that your senses are not valid , and that their wisdom consists of perceiving your blindness by some manner of unspecified means .
Both kinds demand that you invalidate your own consciousness and surrender yourself into their power .
They offer you , as proof of their superior knowledge , the fact that they assert the opposite of everything you know , and as proof of their superior ability to deal with existence , the fact that they lead you to misery , self - sacrifice , starvation , destruction .
“ They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on this earth .
The mystics of spirit call it ‘ another dimension , ’ which consists of denying dimensions .
The mystics of muscle call it ‘ the future , ’ which consists of denying the present .
To exist is to possess identity .
What identity are they able to give to their superior realm ?
They keep telling you what it is not , but never tell you what it is .
All their identifications consist of negating : God is that which no human mind can know , they say - and proceed to demand that you consider it knowledge - God is non-man , heaven is non-earth , soul is non-body , virtue ‘ is non-profit , A is non-A , perception is non-sensory , knowledge is non-reason .
Their definitions are not acts of defining , but of wiping out .
“ It is only the metaphysics of a leech that would cling to the idea of a universe where a zero is a standard of identification .
A leech would want to seek escape from the necessity to name its own nature - escape from the necessity to know that the substance on which it builds its private universe is blood .
“ What is the nature of that superior world to which they sacrifice the world that exists ?
The mystics of spirit curse matter , the mystics of muscle curse profit the first wish men to profit by renouncing the earth , the second wish men to inherit the earth by renouncing all profit .
Their non-material , non - profit worlds are realms where rivers run with milk and coffee , where wine spurts from rocks at their command , where pastry drops on them from clouds at the price of opening their mouth .
On this material , profit - chasing earth , an enormous investment of virtue - of intelligence , integrity , energy , skill - is required to construct a railroad to carry them the distance of one mile ; in their non-material , non -profit world , they travel from planet to planet at the cost of a wish .
If an honest person asks them : ‘ How ? ’- they answer with righteous scorn that a ‘ how ’ is the concept of vulgar realists ; the concept of superior spirits is ‘ Somehow . ’
On this earth restricted by matter and profit , rewards are achieved by thought ; in a world set free of such restrictions , rewards are achieved by wishing .
“ And that is the whole of their shabby secret .
The secret of all their esoteric philosophies , of all their dialectics and super - senses , of their evasive eyes and snarling words , the secret for which they destroy civilization , language , industries and lives , the secret for which they pierce their own eyes and eardrums , grind out their senses , blank out their minds , the purpose for which they dissolve the absolutes of reason , logic , matter , existence , reality - is to erect upon that plastic fog a single holy absolute : their Wish .
“ The restriction they seek to escape is the law of identity .
The freedom they seek is freedom from the fact that an A will remain an A , no matter what their tears or tantrums - that a river will not bring them milk , no matter what their hunger - that water will not run uphill , no matter what comforts they could gain if it did , and if they want to lift it to the roof of a skyscraper , they must do it by a process of thought and labor , in which the nature of an inch of pipe line counts , but their feelings do not - that their feelings are impotent to alter the course of a single speck of dust in space or the nature of any action they have committed .
“ Those who tell you that man is unable to perceive a reality undistorted by his senses , mean that they are unwilling to perceive a reality undistorted by their feelings .
‘ Things as they are ’ are things as perceived by your mind ; divorce them from reason and they become ‘ things as perceived by your wishes . ’
“ There is no honest revolt against reason - and when you accept any part of their creed , your motive is to get away with something your reason would not permit you to attempt .
The freedom you seek is freedom from the fact that if you stole your wealth , you are a scoundrel , no matter how much you give to charity or how many prayers you recite - that if you sleep with sluts , you ’re not a worthy husband , no matter how anxiously you feel that you love our wife next morning - that you are an entity , not a series of random pieces scattered through a universe where nothing sticks and nothing commits you to anything , the universe of a child ’s nightmare where identities switch and swim , where the rotter and the hero are interchangeable parts arbitrarily assumed at will - that you are a man - that you are an entity - that you are .
“ No matter how eagerly you claim that the goal of your mystic wishing is a higher mode of life , the rebellion against identity is the wish for non-existence .
The desire not to be anything is the desire not to be .
“ Your teachers , the mystics of both schools , have reversed causality in their consciousness , then strive to reverse it in existence .
They take their emotions as a cause , and their mind as a passive effect .
They make their emotions their tool for perceiving reality .
They hold their desires as an irreducible primary , as a fact superseding all facts .
An honest man does not desire until he has identified the object of his desire .
He says : ‘ It is , therefore I want it . ’
They say : ‘ I want it , therefore it is . ’
“ They want to cheat the axiom of existence and consciousness , they want their consciousness to be an instrument not of perceiving but of creating existence , and existence to be not the object but the subject of their consciousness - they want to be that God they created in their image and likeness , who creates a universe out of a void by means of an arbitrary whim .
But reality is not to be cheated .
What they achieve is the opposite of their desire .
They want an omnipotent power over existence ; instead , they lose the power of the consciousness .
By refusing to know , they condemn themselves to the horror of a perpetual unknown .
“ Those irrational wishes that draw you to their creed , those emotions you worship as an idol , on whose altar you sacrifice the earth , that dark , incoherent passion within you , which you take as the voice of God or of your glands , is nothing more than the corpse of your mind .
An emotion that clashes with your reason , an emotion that you cannot explain or control , is only the carcass of that stale thinking which you forbade your mind to revise .
“ Whenever you committed the evil of refusing to think and to see , of exempting from the absolute of reality some one small wish of yours , whenever you chose to say :
Let me withdraw from the judgment of reason the cookies I stole , or the existence of God , let me have my one irrational whim and I will be a man of reason about all else - thatwas the act of subverting your consciousness , the act of corrupting your mind .
Your mind then became a fixed jury who takes orders from a secret underworld , whose verdict distorts the evidence to fit an absolute it dares not touch - and a censored reality is the result , a splintered reality where the bits you chose to see are floating among the chasms of those you did n’t , held together by that embalming fluid of the mind which is an emotion exempted from thought .
“ The links you strive to drown are casual connections .
The enemy you seek to defeat is the law of causality : it permits you no miracles .
The law of causality is the law of identity applied to action .
All actions are caused by entities .
The nature of an action is caused and determined by the nature of the entities that act ; a thing can not act in contradiction to its nature .
An action not caused by an entity would be caused by a zero , which would mean a zero controlling a thing , a non-entity controlling an entity , the non-existent ruling the existent - which is the universe of your teachers ’ desire , the cause of their doctrines of causeless action , the reason of their revolt against reason , the goal of their morality , their politics , their economics , the ideal they strive for : the reign of the zero .
“ The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it , too .
The law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it .
But if you drown both laws in the blanks of your mind , if you pretend to yourself and to others that you do n’t see - then you can try to proclaim your right to eat your cake today and mine tomorrow , you can preach that the way to have a cake is to eat it first , before you bake it , that the way to produce is to start by consuming , that all wishers have an equal claim to all things , since nothing is caused by anything .
The corollary of the causeless in matter is the unearned in spirit .
“ Whenever you rebel against causality , your motive is the fraudulent desire , not to escape it , but worse : to reverse it .
You want unearned love , as if love , the effect , could give you personal value , the cause - you want unearned admiration , as if admiration , the effect , could give you virtue , the cause - you want unearned wealth , as if wealth , the effect , could give you ability , the cause - you plead for mercy , mercy , not justice , as if an unearned forgiveness could wipe out the cause of your plea .
And to indulge your ugly little shams , you support the doctrines of your teachers , while they run hog - wild proclaiming that spending , the effect , creates riches , the cause , that machinery , the effect , creates intelligence , the cause , that your sexual desires , the effect , create your philosophical values , the cause .
“ Who pays for the orgy ?
Who causes the causeless ?
Who are the victims , condemned to remain unacknowledged and to perish in silence , lest their agony disturb your pretense that they do not exist ?
We are , we , the men of the mind .
“ We are the cause of all the values that you covet , we who perform the process of thinking , which is the process of defining identity and discovering causal connections .
We taught you to know , to speak , to produce , to desire , to love .
You who abandon reason - were it not for us who preserve it , you would not be able to fulfill or even to conceive your wishes .
You would not be able to desire the clothes that had not been made , the automobile that had not been invented , the money that had not been devised , as exchange for goods that did not exist , the admiration that had not been experienced for men who had achieved nothing , the love that belongs and pertains only to those who preserve their capacity to think , to choose , to value .
“ You - who leap like a savage out of the jungle of your feelings to the Fifth Avenue of our New York and proclaim that you want to keep the electric lights , but to destroy the generators - it is our wealth that you use while destroying us , it is our values that you use while damning us , it is our language that you use while denying the mind .
“ Just as your mystics of spirit invented their heaven in the image of our earth , omitting our existence , and promised you rewards created by miracle out of non-matter - so your modern mystics of muscle omit our existence and promise you a heaven where matter shapes itself of its own causeless will into all the rewards desired by your non-mind .
“ For centuries , the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protection racket - by making life on earth unbearable , then charging you for consolation and relief , by forbidding all the virtues that make existence possible , then riding on the shoulders of your guilt , by declaring production and joy to be sins , then collecting blackmail from the sinners .
We , the men of the mind , were the unnamed victims of their creed , we who were willing to break their moral code and to bear damnation for the sin of reason - we who thought and acted , while they wished and prayed - we who were moral outcasts , we who were bootleggers of life when life was held to be a crime - while they basked in moral glory for the virtue of surpassing material greed and of distributing in selfless charity the material goods produced by - blank - out .
“ Now we are chained and commanded to produce by savages who do not grant us even the identification of sinners - by savages who proclaim that we do not exist , then threaten to deprive us of the life we do n’t possess , if we fail to provide them with the goods we do n’t produce .
Now we are expected to continue running railroads and to know the minute when a train will arrive after crossing the span of a continent , we are expected to continue running steel mills and to know the molecular structure of every drop of metal in the cables of your bridges and in the body of the airplanes that support you in mid-air - while the tribes of your grotesque little mystics of muscle fight over the carcass of our world , gibbering in sounds of non-language that there are no principles , no absolutes , no knowledge , no mind .
“ Dropping below the level of a savage , who believes that the magic words he utters have the power to alter reality , they believe that reality can be altered by the power of the words they do not utter - and their magic tool is the blank - out , the pretense that nothing can come into existence past the voodoo of their refusal to identify it .
“ As they feed on stolen wealth in body , so they feed on stolen concepts in mind , and proclaim that honesty consists of refusing to know that one is stealing .
As they use effects while denying causes , so they use our concepts while denying the roots and the existence of the concepts they are using .
As they seek , not to build , but to take over industrial plants , so they seek , not to think , but to take over human thinking .
“ As they proclaim that the only requirement for running a factory is the ability to turn the cranks of the machines , and blank out the question of who created the factory - so they proclaim that there are no entities , that nothing exists but motion , and blank out the fact that motion presupposes the thing which moves , that without the concept of entity , there can be no such concept as ‘ motion . ’
As they proclaim their right to consume the unearned , and blank out the question of who ’s to produce it - so they proclaim that there is no law of identity , that nothing exists but change , and blank out the fact that change presupposes the concepts of what changes , from what and to what , that , without the law of identity no such concept as ‘ change ’ is possible .
As they rob an industrialist while denying his value , so they seek to seize power over all of existence while denying that existence exists .
“ ‘ We know that we know nothing , ’ they chatter , blanking out the fact that they are claiming knowledge -’ There are not absolutes , ’ they chatter , blanking out the fact that they are uttering an absolute -’ You can not prove that you exist or that you ’re conscious , ’ they chatter , blanking out the fact that proof presupposes existence , consciousness and a complex chain of knowledge : the existence of something to know , of a consciousness able to know it , and of a knowledge that has learned to distinguish between such concepts as the proved and the unproved .
“ When a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must be proved , he is asking you to prove it by means of non-existence - when he declares that your consciousness must be proved , he is asking you to prove it by means of unconsciousness - he is asking you to step into a void outside of existence and consciousness to give him proof of both - he is asking you to become a zero gaining knowledge about a zero .
“ When he declares that an axiom is a matter of arbitrary choice and he does n’t choose to accept the axiom that he exists , he blanks out the fact that he has accepted it by uttering that sentence , that the only way to reject it is to shut one ’s mouth , expound no theories and die .
“ An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge , a statement necessarily contained in all others , whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not .
An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it .
Let the caveman who does not choose to accept the axiom of identity , try to present his theory without using the concept of identity or any concept derived from it - let the anthropoid who does not choose to accept the existence of nouns , try to devise a language without nouns , adjectives or verbs - let the witch - doctor who does not choose to accept the validity of sensory perception , try to prove it without using the data he obtained by sensory perception - let the head - hunter who does not choose to accept the validity of logic , try to prove it without using logic - let the pigmy who proclaims that a skyscraper needs no foundation after it reaches its fiftieth story , yank the base from under his building , not yours - let the cannibal who snarls that the freedom of man ’s mind was needed to create an industrial civilization , but is not needed to maintain it , be given an arrowhead and bearskin , not a university chair of economics .
“ Do you think they are taking you back to dark ages ?
They are taking you back to darker ages than any your history has known .
Their goal is not the era of pre-science , but the era of pre-language .
Their purpose is to deprive you of the concept on which man ’s mind , his life and his culture depend : the concept of an objective reality .
Identify the development of a human consciousness - and you will know the purpose of their creed .
“ A savage is a being who has not grasped that A is A and that reality is real .
He has arrested his mind at the level of a baby ’s , at the state when a consciousness acquires its initial sensory perception and has not learned to distinguish solid objects .
It is to a baby that the world appears as a blur of motion , without things that move - and the birth of his mind is the day when he grasps that the streak that keeps flickering past him is his mother and the whirl beyond her is a curtain , that the two are solid entities and neither can turn into the other , that they are what they are , that they exist .
The day when he grasps that matter has no volition is the day when he grasps that he has - and this is his birth as a human being .
The day when he grasps that the reflection he sees in a mirror is not a delusion , that it is real , but it is not himself , that the mirage he sees in a desert is not a delusion , that the air and the light rays that cause it are real , but it is not a city , it is a city ’s reflection - the day when he grasps that he is not a passive recipient of the sensations of any given moment , that his senses do not provide him with automatic knowledge in separate snatches independent of context , but only with the material of knowledge , which his mind must learn to integrate - the day when he grasps that his senses cannot deceive him , that physical objects cannot act without causes , that his organs of perception are physical and have no volition , no power to invent or to distort , that the evidence they give him is an absolute , but his mind must learn to understand it , his mind must discover the nature , the causes , the full context of his sensory material , his mind must identify the things that he perceive s - that is the day of his birth as a thinker and scientist .
“ We are the men who reach that day ; you are the men who choose to reach it partly ; a savage is a man who never does .
“ To a savage , the world is a place of unintelligible miracles where anything is possible to inanimate matter and nothing is possible to him .
His world is not the unknown , but that irrational horror : the unknowable .
He believes that physical objects are endowed with a mysterious volition , moved by causeless , unpredictable whims , while he is a helpless pawn at the mercy of forces beyond his control .
He believes that nature is ruled by demons who possess an omnipotent power and that reality is their fluid plaything , where they can turn his bowl of meal into a snake and his wife into a beetle at any moment , where the A he has never discovered can be any non -A they choose , where the only knowledge he possesses is that he must not attempt to know .
He can count on nothing , he can onlywish , and he spends his life on wishing , on begging his demons to grant him his wishes by the arbitrary power of their will , giving them credit when they do , taking the blame when they do n’t , offering them sacrifices in token of his gratitude and sacrifices in token of his guilt , crawling on his belly in fear and worship of sun and moon and wind and rain and of any thug who announces himself as their spokesman , provided his words are unintelligible and his mask sufficiently frightening - he wishes , begs and crawls , and dies , leaving you , as a record of his view of existence , the distorted monstrosities of his idols , part - man , part- animal , part - spider , the embodiments of the world of non-A .
“ His is the intellectual state of your modern teachers and his is the world to which they want to bring you .
“ If you wonder by what means they propose to do it , walk into any college classroom and you will hear your professors teaching your children that man can be certain of nothing , that his consciousness has no validity whatever , that he can learn no facts and no laws of existence , that he ’s incapable of knowing an objective reality .
What , then , is his standard of knowledge and truth ?
Whatever others believe , is their answer .
There is no knowledge , they teach , there ’s only faith : your belief that you exist is an act of faith , no more valid than another ’s faith in his right to kill you ; the axioms of science are an act of faith , no more valid than a mystic ’s faith in revelations ; the belief that electric light can be produced by ‘ a generator is an act of faith , no more valid than the belief that it can be produced by a rabbit ’s foot kissed under a stepladder on the first of the moon - truth is whatever people want it to be , and people are everyone except yourself ; reality is whatever people choose to say it is , there are no objective facts , there are only people ’s arbitrary wishes - a man who seeks knowledge in a laboratory by means of test tubes and logic is an old - fashioned , superstitious fool ; a true scientist is a man who goes around taking public polls - and if it were n’t for the selfish greed of the manufacturers of steel girders , who have a vested interest in obstructing the progress of science , you would learn that New York City does not exist , because a poll of the entire population of the world would tell you by a landslide majority that their beliefs forbid its existence .
“ For centuries , the mystics of spirit have proclaimed that faith is superior to reason , but have not dared deny the existence of reason .
Their heirs and products , the mystics of muscle , have completed their job and achieved their dream : they proclaim that everything is faith , and call it a revolt against believing .
As revolt against unproved assertions , they proclaim that nothing can be proved ; as revolt against supernatural knowledge , they proclaim that no knowledge is possible ; as - revolt against the en
The Problem
Patches rarely receive feedback - positive or negative - on the wine - patches list
Patches that are rejected are n't labelled as such , or publicly given a reason for why they were
Hundreds of patches do n't get in , that just need a tweak or two , that would REALLY improve the wine experience
These failed patches can't easily be seen by anyone unless they know exactly what to Google for
The solution
On Monday , I took part in the first Wine Bug Day ( one of hopefully many ) .
It was a great success , I managed to rope in some support from some friends specifically Sean and Yorik both of whom are Wine users , not Wine developers ( yet ! ) .
And it was n't just us , there was of course Scott Ritchie who organized the thing , but also several users popped up in #winehackers asking for others to change the status of their bugs .
It was all quite exciting in a weird kind of way .
It was because of this buzz of excitement that I continued my bug triaging efforts .
I knew that Autocad 2008 was supposed to * almost * work , so I thought I 'd download the trial and give it a spin in the latest Wine .
Surprisingly it worked pretty well , once I 'd installed the prerequisites using winetricks that is .
The installation went smoothly but on the first load of Autocad all of the icons were black - I 've seen this issue before and I knew that using a native gdiplus.dll would fix it , but of course this is a bug in Wine so I thought I 'd look at little closer .
Sure enough there were 2 gdiplus calls that Autocad uses which are just stubs in Wine : GdipCreateHICONFromBitmap and GdipCreateHBITMAPFromBitmap .
Now , this is where I confirmed ( I kinda knew , and mentioned it in a previous blog post ) that there is a real problem with sending patches to Wine .
Google showed me these two links .
The work has already been done before !
But it 's not in Wine ... I 'm not criticizing the fact that these patches were rejected , even skimming over them I can see a few issues that could do with fixing before they are accepted .
What I do get annoyed about is these people have spent hours of their lives developing something , they 've gone through the effort of creating patches and emailing them to the wine mailing list , and the first patch did n't even get a reply !
Yes , they could join #winehackers and chase for comments , yes , they could take on board the comments and resubmit , but why ?
They 've already put in the extra effort to get the patches out there , is n't a bit unfair to expect them to jump through hoops to get the patches in to Wine ?
I think so .
I know how frustrating it is to get patches into Wine .
In fact , of the patches I have submitted I think only one went in first time , and that was only because it was a simple addition to an existing structure .
It 's taken me 3 attempts to get even simple patches in , this is not encouraging for a developer looking for a project to devote their time to .
Even I have just abandoned patches , simply because I could n't be arsed to go through the loop again for a minor minor thing .
So let 's break down the actual problems :
What we need is a public notice board for these failed patches .
We need a way forto see why a patch was rejected and we need a central point to find these patches so they can be cleaned and resubmitted .
Time permitting that 's what I intend to develop , and here 's how it might work .
wine - patches holds every patch that is sent externally to Wine , whether it was accepted or not .
Given a month and year , we can programmatically dig out a list of all the emails that were submitted by parsing the index page at http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/{YEAR}-{MONTH}/thread.html
- this is our master list .
We can follow those links and also , in code , read the bodies of the patches .
Some of them will be attachments , others will be embedded in the page .
Either way , we can parse the majority of them , some emails wo n't have a patch attached we can strip these ones out .
At this point we have a list of patches submitted , now we just need to know whether they were committed ....
Fortunately , wine - cvs holds the answer .
wine - cvs contains emails for every commit to the master repository .
What we need to do is match the patches in our master list , to the ones in wine - cvs .
If we can't find a close match then we can assume the patch never made it in .
So , in theory we can generate a webpage with this information , with the possibility of devs submitting feedback against the patches so they can be cleaned up and resubmitted .
We can go back pretty far in time with this , I would say at least 6 - 8 months back before the patches just become too old to be worth bothering with .

New Jersey officials have been planning the next train tunnel under the Hudson River for so long that it is already on its third name .
This month , work is scheduled to begin on the Mass Transit Tunnel  formerly known as the Trans - Hudson Express and , before that , Access to the Region ’s Core  more than 15 years after it was conceived .
A ceremonial groundbreaking was set for Monday alongside a highway in North Bergen , N.J. , the site of the first small piece of what could be the biggest transit project in the country .
The tunnel , which is expected to take eight years to complete , bears a current price tag of $ 8.7 billion .
That is about $ 6 billion less than the so - called Big Dig highway tunnel in Boston cost but about $ 6 billion more than the project ’s original price .
By getting started this month , the tunnel project will qualify for $ 130 million in federal money from the economic stimulus package President Obama signed in mid-February .
The project ’s planners , who estimate that it will create more than 5,600 construction jobs , are hoping to receive an additional $ 3 billion in federal money .
“ In addition to creating thousands of jobs and promoting mobility and regional competitiveness in the global economy for decades to come , the Mass Transit Tunnel will provide enormous environmental benefits by taking thousands of cars off the road , ” said New Jersey ’s governor , Jon S. Corzine , who has been one of the project ’s most ardent champions .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Legislation that Israel ’s Arab citizens fear could limit their freedom of speech came a step closer on Sunday to becoming law .
The bill , proposed by a legislator from the ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , would withhold government money from any state - supported institutions that fund activity deemed detrimental to the state .
Such activity includes “ rejecting Israel ’s existence as the state of the Jewish people ” and supporting “ armed struggle or terrorist acts ” against Israel .
A ministerial committee approved the bill , clearing the way for its presentation to parliament for future debate and voting .
The legislation is a watered down version of a proposed law that would have made it a criminal offence to commemorate the “ Nakba ” on Israel ’s independence day .
The term refers to what Palestinians describe as the catastrophe they suffered when Israel was created in 1948 .
About 1.5 million , or 20 percent , of the country ’s citizens are Arabs of Palestinian origin .
Leaders of the Israeli Arab community have been outspoken in rejecting any definition of Israel as a Jewish state and in supporting their Palestinian brethren ’s statehood aspirations in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Israeli Arab lawmaker Ahmed Tibi described the bill as “ Lieberman ’s thought police running amok and dragging the entire government with it . ”
Tibi said “ hatred of Arabs has caused the government to lose its mind . ”
Criminal penalties in an earlier draft of the bill were removed at the request of several ministers .

The Feminist Library is looking for support as well as wishing to continue welcoming visitors .
A unique collection of over 10,000 books , 700 sets of magazines and over two thousand pamphlets can be found in the building at St George 's Circus .
Although the library holds some original suffragette pamphlets , it is largely devoted to the second - wave materials from late 1960s to 1970s .
The collection has been built up over more than thirty years mainly by volunteers who have had to face a recurring financial crisis .
Despite these difficulties it remains the largest library of contemporary feminist material in the UK .
Much of the material is not available elsewhere but , say supporters , by keeping it together future researchers will be able to have a coherent picture of the women 's movement in the second half of the 20th - century .
The library 's beginning can be traced back to 1976 when the Women 's Research and Resources Centre was formed .
Its succession of addresses included one in Clerkenwell next to Spare Rib .
The library moved from the Embankment to the present Southwark building following the abolition of the GLC in 1987 .
" From just stepping into that special , unique collection of books , periodicals , poetry , pamphlets and much more I could feel every inch of the buzz , history , knowledge and energy that keeps me returning , " says Natasha Cock who discovered the library in 2007 .
" I feel alive and full of purpose and conviction that I 'm working to further a set of issues and movements that I believe in . "
Supporter Sarah O'Mahoney , who was a librarian , describes the library as " an amazing fiction and non-fiction collection with every key feminist book you could think of " .
In 2006 the Feminist Library was instrumental in seeing that the Women 's Health Library was saved from being disposed of at a rubbish tip .
In addition to welcoming visitors and readers , the library is looking for more volunteers to help with fundraising and cataloguing .
The Feminist Library has a unique classification system .
The current cataloguing project aims not only at preserving the system based on feminist scholarship but also making the catalogue searchable on line .
It is intended that eventually rare pamphlets , journals and posters will also be available online .
• The Feminist Library is at 5 Westminster Bridge Road ; open Saturday 11 am to 5 pm .
Mexican Soccer Fan Punches Woman In The Face : Video
The first rule of fighting is :
Do not hit a woman .
The second rule of fighting is : DO NOT HIT A WOMAN .
Someone needs to tell this Mexican soccer fan these rules .
In the middle of a match between Indios de Ciudad Juárez and Pachuca , he got into an argument with another guy .
A woman stood up between the two to try and break things up , but succeeded only in breaking up his punch with her face .
The other man then jumped on the attacker , only to then be shoved away by riot police , who happened to already be in that same row .
All of this may or may not be normal at Mexican soccer matches , but damned if I ’m ever going to one to find out .

Piraattipuolue on kerännyt talven aikana kannatuskortteja , ja parin kuukauden sisällä siitä pitäisi tulla uusi puolue myös Suomeen .
Maailmalla vastaavia ryhmittymiä on parisenkymmentä , pääosa Euroopassa mutta myös Australiassa ja Yhdysvalloissa .
Kaikkia ryhmiä yhdistävät sananvapauteen liittyvät kysymykset .
- Haluamme turvata ihmisten sananvapautta ja yksityisyyden suojaa .
Piraattiaatteella ei pelkästään ilmaista nettilataamista , epävirallisen puolueen puheenjohtaja Pasi Palmulehto tiivistää puolueensa agendan .
Palmulehto vieraili YLEn Aamu - tv:ssä .
EU tärkeä vaikutuskenttä
Ruotsissa piraattipuolue sai ensimmäisen edustajan EU - parlamenttiin .
Palmulehdon mielestä on tärkeää , että Euroopan parlamentissa on piraattipuolueen edustaja .
- EU:ssa päätetään hyvin pitkälle , mitä maat itse voivat asiasta säätää , hän perustelee .
Hänen mielestään Ruotsin piraattipuolueen suosio kertoo ihmisten tyytymättömyydestä uusiin sananvapautta rajoittaviin lakeihin .
- Ruotsissa ei ole onnistuttu tekemään lakeja , jotka miellyttävät kansaa .
Siellä on tehty salakuuntelulaki , jolla vakoillaan omia kansalaisia ja lähivaltioita .
Ihmiset eivät hyväksy tällaista , ne menevät liian pitkälle
Kritiikkiä artistien oikeuksien polkemisesta
Tekijänoikeuden tiedotus - ja valvontakeskus kritisoi Piraattipuoluetta taiteilijoiden tekijänoikeuksien polkemisesta .
- Yksipuolinen näkökulma huolestuttaa .
Taiteilijoilla ja yrityksillä ei olisi oikeutta neuvotella teosten käytöstä .
Tässä ollaan viemässä heidän oikeutta harjoittaa ammattiaan , toiminnanjohtaja Antti Kotilainen perustelee .
Uusia äänestäjiä nuorista
Puolue mielletään nuorten miesten puolueeksi .
Puheenjohtaja uskookin , että puolue aktivoi äänestysuurnille sellaisia ihmisiä , jotka eivät ole aiemmin olleet poliittisesti aktiivisia .
Hänen mielestään perinteiset puolueet eivät herätä nuorten kiinnostusta , mutta piraattipuolueen teemat he tuntevat ja kokevat tärkeiksi .
Puheenjohtajan mukaan piraattipuolue ei ole yhden asian puolue , vaan harvojen asioiden puolue .
- Se on ehdoton voimavara .
Voimme keskittyä niihin asioihin , jotka kulloinkin tarvitsevat huomioita .
Palmulehto uskoo , että vuoden 2011 eduskuntavaaleissa puolue saa yhden tai kaksi edustajaa eduskuntaan .

UGA 's Biorefinery and Carbon Cycling Program , in partnership with EPRIDA , a private firm in Athens , Ga. , host a pilot thermochemical biorefinery on the UGA campus .
The pilot - scale refinery system converts peanut hulls to hydrogen ( or other fuels ) to biochar .
This byproduct holds tremendous potential for carbon sequestration and production of soil amendments , bio - based products and fuels .
Credit : University of Georgia
Former inhabitants of the Amazon Basin enriched their fields with charred organic materials - biochar - and transformed one of the earth 's most infertile soils into one of the most productive .
These early conservationists disappeared 500 years ago , but centuries later , their soil is still rich in organic matter and nutrients .
Now , scientists , environmental groups and policymakers forging the next world climate agreement see biochar not only as an important tool for replenishing soils , but as a powerful tool for combating global warming .
Christoph Steiner , a University of Georgia research scientist in the Faculty of Engineering , was a major contributor to the biochar proposal that was submitted by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification last week at the United Nations Climate Change Conference meeting in Poland .
The new climate change agreement will replace the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" The potential of biochar lies in its ability to sequester - capture and store - huge amounts of carbon while also displacing fossil fuel energy , effectively doubling its carbon impact , " said Steiner , a soil scientist whose research in the Amazon Basin originally focused on the use of biochar as a soil amendment .
At UGA 's Biorefinery and Carbon Cycling Program , he now investigates the global potential of biochar to sequester carbon .
He also serves as a consultant to the UNCCD , a sister program to the climate change convention .
Steiner explained that almost any kind of organic material - peanut shells , pine chips and even poultry litter - can be burned in air - tight conditions , a process called pyrolysis .
The byproducts are biochar , a highly porous charcoal that helps soil retain nutrients and water , and gases and heat that can be used as energy .
But because the carbon in biochar so effectively resists degradation , it also can sequester carbon in soils for hundreds to thousands of years , effectively making it a permanent " sink " - a natural system that soaks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
Soils containing biochar made by ancient Amazon people still contain up to 70 times more carbon than surrounding soils and have a higher nutrient content .
Steiner said scientists estimate biochar from agriculture and forestry residues can potentially sequester billions of tons of carbon in the world 's soils .
Biochar also avoids the disadvantages of other bioenergy technologies that deplete soil organic matter , said Steiner .
" Removing crop residues for bioenergy production reduces the organic matter accumulating on agricultural fields and thus the soil organic carbon pool , which depends on constant input of decomposing plant material .
In contrast , pyrolysis with biochar carbon sequestration produces renewable energy , sequesters CO2 and cycles nutrients back into agricultural fields . "
" This unique system ideally utilizes waste biomass , and thus does not compete with food production , " said Steiner .
Currently most waste biomass decomposes or is burned in the field .
Both processes release carbon dioxide stored in the plant biomass - for no other use than getting rid of it .
Biochar can capture up to 50 percent of the carbon stored in biomass and establishes a significant carbon sink , as long as renewable resources are used and biochar is used as a soil amendment .
To address our world 's climate change dilemma , said Steiner , " We need a carbon sink in addition to greater energy efficiency and renewable energy .
Acceptance of the UNCCD proposal in Poland is a first step to make carbon trading based on biochar a reality .
This has not only consequences for mitigating climate change , but also for agricultural sustainability , and could provide a strong incentive to reduce deforestation , especially in the tropics . "

LONDON  Britain ’s Conservative Party , which is leading opinion polls less than a year before the next election , confirmed Monday its intention to give the Bank of England sweeping regulatory powers over banks .
The plans would rip apart Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s supervisory model , which the party blames for the country ’s financial troubles .
David Cameron , the Conservative Party leader , formally proposed to abolish the Financial Services Authority , Britain ’s financial regulator , and move its powers to the central bank .
Britain ’s regulatory system needs “ one body to be unambiguously in charge , ” he said in a speech in London on Monday .
“ In the United States , they ’ve called on the Federal Reserve , ” Mr. Cameron said .
“ In Britain , it ’s time to call on the Bank of England . ”
Britain ’s current regulatory system was set up by Mr. Brown when he was chancellor of the Exchequer in 1997 .
The Financial Services Authority is an independent nongovernmental body , but its board is appointed by the Treasury .

Apple has flatly refused to tell anyone just what chips lie inside the iPhone 3G S .
In fact , while Apple insists that the " s " in 3G S stands for speed , it could equally well stand for secrecy .
But T - Mobile in the Netherlands apparently did n't get the memo , and has gone ahead and posted the hardware specs on the product page for the new models .
The relevant numbers are 256MB RAM for the OS , double that of the 128MB in the original iPhone , and a 600MHz processor , up from the pedestrian 412M Hz of the first two models .
The added RAM alone probably makes a huge difference – if you have ever added memory to a Mac you 'll know how much OS X loves it some extra gigs to play around in .
And that processor neatly leapfrogs the second - gen iPod Touch 's 532M Hz .
It also shuts up anyone comparing the iPhone to the Palm Pre , which has the exact same number of megahertz : 600 .
Of course , this never really mattered – as soon as the iPhone goes on sale it will be torn apart like a gazelle being set upon by hunger - crazed lions and the innards cast across the floor for all to see .
We wonder just how long the T - Mobile site will keep this information up .

According to Broadcast and Cable media giant Clear Channel has already passed on the chance to give former Alaska governor Sarah Palin her own radio show .
Clear Channel turned her down because they were n’t sure that she could handle talking for 15 live hours a week .
Palin might not find as many takers for her services as she thought .
According to Paige Albiniak , Clear Channel ’s major concern was that ,
The main objection to Palin as radio talk - show host is that she would have to hold forth for three hours a day .
While some of her recent remarks may indicate a talent for improvisation , anyone who ’s listened to Rush Limbaugh or Thom Hartmann or Don Imus or Howard Stern or even Ryan Seacrest knows it ’s the rare personality who can blab extemporaneously for 15 hours a week .
And relying on callers to get you through wo n’t help , because as we ’ve all experienced , callers - in are usually more embarrassing than compelling . ”
Clear Channel thinks that Palin might not be able to cut it in the world of talk radio .
They may be correct .
She does have no experience , and nothing in her speeches or public appearances would lead someone to think that she has the ability to be entertaining and compelling on live radio every weekday .
Palin tends to repeat herself and stick to the same basic talking points .
This is n’t the trait of a great radio host .

Palin is probably a much better fit for television .
I could see her doing one hour of television on the weekend , on Fox News , like her fellow Republican Mike Huckabee .
Palin is the Paris Hilton of the political world .
She is famous because of who she is .
She is political pop culture .
Palin is still going to make a boat load of money , but her cash may have to come from her book and the speaking circuit .
For the sake for Palin ’s political ambitions , having a radio or television show would keep her in the public eye and in the mix for 2012 .
Without some sort of media platform , Palin is going to struggle to get publicity .
One also ca n’t overlook the irony that Palin constantly bashes the media , yet she is willing to sell herself out to the media for a buck and to keep herself in the spotlight .
Once again , Palin is revealing the hypocrisy of her own words .
It was bad enough when Republican candidates in the presidential election invoked Jack Bauer from the TV show 24 as their model for how to deal with terrorists .
Now the National Review has published an incredibly surreal list of the “ Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years “ .
Here ’s the complete list :
# 25 : Gran Torino ( 2008 )
# 24 : Team America : World Police ( 2004 )
# 23 : United 93 ( 2006 )
# 22 : Brazil ( 1985 )
# 21 : Heartbreak Ridge ( 1986 )
# 20 : Gattaca ( 1997 )
# 19 : We Were Soldiers ( 2002 )
# 18 : The Edge ( 1997 )
# 17 : The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe ( 2005 )
# 16 : Master and Commander ( 2003 )
# 15 : Red Dawn ( 1984 )
# 14 : A Simple Plan ( 1998 )
# 13 : Braveheart ( 1995 )
# 12 : The Dark Knight ( 2008 )
# 11 : The Lord of the Rings ( 2001 , 2002 , 2003 )
# 10 : Ghostbusters ( 1984 )
# 9 : Blast from the Past ( 1999 )
# 8 : Juno ( 2007 )
# 7 : The Pursuit of Happyness ( 2006 )
# 6 : Groundhog Day ( 1993 )
# 5 : 300 ( 2007 )
# 4 : Forrest Gump ( 1994 )
# 3 : Metropolitan ( 1990 )
# 2 : The Incredibles ( 2004 )
#1 : The Lives of Others ( 2007 )
Their # 1 Conservative movie of the last 25 years is The Lives of Others , a German film that is ironically about the evils of government wiretapping .
Other movies on their list are equally interesting .
They picked # 10 Ghostbusters because the bad guy ( not counting the ghosts ) is an obnoxious bureaucrat who works for the EPA .
And how # 24 Team America : World Police by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone , and Brazil by Terry Gilliam ( from Monty Python ) got onto their list is a mystery .
UPDATE : Fark has the complete list , along with the conservative review of each movie from NRO .
I love some of their comments — Brazil is “ Vividly depicting the miserable results of elitist utopian schemes ” .
In The Cronicles of Narnia “ The White Witch runs a godless , oppressive , paranoid regime that hates Santa Claus ” .
And in The Dark Knight , Batman represents none other than Dubya , whose “ stubborn integrity kept the nation safe and turned the tide of war ” against the terrorist Joker — by devising new means of surveillance , pushing the limits of the law , and accepting the hatred of the press and public .
I kid you not .
The Home Office has announced :
UK identity card image unveiled
The ID card image shows the information contained on the face of the card , including photograph , name , date of birth and signature , and the card 's unique design .
It will hold similar information to that currently contained in the UK passport as well as a photograph and fingerprints on a secure electronic chip - linking the owner of the card securely to their unique biometric identity .
Thankfully there is no printed address on this ID Card design .
Will the Home Office Press Release use of the word " unveiled " , coupled with a female photographic image of a female , cause resentment within the fundamentalist Islamic community ?
The 2006 to 2016 validity period of this specimen ID card image also implies 3 years of delays to the scheme .
It comes as no surprise , that the web link URL advertised on the back of this ID Card : www.direct.gov.uk/myid, gives a 404 error i.e. the web page does not exist .
This lack of coordination and communication between different parts of the Home Office is typical of the whole ID Cards scheme to date .
Will the ID Card number be randomly allocated , or will it betray information about the ID Card controllee , through batch sequences , which can also help to break the cryptographic protections on the Contactless / RFID chip , just as happened with the Netherlands biometric passport ?
The prefix " IDGBR " will be enough of an unencrypted identifier , which can be read remotely by " illegal " radio equipment , to snoop on British travellers , well beyond the normal very short range of the official ID Card reading equipment .
Potentially , this could also be used to trigger terrorist bombs , which only detonate , when British citizens are within the lethal radius - this is not our idea of a " security feature " !
Identity Commissioner
The Home Office takes seriously the concerns that the public have over their information being stored securely and accessed appropriately .
That is why an Identity Commissioner will be appointed before ID cards are introduced to oversee operation of the service and report annually on the uses to which ID cards are put and the confidentiality and integrity of information recorded in the National Identity Register .
Public panel meetings in Manchester and London will allow the public to join a conversation about the National Identity Service so their views , reactions and concerns inform the way service is developed and delivered .
Who exactly will be appointed as the virtually powerless National Identity Scheme Commissioner ?
Why should we trust the National Identity Scheme Commissioner , to provide effective checks and balances ?
The Commissioner can only write an annual , censored Report to the Home Secretary , about the scheme , and the office will not have any resources to investigate individual complaints about the scheme from members of the public , and no legal powers to do anything about any such errors and failings .
The National Identity Scheme Commissioner is specifically forbidden by the terms of reference which appoint him under the Identity Cards Act 2006 section 22 Appointment of National Identity Scheme Commissioner to look into the following activities , which are exactly the secret activities which are the most likely to abuse the National Identity Register , and which therefore should be scrutinised the most :
(4) The matters to be kept under review by the Commissioner do not include -- ( a ) the exercise of powers which under this Act are exercisable by statutory instrument or by statutory rule for the purposes of the Statutory Rules ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1979 ( S.I. 1979 /1573 ( N.I. 12 ) ) ; ( b ) appeals against civil penalties ; ( c ) the operation of so much of this Act or of any subordinate legislation as imposes or relates to criminal offences ; ( d ) the provision of information to the Director - General of the Security Service , the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service or the Director of the Government Communications Headquarters ; ( e ) the provision to another member of the intelligence services , in accordance with regulations under section 21 ( 5 ) , of information that may be provided to that Director - General , Chief or Director ; ( f ) the exercise by the Secretary of State of his powers under section 38 ; or ( g ) arrangements made for the purposes of anything mentioned in paragraphs ( a ) to ( f ) .
Please support or join the cross party NO2ID Campaign , to resist the introduction of this far too expensive , insecure , privacy invasive and counterproductive ID Card scheme in the UK .

Of all of the CIA " enhanced interrogation techniques " waterboarding has gotten the most attention , fitting most people 's definition of torture .
I have previously diaried that when the CIA 's doctors ( Office of Medical Services , OMS ) finally were consulted on the enhanced interrogation techniques in December 2004 , they imposed several restrictions on the program to try to ensure that the detainees would not die as a result of interrogation .
One of the changes was a requirement for a physician with a tracheotomy kit to be present during waterboarding .
I have also written about how waterboarding combined with other techniques could lead to a medical complication that could cause painful and severe nerve injury to the legs , a condition that may affect one of the detainees , Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri ( al - Nashiri ) .
At the suggestion of Marcy Wheeler , I have spent time reviewing the Autopsy reports of the detainees known to have died in US custody in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Of these 44 detainee deaths , 21 were determined by US military pathologists to be homicides .
Most of the autopsies reveal the handiwork of pure cruelty .
The autopsies are replete with descriptions of linear bruises caused by batons or other blunt objects , patterned abrasions ( " brush burns " ) on the back from dragging , cuts and bruises at the wrists from shackling , boot prints in the flesh , head injuries that cause blood vessels in the brain to rupture ....
This link to an ACLU press release provides several telling excerpts .
Aside from the unadulterated cruelty evident in many of the autopsies , one autopsy reveals a death that was exacerbated by the medical experimentation of the early torture program .
One of the homicide victims , an Afghani Mullah named Habibullah , was clearly beaten while in captivity ( Autopsy Link PDF ) .
Indeed , his torture and that of another detainee who died a week after him , is detailed in the excellent reporting of Tim Golden .
However , despite the severity of his injuries , Habibullah 's autopsy suggests that his beating was not alone in causing his death .
It is likely that " enhanced interrogation techniques " the DOJ approved for use by the CIA in August 2002 and which Donald Rumsfeld approved for Military use on December 2 , 2002 caused or contributed to his death .
The Beating
According to the autopsy report ( PDF ) , Habibullah was not injured when he first arrived at the Bagram detention facility :
MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW : Copies of the inprocessing evaluation are reviewed in full .
The clinical portion documents the decedent as " appearing well " , without injuries and offering " moderate resistance to inprocessing " .
The decedent was " dead on arrival " per the Medical Treatment Facility ( MTF ) Emergency Room record which was otherwise non-contributory .
On autopsy , however , Habibullah 's body bore the stigmata of torture ( Graphic content warning ) :
Head and Neck : Multiple abrasions and contusions and evidence of ligature or other instrument applied to the neck :
On the right side of the neck there are two parallel , faint , linear abraded contusions .
each averaging 1 1/4 x 1/4 inches with 1/2 inch separation between the two .
They average approximately 10 inches below the top of the head and three inches to the right of the anterior midline .
Just to the left of these is a similar , fainter , patchy abraded contusion in
approximately the same dimensions .
Torso : Multiple contusions and abrasions including " brush burn " injuries consistent with being dragged on the ground .
Extremities : Multiple contusions and abrasions , including injuries around the wrists consistent with shackling .
On the thighs were linear contusions likely made from being struck with blunt objects .
The patterns in the skin of the left calf revealed the likely source of the injuries - combat boots :
On the back of the left knee and calf is a 11 x 7 1 / 2 inch red - dark purple contusion which extends upwards above the back of the knee in a linear fashion .
On internal examination , confluent hemorrhage extends deep within the muscle which is focally necrotic .
On the left calf , centrally located , is a patterned abrasion consisting of multiple parallel horizontal linear abrasions the largest averaging 1 1/2 x 1/4 inches , these are closely spaced .
The Killer
Despite the violence inflicted upon his extremities , what killed Habibullah was found when they cut open his chest :
Examination of the pulmonary artery in - situ reveals a large branching embolus ( blood clot ) extending into both the right and left pulmonary arteries .
The embolus is mildly firm .
focally coiled , and smaller than the circumference of the pulmonary vessels .
Habibullah died of pulmonary embolism .
A pulmonary embolus is a blood clot that is passed from the veins to the heart , then pumped into the lungs .
Blood clots in the pulmonary arteries block blood flow to the lungs .
Because the lungs oxygenate the blood needed for life , if large enough , pulmonary emboli lead to death .
Analysis
The Autopsy listed the cause of death as " Pulmonary embolism due to blunt force injuries " , and the manner of death as homicide .
Whereas I concur this was a homicide , and Habibullah was clearly beaten severely , I strongly doubt that blunt force injuries were the sole cause of the pulmonary embolism .
Pulmonary embolism is most often caused by immobility , which lets blood clots form in the deep veins ( usually of the legs ) .
When trauma is a cause of pulmonary embolism , it is almost always associated with immobility .
For example , head injuries leading to coma and leg fractures both result in immobility and high risk of pulmonary embolism .
In the hospital , such patients would get preventative treatment , such as with a blood thinner to prevent blood clots from forming in the veins of the immobile extremities .
But in Afghanistan in December 2002 , immobility was exactly what was in store for a detainee .
Habibullah was being interrogated by the military .
Upon autopsy he was clothed only in an adult diaper .
Because he was taken from his cell to the Bagram medical facility " dead on arrival " it is likely he was wearing a diaper when he was found " unresponsive , restrained in his cell " ( hanging shackled from the ceiling ) .
This is consistent with the nudity and use of diapering during " sleep deprivation " approved by Rumsfeld and described as part of the protocols for CIA interrogation during one technique : sleep deprivation - in which the detainee is shackled standing or sitting for up to 7 1/2 days straight .
We have learned from the 2005 Bradbury memos that sleep deprivation causes venous stasis in the legs and has led to severe leg edema .
We know that Habibullah was shackled to the ceiling of his cell for sleep deprivation , where he was ultimately found dead .
This scenario is reinforced by a citation of a DOD criminal investigation report in the recently released Senate Armed Services Committee Report on Detainee Treatment ( PDF ) .
This citation noted that " the use of stress positions and sleep deprivation combined with other mistreatment at the hands of Bagram personnel , caused or were direct contributing factors in the two homicides [ Habibullah and Dilawar ] . "
Postscript
In addition renewed attention to blatant and banal cruelty evident in the deaths of detainees in the " War on Terror " , I wanted to point out again that the detainees were subjected to medical experimentation .
Although it is widely known that immobility can lead to blood clots and risk of life - threatening pulmonary embolism ( See Dan Quayle and David Bloom [ h/t Clytemnestra ] ) this risk was apparently not entertained in the initial crafting of the CIA and DOD interrogation programs .
It is interesting to note that another enhanced interrogation technique that forces immobility , " Cramped Confinement " , was approved for use by the CIA in 2002 and initially allowed 18 hours of confinement in a box that " restrict[s ] the individual 's movement . "
An important change to cramped confinement was made in the 2005 DOJ memo for the CIA ; Confinement time was limited to 8 hour sessions and the time limit was now subject to input from OMS officers .
These changes suggest awareness of the potential complications of immobility , and suggest bad experience necessitated the change .
Habibullah 's death by pulmonary embolism is likely one of the events reviewed by the OMS in imposing limits on immobility .
I suspect that the CIA IG report to be released tomorrow will detail many of the " failed experiments " with torture that led to detainee injury or death .
It is important to remember that torture is still torture even if the wonders of modern medicine are employed to keep the torture victims alive .

First calculated in 2006 , the second edition adds data on almost all the world 's countries and now covers 99 % of the world 's population .
NEF says the HPI is a much better way of looking the success of countries than through standard measures of economic growth .
The HPI shows , for example , that fast - growing economies such as the US , China and India were all greener and happier 20 years ago than they are today .
" The HPI suggests that the path we have been following is , without exception , unable to deliver all three goals : high life satisfaction , high life expectancy and ' one - planet living ' , " says Saamah Abdallah , NEF researcher and the report 's lead author .
" Instead we need a new development model that delivers good lives that do n't cost the Earth for all . "
Costa Ricans top the list because they report the highest life satisfaction in the world , they live slightly longer than Americans , yet have an ecological footprint that is less than a quarter the size .
The country only narrowly fails to achieve the goal of what NEF calls " one- planet living " : consuming its fair share of the Earth 's natural resources .
The report says the differences between nations show that it is possible to live long , happy lives with much smaller ecological footprints than the highest - consuming nations .
The new HPI also provides the first ever analysis of trends over time for what are supposedly the world 's most developed nations , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
OECD nations ' HPI scores plummeted between 1960 and the late 1970s .
Although there have been some gains since then , HPI scores were still higher in 1961 than in 2005 .
Life satisfaction and life expectancy combined have increased 15 % over the 45 - year period for those living in the rich nations , but it has come at the cost of a 72 % rise in their ecological footprint .
And the three largest countries in the world – China , India and the US , which are aggressively pursuing growth - based development models – have all seen their HPI scores drop in that time .
The highest placed western nation is the Netherlands .
People there live on average over a year longer than people in the US , and have similar levels of life satisfaction – yet their per capita ecological footprint is less than half the size .
The Netherlands is therefore over twice as environmentally efficient at achieving good lives as the US , Nef says .
The report sets out a " Happy Planet Charter " calling for an unprecedented collective global effort to develop a " new narrative " of human progress , encourage good lives that do n't cost the earth , and to reduce consumption in the highest - consuming nations – which it says is the biggest barrier to sustainable wellbeing .
Matthew 1
The Genealogy of Jesus 1A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David , the son of Abraham : 2A braham was the father of Isaac , … 16 and Jacob the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
17 Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David , fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon , and fourteen from the exile to the Christ .
The Birth of Jesus Christ 18 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about :
His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph , but before they came together , she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit .
19 Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace , he had in mind to divorce her quietly .
20 But after he had considered this , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Joseph son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife , because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit .
21 She will give birth to a son , and you are to give him the name Jesus , because he will save his people from their sins . ”
22
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet : 23 ″ The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son , and they will call him Immanuel ” — which means , “ God with us . ” 24 When Joseph woke up , he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife .
25 But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son .
And he gave him the name Jesus .
Matthew 2
The Visit of the Magi 1After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea , during the time of King Herod , Magi from the east came to Jerusalem 2 and asked , “ Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews ?
We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him . ”
3 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed , and all Jerusalem with him .
4 When he had called together all the people ’s chief priests and teachers of the law , he asked them where the Christ was to be born .
5 ″ In Bethlehem in Judea , ” they replied , “ for this is what the prophet has written : 6 ″ ‘ But you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , are by no means least among the rulers of Judah ; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel . ’ ”
7 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared .
8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said , “ Go and make a careful search for the child .
As soon as you find him , report to me , so that I too may go and worship him . ”
9After they had heard the king , they went on their way , and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was .
10 When they saw the star , they were overjoyed .
11 On coming to the house , they saw the child with his mother Mary , and they bowed down and worshiped him .
Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh .
12
And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod , they returned to their country by another route .
The Escape to Egypt 13 When they had gone , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream .
“ Get up , ” he said , “ take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt .
Stay there until I tell you , for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him . ”
14So he got up , took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt , 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod .
And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet : “ Out of Egypt I called my son . ”
16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi , he was furious , and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under , in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi .
17 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled : 18 ″ A voice is heard in Ramah , weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted , because they are no more . ”
The Return to Nazareth 19 After Herod died , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 20 and said , “ Get up , take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel , for those who were trying to take the child ’s life are dead . ”
21 So he got up , took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel .
22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there .
Having been warned in a dream , he withdrew to the district of Galilee , 23 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth .
So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets : “ He will be called a Nazarene . ” Luke 2 The Birth of Jesus 1
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world .
2 ( This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria . )
3
And everyone went to his own town to register .
4So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea , to Bethlehem the town of David , because he belonged to the house and line of David .
5 He went there to register with Mary , who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child .
6 While they were there , the time came for the baby to be born , 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn , a son .
She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn .
The Shepherds and the Angels 8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby , keeping watch over their flocks at night .
9
An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified .
10 But the angel said to them , “ Do not be afraid .
I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people .
11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you ; he is Christ the Lord .
12 This will be a sign to you :
You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger . ”
13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel , praising God and saying , 14 ″ Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests . ”
15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven , the shepherds said to one another , “ Let ’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has told us about . ”
16So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph , and the baby , who was lying in the manger .
17 When they had seen him , they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child , 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them .
19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart .
20
The shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen , which were just as they had been told .
Jesus Presented in the Temple 21 On the eighth day , when it was time to circumcise him , he was named Jesus , the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived .
22 When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed , Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord 23 ( as it is written in the Law of the Lord , “ Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord ” ) , 24 and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord : “ a pair of doves or two young pigeons . ”
25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon , who was righteous and devout .
He was waiting for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord ’s Christ .
27 Moved by the Spirit , he went into the temple courts .
When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required , 28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God , saying : 29 ″ Sovereign Lord , as you have promised , you now dismiss [ d ] your servant in peace .
30 For my eyes have seen your salvation , 31 which you have prepared in the sight of all people , 32a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel . ”
33 The child ’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him .
34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary , his mother : “ This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel , and to be a sign that will be spoken against , 35 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed .
And a sword will pierce your own soul too . ”
36 There was also a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher .
She was very old ; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage , 37 and then was a widow until she was eighty - four . [ e]
She never left the temple but worshiped night and day , fasting and praying .
38 Coming up to them at that very moment , she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem .
39 When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth .
40
And the child grew and became strong ; he was filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him .
Luke 3 23 Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry .
He was the son , so it was thought , of Joseph , 24 the son of Heli , the son of Matthat , …
I have posted this previously , but will repost annually near December 25 .
Super Gospel
These two stories contain many internal contradictions ( they conflict with each other ) and external contradictions ( they conflict with know facts of history ) .
I will demonstrate these contradictions to my Christian friends in the hope that they will become enlightened this holiday season .
As Dr. Bart Ehrman notes in his books , most Christians do not believe in a gospel , but rather they believe in a “ super gospel . ”
The Christmas story is an example of a story from a “ super gospel . ”
There is no gospel in the New Testament where both wise men and shepherds visit Jesus .
The wise men visit in Matthew and the shepherds visit in Luke .
By combining these two separate stories , Christians create a “ super story . ”
The authors of Matthew and Luke probably never imagined that their two books would be placed next to each other ( and Mark and John ) in a single collection of books .
Each author took existing legends of Jesus and adapted the legends for their particular agendas .
Geneaologies
As previously noted ( rarebible.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/who-is-josephs-daddy-contradictory-genealogies-in-matthew-and-luke ) , the genealogies of Jesus are completely different .
In Matthew , Jacob is the father of Joseph , but in Luke , Heli is the father of Joseph .
The lists from David to Joseph are completely different .
Jesus is not Immanuel
Matthew 1:22 says the parents will name the baby Immanuel in fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14 .
That verse , however is not a messianic prophecy but mentions a baby as a sign for Ahaz .
Furthermore the Hebrew Masoretic text and most translations of the bible indicate that the virgin will call the baby Immanuel .
Mary does not do that , and nowhere in the New Testament is Jesus ever called Immanuel .
Please see the following post for more information on that topic : https://rarebible.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/mary-loses-her-virginity-isaiah-7-in-the-new-english-bible/.
Herod ( reign ended 4 BC ) and Quirinius ( reign started 6 AD ) never reigned at the same time
Matthew claims Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod .
Luke claims Jesus was born while Quirinius was governor of Assyria .
However , Herod died 10 years before Quirinius became governor .
Either Matthew or Luke is wrong on this issue , or they are both wrong .
Only one the is certain : the Bible contains an error regarding the year Jesus was born .
Massacre of the Innocents not recorded in history
Matthew claims
Herod killed all boys near Bethlehem who were 2 or under .
No other gospel makes this claim .
There is no evidence outside the Bible of any atrocity like this .
Historians recorded many things about Herod .
We know he was born around 74 BC , that he died in 4 BC , and that he expanded the 2nd Temple in Jerusalem ( destroyed in 70 AD but 4 walls , including the famous wailing wall , exit today ) .
It is recorded that he improved water sources , built water supplies , built Massada and Herodium , leased copper mines , killed his wife and two sons , and did much else .
The massacre of the innocents is missing from any historical record .
There are many amazing stories in the bible that are not recorded in historical records .
The senseless census is not recorded in history
There is a historical census recorded during the time of Quirinius .
However , that census and no other Roman census ever required anyone to return to their ancestral homes .
If you think about it , why would anyone care where your ancestors lived 1000 years ago ?
Luke has no Trip to Egypt , Matthew has no trip to Jerusalem
In Matthew , Jesus is born in his home town of Bethlehem , they flee immediately to Egypt , and upon their return from Egypt they travel directly to Nazareth to avoid the son of Herod .
In Luke , Mary and Joseph start in their home town Nazareth , travel to Bethlehem for a census , go to Jerusalem , and then return to their home town of Nazareth .
Many apologists try to create a super story in which they combine the travel of the two stories above into one journey .
This is impossible .
Luke specifically mentions circumcision on the eighth day and the required purification time .
This refers to Leviticus 12 , which states when a boy is born the mother is unclean for 7 days , the foreskin is removed on the 8th day , and she must not touch holy objects for 33 days ( if Jesus were a girl , Mary would be unclean for 14 days and could not touch holy objects for 66 days ) .
Luke 39 notes that when this 33 day period was complete they returned to Galilee .
A trip to Egypt is not mentioned at all !
Stories Created to Fulfill Prophecy
As previously noted , Matthew and Luke probably never thought their stories would be next to each other in one book .
They created the stories about the birth of Jesus to fulfill two Old Testament prophecies : 1 ) that Jesus was born of a virgin ; 2 ) that Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem .
An angel visits Joseph in Matthew 1:18 - 21 , and an angel visits Mary in Luke 1:26 - 38 .
As previously noted , the “ prophecy ” that Jesus would be born of a virgin is not really in the Old Testament .
Anyone who takes an honest look at Isaiah 7 and 8 would not come to the conclusion that this is a prophecy that the messiah would be born 1000 years later to a virgin and named Jesus .
There were numerous stories of miraculous births and children of women fathered by gods at the time the New Testament stories were created .
Hercules is an example of someone believed to have been born of an earthly woman and a god .
Alexander the Great and Augustus Caesar are examples of known historical figures who had stories of miraculous births and supernatural fathers .
There are hundreds of additional examples .
It was a common idea 2000 years ago that an important person would have a miraculous birth and / or a supernatural father .
It is likely that there was a Rabbi named Jesus from the town of Nazareth .
The name Jesus is simply the Greek form of Joshua .
Jesus was a very common name in the middle east 2000 years ago , just as Jesus is a very common name in Mexico today .
Since this Jesus was known to be from Nazareth , Matthew and Luke had to invent ways to have him born in Bethlehem .
As noted above , Matthew made Bethlehem the home town , and Nazareth became a safe place to return to avoid the son of Herod .
Luke made Nazareth the home town , and Bethlehem a place to go for a census .
What Matthew and Luke never realized is that when their books were placed in the same bible , their books would be providing evidence that the stories were fabricated .
Bible publishers are aware of the contradictions , so they add subtitles .
For example , Matthew 2 includes a subtitle that says “ The Return To Nazareth ” .
The original scriptures do not contain this text at all .
When reading all these stories , we should remember what Luke admits in Luke 1:1 - 4 .
“ Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us , 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word . ”
These are not stories of eye witnesses , but are stories that have been “ handed down ” .
These stories evidently included some embellishments that reflected mythological elements of the time .
Prophecy Not In The Bible
Matt 2:23 ends with , ‘ So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets : “ He will be called a Nazarene . ” ’
The problem with this claim is that there is no mention of Nazareth or Nazarenes in the Old Testament at all , and there is no prophecy that Jesus will be called a Nazarene .
First of all , note that a Nazarite in the Old Testament is someone who voluntarily took the Vow Of The Nazarite described in Numbers 6:1 - 21 .
A Nazarite is not someone from Nazarene .
Christian apologists do incredible mental gymnastics when trying to explain who the “ prophets ” were that Jesus would come from Nazareth .
Some say the prophets were some that were known orally but not written down in the Old Testament .
My favorite one that shows the depths to which Christians will delude themselves , is that this was a play on words , such as this one at http://www.crivoice.org/branch.html.
“ In Hebrew , the word “ branch ” is netzer , actually only three consonantal letters : NZR .
Note that the town NaZaReth contains the same three primary letters …
He was identifying the obscure Galilean town of Nazareth in which Jesus grew up with the Old Testament reference to a netzer ( Branch ) God would raise up to bring justice and righteousness and peace to His people . ”
So Nazarene is a town and netzer is a branch , both words contain NZR , so therefore Matthew is really saying Jesus is a branch god would raise up .
WOULD YOU CHRISTIANS LET A MUSLIM GET AWAY WITH SUCH RIDICULOUS APOLOGIES FOR THE KORAN ?
These same people who make such apologies for the contradictions in the bible would never let Muslims get away with doing the same thing .
I encourage all Christians to read the bible again ( or for the first time for most Christians ) , but this time question whether it is truly the perfect word of a perfect god .

All you need is $ 44.95 and probably a time machine back to 1977 , because I can't imagine this is legal now .
This ad brings up so many questions : who is this targeted at ?
Even in a theater prop sort of context , I do n't see how the weight and feel would matter .
Is it for potential criminals , who want the intimidation of a gun but are hedging their bets if they get caught , it wo n't be with a deadly weapon ?
It does say " will fool experts , " I bet especially if the " expert " is looking down the barrel of it .
The best line is , of course , " Decorate your den , office , rec-room . "
I can just imagine it .

A few handguns tossed around in just the right spots really makes a rec-room , too .
After more than 25 years in business , Kateâ€™s Mystery Books in Cambridge will close on Aug .
1 .
Kate Mattes , owner of the bookstore , put her 3,400 - square - foot Victorian on the market in 2007 and says that she has finally sold it to a real estate trust that plans on a mixed use for the building .
Besides the store , the building houses Kateâ€™s apartment as well as a rental unit .
â€ œThis is , of course , very sad about the store , â€™â€ ™ she said in a telephone interview .
â€ œBut it was just the right time to do it .
The near future for the real estate market looks bad .
And itâ€™s kind of bleak when you look at the book business .
â€™â€ ™
Since opening the bookstore in August 1983 , Kateâ€™s Mystery Books has become a local gathering spot for aficionados of such writers as Robert B. Parker and Stephen King , who have become customers and friends .
The store , which specializes in mysteries by American writers but recently has built up foreign offerings , has hosted numerous readings and book signings .
Mattes said that the thing that prompted the move was the death of her brother , a book agent , about five years ago .
â€ œHe was a really big part of the store .
I could just pick up the phone and call himâ€™â€™ for advice .
After he died , he left a big trove of books , and Mattes was the only one in her family who had any idea what to do with them .
â€ œI started thinking about things , and decided that I couldnâ€™t do this to my sister and her kids , â€™â€™ she said .
So she started thinking about getting things in order .
One of the first things she decided to do was to try to sell the building .
That way she could potentially reopen the store in a new location and get a place to live separate from the store , hopefully making it easier to dispose of her property when the time came .
Mattes , 62 , said she will stay in the house till the end of August but hopes to find other housing in Cambridge .
She also has not closed the door on re-entering the book business and will put some things in storage while she decides what to do next .
" Just moving is enough for now .
Before I got into the book business I was a social worker and it took a couple of years to decide I wanted to open a book store . ''
In the meantime she says that she intends to try to hold the community of mystery lovers together even after her store closes .
â€ œI hope you can get in in the next few weeks to say good - bye although I wo n't actually disappear , â€™â€ ™ she said in an e-mail to customers .
â€ œWe will be having author events at different venues and of course we will have the annual holiday party so there will be opportunities for the mystery community to get together .
You will get notices of them from me .
â€™â€ ™
As she prepares to wind down the business Mattes plans to mark down everything in the store 25 percent , and on Aug. 1 there will be a packing party from 11 a.m. - 5 p.m. and annual yard sale , with books going for $ 1 or less .

It has n't even been a month since Firefox 3.5 was released to the masses , but Mozilla is already hard at work on Firefox 3.7 .
We gave you a sneak peek at what features are coming in 2010 , but now we know what Firefox 3.7 may look like when it 's released .
Mozilla is known for constantly gathering feedback from its users to improve Firefox - this is why it offers multiple Firefox release candidates for download before launching the final version .
So the company has turned to the web community for feedback on the preliminary design for Firefox 3.7
These screenshots , posted on the Mozilla Firefox wiki yesterday , highlight not only a cosmetic change for the browser , but at least three additional features .
In fact , Mozilla took the time to explain these three changes from the 3.5 browser , corresponding to the first screenshot below .
Here 's their new feature list on the wiki :
1. Embracing Glass : Toolbar and Tabs using Glass .
Buttons translucent and slightly glossy to meld with the toolbar .
Raised 3D lookachieve tactile " feel " .
2 . Page Button : Connect the Page button to the left side of the tab area .
Directly connected to the Page .
3 . Tools / Bookmark Bar : Connecting the Tools button to the side of the window to emphasize the fact that it is used for customizing and changing the UI .
Adding a button next to that to toggle the Bookmarks bar which is turned off by default .
As you can see , several buttons are getting a makeover and the " Tools " section of Firefox is getting a big emphasis in 3.7 so that users are more inclined to change the look , feel , and functionality of their browser via themes and extensions .
We 've also included screenshots of Firefox 3.7 without Aero ( Vista ) and the new Firefox on Windows XP so that you can give us your opinion .
What do you think of the new changes ?
Do you like the new design ?
Let us know in the comments .
TOUR DE FRANCE
Date : 4 July - 26 July
Coverage : BBC Sport website : text commentary of each stage and streamed BBC commentary of the last 90 minutes of each stage available ; commentary on selected stages on BBC 5 Live sports extra Astana enjoyed the stage win - but Cancellara stays in yellow Lance Armstrong 's Astana team narrowly failed to put the seven - time Tour de France winner back in the yellow jersey after a thrilling team time trial .
Astana won the 39 km lap of Montpellier but ended two tenths of a second shy of wiping out Fabian Cancellara 's lead and putting Armstrong top of the podium .
The Texan 's outfit needed to beat Cancellara 's Saxo Bank team by more than 40 seconds to put him in yellow .
Astana beat Garmin - Slipstream into second with Saxo Bank in third .
After four stages , Armstrong , 37 , who retired after winning the last of his record seventh title in 2005 , now has the same overall time as race leader Cancellara but is placed behind him after the results of Saturday 's opener in Monaco were taken into account .
His Astana team - mate and 2007 champion Alberto Contador is third , 19 seconds back , and British duo Bradley Wiggins and David Millar are both in the top 10 .
" We thought we had it , " said Armstrong , whose team clocked 46 minutes and 29 seconds .
It was a strong performance from my team in the last kilometre .
We can be proud that we defended this jersey and tomorrow again we will be in yellow
Tour leader Fabian Cancellara " Based on the time splits on the course we thought we were close or thereabouts but , hey , that 's cycling .
" We looked at our performance and we can say we did our best .
We won the stage and gained time on our main rivals . "
Armstrong moved up seven places from 10th to third after Monday 's equally dramatic third stage , and showed that he intends to stay in contention for an eighth
Tour crown , despite having several rivals in his own team which boasts pre-race favourite Contador as well as the impressive Levi Leipheimer .
The American would have become the oldest man to wear the yellow jersey if he had pipped Cancellara , but afterwards he suggested that he may not be able to keep up his challenge .
" I wanted to be one of the strongest in the race , " he said .
" I think that I am but I may not be the strongest to win .
I think someone on this team will win .
" It 's the Tour , I know the Tour and how to race it .
Sometimes it pays to be old and experienced and not young and strong .
We 'll take it day by day .
606 : DEBATE
" I do n't think the jersey changes hands until Andorra . "
Several teams suffered crashes because of the difficulty of the course , but seven Astana riders stayed together until near the end before five raced clear to beat the Garmin team of Millar and Wiggins by 18 seconds .
Astana 's early pace had suggested they would be fast enough to put Armstrong in yellow but an earlier strong finish by his Swiss rival 's Saxo Bank outfit proved crucial .
There was a dramatic wait when Astana finished before Tour officials confirmed Cancellara had kept the overall lead and afterward he laughed : " That is Swiss timing !
" I think we can be happy with today - it was a strong performance from my team in the last kilometre and we can be proud that we defended this jersey and tomorrow again we will be in yellow . "
Italian outfit Liquigas came fourth , 58secs after Astana and one second ahead of Mark Cavendish 's Columbia team .
But defending champion Carlos Sastre suffered his second big setback of the race , after losing time to key rivals in the opening stage time trial , when his Cervelo team finished eighth at 1:37 behind Astana .
The Spaniard is now two minutes and 44 seconds off the lead .
Australia 's Cadel Evans , the runner up in 2007 and 2008 , also slipped further back and is now two minutes and 59 seconds behind Cancellara and Armstrong .
Denis Menchov , who like Sastre had a disastrous opening day , suffered again after crashing early in the course and is another 53 seconds further back .

Bloomberg is reporting U.S. Home Vacancies Hit 18.7 Million on Bank Seizures .
More than 18.7 million homes stood empty in the U.S. during the second quarter as the steepest recession in 50 years sapped demand for real estate and banks seized properties from delinquent borrowers .
The number of vacant properties , including foreclosures , residences for sale and vacation homes , was little changed from 18.6 million a year earlier , the U.S. Census Bureau said in a report today .
The quarterly homeownership rate was 67.3 percent , seasonally adjusted .
More than 14 percent of homes were vacant in the period , the Census said .
Home values dropped 33 percent since 2006 , according to the S&P / Case - Shiller index , and the unemployment rate in June rose to the highest in almost 26 years .
Tumbling home prices and rising job losses have thwarted government efforts to reverse the housing decline at the heart of the longest U.S. recession since the 1930s .
There were 130.8 million homes in the U.S. in the second quarter , the Census Bureau said .
In addition to the 1.9 million empty properties for sale , the report counted 4.4 million vacant homes for rent and 4.6 million seasonal properties that are only used for part of the year .
Graphs From Calculated Risk
The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.5 % in Q2 2009 .
click on chart for sharper image
This is the lowest vacancy rate since mid-2006 , but still very high .
A normal rate for recent years appears to be about 1.7 % .
This leaves the homeowner vacancy rate about 0.8 % above normal , and with approximately 75 million homeowner occupied homes ; this gives about 600 thousand excess vacant homes .
The rental vacancy rate increased to a record 10.6 % in Q2 2009 .
click on chart for sharper image
It 's hard to define a " normal " rental vacancy rate based on the historical series , but we can probably expect the rate to trend back towards 8 % .
According to the Census Bureau there are close to 40 million rental units in the U.S.
If the rental vacancy rate declined from 10.6 % to 8 % , there would be 2.6 % X 40 million units or about 1.04 million units absorbed .
These excess units will keep pressure on rents and house prices for some time .
Dip In Vacancy Rate Reflects Rise In Rental Rate
The government looking at expanding a pioneering scheme in Flint , one of the poorest US cities , which involves razing entire districts and returning the land to nature .
Local politicians believe the city must contract by as much as 40 per cent , concentrating the dwindling population and local services into a more viable area .
The radical experiment is the brainchild of Dan Kildee , treasurer of Genesee County , which includes Flint .
Having outlined his strategy to Barack Obama during the election campaign , Mr Kildee has now been approached by the US government and a group of charities who want him to apply what he has learnt to the rest of the country .
Mr Kildee said he will concentrate on 50 cities , identified in a recent study by the Brookings Institution , an influential Washington think - tank , as potentially needing to shrink substantially to cope with their declining fortunes .
Banks Walk Away On Foreclosures
City officials and housing advocates in cities as varied as Buffalo , Kansas City , Mo. , and Jacksonville , Fla. , say they are seeing an unsettling development :
Banks are quietly declining to take possession of properties at the end of the foreclosure process , most often because the cost of the ordeal — from legal fees to maintenance — exceeds the diminishing value of the real estate .

Home Vacancies Hit 18.7 Million on Bank Seizures
By Brian Wheeler
Political reporter , BBC News
Ben Bradshaw became culture secretary in last month 's reshuffle Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw has said " a deep strain of homophobia still exists on the Conservative benches " .
Mr Bradshaw , one of three gay men currently in the cabinet , made the comments as a new poll suggested more gay people were turning to the Tories .
Chris Bryant , another gay minister , said : " If gays vote Tory they will rue the day very soon . "
But Tory frontbencher Alan Duncan said the two men's comments showed Labour was " actually the nasty party " .
Being seen to be more " gay friendly " has been a key part of David Cameron 's mission to decontaminate the Conservative Party brand and make it more acceptable to young , socially liberal voters .
There are currently two openly gay men on the Conservative front bench - Shadow Environment Secretary Nick Herbert and Shadow Commons Leader Mr Duncan .
In a symbolic gesture aimed at further healing relations with the gay community and burying the Tories ' " nasty party " image , Mr Cameron this week apologised for Section 28 - the controversial law brought in by the Conservatives in 1988 banning local authorities from portraying homosexuality in a positive light .
' Best behaviour ' Mr Cameron , the first Tory leader to speak at a gay pride event , said : " I am sorry for Section 28 .
We got it wrong .
It was an emotional issue .
I hope you can forgive us . "
Labour has also been pushing its gay credentials .
Bradshaw and Bryant are simply trying to stir up hatred and division from the last century and it's both unwarranted and unworthy
Alan Duncan , shadow commons leader
This Saturday in London , Sarah Brown will become the first prime minister 's wife to take part in a gay pride march .
She will be accompanied at the event by veteran gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell .
Mr Brown himself will not be marching , for " security reasons " , but he will be hosting a reception for the organisers .
But new research by Jake , a networking organisation for gay professionals , suggests a worrying trend for Labour , with 38 % of Jake members who took part saying they would vote Conservative at the next election , 1 % higher than the general population , according to an average of recent opinion polls .
Labour came third on 20 % behind the Liberal Democrats - even though 86.6 % of those surveyed said Labour was the party that had achieved most for gay people and just 4 % said the Tories were " gay friendly " , compared with 44 % for Labour and the Lib Dems .
' Deep strain '
Jake surveyed 506 of its members anonymously on their voting intentions between 18 and 21 June and carried out a separate survey of 600 of its largely male membership on their general attitude towards the big three parties .
Foreign Office minister Chris Bryant said he was concerned that a lot of gay and lesbian voters would " bank " the reforms brought in by Labour , such as civil partnerships and a lower age of consent , and vote Conservative .
He said he did not think Mr Cameron and his frontbench team were homophobic but he claimed the Tory leader could be pushed into rolling back reforms by his own backbenchers if he won the next election .
" I think if gays vote Tory they will rue the day very soon , " he added .
Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw said he shared Mr Bryant 's concerns .
" I hope that people in the lesbian , gay and transgender community will closely examine the Conservatives ' record on this and David Cameron 's record in particular , which is not good , " he said .
He said Mr Cameron " talks the talk but he does n't walk the walk , " and speaking about Tory MPs in general , he said : " A deep strain of homophobia still exists on the Conservative benches " .
' Historic '
But the Tories reacted angrily to the accusations of homophobia .
Alan Duncan told the Evening Standard website : " This is the last gasp of Labour 's desperation .
Bradshaw and Bryant are simply trying to stir up hatred and division from the last century and it's both unwarranted and unworthy .
There is no doubt a huge number of steps forward have been taken in the last 10 years but voters look to the future rather than the past
Ben Summerskill , Stonewall chief executive " It 's simply untrue .
I believed we had reached the happy point where politics had been taken out of this altogether .
But these remarks show that Labour is actually the nasty party . "
Baroness Warsi , shadow minister for community cohesion , said : " On the day that the prime minister said that he did not approve of personal attacks in politics it would appear that members of the Labour Party failed to heed his message .
It is a shame that Labour politicians cannot engage on the policy issues around equality and instead revert to name calling .
" David Cameron and the Conservative Party have made clear they do not believe that anybody should be disadvantaged on the grounds of gender , race , religion or sexual orientation . "
Ben Summerskill , chief executive of gay rights campaign Stonewall , said the Jake research " seems to indicate there is a significant swing to the Conservative Party " , adding : " It must be very reassuring for the Conservative Party " .
He praised Labour 's record on gay rights , but suggested they might not be rewarded for it at the ballot box .
" There is no doubt a huge number of steps forward have been taken in the last 10 years but voters look to the future rather than the past . "
He said he believed there were still " homophobes " on the Tory benches but they were becoming fewer in number and he hailed Mr Cameron 's apology for Section 28 as a watershed moment that would remove an obstacle to many gay people voting Tory .
" It was historic , for a politician , to be so explicit , " he said .
But he said he thought it was " legitimate " for Labour politicians such as Mr Bradshaw and Mr Bryant to point to the Conservative voting record on certain issues .
There are thought to be three million gay people in the UK .

Seek 'n Spell : iPhone games tend to be a lot like games for any other portable device , and rarely leverage some of the traditionally non-gaming capabilities of the handset .
Part of this is because , until recently , the developer SDK was sort of limited .
Most of it , I think , is because developers just have n't been thinking hard enough .
Take this clever , if obvious , idea for a game : A map of wherever you are is overlaid with letters , which you and you teammates can collect by physically running to their icons .
Your goal is to come up with words for points , Scrabble - style .
It 's a very , very cool idea , and decidedly sweatier than your typical iPhone game .

MSNBC : Hey , look , another news organization has a content app !
Let 's talk about it !
This one 's less about news than about catering to fans of the network , with an emphasis on video content as well as Twitter feeds from MSNBC personalities .
It 's a bit hard on the eyes , and occasionally goes stuttery on you , but it works fine .
Fun fact : according to the iTunes description , this iPhone app , being an MSNBC product , uses " Microsoft's Advanced Technologies . "
What this means , I have no idea .

Fluent News :
If you could sense a lack of excitement about that MSNBC app , that was because of apps like Fluent .
It 's far from the first multi-source news aggregator , but it 's one of the better ones .
It behave like Google News , more or less , collecting important news from lots of sources and grouping it in a sensible way Why not just use Google News then , you might rudely interject ?
Well , for one , Fluent can cache news for offline reading , for plans , subways , caves , or wherever .
It also prefetches longer articles , though I could n't really tell in my brief testing .

This one gets an interface lift , but most importantly , two useful features for people who use Skype 's pay services : text messaging with SkypeOut credit ( good for cheap international texts ; bad for having no reply function ) , and Skype Voicemail support .
Voicemail support is a bigger deal than it sounds : since receiving calls when you 're out is still pretty much out of the question , the voicemail access makes being out of touch a little less irritating .

We 've always been impressed with Air Sharing — it 's a solid file storage / viewing solution in its basic form .
The Pro version , though , is a different animal entirely .
First of all , it 's expensive : $ 10 , to be exact .
It 's also got expanded support for file storage services like , MobileMe , MyDisk , and Drop.io .
The main draw is that there are tons of new file functions : emailing , which is a huge help ; direct printing , via OS X printer sharing ; archiving abilities , including viewing archive contents without extracting .
It 's a bit like a walled - in version of Finder , and the closest to a proper file browser you 're going to get on a non-jailbroken iPhone .

CANTOR ’S IDEA FOR A THIRD STIMULUS ….
Last week , House Republicans , who ’ve been wrong about every significant economic development of the last few decades , felt comfortable arguing that the economic stimulus package passed in February “ is not working . ”
Paul Krugman called this kind of analysis “ insane , ” in large part because “ hardly any of the money has flowed to the economy yet . ”
Today , House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) went a step further .
We ’ve gone from “ is not working ” to “ did not ” work in just a few days .
Pushing back against a possible second stimulus bill , Cantor asserted that the Obama administration - backed first $ 787 billion stimulus has not worked , and insisted that characterization has now become consensus .
“ I think we all need to recognize that the first attempt of the stimulus bill did not stimulate the economy , ” Cantor said in a conference call sponsored by the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) .
“ I think we all agree on that now . ”
Who ’s “ we all ” ?
Apparently , Cantor and his right - wing cohorts who got together for a chat .
“ We hear today now that there is talk in the administration and elsewhere that perhaps we should go on with a ‘ Stimulus II , ' ” the second - ranking House Republican added .
“ Any mention of a Stimulus II implies that there was a Stimulus I that did anything to provide jobs and get the economy going again . ”
Actually , it would be Stimulus III .
The Minority Whip may not remember this , but the first was last fall , when Bush , with Cantor ’s blessing , signed a bunch of new tax breaks intended to stimulate the economy .
It had no effect , and the economy continued to spiral .
The second was just signed into law four months ago , with much of the spending in the bill still heading out the door .
But do n’t worry , Cantor is open minded about the future .
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) said that Republicans would work with President Obama on a second stimulus bill , as long as it ’s like the tax cut - heavy package the GOP proposed earlier .
Ah yes , the all - tax - cut stimulus Cantor pushed in January .
That , of course , was the “ completely crazy ” proposal that did n’t even try to stimulate the economy .
Indeed , it ’s been a little while since we had the debate , so it ’s probably a good time to remind folks that “ tax cuts are an ineffective economic stimulus . ”
It ’s just so tiresome listening to GOP leaders pretend to be grown - ups .
They ’ve sworn up and down for months that deficits are the scourge of modern government , but Cantor does n’t mind adding hundreds of billions of dollars in debt now , just so long as it ’s delivered through more ineffective tax cuts .
Cantor has also spent the past few months bragging about how good the stimulus bill is for the economy in his district — a message he seemed to forget about this morning .
昨日、TOMOYO Linuxメインライン化記念合同勉強会（カーネル読書会、セキュアOSユーザ会、まっちゃ445）に行ってきて、小崎さんが匿名掲示板でガチでレビューしていたお話を聞いたので、早速過去ログを読んでみた。http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/2ch/thread-2.txt
（追記：2009/7/4 21:03 なぜか後半部分、アスキーアートの後が切れてしまったので、前半部分を若干カットして（略）の部分、その２を追加しました。）
LKML ( Linux Kernel Mailing List ) というの はLinuxカーネルの技術的なことを議論するもっとも権威（？）あるメーリングリストで、ここで議論され合意されたものがLinuxの本体に取り込まれることになる。このLinuxの本家本元の本体（くどいな）のことをメインラインと呼ぶ。Linuxを創ったLinusさんにちなんでLinus ' treeとか、アップストリームカーネルとか呼ぶ場合もある。
このメインラインに新機能を入れるのは簡単ではない。強者の開発者が納得する技術的メリットをわかりやすく説明する必要がある。その方法論というのをわれわれは学校でも教わっていないし、訓練する機会もあまりないのでLKMLでの議論を題材に説得術という観点で学んでみたい。
2チャンネルのログを再構成しながら、適宜解説などを加える。
本家LKMLの過去ログは下記にあるので、適宜参考にしてほしい。下記[1/10]とかいう表記は10個のパッチのうちの１個目のパッチについてのコメントを示す。

方がよい。というかこういう コアピースは他のパッチのついでみたいな投稿の
しかたじゃ入らないと思う。 Linusも以前、ダメだと言っていたよ。とか言わ れてるぐらいだし。 685 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/09 (金) 22:42:49 ID : hv8sw / Ot [ 3/10 ] d_realpath ( ) はpatch description がよくない 。patch descriptionは何故これ が必要なのかと、 その問題のポイントがどこだと考えているのかという話と、 どうやって解決しているのか、 の ３ 点 が必要だが、実装の説明しかない。 また、pathname based access control difficult の一行だけで dcache.c いじ るのはかなり無理筋。 難しいだけで、可能なんだった らTOMOYO 側でやれよ。共通ルーチン部分いじんな。と 前に誰かが、なんで d_path ( ) ＋ ユーザランドで加工で出来ないの？とか聞いて、 そうするとセキュリティレベルが落ちるとか なんかとか答えていたおぼろげな記憶があるけど、 それがpatch description に反映していない。 つまり、新しい人 がReviewするたびに 、Nackが増える構造 realpath ( ) は悪い名前。d_path ( ) がfake であることを連想させるけど、 そうではなく、たん にTOMOYO に 都合のいい形式のもの をrealと呼ぶのは無理がある。 他のアプリでも使えることを説明しないと、real じゃないでしょ。 もちろん、理論上可能ってことじゃなくて、実際に d_realpath ( ) つかって 他のサブシステムがこんなに行数減ったってパッチを書く必要がある chrootとbind mount時のふるまいはもっと細かく書かないとダメ。 それがあるからrootより上をたどりたくないんだから。 ディレクトリ時に/を付加するのは、TOMOYO側で出来るはずだし、linuxのパスの
ルールではな くTOMOYO ルールなので、 共通ルーチンにいれるべきではない。 / proc / PID を/ proc/self に変換してるのも同じく筋悪 686 ：login : Penguin：2009/01/09 (金) 22:49:07 ID :hv8sw / Ot [ 4/10 ] crazy なファイル名に対してエンコードを施さないとどうしてsafeでなくなるのか 説明されていない。 カーネル内にパーサーを入れること はLinusがいやがっていることもあって、 みんな気にするので もっと詳しく説明した方がよい。 僕の感想では、たんに、ログが見にくくなるだけだったら、こんな処理入れるな。 というのが共通認識だと思う ログは人間がみるものなんだから、見る直前に加工すればいいじゃん。という疑問がわく。 687 ：login : Penguin：2009/01/09 (金) 22:55:16 ID :hv8sw / Ot [ 5/10 ] 全般的に、パーサーを入れるな方針に反しているので厳しそう。
Ingo がftrace関係でファイル名を正規表現で指定できるようにしたい。
って以前いっていたらから そっちに協力して、汎用的な正規表現パス指定関数群を linux / lib 以下に作って そっちを使うように作りかえたらどうかな？ あと、 + case '$ ' : /* " \$ " */ + case '+' : /* " \+ " */ + case '?' : /* " \? " */ + case '*': /* " \* " */ + case '@ ' : /* " \@ " */ + case ' x ' : /* " \x " */ + case ' X ' : /* " \X " */ + case ' a ' : /* " \a " */ + case ' A ' : /* " \A " */ + case '-': /* " \-" */ このコメントはひどいやろ。なんの説明にもなってない。 688 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/09 (金) 22:57:09 ID : hv8sw / Ot [ 6/10 ]
TOMOYO のファイルだけの変更だし、パーサーもないから、誰も文句を言わなさそう。
でもpatch description が１行なのはちょっとひどい 689 ：login : Penguin：2009/01/09 (金) 22:59:52 ID :hv8sw / Ot [ 7/10 ]
これも6/10と同じで、完全にTOMOYOに閉じた話なので文句はつかないと思う。 ただ、これも同じくpatch descriptionが弱い。 TOMOYO のドメイン遷移ルールなんか誰も知らないのだから例を交えつつ丁寧に
説明しないと、誰にもレビューできないのではないか。
レビューされてなくても、マージされそうな気もするので、無視してもらってもよいが。 690 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/09 (金) 23:07:02 ID : hv8sw / Ot [ 8/10 ] RFCならともかく、マージをめざすパッチで議論とか質問が書いてあっても、 相手が困ると思う。 あと、security_task_free ( )
はCredなくても事実上無意味だったはず。 task struct ってRCUつかって、 スレッド死んだときとは違うタイミングで構造体破棄してるから、 もともと使い道なんて無かった。 （まちがってる？ ） tomoyo_domain_info にu32 を追加する方式では何が困るかが全然書いてないので
返事のしようがないというのが感想。 ・ TOMOYO のTはtask のTなんだ −＞ だから何？ ・ TOMOYO にとってnightmareなんだ
−＞結局理由かいてないよね。それってただの感想だよね って見えると思う 691 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/09 (金) 23:07:34 ID :hv8sw / Ot [ 9/10 ] [ 10/10 ]
は No problemと思います る
ふー。ひとつひとつのパッチについて詳細にレビューコメントを書いている。すごいな。LinuxKernelコミュニティのお作法で言えばレビューコメントはLKMLでやるのが筋なのだけど、わざわざ２chでやったのは、LKMLでやるとレビュアーが否定的なことをがんがん言っているように受け取られるのが嫌だからだそうだ。建設的な議論をしたかったそうだ。英語だと自分の気持ち（応援しているんだよ）が伝わらないので日本語でしたと。なるほど。

もらったのはこれが初めてです。（kosakiさんが書かれているように、全体を通してみるには
規模が大きくなってしまったということでもあります） 提案では「完全なパッチを目指す」というよりは、「通す（マージしてもらう）」を
優先して考えていますが、有識者の方のご意見は進行中のやりとりや今後のパッチの参考に
なると思います。他の方でもご意見、ご提案があれば是非お聞かせください。

片方向リストというの にTOMOYOは妙にこだわっているわけだけど、そーゆーところは捨ててもいいのではないかと。いきなり実装の細部にこだわるのは木を見て森を見ずになりがちということか。

捨てられません。 過去の提案では security / tomoyo / 以下だけの修正で済むようになっており、
TOMOYO を使わないカーネルのためにコードが大きくならないように配慮していました。 しかし、熊猫の記憶が正しければ、 「 このリストは共通部品として使えるから security / tomoyo / 以下に置くよりも include / linux / 以下に置く方が良いのでは？ 」 「 この処理は d_path ( ) と同様だから security / tomoyo / 以下に置くよりも fs/ dcache.c に入れる方が良いのでは？」とアドバイスされ、それに従ったら今度は
「コアコードに手を加えるな」と反発を喰らっているように感じています。
どうせ TOMOYO しか使わないでしょうから、置き場所が問題なのであれば security / tomoyo / 以下に移動させるだけの話です。
>>683 > そんならCRED直せば出来るんやろ。という話にならないのか？という疑問がわく。 credentials パッチは TOMOYO が out - of - tree の状態で検討され、マージされました。 活発な検討が行われているのは見ていましたが、
TOMOYO がマージされる前に credentials がマージされることは想定していなかったので、 credentials 無しの 状態で TOMOYO の開発が続けられました。 credentials がマージされてしまった現在でも TOMOYO は out - of - tree であるため 、 TOMOYO 側から 「 今までできていたことができなくなった。リグレッションだ。 何とかしてくれ。 」 と要求することはできません。 credentials に影響を与えない範囲で workaround を探すのが精いっぱいでしょう 。

TOMOYO の根底をなす識別子として 「ドメイン名」というものがあります。このドメイン名は 起点となる＜kernel＞という文字列に、そのドメインに到達するまでに実行された プログラムの 絶対パス名を連結（区切りとして 0x20 を使用）したものとして定義されます。 しかし、 Linux では、 パス名には 0x20 を含めて全ての文字を使用できてしまいます。 もし、エンコードを施さなかった場合、 プログラムのパス名の一部としての 0x20 なのか、 区切り文字としての 0x20 なのかが区別できなく なってしまいます。 かといって、区切り文字として 0x0 を使用するのは、ライブラリ関数を使えなくなるので 大混乱を招くことが容易に想像できるでしょう。 > カーネル内にパーサーを入れることはLinusがいやがっていることもあって、みんな気にするので > もっと詳しく説明した方がよい。 0x20（要素の区切り） と 0x0A （行の区切り）だけで機械的にパースできる TOMOYO の 表記法は、 0x0 （要素の区切り） と 0x0 0x0 （行の区切り）でパースするよりも 扱いやすく、安全です 。 「 長さ＋文字列」でパースする方法もありますが、（パターン文字などを含む可能性が あるため） 「 文字列」の部分が正しい表記に従っているかのチェックはどのみち必要に

Ingo がftrace関係でファイル名を正規表現で指定できるようにしたい。って以前いっていたらから 正規表現は昔の AppArmor が使っていたようですが、 TOMOYO で採用するつもりはありません。 正規表現の問題点としては 、
（１）表記がプログラム毎にバラバラ（例えばシェルでは
* は特別な意味を持つが .
は 持たないのに対し、 sed では .
は特殊な意味を持つ）であるため、利用者に対して
「 事前に全ての正規表現を理解しておく 」 ことが必要 （２）特別な意味を持つ文字を無効化するために何からの特別な文字（通常は
\ でしょう） を指定するという 実装だと、将来新しい意味を持たせたくなった場合に既存の文字列との 互換性が失われてしまうため、機能を 増やすために拡張することが不可 能
（３）（２）が発生するのを恐れて特別な意味を持たない文字まで
\ を指定させるのは ユーザにとって 読みにくいしパースする側としても無意味な処理 というのがあります。 TOMOYO では特殊な文字は \ で始まるという実装であるため 、
（４）利用者は自分が知らないパターンに遭遇した時に初めて意味を調べればよいため、 利用者に対して 「 事前に全ての正規表現を理解しておく」ことは不要
（５）新しい機能を持たせたくなった場合は \ で始まる表記を定義することができるので、 拡張が容易 というのがあります。 >>690 > security_task_free ( ) はCredなくても事実上無意味だったはず。task struct ってRCUつかって、 > スレッド死んだときとは違うタイミングで構造体破棄してるから、もともと使い道なんて無かった。
メモリを解放するためのフックという意味ですので、スレッドが死んだときに
呼ばれなくても構いません。 フックが存在していることが重要なのです。 > tomoyo_domain_info にu32 を追加する方式では何が困るかが全然書いてないので返事のしようがないというのが感想。 credentials により copy on write となったため、新しく - ENOMEM が発生する 可能性が増えました。 credentials が無かった時代には存在しなかった error path を扱う必要が生じるため、 随所に if 文が必要になります 。

TOMOYOのレビューの受け答えであっても、TOMOYOの事情を説明するのは、実は理由に なってないんだよ。 TOMOYO の仕様変えれば解決なのね。って相手は思うから。

先に実装を作って、それを元に説得を始めるというのは典型的な悪いパターンなんだけど、企業発のオープンソースの場合、そーゆーのが往々にしてある。
そーゆーのにハマらないようにするために、実装をする前に、コミュニティに「〜という機能を追加したいんだけどさ」というRequest for Comments ( RFC ) みたいな文書を流すのが王道である。

こだわりを持ちすぎるのが悪い傾向かと思う。
TOMOYO のキーコンセプトは 「パス名ベースのセキュリティーモジュール」であり、 このコンセプトは みんなNackしていないので、いつマージされてもおかしくない状況。
このキーコンセプトの範囲ではVFSだって変えれたんだし、このコンセプトの範囲では、
かなり強い立場で交渉できる状況。 なのに、マージされないのはキーコンセプト以外に問題のあるコードが多い。
・list1はTOMOYOのキーコンセプトなのか ・d_realpath（）キーコンセプトなのか ・今のパス名のTOMOYO記法はキーコンセプトなのか と聞かれたら全部NOでしょう。 list1捨てても実装できるよ。今の記法を捨てても「パス名ベースのセキュリティ」は
出来るよ。ちょっと便利程度じゃ、 レビューワーから見ると再利用性を捨てるだけの
メリットじゃないから却下なんだよ。 d_realpath ( ) はまったくダメじゃないけど、TOMOYO 以外が使えれるように汎用化しないと、 ちょっと論外っぽい。 過去の発言みかえしてみると、TOMOYO チームが質問もらって、それに対してTOMOYOの事情を 説明したときに 相手が返事してないケースがかなりある。 これ はOK じゃなくて、消極的反対ってのは理解しといたほうがいい。 一度仕様を、もっともっと削って、マージされてから改善する方を僕は押す。 今のコードだと、僕がレビューワーな らNackする。

723 ：login : Penguin：2009/01/12(月) 19:33:24 ID : fsX40d3O なぜ、段階的開発を押すかというと理由が２つあって

効率がよくて・・なんて書いたら、どの指導教官でも絶対却下する。
つまり、いまやっているのは、そういうこと。
新しいコンセプトを世に問うているときに、違う枝葉を混ぜるのは筋悪
２．一度いれて、ディストリに巻かれてからの方が、TOMOYOはこんなに多くのユーザに 使われているので コア部分を変えてでも改善する価値があるんだーー
という論法が使えるようになる。これは大きい。
レビューワーはコストとベネフィットの天秤でチェックしているので、コストが削れない
コスト（絶対必要な機能）なら ベネフィットをあげるしかない
なぜ、段階的開発を取るかという理由を教授している。素晴らしい。

CELF , YLUG のショックを経て挑戦することにしたときも、本当にそれが可能とは
思っていませんでした（思えませんでした）。でもそれが目指すべきことだと
教えてもらったので、挑戦を始めました。「こうすればマージされる」がわからないまま、
投稿を繰り返していました。 それがLSMのフックがマージされ、また昨日からのここのやりとりを見ていて、
あらためて、「ああ、もう本当に手が届くところにきた。やっと来られたんだ」と
思いました。変な言い方ですが、有限の努力と作業でなんとかなるところにこられたのだと
感じました（今まではそうではなかったのです）。
明日、中の人会議で話し合ってみますが、できることならここ、というか国内の
方々にも見てもらって「これでいこう、というか逝け」と言われるパッチにして
挑戦できたらと思います。
随分遠くまで来ました〜という感慨深いコメントである。闇雲に手探り状態でここまで来たから、がんばったから。いや、がんばらなくてもいいから。相手を説得する方法を間違えていたわけで、多分、今の経験値でTOMOYOを再設計すればあっという間にマージされると思う。その経験は貴重だと思う。試行錯誤のなかで獲得したすごいことだと思う。

普通ならきっとそうなんですが、これまでの経験から言うと、
「 面倒」とか「何回も投稿するな」とかは言われないような気がします。
「 何度でも挑戦は受けて立つぜ」的な印象です。 「 効率的に収束する」提案の仕方ができないか考えているところです。
相手を説得する時のアンチパターン（筋の悪い方法）と、筋のいいベストプラクティスをまとめるのは重要なことかと思う。TOMOYOが経験したアンチパターンとベストプラクティスは間違いなくバザール型オープンソースソフトウェア開発の方法論として重要な情報になる。コミュニティとのやりとりという方法論をまとめることは絶対無駄ではない。
自分の都合を押し付けない。コミュニティ全体に取って利益のあることを提案する。実装は変更することを躊躇しない。
そのような原理原則を学ぶ大変貴重な経験だったと思う。それをわれわれ第三者が疑似体験できるというのも情報の公開によってだ。オープンソースってすごいね。

ttp://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Linux_Weather_Forecast/security
TOMOYO Linux TOMOYO
Linux is a mandatory access control framework similar to AppArmor .
Like AppArmor , it has been criticized for its use of pathnames and ( to some ) simplistic approach to security .
Forecast : TOMOYO
Linux has only recently surfaced on the wider mailing lists ; its reception has not been entirely friendly .
This project 's developers have some work to do if they are ( 1 ) to get past the same obstacles which have slowed AppArmor , and ( 2 ) show that their project is sufficiently different from AppArmor to merit inclusion as yet another security framework .
とここまではおそらくこれまでと同じですが、その後に
The merging of the pathname - based security module hooks for 2.6.29 has helped this cause significantly , though ; a 2.6.30 or 2.6.31 merge is not entirely out of the question .
（しかし、2.6.29でpathname-based用のフックが追加されたので状況は大幅に変わった。
2.6.30 , 31でのマージは全くあり得ないことではなくなった）
が追加されています。多分書いているのはJonathanですがびっくりです。 747 ：login: Penguin ◆ XkB4aFXBWg ：2009/01/13 (火) 18:51:15 ID : QtV6ZzdK >>745 >もし可能な場合は、realpath( 3 ) は解消し、 > Alへの確認もいらなくなるようです。 について、 「それは違う」と先生に突っ込まれました。procのselfのところが
いらなくなるだけで、上の内容は間違っているようです。
でもこのあたりは何回聞いてもややこしくてよくわかりません・・・。
ちゃんと説明したものがないのが悪いんです。（笑） 748 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/13(火) 19:04:13 ID :acMdqThM james_morris : Security changes in the 2.6.28 kernel ttp://james-morris.livejournal.com/37583.html @ 2009-01-06 20:55:00
Also noteworthy is the merge of the pathname security hooks for LSM , which should pave the way for TOMOYO and AppArmor in 2.6.30 , subject to the general patch submission review process .
TOMOYO is only a couple of acks from approval , has been baking in - mm , and is pretty much self - contained .
It may even appear in 2.6.29 if the merge window is open for features long enough .
749 ：login : Penguin ◆ XkB4aFXBWg ：2009/01/13 (火) 19:36:07 ID : QtV6ZzdK >>748 thanks :-) Jonathan Corbet氏、ある日のブログか ら ttp://linux-foundation.org/weblogs/lwf/2009/01/11/looking-forward-to-2629/
One small , quiet piece of code which went in was a new set of security module hooks which enable the addition of pathname - based mandatory access control mechanisms .
This was an important prerequisite for security modules like AppArmor and TOMOYO Linux , which may finally be getting close to inclusion into the mainline .
あらためて、lsmフック追加の 「小さなコード」の価値を感じます。 757 ：login: Penguin ◆ XkB4aFXBWg ：2009/01/14(水) 18:12:32 ID :w5+hnGvV

It is a sad thing that I cannot use / proc / self / ( which is the only part where a pathname based access control can prevent current process from accessing other process 's information ) , but I purged d_realpath ( ) for now .

>>761 パーサについて自分の考えを書きます。（今日は先生は体調不良でお休みです）
「カーネル内パーサってどうよ？」というコメントは過去確かにありましたし、
好ましくないのは事実と思います。 ただ、tomoyoにつ い て
「パーサ」と呼ばれている部分は、パスをそのまま文字列
として格納しているというのが実際で、汎用の文字列操作ライブラリではなく、 むしろDBに近いものと思います （それをパーサと呼ぶと言われればそうかもしれませんが）。
linux/lib以下に置くようなものには遠いですし、tomoyoとして必要な機能を考えると
バイナリ形式に変換してもうれしいことはないというのが先生の考えだと思います。 769 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/16(金) 02:13:52 ID :T2 fQPja9 >>765 カーネル的にはパーサー以外の何者でもないんだよね。 これが本当にstrcpy ( ) して格納してるだけなら文句は絶対こないと思う。 771 ：login : Penguin ◆ XkB4aFXBWg ：2009/01/16 (金) 07:26:08 ID : 1W9JShIi >>769 多分、文字列で格納している時点でパーサなんだと思います。( ; ;) でもtomoyoの場合というかtomoyoの使い方はカーネル内であっても
許容される範囲ではないかと思います。逆に言えば、バイナリで保存して
インデックスをつけても、誰にとってもうれしいことはないように思います。 772 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/16(金) 21:21:00 ID : T2 fQPja9 >>771 バイナリで保存するのに意味がないというのはそのとおりだと思う。
これはレビューワーがいやがることを避けるのがNAKされない為に重要。という 半分テクニックの話だとも思う。 でも、メンテナーが過去の経験として文字列処理はつまらんバグやバッファオーバーフローを
産みやすく、過去何度もセキュリティ勧告をくらっていやな思いをした経験から「ちゃんと
した理由がなきゃいやだ」と思っているという背景は理解するべきで、
「だって僕はいるんだもん」的な説得は相手の心に響かない。
ので、事前に作戦考えておいたほうがいい。とは思う。
たとえば、パス名ベースセキュリティのように、カンファレンス等を通じて「コンセプト」を
レビューしてもらって 承認を受けるというの
も１つの手だし、誰かと組んで共通ライブラリに してもいいし、 何か他の手段でベネフィットを上げれればいいんだという認識。
所詮コスト vs ベネフィット議論なので。 それか、もっと行数を縮めて、ほかのにまぎれて入れてしまうという寝技もアリはアリ。 今は説明ない、コードは目立つ、必然性がよく分からないの３点セットなのがいけないと 思うのですよ。 773 ：login : Penguin：2009/01/16(金) 21:27:21 ID : T2 fQPja9 僕の理解では、TOMOYOの独自記法のメリットがコンセンサスを得られているとは
いいがたいと思ってるのよ。 少なくとも独自記法は確実に共有コードが減るというデメリットがある。なので、
それを上回るメリットがあることの説明は必要と思う。 774 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/16(金) 21:29:30 ID : T2 fQPja9 「 パーサーだったら、絶対だめ」的な過激な人は一人もいないという認識なので、
要は、メリット＞デメリット を説得できるか、で、どの観点から攻めるのかを戦略決めようね。と
戦術あっての戦略 戦略あっての戦術なのだけど 、TOMOYO には戦略がない。

どうも、通じてない気がするな。僕ならこう書くというのを出そう。
まず、論文であるので、最初にアブストラクトを書く。
パス名ベースのセキュリティモジュールでは、カーネルに対して対象オブジェクトを
パス名で指定する。 このパス名はファイルそのもののパスでもよいが現実的には、もっと柔軟な指定方法が 必要である。 （あなたのシステムで/etc/以下に何個ファイルがあるかを考えてみたら、１つ１つ指定する
気はすぐに失せるだろう） そう、我々は柔軟でパワフルで、「かつ 」
誤解しにくいパス名の記法が必要である。 ・・・などのように書いて、regularなexpression は必須なのはあきらかだから、 どういうexpressionがいいかを議論するよん。的な出だしにする。 んで、次に選択肢を３つ並べる １ ） shell glob style expression ２ ） POSIX regular expression ( UNIX style regular expression ) ３ ） 独自記法 ＃
１）と２）が普通の人が最初に思いつく選択肢なので必ずのせる。それであとで、
＃１と２を論破して３のTOMOYO独自記法サイコー。
＃ という結論に誘導する事を目的にする AppArmerは（２）を選択しており、一見これはよい選択肢に見える。しかしこれには
重大な見落としがある。 POSIX regular expressionのメタキャラクタの多くはファイルシステムで使用可能な 文字であり、エンドユーザは間違った正規表現を書きやすい。 また、linux で は 「 習慣として」英数字以外のファイルがほとんど存在しないため、
間違った正規表現でも動いてしまうのが問題だ。
これは攻撃者が特殊なファイル名のファイルを作成したときに、初めて間違いが露見する事に
なる ＃ここで具体例を２，３個いれる （つづく） 781 ：login : Penguin：2009/01/17(土) 00:05:30 ID : BLqmOvB5 これは誰が悪いのだろうか ？ TOMOYO のバグか？明らかに違う。TOMOYOは指定された通りに動いている。
では、エンドユーザか ？AppArmer関係者 はYesと答えるだろう。 しかし、 「 我々は 」そう思わない。 ユーザが正しく使えないセキュリティモジュールなど、なんのセキュリティ的な価値が あるだろう。 我々には、誤解しにくい、明瞭なシンタックスをもった、POSX regular expressionと 同等にパワフルな記法が必要だ。 よって、我々は以下の記法を提案する ＃ここ でTOMOYO 記 法の紹介にうつる ＃たぶん、いま のTOMOYO 記法はメタキャラクタが、ちょっと多すぎるので論文の都合上
＃もうちょっとダイエットされていると ＃ストーリーが通りやすい。。。 この記法はシンプルでパワフルで、そして「セキュア」だ。 と書いて論文をしめる。 相手はTOMOYOの識者ではなく、セキュリティの識者なので、アプローチはかならず
「 セキュア」という単語を含める。 プロジェクトで予算を獲得するためにエロい人と話をするときは「TOMOYOが分かればあなたの
疑問は解決します」とはいわずに、粛々とお金の話をすると思う。それと同じ。
相手によって、会話のキーポイントを変える。 782 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/17(土) 00:11:06 ID : BLqmOvB5 以上、僕がパッチディスクリプションを書くなら。という仮定で、書いてみたけど、
TOMOYOルールだから、という単語は使わずに、セキュリティを考えていったら、
今の記法になっちゃった。というストーリーが作れる。というのは分かって もらえたと思う。 こうやって、理由が書いてあるとレビュアーは
" It 's no sense ! ! " とはいいにくいので、
承認するか、建設的な代替案を出すかの二択に精神的に追い込まれる。
・・・・ふだんレビューワーの僕がいってるんだぜい？
もちろん、本当に、建設的な代替案がでてきちゃったら、ちゃんと対応しないとダメですよ。
もう出荷しちゃったから変えられねーー、とかレビュー拒否かと思わんばかりの発言して 反発くらったAppArverの二の舞にならないように。 784 ：login: Penguin：2009/01/17(土) 00:27:44 ID : BLqmOvB5 で、話をもどすと、これは相手にこちらの思考をトレースできるようにして、
ベネフィットを上げる作戦ね。 最初に実装つくって、口説き方を考えるよりも、口説き方を考えた後で、 それにあわせて実装修正したほうが、考える幅を、広くとることが出来るんだよね。 他にもいろいろ作戦はあると思うけども、ギーク口説くのも、女を口説くのも、 たいして違いはなくて、相手に会わせてアプローチ変えるのキモだと思うのです。 たぶん 、TOMOYO の方々は僕よりもセキュリティに数倍詳しいので、もっといい口説き文句が 考えられるはず 。
論文を書くように書く。素敵だ。
口説く方法を相手に合わせてアプローチを変える。

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday the coup that ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya was illegal and would set a “ terrible precedent ” of transition by military force unless it was reversed .
“ We believe that the coup was not legal and that President Zelaya remains the president of Honduras , the democratically elected president there , ” Obama told reporters after an Oval Office meeting with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe .
Zelaya , in office since 2006 , was overthrown in a dawn coup on Sunday after he angered the judiciary , Congress and the army by seeking constitutional changes that would allow presidents to seek re-election beyond a four - year term .
The Honduran Congress named an interim president , Roberto Micheletti , and the country ’s Supreme Court said it had ordered the army to remove Zelaya .
The European Union and a string of foreign governments have voiced support for Zelaya , who was snatched by troops from his residence and whisked away by plane to Costa Rica in his pajamas .
Obama said he would work with the Organization of American States and other international institutions to restore Zelaya to power and “ see if we can resolve this in a peaceful way . ”
“ TERRIBLE PRECEDENT ”
“ It would be a terrible precedent if we start moving backwards into the era in which we are seeing military coups as a means of political transition , rather than democratic elections , ” Obama said , noting the region ’s progress in establishing democratic traditions in the past 20 years .
Despite Obama ’s comments , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the administration was not formally designating the ouster as a military coup for now , a step that would force a cut - off of most U.S. aid to Honduras .
Under U.S. law , no aid -- other than for the promotion of democracy -- may be provided to a country whose elected head of government has been toppled in a military coup .
“ We do think that this has evolved into a coup , ” Clinton told reporters , adding the administration was withholding that determination for now .
Asked if the United States was currently considering cutting off aid , Clinton shook her head no .
The State Department said it was unable to immediately say how much assistance the United States gives Honduras .
The State Department has requested $ 68.2 million in aid for fiscal year 2010 , which begins on October 1 , up from $ 43.2 million .
This covers funds for development , Honduran purchases of U.S. arms , military training , counter - narcotics and health care but does not include Defense Department aid , a U.S. official said .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said he did not believe Obama had spoken to Zelaya since the ouster .
He said the administration had worked in recent days to try to prevent the coup from happening , and “ our goal now is on restoring democratic order in Honduras . ”
OBAMA CRITICISM
Analysts said quick criticism of the coup by Obama and Clinton on Sunday pleased Latin American countries bitter about the long history of U.S. intervention in the region .
The Obama administration ’s stance contrasted with the equivocal position taken in 2002 by former President George W. Bush ’s administration , which was seen as tacitly accepting a coup against Venezuela ’s leftist President Hugo Chavez .
A senior U.S. official who spoke on condition he not be named said that by holding off on a legal determination that a coup has taken place , Washington was trying to provide space for a negotiated settlement .
“ If we were able to get to a ... status quo that returned to the rule of law and constitutional order within a relatively short period of time , I think that would be a good outcome , ” Clinton said .
The clashes continue at Phibro , the Citigroup 's ( C ) highly successful commodity trading unit , where compensation has gotten all messed up due to TARP limits .
Citi desperately wants to keep Phibro , but it 's fighting with the unit 's top trader , Andrew J. Hall , who is demanding to be made whole on some $ 100 million in owed compensation for his performance .
Needless to say , Citigroup is n't in a position to go around writing $ 100 million checks just like that .
WSJ : It will be an early test for Kenneth Feinberg , the Treasury Department 's pay czar , who was appointed last month to a new position with the power to help set pay for top executives and highly paid employees at seven firms receiving the most government financial aid .
Banks and others have a mid-August deadline for submitting pay requests to Mr. Feinberg .
" Companies will need to convince Mr. Feinberg that they have struck the right balance to discourage excessive risk - taking and reward performance for their top executives , " a spokesman for Mr. Feinberg said .
Mr. Hall is contractually obligated to receive pay based on Phibro 's profits , and some observers on Wall Street believe Citigroup has a better chance at repaying the U.S. money with its Phibro unit humming .
True , if Citi can't pay top Phibro traders , then yes , they 'll leave , go somewhere else and make another bank ( maybe a foreign one ! ) a whole lot of money .
But this whole " Repaying the US money " line is just horrible , and we 'd really like to call out the " obersvers on Wall Street " who keep using it to justify letting banks do whatever they want .
Let 's start with the fact that Phibro , for however successful it is , wo n't come anywhere near to making the billions and billions that have been plowed into Citi .
Beyond that , who cares ?
We do n't want our money back from Citigroup .
We want this dysfunctional bandit bank put in a state where it can't keep doing more damage .
And though Phibro did n't contribute to Citi 's problems , it 's also true that many institutions have suffered from the haywire bets taken by a wayward unit .
We feel for the Phibro traders , because , well , if we were owed $ 100 million for some service performed , and we were only offered , say , $ 1 million or $ 5 million , we'd be livid , too .
It 's one of the unwritten laws of physics :
At some time or another , everybody screws up .
But when IT pros make mistakes , they do n't mess around .
Entire buildings go dark .
Web sites disappear .
Companies grind to a halt .
Because if you 're going to mess up , you might as well make it count .
" I always tell my guys , hey , you 're gonna do stupid stuff , " says Rich Casselberry , director of IT operations at Enterasys , a networking systems vendor .
" It 's OK to do something stupid if you have the wrong information .
But if you do something stupid because you 're stupid , that 's a problem .
The trick is to not flip out , which only makes it worse , or try to hide it .
You need to figure out how to keep it from happening again . "

We 've gathered up some of the more egregious examples from IT pros brave enough to share their screwups with us .
Backups gone bad , people with admin privileges who probably should n't , what can go south when you unplug the wrong equipment -- in some cases , we 've obscured their identities to spare them embarrassment ; other geeks , however , are perfectly willing to own up to their youthful mistakes .
Sure , some of these mishaps are amusing in retrospect .
But do n't laugh too hard .
We know you 've probably done worse .
True IT confession No. 1 : The case of the mysterious invisible backup
Our first tale of misadventure involves a longtime IT pro who does n't want his real name used , so we 'll just call him Hard Luck Harry .
Harry had his share of mishaps when he started out a decade ago at a major networking equipment maker in the Northeast .
There was the time he changed an environmental variable that broke everything on his company 's financial apps , earning an e-mail from his boss ordering him to " never hack on this system again . "
Or the time he crashed the company 's core ERP system by overwriting / dev/tty .
Harry says after he accidentally ripped the company 's T1 lines out of the wall with his pager , he was banned from ever reentering the telecom closet .
But the worst one happened after Harry installed an Emerald tape backup system .
Did he bother to read the manual ?
Please .
This was child 's play .
Just load install.exe and let the software do its thing .
It seemed to work perfectly .
Four hours later , the first backup completed and everything looked fine .
Fast - forward six months .
Harry gets a call late one night at home from one of his work pals .
That night 's backup tape is completely blank , the friend tells him .
Worse , the last four weeks of backups are also blank .
As Harry soon discovered , that particular backup program installs in demo mode by default .
Demo mode looked exactly like real mode and even took the same amount of time as an actual backup , but nothing ever got written to tape -- a fact that was noted in the manual , which Harry might have seen had he read it .
Fortunately , the company used ADP for payroll processing .
ADP shipped back historical payroll records , so the firm lost only a week 's worth of data .
The bad news ?
Harry was up until 3 a.m. manually stuffing payroll envelopes , along with his boss , the VP of finance , the entire payroll department , and the company 's brand - new CIO , whom he met for the first time that night .

Have you heard that old saying ‘ a little of what you fancy does you good ’ ?
Well when it comes to some foods I ’m afraid its just not true .
They can kill you .
Surprisingly , even some of the everyday staples of our diet like the humble potato can cause death if we ’re not careful but if your tastes run to more exotic delicacies like the Japanese puffer fish , so highly prized by oriental gourmets , then eating becomes a deadly game of culinary Russian roulette .
Here are a few dishes you might think twice before ordering .
Fugu ( Puffer fish )
Fugu ( or puffer fish ) is one of the most celebrated and notorious dishes in Japanese cuisine .
Because it is so lethally poisonous if prepared incorrectly , chefs have to undergo rigorous training and be officially licensed to prepare it .
The final test they undergo before being licensed , incidentally , is having to eat a piece of Fugu that they have prepared , which must focus the mind wonderfully .
Even a tiny drop of toxin from the Fugu can leave unfortunate diners paralyzed and dying .
It contains lethal amounts of the poison tetrodoxin in the organs , especially the liver and ovaries , and also the skin .
The poison horrifyingly paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious , and eventually dies from asphyxiation .
There is no known antidote .
Bon appetit .
Sannakji ( raw baby octopus )
( image via : learnsomethingnewtoday
In Korean cuisine , sannakji or sannakji hoe is a raw dish made from a live small octopus that has been cut into small pieces and served immediately , usually lightly seasoned with sesame or sesame oil .
The nakji pieces are usually still squirming on the plate as they are eaten .
Because the suction cups on the arm pieces are still active when the dish is served , the danger is that pieces will stick to the mouth or throat and make the diner choke .
Some people like to feel the pieces wriggling as they swallow but for safety it needs to be chewed very thoroughly .
Ackee Fruit
The Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica and features in its cuisine .
When picked before it is fully ripe , the fruit contains a chemical that limits the body ’s ability to release the backup supply of glucose that is stored in the liver .
That supply is essential because once the body uses up the sugar immediately available in the bloodstream , an event that usually occurs several hours after eating , it depends on this glucose to keep blood sugar levels normal until the next meal .
Without it , blood sugar plunges dangerously .
Enough people have died from eating unripened ackee to make it illegal to bring the raw fruit into the U.S although that restriction does n’t apply to canned and properly processed ackee .
Almonds
Contrary to popular belief almonds are seeds rather than nuts .
They have a unique taste and have been one of the most popular ingredients in pastry kitchens for centuries .
The problem is that they are full of cyanide , a deadly poison .
In fact cyanide poison is often said to leave the tell - tale smell of almonds .
Heating destroys the poison but untreated bitter almonds are so dangerous that their sale is illegal in some countries .
In the USA , for example , only the sale of almonds that have been processed to remove all traces of poison and bacteria is permitted .
Silver Strip Blaasop
The silver - stripe blaasop fish is considered a delicacy in some ports in the Indian Ocean , but it contains a poisonous substance in its liver , skin and reproductive organs which can cause fatal muscle paralysis and breathing or circulation problems if eaten by humans .
Deaths from eating this fish have been reported across the eastern Mediterranean , Egypt and Israel , prompting the Hellenic Center for Medical Research to send an urgent notice to port authorities to warn fishermen about the toxic qualities of the fish , saying “ This fish is a source of poison for human beings if eaten , with a high risk of fatality . ”
Cherries
Cherries are a popular and much - loved fruit , used widely in cooking , liqueur production , or eaten raw .
They are from the same family as plums , apricots , and peaches and like these other fruits contain highly poisonous compounds in their leaves and seeds .
When the seeds of cherries are crushed , chewed , or even slightly injured , they produce prussic acid ( hydrogen cyanide ) .
Deaths from eating cherries are rare but its as well to remember not to suck on or chew the pit .
Giant Namibian Bullfrog
In parts of Africa these giant bullfrogs are apparently a local delicacy .
The French , as we all know , love their frogs legs , but they wisely leave the rest of the amphibian alone .
The Namibians , on the other hand , eat the whole thing , and therein lies the danger .
The poisonous secretions in the skin of the bullfrongs can cause kidney failure and death .
Apparently , lining your cooking pot with wood absorbs the poison and also stops your frog sticking to the bottom of the pan , a handy tip to remember if you want to take your chances .
Potatoes
Usually the only risk we run with eating potatoes is piling on too much weight , but even this ubiquitous vegetable has an even darker side .
Potatoes ( like tomatoes ) contain poison in the stems and leaves and even in the potato itself if it is left to turn green .
The green coloring is due to a high concentration of a glycoalkaloid toxin .
Potato poisoning is rare , but it does happen from time to time .
Death normally comes after a period of weakness and confusion , followed by a coma .
The majority of cases of death by potatoes in the last fifty years in the USA have been the result of eating green potatoes or drinking potato leaf tea .
Mushrooms
Mushrooms good , toadstools bad , right ?
Unfortunately its not as simple as that .
They are n’t different plants and in fact ‘ toadstool ’ is just a slang word for mushroom .
Some are edible but some can be deadly and picking the right ones is not a job for an amateur .
Most mushroom poisoning ( mycetism ) results from people eating wild mushrooms that have been incorrectly identified as safe .
The symptoms can range from mild gastro - intestinal disorders to death .
It ’s not only a bad stomach or an early demise you need to worry about either .
Psilocybin mushrooms ( magic mushrooms or ‘ shrooms ’ ) are a hallucinogenic that can have unpredictable mental and physical effects .
Fast Food
Fast food like burgers and fries , in moderation , is n’t going to do much harm , but as a society we seem to really struggle with the concept of ‘ moderation ’ .
The result of a runaway fast - food lifestyle in the west can be seen in the present obesity epidemic and also in rising levels of heart disease and premature death .
Despite advances in medical science they say this is the first generation where children are not expected to live longer than their parents and a lot of that simply comes down to diet .
It might seem strange to include things like burgers and fries in a list of deadly foods , but in terms of contributing to illness and death the western ‘ fast - food ’ diet outstrips all of the other more exotically dangerous edibles we ’ve looked at here by a long way .
Agree or disagree , at least its ‘ food for thought ’ .

Argentina : Turning Around is an exciting film which captures the spirit of Argentina ’s grassroots response to economic meltdown .
Drawing from diverse interviews and incredible footage , the film offers an inside look at the victories and challenges of Argentina ’s neighborhood assemblies , protest movements and worker - run factories .
Argentina : Turning Around skillfully transmits the country ’s courageous examples of social change .
In this interview , the film directors Mark Dworkin and Melissa Young talk about what led them to make the film , how the social and political environment in Argentina has changed since the 2001 economic crash , and how Argentina ’s methods of combating economic crisis on a grassroots level might offer lessons to activists in the US facing economic trouble .
Argentina : Turning Around is a documentary available from Bullfrog Films
Benjamin Dangl :
What led you to make this film , and how is it connected to the story of your previous film on Argentina , Hope in Hard Times ?
Mark Dworkin and Melissa Young : Just as we prepared to leave for the World Social Forum in southern Brazil , and then to visit Argentina , the dominant U.S. media reported Argentina ’s economic and political collapse of late 2001 with pictures of people pounding on the shuttered banks and the news that 30 people had been shot and killed by the police in just one day .
We almost cancelled our plans to visit Argentina for fear that it might be too dangerous or depressing .
But friends in Buenos Aires encouraged us to come anyway .
And when we got there we saw what was not reported in the dominant media – a remarkable resurgence of grassroots democracy , mutual aid , and cooperation , with street corner assemblies that sometimes led to takeovers of unused banks to form neighborhood centers , factories that had been shut down and were re-opened by their workers in defiance of the law , large scale community gardens , and daily mass blockades of streets and highways to demand government action to help those most hurt by the economic crisis .
We pulled out our travelling camera and began to film .
Although we were only able to stay for a couple of weeks , we continued to follow events in Argentina and returned 6 months later for more filming .
The result was Argentina - Hope in Hard Times ( 2004 ) which has screened all over the world in its English and Spanish versions and has even been translated into Chinese for a screening in Hong Kong .
We were invited to screen Hope in Hard Times at the 2005 Festival de los Documentalistas in Buenos Aires .
While in Argentina again , we tried to assess if things were back to business as usual , or if there were some fundamental changes from when we were last there .
We revisited the grassroots projects in our film with camera in hand , and we even screened Hope in Hard Times in a couple of the worker run factories .
Many neighborhood assemblies were no longer active , but the factories that had been taken over by worker cooperatives were surviving and thriving , and we filmed at a few more .
We also visited a new community cooperative run by unemployed workers in the poor suburb of La Matanza , and a villa de miseria ( slum ) on the outskirts of Buenos Aires founded by cartoneros ( recyclers ) .
We met with economists , journalists and activists , including Esteban Magnani , author of The Silent Change , who helped us to appreciate that the long term significance of the events of 2001 - 2002 goes well beyond the accomplishment of a given factory or neighborhood .
As Magnani puts it in Argentina - Turning Around , " It was a miracle !
People took over the scene again .
We said that we are the protagonists of our own history , and we want to be the protagonists . "
BD : Could you describe some of the main ways that Argentina ’s social and political environment has changed since the 2001 - 2002 economic crash and subsequent popular activism and organizing ?
MD and MY : This is what Argentina - Turning Around addresses .
For most people life has become more normal again .
Once the emergency passed , the intense grassroots activity subsided , but many efforts in communities and workplaces continue .
In 2003 , Nestor Kirchner was elected President , and he was succeeded by his wife Cristina Fernández in 2007 .
They both talked a more populist line , and persuaded the courts and government agencies to give worker run factories a chance to prove themselves [ even as former owners tried to get them back ] .
Argentina paid off its entire debt to the IMF with help from Venezuela .
They began to prosecute human rights offenders from the military dictatorship of 1976 - 83 ( also touched on in Turning Around ) .
As the economy recovered substantially in 2004 - 2007 , official unemployment rates dropped from over 20 % to 8 % .
We were told that people would never again let the Argentine government favor the demands of global corporations and institutions at the expense of regular people such as what happened in the 1990s .
Of course , now Argentina is feeling the effects of the global financial crisis , and right now too , the swine flu .
The economy is down and unemployment is up .
The expansion of lands planted with transgenic soy has raised food prices and contributed to inflation .
And President Cristina Fernandez ’s party lost seats in the June mid-term elections , with criticism from both right and left .
( For more information , see Argentine journalist Marie Trigona ’s writings about swine flu and recent elections in Argentina . )
On a return visit earlier this year we found that the 200 or so worker run factories continue to " occupy , resist , and produce . "
A few have failed but others have started up .
When eviction has been threatened by former owners , often the public has shown up to demonstrate their support for the worker run enterprises .
For the history of the Zanon ceramics plant , one of the first to be seized by its workers , see this article .
Similar worker run enterprises have taken root in Brazil , Venezuela and most recently , Uruguay .
BD : Could Argentina ’s experience with economic crisis and methods of combating that crisis on a grassroots level offer any lessons to activists in the US facing economic trouble ?
MD and MY : Although there is seldom inspiring news from Latin America in the U.S. press , we believe we can learn a lot from Argentina ’s activism , especially from the can do spirit of horizontalidad ( non-hierarchical organizations ) .
As Esteban Magnani puts it in Turning Around , " There is a vibe in the air that the important thing is to do it , to find your own way to do it , and to help other people find their own way ! "
When Hope in Hard Times came out over 4 years ago , people at screenings in the U.S. would say , " We have seen similar policies , such as off - shoring of jobs and privatization of public services here in the U.S.
Will we have an economic collapse of our own ?
And if we do , would we pull together as people did in Argentina ? "
Fast forward a few years and we are in the worst economic crisis since the great depression .
The corporate agenda of globalization and privatization has been discredited .
Many in the U.S. have quit expecting solutions from the top and are becoming active with others in their local communities , with a particular emphasis on local food and alternative energy .
Workers at Republic Windows and Doors occupied their Chicago factory late last year , to demand severance pay and benefits after the factory closed , and they won .
That factory is scheduled to re-open under new management to produce energy conserving windows .
Their example was followed by workers at Hartmarx clothing , who voted in May to sit - in at their plants to protect their jobs .
But so far , we have n’t seen workers begin to run these plants themselves .
Even in Argentina , self - management did n’t happen right away .
At the beginning of Argentina - Turning Around , Soledad Bordegaray of the Union of Unemployed Workers says , " It ’s not like people began with the idea of running things ourselves , we were n’t taught to think that way .
But no existing institutions were responding to our needs for jobs , education , and health care .
People got together and said , why wait for someone else ?
Let ’s see what WE can do ! "
We produced these films to encourage our own resurgence of grassroots democracy here in the U.S.
It is hard to imagine resolving the current economic situation and the challenges of energy and climate change by relying on the same top down , profit maximizing institutions that got us into this mess in the first place .
BD : What are you working on now ?
MD and MY : Earlier this year we visited Argentina again and personally delivered copies of Argentina - Turning Around to all who appear in the film .
Our travels led us to film some of the current struggles of indigenous peoples in northwest Argentina .
The expansion of mining contracts , burgeoning grape production for wines , and the lucrative soy plantations that produce animal feed for export are exerting pressure on the traditional lands of indigenous peoples .
We also witnessed the successful vote in Bolivia for the new constitution that provides more rights for indigenous peoples .
Some short pieces about these struggles will appear soon on You Tube .
At the moment we are preparing our most recent documentary for public TV broadcast in English and Spanish , Good Food .
Recently we signed a license with public TV in Argentina to broadcast Buena Comida .

Paul :
It 's a terrible idea on all sorts of levels .
There are three big problems with attempting to control health care costs by reducing so - called " obesity . "
First , it 's a fake problem .
Second , the solutions for the problem are non-existent , even assuming the problem existed .
Third , focusing on making Americans thinner diverts resources from real public health issues .
Megan : Let 's start with the first .
If there 's one thing that everyone in America knows , it 's that being fat is really unhealthy .
Why do you call it a fake problem ?
Paul :
The correlations between higher weight and greater health risk are weak except at statistical extremes .
The extent to which those correlations are causal is poorly established .
There is literally not a shred of evidence that turning fat people into thin people improves their health .
And the reason there 's no evidence is that there 's no way to do it .
So saying " let 's improve health by turning fat people into thin people " is every bit as irrational as saying " let 's improve health by turning men into women or old people into young people " .
Actually it 's a lot crazier , because there actually are significant health differences between men and women and the old and the young -- much more so than between the fat and the thin .
Megan :
So why is the public health community so set on this issue as the major driver of our health care costs ?
Paul :
Because we 're in the midst of a moral panic over fat , which has transformed the heavier than average into folk devils , to whom all sorts of social ills are ascribed .
Megan : Aside from rising health care costs ?
Paul :
Well according to the obesity mafia our kids are all going to die sooner than their parents , which sounds like a moral problem as well as one of health care costs .
It 's all complete nonsense .
Megan :
Do you think being overweight is a proxy for things that DO make a difference , like fitness ?
Paul :
It 's a weak proxy , but yes it has some marginal significance .
It 's good to encourage people of all sizes to be active and avoiding eating disordered behavior ( like dieting ) , but this is n't because lifestyle changes will make fat people thin people .
They wo n't .
I 'd like to talk a little about the statistics if I may .
: Please !
We 're all about statistics here .
Paul : OK , the CDC honchos and the authors of this study you referenced are in hysterics because the obesity rate , so - called , has roughly doubled in the last 30 years .
But let 's consider what that actually means .
Obesity is defined completely arbitrarily as a body mass index of 30 or higher ( 175 pounds for an average height woman ) .
Now body mass follows more or less a normal distribution , whiich means if the the mean body weight is in the mid to high 20s , which it has been for many decades now , then tens of millions of people will have BMIs just below and just above the magic 30 line .
So if the average weight of the population goes up by ten pounds , tens of millions of people who were just under the line will now be just over it .
This might be meaningful if there was any evidence that people who have BMIs in the low 30s have different average health than people with BMIs in the high 20s , but they do n't .
At all .
So the " obesity epidemic " is 100 % a product of tens of millions of people having their BMIs creep over an arbitrary line .
It 's exactly as sensible as declaring that people who are 5 ' 11 are healthy but people who are 6 ' 1 " are sick .
Adding to the absurdity of all this , people with BMIs in the mid to high 20s actually have the best overall health and longest life expectancy -- , more so than those in the so - called " normal " BMI range .
Megan :
So we can't save billions of dollars by making people thinner ?
Paul : Consider the methodology of this study .
It tried to calculate changes in health costs if everybody with a BMI over 30 had a BMI under 25 .
But leaving aside the preposterous assumption that all increased health risks associated with a level of body mass are caused by that level of body mass , the idea that somehow we could make fat people into thin people is bizarre .
A study like this is n't talking about turning 180 pound women into 165 pound women , which at least in theory might actually be possible .
It 's talking about turning 200 pound women into 130 pound women , on statistical average .
The success rate for such attempts is about .1 % Even stomach amputation does not turn fat people into thin people .
So even if it were true that we knew it would be beneficial to turn fat people into thin people ( which we do n't ) it 's not something we have any idea how to do .
The statements in the study indicating that there are known methods for doing this are simply lies of the most egregious sort .
Now lets talk about excess health care costs .
if you look at the study , nearly half of the excess health care costs associated with being fat are from higher rates of drug prescription .
But why are fat people being prescribed more drugs than thin ones ?
Largely , because they have the " disease " of being fat , which is then treated directly and indirectly by prescription drugs !
For instance , statins .
Statins are a multi-billion dollar business , but there 's very little statistical evidence that they benefit the vast majority of people to whom they 're prescribed .
Basically the only people who have lower CVD [ cardiovascular disease ] mortality after taking statins are middle - aged men with a history of CVD .
But the heavier than average are prescribed statins at higher rates simply because they 're heavier than average , even though there 's no evidence this is beneficial for them .
And of course this does n't touch on the costs of all the treatments for " obesity " itself , which are uniformly ineffective .
Megan :
You 're saying that increased risks from being heavy come from -- what ?
Having gained weight in the first place ?
Bad genetics ?
Or dieting ?
Paul :
As for where the increased risks associated with being heavy come from ( such as they are ) , many of them come from weight cycling , which is clearly bad for people , and which is the outcome of 98 % of diets .
Others come from the stress and social discrimination generated by having what 's considered an inapproprirate body in this culture .
Others come from diet drugs , eating disordered behavior , poverty -- all things strongly associated with higher than avberage weight .
Megan :
What about gastric bypass ?
The quoted figures for gastric bypass seem pretty impressive when doctors talk about them on television .
Paul : Gastric bypass is surgically induced bulimia .
People starve for the first few months so of course their blood sugar levels go down .
At five and ten year followup the average weight loss from these procedures is about 10 % to 15 % of body mass ( it 's actually less than that since lots of people drop out of the studies ) which means most of these people end up still " morbidly obese . "
And they can never eat normally again .
Why do you think you never see the actual stats for weight loss from stomach stapling ?
If they were good they'd be on billboards 50 feet high .
Megan :
Those shows on TLC that basically invite the audience to gawk at fat people usually say they 'll lose fifty percent of their excess body weight
Paul :
If you put people on starvation diets , which is what these methods do , of course you 'll get huge amounts of weight loss .
Then most or all of it will be gained back , which among other things is a recipe for congestive heart failure .
I 'd love to do a " reality " show on the contestants on shows like The Biggest Loser three years down the road .
But that would probably be a little too much reality .
Gastric bypass is the most radical method available for weight loss , and it basically does n't work .
Everything else is even less successful , though usually not quite as dangerous .
Megan :
Over the last five years or so , I 've noticed that public health efforts about obesity are not just amping up the volume , but exploring increasingly coercive methods to induce weight loss : taxes on junk food , lawsuits against fast food companies ( which are basically a tax on junk food ) , and so forth .
Does that match your analysis ?
Paul :
It 's the classic pattern of moral panics .
As public concern about the damage being done to the fabric of society by the folk devils increases , increasingly intense demands are made on public officials to " do something " about the crisis , usually by eliminating the folk devils .
That of course is the strategy for this crisis .
If fat people are the problem , then the solution is to get rid of them , by making them thin people .
The most amazing aspect of this whole thing , for me , has always been the imperviouusness of policy makers , and even more so people who consider themselves serious academics and scientists , to the overwhelming evidence that there 's no way to do this .
I mean , there 's no better established empirical proposition in medical science that we do n't know how to make people thinner .
But apparently this proposition is too disturbing to consider , even though it 's about as well established as that cigarettes cause lung cancer .
So all these proposals about improving public health by making people thinner are completely crazy .
They are as non-sensical as anything being proposed by public officials in our culture right now , which is saying something .
It 's conceivable that through some massive policy interventions you might be able to reduce the population 's average BMI from 27 to 25 or something like that .
But what would be the point ?
There are n't any health differences to speak of for people between BMIs of about 20 and 35 , so undertaking the public health equivalent of the Apollo program to reduce the populace 's average BMI by a unit or two ( and again I will emphasize that we do n't actually know if we could do even that ) is an incredible waste of public health resources
Megan :
The idea I 'm hearing now is that we need to change the environment , but of course , if losing a great deal of weight actually makes you unhealthier , that might not save us any money .
The other idea I 'm hearing a lot more these days is that we have to Save the Kids : intervene when they 're young so they do n't get fat in the first place
Paul :
So the strategies that have failed so spectacularly with adults -- tell them to exercise more , and eat less , and shame them about their weight -- will work with children .
Because if there 's one thing fat kids need , it 's to be made to feel bad about feeling fat .
The current stigmitization of fat kids is essentially child abuse as government policy , and the people behind it are , as far as I 'm concerned , either incredibly stupid or very evil or in some cases both .
Here 's an idea : Stop harrassing people about their weight .
Because it appears that focusing on the idea that being fat actually makes people fatter .
At least there 's an extremely strong correlation there .
I bet if we stopped demonizing fatness people would actually be a bit thinner .
They 'd certainly be happier and healthier
Megan :
What should we do instead if we want to reduce health care costs ?
Here are some proposed ideas I 've heard :
Earlier this week , I was surprised when I read that Moody ’s put the decline in commercial real estate at 16 % over the last TWO MONTHS .
That ’s a stunning rate of decline that has very negative consequences for banks who are still carrying commercial whole loans on their balance sheet at close to 100¢ on the dollar .
For comparison , consider the chart to the right , which compares the Case - Shiller Composite 20 Index for residential real estate prices with the Moody ’s / REAL National All Property CRE Index . *
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
Peak to trough the declines are similar : Residential is down 33 % from its July ’06 peak while commercial is down 35 % from its October ’ 07 peak .
But note the stunning rate of decline of late for commercial .
28 % since September .
Residential is off half as much over that time .
To be sure , comparing these two indices is n’t totally fair .
As Dan Alpert of Westwood Capital pointed out to me , there are millions of transactions that go into Robert Shiller ’s residential index .
It ’s very granular .
On the CRE side there have been very few actual sales that indicate recent pricing .
So you have to read Moody ’s / REAL with a grain of salt .
Directionally , however , the index is correct .
Commercial is collapsing very quickly , even as residential looks to be forming a ( temporary ? ) bottom .
What are the implications ?
Consider the $ 1 - $ 1.5 trillion in commercial mortgages being held as whole loans at commercial and savings banks in the U.S. **
Because whole loans are “ held to maturity , ” they are typically carried at full value until the borrower actually defaults .
Never mind that the underlying collateral is now worth far less than the mortgage .
But banks are n’t forced to take writedowns until an event of default .
To avoid that they can play all sorts of games to make things easier for the borrower .
According to Alpert :
Banks and other lenders with loans collateralized by income - producing properties have been offering borrowers nearly any forbearance imaginable : loan extensions , interest rate reductions , delayed principal payments , wavers of covenants and guarantees , and in some instances additonal funding — anything and everything to avoid taking a current loss , as long as there is some cash flow or reserve balance to draw on so as to maintain that the loan is performing against its ( often heavily modified ) terms .
The bottom line is that banks still have hundreds of billions of losses buried on their balance sheets .
Commercial real estate prices are n’t coming back , which means these loans will have to be marked down eventually .
The longer banks wait , the more painful the writedowns will be .
Bank shareholders should take note .
Assuming the government is n’t going to absorb all these losses , their equity may eventually be wiped out .

I had another call from Cynthia McKinney who has been told she will remain imprisoned in Ramale , Israel until Monday , July 6 at least along with many others .
She asked me to pass along this detail .
Among their aid group were three Muslim women from Bahrain who spoke neither English nor Hebrew , and two men from Bahrain .
All five of these people were released from custody and flown back to Bahrain in the private plane of the King of Bahrain Sheikh Hamad ibn ' Isa Al Khalifah , where they were welcomed as national heroes .
WASHINGTON — Sen. John F. Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , says he will hold far - ranging oversight hearings on the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan .
“ End of summer , early fall , we are going to take a hard look at Afghanistan , ” Kerry said in an interview with GlobalPost .
Kerry , whose committee previously held informational hearings that focused on Afghan society and the experience of veterans of the war , has until now held off on a public examination of the administration ’s handling of Afghanistan while President Barack Obama ’s national security team crafted its own counterinsurgency strategy .
That strategy called for an increase of more than 20,000 troops in Afghanistan , which is now underway .
When Congress approved funding for the additional troops , “ I think we gave them a fairly defined and limited scope of engagement , ” Kerry said .
“ I remain concerned about the nature of the footprint and how this is going to be implemented . ”
Kerry 's proposal for hearings comes as just - deployed U.S. Marines undertake an ambitious and perilous offensive against the Taliban in the south , and as suicide bombings and roadside attacks on U.S. troops have escalated .
Thursday morning a roadside bomb killed 25 people , including 13 children who were walking to school , in the Logar Province just outside Kabul .
The war in Afghanistan is a potentially divisive issue for Democrats .
A sizable group of House Democrats voted against a recent appropriations bill that provided funds for the Obama administration ’s additional troop deployments .
Some worried openly that Afghanistan could become another Vietnam , and asked why Congress is not insisting on an exit strategy , nor holding oversight hearings on so important a matter .
Between 1966 and 1971 , the same committee Kerry chairs , then under Democratic chairman William Fulbright of Arkansas , played an important role in focusing concerns on President Lyndon Johnson ’s flawed strategy during the Vietnam War .
Kerry , then a 27 - year - old decorated combat veteran of that war , rose to prominence as an anti-war leader with his testimony at the committee 's hearings .
Now Kerry is in a key position to shape the direction of the war in Afghanistan .
The hearings will be part of an aggressive schedule Kerry — a Massachusetts Democrat who lost to George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election — has for the coming weeks .
The schedule includes oversight hearings on Iraq , at which U.S. Ambassador Chris Hill will testify , and work to get a global warming bill passed by mid-October .
Senate Democrats may “ tweak it ” a little , but plan to leave the climate bill passed by the House intact , Kerry revealed .
“ We are really working hard to build on what the House did , ” Kerry said .
“ We are not going to try to reinvent the wheel . ”
House leaders , with the aid of the White House , painstakingly assembled a complex bill to meet the concerns of the wide range of interests — consumers , utilities , businesses and environmentalists — who helped draft the legislation .
The Senate , Kerry said , will try not to disturb that hard - won consensus .
“ A lot of the battles we were going to fight here were fought there .
We respect the needle they threaded , ” he said .
“ With respect to a lot of those interests we are going to model it on what they did . ”
On Afghanistan , Kerry promised that his committee would fulfill its constitutional obligation to serve as a check on the executive branch — even though it is controlled by his fellow Democrats .
“ We are not going to abrogate our responsibility , ” said Kerry .
“ We will have hearings . ”
Earlier this year , Kerry ’s committee held several provocative public hearings on the situation in Afghanistan , quizzing counterinsurgency experts and U.S. troops who served there .
But unlike Sen . Fulbright , Kerry has not called the top policymakers within the the Obama administration — such as the secretaries of State and Defense or the regional commander , Gen. David Petraeus — to Capitol Hill to explain and defend the strategy under critical cross-examination .
“ In fairness to this administration , they have done what prior administrations did not do , which is accurately define a mission and a rationale for our presence , which is no longer this grand sweeping democratic state and so forth , but is the much more limited mission of achieving a sufficient level of stability , that the Afghans can work things out for themselves , ” Kerry said .
That would leave the U.S. with “ the ability to prosecute Al Qaeda and not allow them to attack the U.S. from their soil , ” he said .
“ This is a pretty limited goal , ” said Kerry .
“ The key here is how Petraeus and company actually implement and define the use of those troops .
You have to be very careful that this is an Afghan operation and not an American one . ”
It ’s essential that the U.S. win the loyalty and cooperation of the Afghan people , Kerry said .
Victory “ depends on whether the Afghans themselves invest and start engaging , ” he said .
“ If a tribe is willing to stand up and protect its own valley , as they used to , then you do n’t need a lot of troops on the ground . ”
But “ up until now there has been no strategy , no global strategy for their country , and a huge growing distrust of Kabul and of the Karzai government and of the corruption , ” he said .
Afghans “ have to see there is a light at the end of the tunnel , ” said Kerry , and that light can only be provided by an American commitment of money and lives .
“ Are we doing it at a level where it will take ? ” Kerry asked .
“ That is a good question .
That is what our hearings are going to look at .
I do n’t have the answer for that right now . ”

Have you ever seen Zeus ’ family tree ?
Dude , that guy is a whole series of Jerry Springer .
A few years back , I saw an insanely rough sex moment in an adult flick .
A man was hitting it doggie style , shagging the hell out of a woman while pulling her arms into a painful stretch behind her .
He then abruptly folded her arms together on the small of her back , swung his leg up to the couch , and planted his foot firmly on her head .
Suffice to say I found this deprecating cruelty terribly arousing .
Pervert , remember ?
Then a few months ago I came across the same thing again , and squealed in delight .
And then I wondered …as I often do , “ What the hell is wrong with me ? ”
OK , pervs …come on .
Is that not …hot ??
It could only be better were he fully clothed , wearing boots .
There is something hot and humiliating about being nude when your partner is fully dressed .
I simply adore the sensation of being vulnerable and bare in front of someone who is dressed and dominant .
If clothes make the man , boots make the man hot as fuck .
I often struggle on the ego - totter with my deep - seated need to be humiliated in some way .
On the one hand , my self - esteem is a fawn - footed creature , susceptible to light and noise and the softest of blows .
On the other hand , under the withering harshness of brutal treatment , I find a hidden and oft unacknowledged strength that buoys me up and sends me into a chest - wrenching paroxysm of fierce pride when I have weathered scornful abuse .
Many years ago , I had a dominant to whom I ’d newly submitted after knowing him for years .
In the midst of a very brutal scene in which my stubbornness was in the fore , he had me down on the ground with a boot to my cheek .
Using his heel as leverage , he rolled my head to one side and ordered me to lick the sole of his boot .
“ OK . No . ”
… was the clear voice from one side of my head .
“ You have no choice .
Do it . ”
… was the voice , ever more strident , from the other .
I felt more humiliated , repulsed and horrified as I ever had before in a scene .
I ’m not entirely mysophobic … but it is pretty fucking close .
So licking the sole of a street boot , no matter how sexy the boot was , squicked me to nausea .
But my reflex to be obedient was strong .
And then came the Bad Voice .
“ You are so desperate for this man ’s attention you ’ll do anything … anything …to amuse him .
You sick , sick worthless bitch … ” it sighed , claws extending deep into consciousness .
I shook , my eyes full of hot tears that ran down into my ears and pooled beneath my head .
He put the boot on my throat , regarding me coldly from above my naked prone body .
“ You ’d disobey me ?
What ?
Do you think you are above licking my boot ?
I stared mutely at him , face frozen , staring .
“ So .
You think you ’re worth more than that ? ”
I nodded .
Slowly , then again .
I hitched in a shuddering breath and waited for him to berate me further .
Instead , he was suddenly pulling me up and holding me tightly .
“ Yes .
You are .
You are invaluable .
And beautiful .
And I am so proud of you . ”
I was shocked , to say the least , as that was n’t what I expected .
To this day , I look on that moment as being when I fully understood the value and place that humiliation has for me .
It is a broad - brush full - bore way for me to feel the worst of how I feel about myself , give it away to someone , and have them hold it .
Once someone else holds up for me , mirrors it back , shows me the depth of my own feelings , my self - deprecation , I can see it for what it is .
And then the let it go .
And then , they come back , and love me for who I TRULY am .
And then , sometimes just for a second , but sometimes for much longer … sometimes I DO feel that valuable .
That special .
That precious .
It was a surreal moment two weeks ago when analysts on Goldman Sachs ’ earnings conference call pressed CFO David Viniar to jack up leverage .
They seem to think that the worst of the credit crisis is behind us , so Goldman should goose its risk profile to increase returns .
This is remarkably short - sighted .
Yes , leverage is down , but only relative to the obscene levels reached a year ago .
Measured by tangible common equity , the biggest banks are still levered over 20 to 1 .
If banks learn nothing else from the financial crisis , it ’s that they should err on the side of prudence , carrying substantially more capital than appears necessary .
( Click table to enlarge in new window )
Tangible common equity remains the crucial measure of bank capital because it ’s the primary cushion to absorb losses .
When that cushion gets low , creditors panic .
Bank runs ensue and the financial system ceases to function .
A nickel of equity for every dollar of assets is a pathetically small capital cushion .
And today , banks substitute federal guarantees for liquid capital .
Policymakers are afraid to remove the guarantees because they do n’t want to precipitate another collapse .
The financial system ca n’t stand on its own until its capital cushion is rebuilt .
Now consider the analyst comments on Goldman ’s call : Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski asked how the firm plans to deploy “ what looks like pretty significant excess … capital ; ” Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski pronounced himself “ stunned ” by the increase in Goldman ’s TCE .
To be sure , Goldman ’s 5.7 percent ratio of TCE to tangible assets at the end of the second quarter surpassed rivals ’ .
And it was up significantly from 4.6 percent in the the previous quarter .
But how far have banking standards fallen that 6 cents against a dollar of assets is considered an excessively prudent cushion ?
And other banks are in worse shape .
Citigroup exited last quarter with a puny TCE ratio of 2.3 percent , which implies leverage of 43 to 1 .
That ’s an improvement over 1.7 percent in the previous quarter , but it ’s still awful .
The majority of the big banks are hovering between 4 percent and 5 percent , which implies leverage between 20 x - 25 x .
For the complete list of the top nine banks , see the chart above .
Thanks for the recent improvement go to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , whose stress tests forced the big banks to raise capital .
But they have n’t raised enough .
As unemployment rises , charge - offs on credit card and other consumer loan portfolios will accelerate .
As property values stay depressed , impairments on mortgages and home equity loans will increase substantially .
These losses will eat through banks ’ small capital cushions quickly .
And Calyon analyst Mike Mayo expects the worst is yet to come .
In a recent note to clients he said peak loan losses during the current cycle will “ approach if not exceed peak loan losses during the Great Depression . ”
To deal with that , banks need to de-leverage .
They need to take risk off their balance sheets .
Mayo estimates they ’re “ just one - third complete ” with this process .
In the meantime , banks are using various accounting gimmicks to hide leverage .
For instance , Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase have $ 165 billion and $ 145 billion of off - balance sheet assets , respectively , that will have to come back on their balance sheets next year .
Taking account of them now would reduce their TCE ratios by 8 percent and 7 percent , respectively .
Bank of America has $ 470 billion of off - balance sheet assets , though they have n’t disclosed what will end up on the balance sheet .
A counterargument is that using TCE as the test for capital is excessively prudent , that regulatory measures like “ Tier 1 ” are sufficient .
But Tier 1 includes capital like preferred stock as equivalent to TCE .
But it ’s not because it is n’t in the first loss position of the capital structure .
Banks that blew through this buffer last year saw their balance sheets disintegrate in a matter of hours .
FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul Miller argues that Tier 1 capital has been “ polluted ” by preferred stock offerings .
At the end of the first quarter this year , TCE made up “ just 53 percent of Tier 1 capital for the top 11 banks , down from an average of 91 percent ” between 1991 and 2006 .
Afraid of diluting common shareholders , they sold preferred stock instead .
In the end they gamed regulatory capital standards , substituting inferior capital for TCE .
The comments on Goldman ’s call show that the pre-crisis mindsets have not changed .
Less than a year from one of the greatest financial meltdowns in history , many analysts seem to think 17 x leverage is “ excessively ” prudent .
That is mind - boggling .
Our hero , Ron " Skywalker " Paul , has managed to gather sufficient support to overthrow the Evil Empire widely known as the Fed .
In a brazen attempt to beat back our hero , the Empire has taken its case directly to Congress , seeking more power to rape and pillage the populace under cloak of secrecy .
The Washington Post picks up the story in Sith Lord Kohn warns Congress on meddling in the Empire 's affairs .
The Federal Reserve Evil Empire on Thursday launched a robust defense of its independence and warned that efforts in Congress to put monetary policy under political sway would hurt the economy Empire .
Fed Vice Chairman Sith Master Donald Kohn said opening up some of the U.S. central bank 's most sensitive decisions to political scrutiny could result in higher long - term interest rates and hurt the United States ' credit rating discrimination against the Sith Lords .
Testifying before a congressional panel , Kohn sought to beat back a proposed bill that would open the U.S. central bank 's policy decisions to audits by a federal an Ewok watchdog agency .
More than half of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives Ewoks have signed as co-sponsors of the measure .
" Any substantial erosion of the Federal Reserve 's Empire 's monetary independence likely would lead to higher long - term interest rates as investors begin to fear future inflation , " Kohn told a House the Ewok subcommittee .
Kohn 's testimony comes as Congress debates President Sith Lord Barack Obama 's plan for regulatory reform , which envisions the Fed Evil Empire taking on an expanded role monitoring risks across the entire financial system to help ward off future financial crises .
The proposal has boosted calls for greater accountability at the central bank , which already faces heavy scrutiny from lawmakers troubled by its role in bailing out Wall Street .
Kohn said blatantly lied while stating the administration 's plan would not greatly expand the Fed 's Empire 's power , and said it would work hand - in - glove with monetary policy , not compromise it as some critics contend .
Fed Empire officials have had to endure rigorous congressional Ewok grillings over their aggressive actions to restore financial calm squash the noble rebellion .
Their e-mails have been subpoenaed , recalling past episodes when the central bank came under attack and was forced to yield to the political will .
The proposed bill , put forward by Ron " Skywalker " Paul , a Texas Republican Jedi Knight and long - standing Fed Evil Empire foe , would expose decisions on monetary policy and emergency lending to audits by the Government Ewok Accountability Office .
The GAO EAO is currently prohibited from auditing these areas .
Sith Master Kohn said removing this exclusion would be highly detrimental to the Evil Empire and could lead investors to worry that politics -- not economics -- sanity would guide the Fed 's Empire 's decisions .
Skywalker Paul 's bill has 250 co-sponsors , including 78 Democrats Ewoks .
But it has not been promoted by the Democratic Ewok majority leadership in the House , where it has yet to face even a committee - level vote thanks to Ewok traitor Barney " Benedict " Frank .
The Dark Lord , Ben " Vader " Bernanke , head of the Evil Empire , could not be reached for comment .
Ron " Skywalker " Paul : We Will Not Be Stopped
Congressman Jedi Knight Ron Paul has vowed that he will not be stopped in his effort to audit the Federal Reserve Evil Empire , as he slammed Senate authorities for blocking the bill earlier this week .
Appearing on Fox News ’ Freedom Watch with Judge Napolitano , Paul referred to Senate authorities blocking Jim DeMint ’s attempt to attach the legislation , which already has 250 co-sponsors in the House , as a provision to a spending bill as a “ facade ” .
The amendment was blocked by Senate authorities on Monday after they claimed that it violated rules for provisions attached to spending bills .
“ Technicalities are always ignored for things they the Evil Empire wants – this means they do n’t want it and this is their organized effort now to stop us , but we ’re not going to be stopped , it ’s just going to energize everybody at the grass roots , ” said the Congressman Jedi Knight .
" Skywalker " Paul said that it made no sense to give the Fed Evil Empire more power when they had already created the bubble that led to the economic collapse in the first place .
Sith Lord Obama 's new regulatory reform plan , which will officially hand the Federal Reserve Evil Empire complete dictatorial control over the U.S. economy , will give the Fed Empire the authority to “ regulate ” and shut down any company whose activity it believes could threaten the economy and the markets .
Jedi Paul explained that nobody knows exactly what would be uncovered but that was the whole point of having an audit in the first place .
“ When we discover what ’s really going on , I think the American people are going to demand the next step , they ’re going to demand honest money – it ’s happened many times in history , ” added Skywalker .
The case for liquid water beneath the surface of Saturn 's moon Enceladus has gotten a boost , with the discovery of salty ice grains that were blasted into space in the moon 's gigantic plumes of ice and water vapour .
The salt may have been leached from rocks in the moon 's core by a reservoir of subsurface liquid water , which could be a potential habitat for life .
But the source of the plumes is still unknown .
While some of the plume 's ice grains are salty , another study released this week found that water vapour in the plumes seems to be salt - free , ruling out explosive geysers that directly blast salty water into space from elongated rifts called ' tiger stripes ' .
This suggests the plumes are produced in a way that leaves most salt behind on the moon .
" Our picture of [ Enceladus 's ] subsurface must now be expanded to include the possibility of misty ice caverns floored with pools and channels of salty water , lurking beneath the tiger stripes , " writes planetary scientist John Spencer in a commentary appearing this week in Nature .
" What else make lurk in those salty pools , if they exist , remains to be seen . "

A knob from a work light seems to have floated loose during the space shuttle Atlantis 's May mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope .
After the shuttle landed , the knob was found wedged between the dashboard and an inner front window on the shuttle 's fight deck .
NASA is investigating how best to remove the knob , which became stuck when the shuttle 's cabin depressurised and shrank on landing .
If the window is deemed too dangerous to fly and must be replaced , Atlantis 's scheduled November flight to the International Space Station could face a delay of up to six months .
This could add pressure to NASA 's already tight launch schedule .
The agency aims to fly eight more missions before the shuttle is retired in 2010 .

An underground laboratory in the deepest mine in the US was officially dedicated this week in a ceremony that took place about 1.5 km below the surface of the Earth .
The Sanford Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory lies beneath the Black Hills of South Dakota in a former gold mine known as Homestake .
Later this year , physicists hope to install the Large Underground Xenon detector , which will use a chamber containing 350 kilograms of liquid xenon to search for weakly - interacting massive particles , one of the leading candidates for dark matter .
The intervening earth will shield the detector from bombardment by charged particles called cosmic rays that are released by the sun and other cosmic bodies .
Before 13 May , the mine 's 1.5 - km level was under water .
With more funding and water pumping , physicists hope to make Homestake Mine a national underground laboratory that is capable of hosting experiments down to a depth of 2.4 km .

Five days after launching , NASA 's moon collider , the Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) , got the first glimpse of its quarry .
This image was taken on 23 June , as LCROSS passed by the moon at a distance of 3200 km and used the moon 's gravity to place it on course to collide with the moon .
LCROSS , as well as the spent upper stage of its launch vehicle , will crash into the moon 's south pole in October .
The resulting plumes of debris will be analysed for evidence of water ice , a potential resource for future lunar explorers .

Spaceport America , the planned headquarters for commercial space firm Virgin Galactic , broke ground late last week .
The state of New Mexico , which will host the facility at a site about 70 kilometres north of the town Las Cruces , has invested $ 200 million in the project .
Construction is expected to be complete by the end of 2010 , around the same time that Virgin Galactic aims to begin offering $ 200,000 suborbital trips from the spaceport that will provide ticket holders about five minutes of weightlessness .

This ghostly ribbon is a remnant of a stellar explosion that was recorded by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD , making it the world 's oldest recorded supernova .
The remnant , dubbed RCW 86 , sits 8200 light years away from Earth in the constellation Circinus .
A new study reveals that a fast - moving shock wave in RCW 86 has heated the gas behind it to some 30 million °C .
This temperature is more than 10 times cooler than expected from the speed of the shock wave .
Astronomers suspect the missing energy was used to accelerate charged particles , a fraction of which eventually hit Earth 's atmosphere as cosmic rays .
The researchers argue this process is sufficient to create the cosmic rays we see originating from the Milky Way .

Strap us in and color us blue with excitement : the first stills from Syfy 's adaptation of Philip José Farmer 's Riverworld series are out .
They 're full of shirtlessness , cleavage and blue Alan Cumming .
Pop in your dreamgum , and check them out .
Ah , marketing — you certainly know how to get our attention , tie the boys up and we 're there , especially if it 's Tahmoh Penikett .
But all kidding aside , Riverworld is a huge undertaking for the Syfy channel .
It 's a wild story about the place we all end up after death , focused around a man separated from his fiancée and his struggle to get her back .
All with the help of other famous dead people , like Mark Twain .
It 's a fantastical epic , and it will be quite an adventure , if they can pull it off .
We 've got our fingers crossed .
Until its release in 2010 , here 's a new , and longer , synopsis .
official synopsis :
When American war zone journalist Matt Ellman ( Tahmoh Penikett , Battlestar Galactica ) and his fiancée , Jessie Machalan ( Laura Vandervoort , Smallville ) , are killed in an explosion , Matt awakens , separated from Jessie , on the banks of a river snaking endlessly across a mysterious new plane of existence .
On Riverworld , everyone who has ever lived on Earth , ever soul throughout time , has been reborn along the banks of a seemingly endless river .
Determined to locate Jessie , Matt aligns with Tomoe ( Jeananne Goossen , Falcon Beach ) , a 13th century female warrior , Allegra ( Romina D'Ugo , Hairspray ) , a 15th century courtesan of shifting alliances , and American novelist and Riverboat captain Samuel Clemens ( Mark Deklin , Justice ) , better known as Mark Twain .
With a full crew of adventurers , they embark upriver to understand where they are , why they are here , and to what unknowable end the river winds .
Under the guidance of the peculiar Caretaker ( Alan Cumming , Tin Man ) , their quest takes them below to a torturous Cavern of Souls and the Underworld prison , above in a Zeppelin piloted by a brilliant German engineer , and forward to cross paths with renowned explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton ( Peter Wingdfield , 24 ) who has joined forces with Francisco Pizzaro to conquer and destroy Riverworld .
For Matt , each unfathomable day , each nefarious encounter , only deepens the conundrum of Riverworld and raises more questions … What happened to Earth and when ?
What is the purpose of the burning Orb ?
What powers are contained in the infamous Dark Tower ?
And why is their every move being followed by the watchful eye of an alien being ?
The answers are waiting beyond the endless swells of Riverworld .
" Charting a territory somewhere between Gulliver 's Travels and The Lord of the Rings " ( Time ) , Philip Jose Farmer 's Nebula Award - winning saga becomes a spectacular miniseries event - a feast for the eyes , the mind , and the heart of everyone who longs to explore the meaning of life , the mysteries of death , and everything that lies between .
TALLINN , July 6 ( Reuters ) -
The world 's top cellphone maker Nokia NOK1V .HE said on Monday it was not working on introducing a phone running on Google 's GOOG .O Android operating system .
British daily
The Guardian said on Monday the Finnish mobile phone maker was understood by industry insiders to be developing a smartphone that runs on Google ’s Android software , to be introduced in September .
“ Absolutely no truth to this whatsoever , ” said a Nokia spokesman .
Google ’s Android is a rival to Nokia ’s Symbian software .
“ Everyone knows that Symbian is our preferred platform for advanced mobile devices . ”
Google ’s Android has got a lot of traction in the cellphone industry , with many vendors planning to introduce phones using it , but so far only a few Android phones have reached consumers .

But online , when creative affirmation finally arrives , it takes a very different form than it has in New York .
In the offline world , getting a “ big break ” is a matter of impressing a subjective intelligence , one person or a few people who look at work with an experienced eye and declare there ’s something to it .
Up until now , it has been intimate encouragement that has literally set the course of whole careers : a gallery offers a show , a record label dangles a contract , a prospective boss plucks one résumé from a sheaf , and a path forward is set .
Such moments of recognition , by individuals or small groups , have helped to decide not merely who succeeds but at what .
A nice note from a famous poet can cause an amorphously creative young person to throw the novels and screenplays overboard and take up verse for life .
Without intervention from The New Yorker , John Updike might well have been a cartoonist , James Thurber a journalist , William Shawn himself a composer .
On the Internet , however , it ’s not one single subjectivity but a popular hive - mind that decides .
The “ big break ” arrives when , with lightning speed and often to one ’s own surprise , the inscrutable pack decides to start forwarding one ’s content around .
Like the note from the poet , the viral blowup online is transformative : The Gregory Brothers , transplants to Brooklyn from Radford , Va. , are a serious soul band , but ever since the sudden success , this spring , of their deliriously funny YouTube series “ Auto - Tune the News ” ( which turns news footage of politicians and pundits into pop jams ) , they ’ve been devoting ever more time to keeping their hundreds of thousands of online fans entertained .
Talk to anyone who makes culture online and you ’ll often hear a similar story  of the first Web site that took off , or the video or the new meme successfully disseminated .
And so the move online changes how we make art , but the road ahead there is uncharted and perilous .
In the old model , young creatives dreamed of entertaining the millions , but in practice they could do so only by first pleasing a small group of gatekeepers : established figures who controlled access to the audience and , in doing so , protected young people from that audience , its obsessions and desertions , its adoration and its scorn .
These old hands had to worry about the numbers , of course , but they rationalized the upticks and downticks through a certain set of professional values , which they themselves spent years imbibing and which they in turn pressed upon their wards .
Online , though , the audience can be yours right away , direct and unmediated  if you can figure out how to find it and , what ’s harder , to keep it .
What to you is a big break is , to this increasingly sophisticated and fickle audience , just one forwarded e-mail message in a teeming inbox , to be refilled again tomorrow with a whole new slate of distractions .
“ Microcelebrity ” is now the rule , with respect not only to the size of one ’s fan base but also to the duration of its love .
Believe it or not , the Internet is a tougher town than New York ; fewer people make it here , but no one there seems to make it for long .

Strikes , hunger strikes and environmental action leading to clashes with riot police open week after weekend of state terror in Greece .
After the weekend of terror in Greece , the mid-summer week has started with a wave of strikes and environmental actions , underlining that the spine of the movement is too strong to break .
On Monday 13/7 trains across Greece came to a halt for 48h as a result of a rolling 3 - hour stoopage industrial action by railway workers .
At the same time workers at Wind , the mobile telecommunications giant , in Greece declared a 24h strike .
Workers of Wind and solidarity workers of other industrial sectors gathered outside the company 's HQ and blockaded its entrance on Tuesday 14/7 morning till the afternoon .
The same day the committee against harm , and the committee against exploitation in the village of Megali Panagia in Chalkidiki joined by scores of locals form the wider area built block houses along the forest roads leading to Scouries , the area that a big gold - mining company wants to transform into a wasteland with the support of the greek government which has recently passed a law that declares any opposition to the exploitation of minerals as treason .
The area has a long history of struggle against gold mines which peaked in the late 1990s with the titanic struggle of Olympiada villagers against TVX - Gold .
Meanwhile OTE , the National Telecomunication Company has sued the historical Athens Polytechnic for hosting athens indymedia in its server , alleging that this violates the conditions of its contract with OTE .
The Polytechnic has condemned the legal action as censorship in line with LAOS ( fascist party ) demands of gagging radical dissent to the regime .
The legal action was also condemned by the Coalition of Radical Left .
On Tuesday 14/7 protesters attacked the central OTE tower in Athens with black paint symbolising the information black out planned by its managers .
Many workers in the tower expressed their support to the action .
The same day locals of Grammaticos who are resisting the construction of an open refuse damp in their area , and clashed with riot police last week erecting barricades and torching company bulldozers organised a protest march towards the riot police blockade of the construction site .
The locals clashed with the police throwing stones and other projectiles , including a few molotov cocktails .
The battle lasted for about an hour and the locals suffered the extended use of tear gas and ' blast flash ' grenades .
In the prison front , Thodoris Iliopoulos started a hunger strike on the 10th of July 2009 .
Iliopoulos was arrested on the 18th of December 2008 in Akadimias street during a riot police sweeping operation in the context of the December Uprising .
He is held since the 22nd of December in the Court Prisons of Koridallos accused for 3 crimes with no witnesses other than policement .
Iliopoulos denies all charges against him , and has launched a long campaign to prove his innocence .
On the 8th of July his petition for release until his trial was waived by judges , being the only arrested from the December Uprising to be still held hostage .
On beginning his hunger strike Iliopoulos declared : " In go on hunger strike .
It is the only means remaining to me as a hostage on order to cry out the truth and denounce the terrible injustice .
To denounce the hatred and the empathy of ' justice ' mechanisms .
To denounce the arbitrariness and the violence of a ' justice ' which is blind indeed , the its even more ' blind ' functionaries " .
In solidarity the convict Nicos Tsouvalakis has also started a hunger strike demanding the release of Iliopoulos and in protest to the dehumanising prison conditions .
As of Monday 13 of July the inmates of the First Wing of Koridallos Prison , the central prison of the country in Athens , declared that they abstain from the prison kitchen ration .
Meanwhile 19 Pakistani asylum seekers held in the police station of Glyfada , south Athens , are in their fourth day of hunger strike in protest to the agreement of the ministry of Public Order and the Pakistani Embassy to repatriate them .
The asylum seekers claim that their life is in danger if they return to Pakistan .
The rise of Twitter and other microblogging systems with constrained character counts has led to renewed interest in Web services that shorten URLs .
Support for these services is often integrated into desktop client applications so that users can take advantage of the functionality without having to open a browser window .
Most desktop clients , however , make users jump through a few extra hoops in order to shorten a URL .
For example , Seesmic makes users click a toolbar button and then paste the link into a popup dialog .
Gwibber , my microblogging client for Linux , avoids the extra step by automatically shortening URLs when they are pasted directly into the message textbox .
This seems to be a popular feature and I 've been asked to explain how it works on several occasions .
In this tutorial , I 'll show you how to intercept and manipulate text as it is being pasted into a GTK + textbox .
My first instinct when I started implementing this feature was to use the GTK +
entry widget 's paste - clipboard signal , which is emitted when the user pastes content into a text entry field .
The callback function would extract text from the clipboard using something like gtk .
Clipboard ().wait_for_text ( ) , detect if its a URL , and then act accordingly .
There are a few problems with this approach , but the most significant issue is that the paste - clipboard signal does n't get emitted when the user pastes from the selection clipboard .
It will detect a standard ctrl+v operation , but not a middle - click paste .
In practice , it 's actually easier to intercept paste events in a GTK + entry widget by trapping the insert - text signal .
It will work consistently regardless of how the user puts content into the textbox .
Another advantage of using insert - text is that it eliminates the need to manually extract the text content from the clipboard because it provides a string with the inserted text as a parameter to the callback function .
The following example shows how to bind a callback to the signal and print the intercepted text to the console :
import gtk w = gtk.
Window ( ) w.connect ( " destroy " , gtk.main_quit ) def on_insert_text ( entry , text , tlen , pos ) : print text e = gtk .
Entry ( ) e.connect ( " insert- text " , on_insert_text ) w.add(e ) w.show_all ( ) gtk.main ( )
Now that we can get the text as it is being inserted into the entry , the rest is easy .
We need to analyze the text to determine if it is a URL .
For the purposes of our demo , we can do this with a regular expression :
re.match ( " ^https ?://[^ ]+ " , text )
Note that we include the " s ? " to make sure we properly handle https URLs in addition to conventional http URLs .
Before we shorten the URL , we will also need to check the length to make sure that it really needs shortening .
If it 's less than 20 characters , then we can just let it go through as - is .
We can do that with the third callback parameter , which contains the length of the inserted string .
def on_insert_text ( entry , text , tlen , pos ) : if re.match ( " ^https ?://[^ ]+ " , text ) and tlen > 20 : # shorten the URL
There are a multitude of different shortening services and each one has its own distinct API .
I tend to favor is.gd , because it 's got particularly short URLs and it's API is very easy to use .
All we have to do is call is.gd / api.php and pass the full URL as the value of the longurl key and it will spit back out a shortened version :
apiurl = " http://is.gd/api.php? " + urllib.urlencode(dict(longurl=text ) ) shorturl = urllib2.urlopen(apiurl ).read ( )
We have to use urllib.urlencode on the full URL so that is .gd can handle it properly .
Then we use urllib2.urlopen to request the shortened version from is.gd .
It will return the shortened text in the body of the response , so we can pull it out with the read ( ) method .
The next step is inserting the shortened URL into the textbox after we have retrieved it .
To do that , we use the gtk .
Editable .insert_text method .
The Editable . insert_text method requires two arguments : the text to insert and the position at which to insert it .
We want to insert it at the current position .
The insert - text callback provides the position as a parameter , but unfortunately the Python bindings do n't handle it properly .
It 's stored in a gpointer which makes it a bit of a pain to get the data out .
Instead of using that callback parameter , we can just use the Editable .
get_position method .
def on_insert_text ( entry , text , tlen , pos ) : if re.match ( " ^https ?://[^ ]+ " , text ) and tlen > 20 : apiurl = " http://is.gd/api.php? " + urllib.urlencode(dict(longurl=text ) ) shorturl = urllib2.urlopen(apiurl ).read ( ) entry.insert_text(shorturl , entry.get_position ( ) )
This works , but it also insert the original URL and not just the shortened version .
In order to prevent the insert - text signal from completing and inserting the originally pasted text , we have to kill the signal emission .
You can do this with the stop_emission method .
entry.stop_emission (" insert-text " )
Now the only other problem with our example implementation of this feature is that the text cursor remains at the point where the text is inserted .
This is inconsistent with how text pasting is generally supposed to work .
The program needs to move the text cursor position to the end of the short URL in the entry after it is inserted .
This is done with Editable .
set_position , but it does n't work if you do it during the insert - text signal handler .
To make it work , we can just use gobject .
idle_add to make it run when the signal handler is finished and returns control back over to the GTK + main loop .
gobject.idle_add(entry.set_position , entry.get_position ( ) + len( shorturl ) )
The following is the full code of the example :
import gtk , gobject import urllib , urllib2 , json , re w = gtk .
Window ( ) w.connect ( " destroy " , gtk.main_quit ) def on_insert_text ( entry , text , tlen , pos ) : if re.match ( " ^https ?://[^ ]+ " , text ) and tlen > 20 : apiurl = " http://is.gd/api.php? " + urllib.urlencode(dict(longurl=text ) ) shorturl = urllib2.urlopen(apiurl ).read ( ) entry.insert_text(shorturl , entry.get_position ( ) ) gobject.idle_add(entry.set_position , entry.get_position ( ) + len( shorturl ) ) entry.stop_emission (" insert-text " ) e = gtk.
Entry ( ) e.connect ( " insert- text " , on_insert_text ) w.add(e ) w.show_all ( ) gtk.main ( )
This is a pretty simple implementation and there are a lot of ways that it could be embellished to make it more functional .
For example , you could add support for rev=canonical shortening so that it will automatically use the site operator 's preferred short URL instead of is .gd in cases where one is specified .
It would also be wise to add proper error handling , like a try / except block that will cause the original full URL to be inserted in the event that the URL shortening service fails .
Humans have been aggressively transforming the planet for more than 200 years .
The Nobel Prize–winning atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen — one of the first cheerleaders for investigating the gas - the - planet strategy — recently argued that geologists should refer to the past two centuries as the “ anthropocene ” period .
In that time , humans have reshaped about half of the Earth ’s surface .
We have dictated what plants grow and where .
We ’ve pocked and deformed the Earth ’s crust with mines and wells , and we ’ve commandeered a huge fraction of its freshwater supply for our own purposes .
What is new is the idea that we might want to deform the Earth intentionally , as a way to engineer the planet either back into its pre-industrial state , or into some improved third state .
Large - scale projects that aim to accomplish this go by the name “ geo- engineering , ” and they constitute some of the most innovative and dangerous ideas being considered today to combat climate change .
Some scientists see geo-engineering as a last - ditch option to prevent us from cooking the planet to death .
Others fear that it could have unforeseen — and possibly catastrophic — consequences .
What many agree on , however , is that the technology necessary to reshape the climate is so powerful , and so easily implemented , that the world must decide how to govern its use before the wrong nation — or even the wrong individual — starts to change the climate all on its own .
I f geo-engineers have a natural enemy , it is the sun .
Their first impulse is to try to block it out .
Stephen Salter , a Scottish engineer , has mocked up a strategy that would cool the planet by painting the skies above the oceans white .
Salter ’s designs — based on an idea developed by John Latham at the National Center for Atmospheric Research — call for a permanent fleet of up to 1,500 ships dragging propellers that churn up seawater and spray it high enough for the wind to carry it into the clouds .
The spray would add moisture to the clouds and make them whiter and fluffier , and therefore better at bouncing sunlight back harmlessly into space .
Salter , who has investigated the technical feasibility of this idea minutely ( down to the question of whether ship owners would mind affixing spray nozzles to their hulls with magnets ) , estimates the cost to build the first 300 ships — enough to turn back the climatological clock to James Watt ’s era —to be $ 600 million , plus another $ 100 million per year to keep the project going .
Roger Angel , an astronomy and optics professor at the University of Arizona , would block the sun by building a giant visor in space .
He proposes constructing 20 electromagnetic guns , each more than a mile long and positioned at high altitudes , that would shoot Frisbee - size ceramic disks .
Each gun would launch 800,000 disks every five minutes — day and night , weekends and holidays — for 10 years .
The guns would aim at the gravitational midpoint between the Earth and the sun , so that the disks would hang in space , providing a huge array of sunshades that would block and scatter sunlight and put the Earth in a permanent state of annular eclipse .
Angel ’s scheme relies on launch technology that does n’t yet exist ( no one has ever wanted to shoot Frisbees at the sun before ) , and would cost several trillion dollars .
“ I know it sounds like mad science , ” he says .
“ But unfortunately we have a mad planet . ”
The Marine Corps Four - Star General James N. Mattis currently serves as NATO ’s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation and also as commander , U.S. Joint Forces Command — titles that were surely announced in a PowerPoint presentation somewhere .
More accessibly , from what I can tell by bouncing around the Web , he will be depicted by Harrison Ford in the forthcoming movie “ No True Glory : The Battle For Fallujah , ” which may be released later this year , based on the book by former - Marine - turned - journalist Bing West .
Mattis is not a tall man , and his grey hair is trimmed tightly ; his ears protrude a little , in a manner pioneered by President Obama and , before him , Mr. Spock .
He speaks in a blunt and unvarnished fashion not typical of general officers on staff assignments at the Pentagon .
Mattis is an important intellectual ally of U.S. Army General David Petraeus , the champion of counterinsurgency doctrine , which has migrated from the fringes of U.S. military thinking to dominance .
Within that field these days , a hot topic is what is generally referred to as “ hybrid warfare , ” meaning conflicts where U.S. forces and their opponents may have to move seamlessly in the same theatre and even on the same day among counterterrorism operations , humanitarian - relief efforts , and formal artillery duels .
The term first sprang up within U.S. military circles to describe the lessons of Israel ’s unsuccessful contest with Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 .
Since then , as an idea , it has taken on a life of its own , aided by the very nature of its hybridness — that is , it is a phrase that can be used to describe many different things at once .
At the Center for Strategic and International Studies today , Mattis turned up to give an address as part of a series of meetings C.S.I.S. has organized to support the Obama Pentagon ’s Quadrennial Defense Review , a strategy document due in the next several months .
Today ’s subject was irregular warfare , and I was there to talk on a panel following Mattis ’s speech .
He began by observing that the worldwide conventional military superiority enjoyed by the United States had caused its opponents to migrate into irregular formations , embedding and dispersing themselves in civilian populations , and innovating in media strategy .
“ We should n’t be offended ” by this evolution , he said ; it is part of the natural way that people who wage war adapt to avoid their opponent ’s strengths .
In describing the recent intellectual history of Pentagon thinking about irregular war , Mattis cited Bosnia , Chechnya , Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon in 2006 , and the events in Georgia and South Ossetia last summer .
“ The signposts have come into focus , ” he said .
“ We ’re seeing a lot of those signposts right now . ”
With its vast conventional military superiority in the air , on the open seas , and in conventional tank and artillery war , the challenge facing the U.S. military , Mattis argued , is that “ we must avoid being dominant and irrelevant . ”
He observed that the United States lacks a Grand Strategy for the world it confronts today , although he conceded , “ It ’s hard to write a grand strategy when your house is on fire . ”
Without mentioning the name of Donald Rumsfeld , he explained that Pentagon thinkers had recently overestimated the potential of technological solutions .
“ We engaged in some wishful thinking , ” he said .
He continued , “ We have to diminish the idea that technology is going to change warfare … War is primarily a human endeavor . ”
On today ’s battlefield , linked technologies are so pervasive that soldiers conducting routine patrols are in constant real - time audio — and sometimes video — contact with their superiors , who watch over operations as they occur , with lawyers and civilian policymakers sometimes at their sides , issuing orders and advice from afar .
The advantage of these all - seeing systems is that they can ensure that violent operations are carefully reviewed and calibrated before they occur .
Mattis , however , clearly thinks that these systems are depriving soldiers , noncommissioned officers , and junior officers of the independence and initiative they need to operate effectively in places like Afghanistan .
He said that when he served as a young officer in Europe during the Cold War , he and his colleagues knew they could not turn on their radios during prospective combat because the Soviets would immediately be able to identify their position and attack .
They would have to operate on their own , in silence .
“ We have not turned off a radio once in the last eight years of operations , ” he went on .
“ We may have raised a generation of young soldiers who may have learned all the wrong lessons . ”
Mattis said he is “ not a Luddite ” but , in fact , his reading of how pervasive networked technology will play out in the future , even in relatively unplugged environments like Western Pakistan , may nonetheless be tinged with some old - school nostalgia .
Once this sort of technology is established , it is hard to reduce its effects on perception and culture .
In the suburbs a generation ago , for example , we went off on our bicycles , built our secret forts , threw around our rocks and sticks , and carried from parental authority vague directions to be home by sunset — but we were secure in the knowledge that we might be difficult to find if we strayed .
Today parenting is like those Nextel commercials — no stray thought or anxiety passes without a cell - phone or messaging check .
So it is on the battlefield .
“ That ’s no longer going to work , ” Mattis argued .
He quoted Petraeus as saying that the U.S. military must “ decentralize to the point of discomfort … Technical systems will come under attack and will go down . ”
When they do , only “ commander ’s intent ” will be there to guide soldiers and officers in the field .
His emphasis on a better educated , more articulate , more independent soldier trained to handle such circumstances is hard to dislike .
Whether the Pentagon can actually create such a force seems another matter .
Mattis called for civilian leaders to take responsibility for the prospective quality of the all - volunteer military .
He also trotted out a line I ’d heard before , but have not stopped enjoying : “ I do n’t write policy ; I just execute the last six hundred meters of it . ”
I did n’t even need to fight , the administration blinked and showed it ’s cards , actually they showed that they have no cards to play , as they immediately revoked the order for major Cook .
You can see below , the revocation is below , saying he does n’t need to go .
What does it mean ?
It ’s proof that we have a totally illegitimate commander in chief and they will cave in each and every situation .
It means that from now on any member of the military , who does n’t like any order , needs to call Dr. Taitz , ESQ and state that he does n’t want to follow the order , a legal action will be initiated based on Obama ’s illegitimacy in office and the military will cave in .
It means that for the sake of covering up for Obama and fraud perpetrated , top brass of the US military is willing to undermine integrity of the military .
This has to stop .

THE FOLLOWING ORDER IS REVOKED OR RESCINDED AS SHOWN .
ACTION : REVOKE
Comments
The Senate Health and Social Services committee released the bill Wednesday after a 90 - minute hearing in which no one spoke against it .
Sen. Margaret Rose
Henry , the chief sponsor , said amendments to clarify language in the bill will be drafted before it is brought up for a vote by the full Senate .
Anyone seeking to use medical marijuana would be required to submit written certification from a medical practitioner licensed to prescribe drugs that it likely would provide therapeutic benefit .
The patient , or a designated caregiver , would then receive an identification card permitting him or her to grow marijuana or purchase it from state - regulated , nonprofit " compassion centers . "
The measure , based on model legislation developed by the Washington , D.C. - based Marijuana Policy Project , would allow a qualifying patient or caregiver to possess up to 12 marijuana plants and up to six ounces of usable marijuana .
Supporters said that amount is less than what the federal government has determined would be a one - month supply for patients in an investigational drug program .
Noah Mamber , legislative analyst with the Marijuana Policy Project , said 13 states currently have medical marijuana laws , and the legislation is pending in a handful of others .
The Medical Society of Delaware has decided not to take a position on the bill , according to Robert Byrd , a lobbyist for the organization .
Byrd said members of the society 's legislative committee discussed the bill Monday , and there were " very strong feelings " on both sides of the issue .
Sen .
Patricia
Blevins expressed concern that if the list of conditions eligible for treatment with medical marijuana is too broad , the bill could face difficulty passing muster with lawmakers and law enforcement officials .
" We may have difficulty in getting the necessary relief to the people who need it , " said Blevins , D - Elsmere .
But Henry , D - Wilmington , responded that " pain is a relative thing , " and that she was wary of narrowly limiting the conditions for which medical marijuana might be useful .
" We do n't know what will always help and benefit a person , " she said .

The second - quarter earnings results for Goldman Sachs were supposed to be enormous , but this is beyond enormous : a $ 3.44 billion profit in the past three months alone .
The New York investment bank 's trading arm nearly doubled its revenues in the quarter .
Profits were way beyond the bullish expectations of analysts .
So soon after receiving government bailout funding , Goldman is raking in megabucks .
How to explain it ?
Conspiracy theories abound , but here 's one indisputable reason : Competition is down , and most other competing banks and funds that survived the past year have nothing like Goldman 's $ 254 billion in capital to work with .
Plus , the markets cooperated almost across the board :
The firm that Main Street loves to hate made money in credit products , interest rates , currencies , equities and commodities .
Commercial mortgage loans produced a $ 700 million loss , but obviously that was offset many times over by the success trading other financial products .
Just call it " favorable market opportunities " -- that 's what the bank is calling it as it lives up to its nickname of " Goldmine " Sachs .
On Saturday , I posted this chart and wondered why “ Some people were calling for a housing bottom . ”
That generated a ton of emails asking about for further clarification .
The people I referred to were the usual happy talk TV suspects ( i.e. , Cramer ) who have been perpetually wrong about Housing for nigh on 3 years .
I not only disagree with them , but do n’t respect their opinion — essentially headline reading gut instinct big - money - losers .
No thanks .
Then there were the slew of MSM who insist each month on reporting that 3 % (+/- 11 % ) is a positive integer .
We disposed of that silliness on Friday .
But the crux of the email was over this post .
There are a handful of people whom I disagree with , but nonetheless have a great deal of respect for their methodology and process .
Over the past year , these have included Doug Kass and Lakshman Achuthan and Bill of Calculated Risk .
We may reach different conclusions about a given issue , or disagree on timing , but these are the folks whose opinions force me to sharpen my own .
When I tossed up that chart yesterday , I had not yet seen Bill ’s comments on the subject ( McCartney ! ) but he is one of those people I can respectfully disagree with .
We simply have reached different conclusions about the timing and shape of the eventual Housing lows .
There are a plethora of reasons why I believe we are nowhere near a bottom in Housing prices or activity .
Here are a few :
• Prices :
By just about every measure , Home prices on a national basis remain elevated .
They are now far off their highs , but are still remain about ~ 15 % above their historic metrics .
I expect prices will continue lower for the next 2 - 4 quarters , if not longer , and wo n’t see widespread Real increases for many years after that ;
Indeed , I do n’t expect to see nominal increases for anytime soon ; • Mean Reversion :
As prices revert back towards historical means , there is the very high probability that they will careen past the median .
This is the pattern we see after extended periods of mispricing .
Nearly all overpriced asset classes revert not merely to their historic trend line , but typically collapse far below them .
I have no reason to believe Housing will be any different ; • Employment & Wages :
The rate of Unemployment is very likely to continue to rise for the next 4 - 8 quarters , if not longer .
This removes an increasing number of people from the total pool of potential home buyers .
There is another issue —
Wages , and they have been flat for the past decade ( negative in Real terms ) , crimping the potential for families to trade up to larger houses — a big source of Real Estate activity .
Plus , more unemployment means more . . . • Foreclosures :
We likely have not seen the peak in defaults , delinquencies and foreclosures .
Many more foreclosures — which are healthy in the long run but wrenching during the process of dislocation — are very likely .
These will pressure prices yet lower .
And Loan Mods are not working — they are redefaulting in less than a year between 50 - 80 % , depending upon the mod conditions themselves .
•
Inventory :
There is a substantial supply of “ Shadow Inventory ” out there which will postpone a recovery in Home prices for a significant period of time .
These are the flippers , speculators , builders and financers that are sitting with properties that they do not want to bring back to market yet .
Given the extent of the speculative activity during the boom years ( 2002 - 06 ) , and the number of foreclosures so far , my back of the envelope estimates are there are anywhere from 1.5 million to as many as 3 million additional homes that could come to market if prices were more advantageous .
• Psychology :
The investing and home owning public are shell shocked following the twin market crashes and the Housing collapse .
First the dot com collapse ( 2000 - 03 ) saw the Nasdaq drop about 80 % , then the Credit Crisis of 2008 saw the unprecedented near halving of the market in about a year .
Last , Homes nationally have lost about a third of their value since the 2005 - 06 peak .
Total losses to the family balance sheet of these three events are about $ 25 trillion dollars .
These losses not only crimp the ability to make bigger purchases , it dramatically curtails the willingness to take on more debt and leverage .
Speaking of which . .. • Debt Service / Down Payment : Far too many Americans do not have 20 % to put down on a home , have poor credit scores , and way too much debt .
All of these things act as an impediment to buying a home .
At the same time , to get approved for a mortgage , banks are tightening standards , including 1 ) requiring higher Loan to Values for purchases ; 2 ) better credit scores to get approved for a mortgages ;
3 ) Lower levels of overall debt servicing relative to income for applicants .
Yes , the NAR Home Affordability Index shows houses as “ more affordable , ” but it conveniently ignores these real world factors .
Deleveraging :
For the first time in decades , the American consumer is in the process of saving money and deleveraging their balance sheets .
After a 40 year credit binge , its long overdue .
The process is likely to go on for years , as a new generation is losing confidence in the stock market , Corporate America and their government .
Think back to the post - Depression generation that were big savers , modest consumers , who eschewed credit and borrowing .
The damage is going to take a while to repair .
There are more reasons I expect the Real Estate market to remain punk for many years , but these are a good place to start when considering the question .
The Housing Boom & Bust , and the 2002 - 07 credit bubble created massive excesses .
More than anything , it is going to take time to resolve them .

One last element that is so obvious I forgot to include it : Zero % Interest Rates .
As many of you have written , when rates are this low , they only have one direction to go : Up .

The result , North Korea Uncovered , is one of the most detailed maps of North Korea available to the public today .
The small file , which can be installed on top of Google Earth , has been downloaded more than 47,000 times since an updated version was released last month .
" We have portrayed things about which they are most proud and ashamed , " Melvin said in an email interview .
Among the most notable findings is the site of mass graves created in the 1990s following a famine that the UN estimates killed about 2 million people .
" Graves cover entire mountains , " Melvin said .
Also visible is the stark contrast between the living conditions of North Korea 's elite and the general population .
The palaces housing dictator Kim Jong
Il and his inner circle , clearly shown on the maps , contain Olympic - size swimming pools with giant waterslides and golf courses .
Conversely , much of North Korea 's population is reliant on foreign food aid , ironic given the authoritarian regime is built around the ideology of self - reliance .
Analysing the satellite maps allowed Melvin to plot the country 's transport and electricity network , revealing that many towns have no power supply at all .
Melvin and his team also believe they have discovered the Vinalon complex that has been connected with chemical warfare experiments .
The project highlights the collaborative power of the internet , which allows disparate groups of amateur sleuths to work together to uncover state secrets and shine new light on previously hidden countries .
North Korea is of particular interest to diplomats , analysts and the public of late because the communist regime has ramped up its nuclear tests , launched a series of short - range missiles and threatened possible attacks on South Korea .
Melvin said he notified two North Korean embassies of his project but received no response .
" This project is a terrific record of their ' revolution ' so I would love to have more of their input for historical purposes , " he said Melvin , who began the project as a way of mapping places in North Korea that he had visited , said he pored over books , maps , pictures and news reports to identify locations on the Google satellite map .
But he received significant help from collaborators , some of whom have studied North Korea professionally .
For instance , The Wall Street Journal reported that Joshua Stanton , a Washington attorney who has served in the US military in South Korea , identified one of the country 's most notorious prisons , Camp 16 , by combing the map for structures identified in sketches created by defectors .
A US senator then used Stanton 's information to criticise North Korea 's human rights record , saying " Google has made a witness of all of us ... we can no longer deny these things exist " .
North Korea 's own publicity of the movements of Kim Jong
Il have also been invaluable to Melvin .
Media reports from the country allowed him to identify locations the dictator has visited , such as a hydroelectric dam and power station he toured in April .
One of the headlines from the Fed 's Flow of Funds report this morning was that household percent equity had fallen to a record low 41.4 % .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows homeowner percent equity since 1952 .
This is a simple calculation : divide home mortgages ( $ 10,464 billion ) by household real estate assets ( $ 17,870 billion ) gives us the percent mortgage debt ( 58.6 % ) .
Subtract from one gives us the percent homeowner equity ( 41.4 % ) .
But what does this tell us ?
What we really want to know is the percent equity for homeowners with mortgages .
According to the Census Bureau , 31.6 % of all U.S. owner occupied homes had no mortgage in 2007 ( most recent data ) .
These homeowners tend to be older , or more risk adverse , and few of them will probably borrow from their home equity .
You can't do a direct subtraction because the value of these paid - off homes is , on average , lower than the mortgaged 68.4 % .
But we can construct a model based on data from the 2007 American Community Survey .
Note : See data at bottom of this post .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the distribution of U.S. households by the value of their home , with and without a mortgage .
This data is for 2007 .
By using the mid-points of each range , and solving for the price of the highest range to match the then Fed 's estimate of household real estate assets at the end of 2007 : $ 20.5 Trillion , we can estimate the total dollar value of houses with and without mortgages .
Using this method , the total value of U.S. houses , at the end of 2007 , with mortgages was $ 15.1 Trillion or 73.6 % of the total .
The value of houses without mortgages was $ 5.4 Trillion or 26.4 % of the total U.S. household real estate .
Assuming 73.6 % of current total assets is for households with mortgages ( so $ 13.2 trillion of $ 17.87 trillion total ) , and since all of the mortgage debt ( $ 10.464 trillion ) is from the households with mortgages , these homes have an average of 20.4 % equity .
It 's important to remember this includes some homes with 90 % equity , and millions of homes with zero or negative equity .
Data from 2007 American Community Survey :
United States Estimate Margin of Error Total : 75,515,104 +/-227,236
With a mortgage : 51,615,003 +/-152,731 Less than $ 50,000 2,037,849 +/-21,748 $ 50,000 to $ 99,999 6,443,236 +/-45,023 $ 100,000 to $ 149,999 8,023,775 +/-48,465 $ 150,000 to $ 199,999

That 's because according to NPD , in June , 91 percent of the market for computers that cost over $ 1000 belonged to Apple .

Sure , it helps that Apple only sells two computers under $ 1000 — the white MacBook and Mac mini — so if you get a Mac , it 's probably going to cost over a grand .
In fact , the average selling price of a Mac is $ 1400 .
But , consider that Apple claimed just 66 percent of the $ 1000 + market in the first three months of 2008 , and 88 percent in May of this year .
It also means that people just are n't buying super tricked - out PCs — which is something Microsoft courted with its Laptop Hunters ads , showing how cheap PCs were compared to Macs .
To wit , the average selling price of all PCs in June was precisely half that of Mac : $ 700 .
( For Windows notebooks , sans netbooks , the average selling price was $ 569 . )
Which suggests there are way more Laurens than Giampaolos in the world .

Update :
It should be noted , however , that these numbers are for retail — not for business purchases or PCs people built themselves .
Of course , I would definitely prefer far more Laurens .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
It ’s back to “ Futurama ” for fans of the animated series .

Taking a page from the “ Family Guy ” resurrection guidebook , the canceled Fox animated comedy is returning with an order from Comedy Central for 26 new episodes to run over two seasons .
“ Futurama ” creators Matt Groening and David X. Cohen already are working on stories for the new batch of episodes of the sci- fi cartoon , slated to premiere on Comedy Central in mid-2010 .
Just as with “ Family Guy , ” whose improbable return was triggered by big DVD sales and solid ratings for the show ’s reruns on Cartoon Network , the performance of “ Futurama ’s ” repeats on Comedy Central and on DVD was key to its resurrection .
The 26 - episode order from Comedy Central was preceded by four feature - length original “ Futurama ” specials : “ Bender ’s Big Score , ” “ The Beast With a Billion Backs , ” “ Bender ’s Game ” and “ Into the Wild Green Yonder , ” which have done well on DVD and on Comedy Central .
( The most recent special , “ Yonder , ” premieres on Comedy Central in September . )
Comedy Central was happy with the specials and with the 72 produced episodes of “ Futurama ” it acquired from 20th Century Fox TV in 2006 .
“ Yet there is nothing like new , self - contained episodes week to week , ” said Comedy Central ’s senior vice president programing David Bernath .
“ This is all about reinvigorating the franchise , giving it a new burst of energy . ”
“ Futurama , ” which aired on Fox for five seasons ( from 1999 to 2003 ) centers on Philip Fry ( Billy West ) , a 25 - year - old pizza delivery boy who accidentally freezes himself on December 31 , 1999 , and wakes up 1,000 years later with a fresh start at life and a “ diverse ” new group of friends including Leela ( Katey Sagal ) , a tough but lovely one - eyed alien , and Bender ( John DiMaggio ) , a robot who possesses human characteristics and flaws .
When the series returns with original episodes in 2010 , it will be seven years after the show ’s last original episode aired on Fox .
That ’s a much longer hiatus than the three years “ Family Guy ” spent on the bench before being summoned back by Fox .
The four “ Futurama ” specials , produced in the past two and a half years , helped bridged the gap , said Groening , who also created the Fox / 20th TV long - running animated comedy “ The Simpsons . ”
“ It was a great way of keeping the show alive , and one of the great things was that everyone enjoyed doing them , so it ’s been relatively easy trying to get everyone who was originally on the show to come back , ” he said .
All key voice cast members are expected to return for the new original episodes of “ Futurama , ” along with the series ’ core writing team .
Storyline - wise , the new episodes will pick up where the most recent DVD special , “ Yonder , ” took off -- with the main characters fleeing death and flying into the unknown .
But after four epic - in - scope feature - length films , “ what we will try to do is go a little bit back to pure comedy , characters and sci-fi , ” Cohen said .

In a report that ’s sure to surprise absolutely nobody , The New York Times revealed on Saturday that former Vice President Dick Cheney explicitly ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to keep a “ counterterrorism program ” — of an as - yet - unknown nature — secret from Congress .
The program reportedly existed for eight years .
The New York Times :
The report that Mr. Cheney was behind the decision to conceal the still - unidentified program from Congress deepened the mystery surrounding it , suggesting that the Bush administration had put a high priority on the program and its secrecy .
Mr. Panetta , who ended the program when he first learned of its existence from subordinates on June 23 , briefed the two intelligence committees about it in separate closed sessions the next day .
Efforts to reach Mr. Cheney through relatives and associates were unsuccessful .
[ …]
The law requires the president to make sure the intelligence committees “ are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States , including any significant anticipated intelligence activity . ”
But the language of the statute , the amended National Security Act of 1947 , leaves some leeway for judgment , saying such briefings should be done “ to the extent consistent with due regard for the protection from unauthorized disclosure of classified information relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods or other exceptionally sensitive matters . ”

DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is preparing an effort to gain market share while its two main rivals are bogged down in bankruptcy and restructuring .
Ford , the only one of Detroit 's Big Three that did n't need a bailout from the federal government , plans to increase production of cars and trucks in the third quarter by about 10 % from the level of a year ago , a company official said .
It will be Ford 's first significant production increase in almost two years .
In contrast , General Motors Corp. , which is expected to file for Chapter 11 protection Monday , and Chrysler LLC , which is nearing the end of its bankruptcy reorganization , are planning to shut down their plants for nearly all of the third quarter .
The difference in production plans will give Ford a chance to push sales through the prime summer selling months while GM and Chrysler focus on their internal issues .
" This is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to separate us from our other domestic competitors , " said a person familiar with the matter at Ford .
" No one is going to gift - wrap it for us .
You have to deliver the product people want to buy .
That said , you have to take this historic opportunity to grab market share . "
Ford has seen a gain in retail market share in six of the past seven months and expects to see another boost when May auto sales are reported Tuesday .
As of April 30 , Ford 's U.S. market share was 13 % , according to the company .
The Air Force 's geek squad wants the technology to monitor government employees ' deviant online behavior .
And they want you to build it .
Today , the Air Force issued a call for proposals from small businesses , with this objective : " Define , develop , and demonstrate innovative approaches for determining ' good ' ( approved ) versus ' bad ' ( disallowed / subversive ) activities , including insiders and / or malware . "
But taboo activity could span everything from leaking top secret information to spamming contacts with a chain letter to visiting any site that government officials deem dubious .
Previously , they 've said some interesting things about social networking , which may or may not influence what they 'd do with new tools .
Now , those tools are a ways away .
Current methods to detect insider breaches of cyber security " only address the most blatant violations of policy or the grossest deviations from accepted behavior , " according to the Air Force request .
The cyber security system works mostly by rejecting certain predefined digital signatures at the borders of the network .
But , as the Air Force request pointed out , people with inside access are more familiar with the security system and best know how to thwart it .
Not everyone who jeopardizes security does it intentionally .
The Air Force also wants the algorithm to flag unwitting security breaches like opening an infected site during research .
Get cracking if you want to help root out the deviants .
The technology needs to be ready to test nine months from now , and you 'll be compensated up to $ 100,000 for your troubles .

[ Hey , this is Adam The Amateur Gourmet .
I ’m on vacation in Barcelona , Spain and while I ’m gone I ’ve asked some awesome people to fill in for me .
Today we continue talented female filmmaker day with another talented female filmmaker , Ms. Dara Bratt .
( Check out her film , “ In Vivid Detail . ” )
Dara is n’t just a talented filmmaker , she ’s also an excellent cook–see here –but this post , I have to confess , has me a little worried .
Take it away , Dara ! ]
What I ’m about to share may shock you , some will be repulsed , others curious or even amused .
Nothing beats a hot summer day like frozen pickle juice .
Ever since Adam asked me to contribute to his blog while he was away , I began agonizing over what I would write about .
I hummed and hawed – should I review a restaurant , cook a meal ?
And then I heard my mom ’s recent advice in my head : “ it ’s never too late to follow your dreams ” .
Although I love desserts , I also love salty sour foods .
If I ’m not drinking wine , then it will be a dirty martini in hand , or a bloody mary , or the yummy bloody casear ( only available in Canada and made with clam juice . )
I ’m no cosmo girl and you ’ll never see me with a manhattan .
So it ’s not that surprising that when I was ten , along with the help from mom , I decided to take pickle juice straight from the jar , and make popsicles .
I named my creation : “ Pickle Spiced Ice . ”
Yes , pickle popsicles .
And they were good .
And today , over 20 years later , I ’ve decided to do it again and see if they still hold up over time .
Now I grew up with pickles .
No family holiday dinner was complete without them .
My great uncle Max made his own batch in his backyard .
I lived in the neighborhood where the owners of Mrs Whites pickles would give them out on Halloween in single serving sealed containers .
The line for that house would get so long that they implemented a rule of one jar per tricker - treater .
( Some of us would change costumes and go back for seconds ) .
I ’m not going to lie , if you do n’t like pickles , this may not be your cup of tea .
For this adventure , I enlisted my good friend Laura .
First , we needed to find the best pickles .
Normally , I maintain loyalty to Gus’ Pickles , established in 1910 in the Lower East Side .
But not wanting to leave my neighborhood , I decided to try the farmer ’s market on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope .
Tip 1 : Pickles on store shelves are vacuum packed to last five years .
They often contain sugar and other preservatives to keep them fresh .
The best pickles are the ones out of the barrel ( fermented in brine ) that will last about 6wks in the fridge .
2 : The small Kirby is the best cucumber for pickling .
The bigger the cucumber , the bigger the seeds , which can lead to an overripe mushy end product .
Next we went to my favorite neighborhood wine store to find the perfect pairing .
What ’s the point of a food adventure without some wine ?
My request was met with a long pause of silence , the sales man eventually recommended Gruner , “ a wine that goes with weird food , like asparagus . ”
Back in the kitchen , we poured the brine from half sours and full sours into the molds .
We squeezed some juice out of the pickles and then we added Perrier to a select few for variation .
In addition to the popsicle molds , I filled an ice - cube tray with the mixture , then covered it with saran wrap so that the toothpicks could stay standing as I pierced through the plastic .
And then we waited .
Facts :
Did you know that a pickle has more vitamin C than an orange ?
Pickle juice is an Easter European favorite for the morning after a hard night of hitting the bottle ?
Shakespeare was the first to use it in a sentence : “ How cam ’st thou in this pickle ? ” and “ I have been in such a pickle ” ?
3 hours later and still slushy pickles force me to call it a night .
I reconvened the next evening with my friend Kim , the willing taster .
To accompany the popsicles , I prepared an arrangement of foods I thought would be well matched : homemade gazpacho ( red and yellow tomatoes , celery , red pepper , jalapeno , cucumber , red onion , lime juice , olive oil , sherry wine vinegar , Worchester sauce , hot sauce , cilantro , s&p ) , egg salad ( cage free eggs , dill , celery , red and green onion , Dijon mustard , olive oil , cayenne and paprika , s&p ) , open - faced tuna melts ( pole caught tuna with celery , apple , red onion , capers , chopped pickles , dill , Dijon mustard and olive oil on toasted rye with melted goat gruyere cheese and a sliced pineapple on top – hey do n’t knock it till you tried it – the sweet pineapple complements the acidic pickle taste perfectly ) , smoked trout and sweet roasted peppers .
I was nervous about ruining my childhood memories - indeed some memories are meant to be left alone .
The verdict ?
Kim ’s first taste caused severe facial contortion .
“ Shocking , ” she said .
But a few more tries and she was hooked .
We both agreed that the full sours were more flavorful than the half - sours that just tasted salty .
Letting one melt into the gazpacho was delicious .
The mineral light wine was a perfect match although we started daydreaming of martinis with pickle popsicles instead of olives .
The light bites were a match in heaven .
By the end of the night and four popsicles later , Kim concluded that it was “ a genius concoction ! ”
Yay for pickle spiced ice !!
The bottom line is that this recipe may not be winning any James Beard awards , and it wo n’t please all taste buds out there , but it does please mine , and at the very least – it will cure your hangover .
The market potential for energy savings companies ( ESCOs ) in India is great , yet barriers still stand in the way of the industry 's growth .
Listen to the full podcast interview :
In April 2009 , WRI released " Powering Up : The Investment Potential of Energy Service Companies in India , " a study that examined the potential of India ’s Energy Service Company ( ESCO ) industry .
The authors found that with an investment of US $ 10 billion dollars in energy efficiency improvements , India ’s economy would see benefits of up to 183.5 billion kilowatt hours in energy savings .
The publication is part of ongoing research on Accelerating Clean Energy Markets in India .
In this interview , WRI Ella Delio gives some background on ESCOs in India , and describes how this industry can overcome its most significant barrier to growth - - a lack of access to finance :
Full transcript :
Q : How big is the potential for energy savings through energy conservation efforts in India ?
A : The potential for energy savings in India is tremendous .
With an investment of $ 10 billion dollars , India can realize 183.5 billion kilowatt hours of savings annually .
That is 36 % of their annual electricity consumption .
And a key element of realizing this potential is the Energy Services Company industry .
Q : What is an energy service company ?
A : An Energy Service Company , or an ESCO , is a company that provides energy efficiency related services , and operates on an energy performance contract .
Which means that their revenues are earned based on the amount of energy savings that they produce for the client .
The majority of ESCO projects have payback periods of two years , and on average , the clients of ESCO 's save around 20 - 25 percent of their baseline energy costs .
Q : How big is the ESCO Industry in India ?
A : In India , the ESCO industry has grown tremendously over the past five years .
From 2002 - 2007 , the compounded annual growth rate was 96 % , and it is estimated that in 2008 the growth rate was 62 % .
This high growth rate is due to rising energy costs , to the desire of enterprises to increase their cost competitiveness , and due to the greater procurement of energy services from government agencies in India .
Despite this high growth , though , in the past five years , India 's industry is still relatively small to other emerging economies such as Brazil and China .
In India , in 2007 , the annual revenues of the industry was $ 18 million US dollars , while in Brazil , for the same year , the industry revenue was $ 280 million US dollars -- which is 15.5 times more than that of India's .
Q : What are the barriers to growth of the ESCO industry ?
A : One of the primary barriers to the growth of the ESCO industry is the lack of access to financing for the energy service companies .
WRI 's analysis shows that there are attractive investment opportunities to fund ESCO 's , especially among debt investors such as commercial banks in India , and one of WRI 's recommendations is for these banks to pilot financial products targeted at ESCO 's and their energy efficiency projects .
In fact , WRI is currently in talks with several national Indian banks to explore this option .
And we hope that by the end of June 2009 we will have an agreement with at least one of these banks to pilot such a financial product .
There are other barriers to the growth of the ESCO industry , such as the lack of a strong national industry association for ESCOs , as well as the lack of confidence of the prospective clients in the ESCOs .
And we provided recommendations to address these barriers in our new report called " Powering Up , " and we hope that all those who have listened to this video today , and are interested in learning more about the investment potential of the ESCO industry in India will download the report from the WRI website .

Staff at Goldman
Sachs staff can look forward to the biggest bonus payouts in the firm 's 140 - year history after a spectacular first half of the year , sparking concern that the big investment banks which survived the credit crunch will derail financial regulation reforms .
A lack of competition and a surge in revenues from trading foreign currency , bonds and fixed - income products has sent profits at Goldman Sachs soaring , according to insiders at the firm .
... Critics of the bonus culture in the City said the dominance of a few risk - taking investment banks is undermining the efforts of regulators to stabilise the financial system .
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman , said : " The investment banks more than any other institutions created the culture of excessive leverage , excessive risk and excessive bonuses that led to the downfall of the financial system .
Now they are cashing in and the same bonus culture has returned .
The result must be that we are being pushed to the edge of another crash . "

Rather than propose ways to shrink these companies and the risks they pose , the Geithner plan argues instead for enhanced regulatory oversight of the behemoths .
This suggests the taxpayer safety net will be larger after our national financial train wreck , not smaller .
More than two years after the crisis began , “ too big to fail ” remains “ too problematic to address ” with anything other than more souped - up regulation .
Given that earlier efforts at policing these entities failed so miserably , why should anyone think that a new - and - improved regulatory approach will fare better ?
The banksters and their lobbyists continue paying off members of Congress , Congress continues repaying them with our tax dollars in the form of more bailouts , and they keep rewarding themselves with bigger and bigger bonuses .
This hasto stop .
The disgraceful trash Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley are calling the Senate Finance Committee 's health reform proposal is just a thinly - disguised bailout for an Insurance Industry that everyone hates -- everyone .
Corrupt politicians like Baucus and Grassley love the Insurance CEOs .
They scratch each others ' backs .
Insurance Giants have spent $ 1,219,675,114 on lobbying Congress in the last decade -- but that does n't count the $ 316,522,578 in direct payments to candidates and members of Congress .
And I bet it would n't surprise any regularreader to hear that some of the most violent opposition to single payer -- or even a compromise public option -- comes from the members of the Senate , like Baucus and Grassley -- who have profited the most from Insurance CEOs ' generosity .
Among the worst shills -- and this isinsurance cash , not the whole Medical - Industrial Complex , which is far more -- is this dirty dozen corrupt and sleazy characters :
And if you 're worried about Blanche Lincoln , do n't .
She 's gotten $ 462,383 out of them and this year she 's # 2 on the list of who the health insurance industry is financing .
Back to the banksters for a moment .
Last week the banksters ' man on the inside , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , looked at members of Congress and told them , with a straight face , exactly what they wanted to hear : " No one should assume that the government will step in to bail them out if their firm fails . "
As Gretchen Morgenson explained in theyesterday , talk is cheap .
Its especially cheap when your audience is as scripted and full of shit as you are .
Geithner was trying to " sell " Congress -- or maybe the public -- on the weak and ineffective bankster - approved remake of the financial regulatory framework .
As Morgenson points out , " there ’s precious little in the 88 - page document about how the government will eliminate systemic risks posed by financial firms that are n’t allowed to fail because they ’re simply too big or to interconnected to other important economic players here and abroad .
"
It 's kind of ironic that we 'll hearing this from the Obama Administration just hours after Rahm Emanuel shoved a $ 108 billion loan guarantee up Congress ' collective rear end for European bank bailouts under the auspices of the IMF .

There have been lots of rumors echoing around that star -CNBC anchor Dylan Ratigan stormed out of CNBC after feuding with bosses Mark Hoffman and Susan Krakower , that he 's headed straight to ABC for a big - time broadcast slot , and that he can't go on - air for the next 6 months because of some ridiculous , spiteful clause in his CNBC contract .
Is it all TRUE ???
Inquiring minds want to know !
So we asked Dylan himself , who was kind enough to share 20 minutes with us .
The short answer ?
" No . " This is a pro-Dylan Ratigan move , not an anti-CNBC move .
And the bull market of the past month is just a suckers ' rally .
Here 's an excerpt of our conversation :
ON THE DECISION TO LEAVE CNBC :
Blodget :
So , you 're one of CNBC 's biggest stars .
You 're running one of the most successful shows they 've got .
And you bolt .
Why ?
Ratigan : A lot of things came together .
One , it became apparent to me that there had been some major policy failures in America .
While clearly pursuable at a place like CNBC , in my opinion , they are more broadly pursuable from a wide variety of other news platforms .
Blodget : Such as ?
Ratigan : Pick them .
ABC , CBS , HBO , MSNBC , CNN , FOX .
When you 're dealing with economic problems , you want to be speaking from an economic platform .
When you 're dealing with systemic policy failures that have rendered a catastrophe the likes of which we 've really never seen , the role of journalism is to ask questions of money and power from the broadest possible platform .
And I happened to have a contract that was expiring .
If I had been in the second year of a five - year deal , none of this would have happened .
Here 's the thing that people get confused by .
" He has a hot show on a hot network , and they 're going to pay him a bunch of money ... and he walks !
There must have been some terrible thing there ! "
Management must have been bad , or whatever .
And then they say , " Whoah , we found out he fought with one of the managers !
That must be it ! " ...
" They did n't pay him ! "
It 's not even that some of the things are n't true .
Did I fight with management ?
Sure .
Did I fight with everyone in management all the time ?
Absolutely not .
Did it have anything to do with the departure ?
Absolutely nothing ...
People think that my departure was in some way a reflection on CNBC .
I 'm telling you , it was a reflection on me .
CNBC was incredibly generous in not only giving me the opportunity to host shows , but in giving me the opportunity to create shows .
And I got to the end of a three - year deal after doing play by play in the afternoon for the financial apocalypse .
And I say , hang on a second here , this is a bigger story .
This is a story of this country , and this country 's system of making laws that affect its money .
So [ I 'm a ] CNBC star , 36 , single , trained by lots of entrepreneurial people , starting with Michael Bloomberg .
The value system that I grew up was that you make decisions based on being respectful to the situation you are already in , and at the same time honor any future opportunities .
Blodget :
So you want to go to a bigger platform and tell the same story to a broader audience ?
Ratigan :
Tell the same story to a broader audience but also broaden the story by making it more accessible to more people .
ON TOP - TICKING CNBC :
Blodget :
Do you think that , as far as CNBC goes , you 're getting out at the top ?
I do n't mean that something 's wrong with the network .
I mean that if you go back in time you find that the ratings at CNBC and other financial networks are extraordinary when markets are crashing , but then when markets stop crashing and we all begin to focus on the fact that we 've lost our shirts , we completely lose interest .
So was this a great timing call ?
Ratigan :
If that turns out to be the case it would be entirely coincidental .
ON THE ALLURE OF BROADCAST NEWS :
Blodget :
Is there really a place for this story you 're talking about on broadcast TV ?
Ratigan : Sure .
If you went to broadcast TV and started to connect the dots between the real impact of all these policy decisions -- students not getting loans , all the housing problems , all the layoffs -- and juxtapose that reality with the policy decisions and policies that allowed for the largest insurance fraud followed by blackmail ever ...
Broadcast TV 's perfect for that .
And the potential to use this moment to achieve systemic improvement by virtue of the taxpayer being asked for all this capital ... is important .
The original role of the journalist was not to give everyone the answers but to ask lots and lots of questions .
And that 's what I 'd like to do .
Blodget :
Is it fair to say that most people who are big stars at cable networks want to go on to do broader news at broadcast networks ?
And I specifically ask about the broadcast networks because everyone in the digital business thinks that eventually they 're toast .
Ratigan :
For me it 's not like I want to go from cable to broadcast like it 's 1988 or 1993 .
Broadcast represents an opportunity to reach a huge percentage of the population ... and ask the questions I want to ask .
ON THE MOVE TO ABC :
Blodget :
Is it reasonable to think you 'll end up at ABC ?
Ratigan : Yes .
And it 's equally reasonable to think that I won't .
NO DYLAN ON TV FOR MONTHS ?
BLAME JEFF ZUCKER !
Blodget :
How long will we have to wait ?
Ratigan : Call Jeff Zucker and ask him .
He controls the contract .
He can waive it tomorrow .
Blodget :
So we might get you back in a few weeks ?
Ratigan : Who knows .
Blodget :
So we can hold Jeff Zucker personally responsible for keeping you off the air ?
Ratigan : No , no .
That 's not fair .
ON THE FUTURE OF CNBC :
Blodget : So what happens to CNBC ?
You 've left .
Jonathan Wald [ editor ] has left .
I hear other big stars are thinking of leaving .
What happens to the network ?
Ratigan :
You 'd have to ask them .
Blodget :
As an aside , I have to say that I think CNBC has done a great job over the last couple of years .
I 'm always appalled when people say that they should have somehow told everyone else in advance that the world was going to end when 99.9 % of financial professionals missed this .
Ratigan : Yes .
I have no doubt that CNBC will go on to be bigger and better than ever before .
NEW BULL MARKET ...OR SUCKERS ' RALLY ?
Blodget : Last question .
You 've been right in the middle of this meltdown day after day , interviewing the smartest people , etc .
So is this a new bull market , or is this another suckers ' rally ?
Ratigan : Suckers ' rally .
No question .
That 's not an indictment of the judgement of the market .
That 's just my perception of the ability of the banks to function in a timely fashion , the ability to create meaningful amounts of jobs in the immediate future , and the as - yet unrecognized meaningful losses to come in commercial real - estate and other asset classes ...
We 've gone through a transition where things were getting bad in a freefall , and now they 're just getting slowly worse .
So it 's a transition from jumping out a plane without a parachute , and now , after a year of free - fall , we 've pulled the parachute , which feels a hell of a lot better than the freefall ...
I think we 're dealing with a problem that has a few years in it , not a few months .
Blodget :
Thanks , Dylan .

The vast majority of average Americans never spend much time thinking about things like “ population control ” or “ eugenics ” , but for the ultra - wealthy of the global elite and for the politicians that serve them , population control and eugenics are issues of the highest priority , and in fact it would be difficult to overstate the sick obsession that these elitists have with reducing the population of the planet .
Most of the time this sick obsession with population control does not make headlines , but a couple of recent news events has brought these issues back to the forefront once again .
The first involved Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
In an absolutely stunning interview with the New York Times , Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alluded to the fact that abortion is all about getting rid of certain types of people that the elite do not want to have around :
“ Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided , there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we do n’t want to have too many of . ”
Now in what kind of sick world is it EVER acceptable to use the phrase “ populations that we do n’t want to have too many of ” ?
That has got to be one of the most offensive statement made by any public figure in recent memory .
Yet the mainstream media has mostly let is pass without objection .
Fortunately , at least one member of Congress took notice .
Representative Joseph Pitts , a Republican from Pennsylvania , gave a stirring speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives denouncing Ginsburg ’s comment .
If you have not seen his one minute speech addressing this yet , then you definitely need to watch this video :
Unfortunately , Ginsberg ’s comments are hardly an isolated case .
The reality is that the top levels of government are filled with officials who are obsessed with population issues .
For example , John P. Holdren , Barack Obama ’s top science advisor co-authored a book in 1977 in which he advocated mass sterilization using the food and water supply , mandatory bodily implants that would prevent couples from having children , forced abortions for American couples trying to have too many children and a global police force to enforce population control .
Really ?
Yes , really .
Now keep in mind , this is Barack Obama ’s number one science advisor .
Holdren advocated these insane proposals in a 1977 textbook entitled “ Ecoscience ” , which he co-authored with Paul Ehrlich ( who worked in the Bush administration ) and Anne Ehrlich .
When rumors of Holdren ’s book first began to surface , they were quickly dismissed by many because it just seemed so inconceivable that the top science advisor to the president of the United States would advocate such bizarre ideas .
However , once one blogger posted pictures of the pages of Holdren ’s book up on the Internet , people started to realize that Holdren actually did write these sick things .
What followers are some of the more shocking quotes from Holdren ’s book .
On page 837 , the book states that compulsory abortion is perfectly legal under the Constitution of the United States :
“ Indeed , it has been concluded that compulsory population - control laws , even including laws requiring compulsory abortion , could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society . ”
On page 786 , it says that single mothers should have their babies taken away by the government and that they could be forced to have abortions if the government decides that is what is best :
“ One way to carry out this disapproval might be to insist that all illegitimate babies be put up for adoption — especially those born to minors , who generally are not capable of caring properly for a child alone .
If a single mother really wished to keep her baby , she might be obliged to go through adoption proceedings and demonstrate her ability to support and care for it .
Adoption proceedings probably should remain more difficult for single people than for married couples , in recognition of the relative difficulty of raising children alone .
It would even be possible to require pregnant single women to marry or have abortions , perhaps as an alternative to placement for adoption , depending on the society . ”
On pages 787 and 788 , the book advocates the mass sterilization of humans by putting drugs in the food and water supply :
“ Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods is a suggestion that seems to horrify people more than most proposals for involuntary fertility control .
Indeed , this would pose some very difficult political , legal , and social questions , to say nothing of the technical problems .
No such sterilant exists today , nor does one appear to be under development .
To be acceptable , such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements : it must be uniformly effective , despite widely varying doses received by individuals , and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals ; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects ; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex , children , old people , pets , or livestock . ”
On pages 786 and 787 , the authors discuss the involuntary sterilization of women after their second or third child :
Involuntary fertility control
“ A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child , despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy , might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men .
The development of a long - term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control .
The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable , with official permission , for a limited number of births . ”
On page 838 , the authors state their belief that there is nothing wrong or illegal about the government dictating family size :
“ In today ’s world , however , the number of children in a family is a matter of profound public concern .
The law regulates other highly personal matters .
For example , no one may lawfully have more than one spouse at a time .
Why should the law not be able to prevent a person from having more than two children ? ”
On pages 942 and 943 , the authors call for the creation of a “ planetary regime ” that would control the global economy and enforce population control measures :
Toward a Planetary Regime
“ Perhaps those agencies , combined with UNEP and the United Nations population agencies , might eventually be developed into a Planetary Regime — sort of an international superagency for population , resources , and environment .
Such a comprehensive Planetary Regime could control the development , administration , conservation , and distribution of all natural resources , renewable or nonrenewable , at least insofar as international implications exist .
Thus the Regime could have the power to control pollution not only in the atmosphere and oceans , but also in such freshwater bodies as rivers and lakes that cross international boundaries or that discharge into the oceans .
The Regime might also be a logical central agency for regulating all international trade , perhaps including assistance from DCs to LDCs , and including all food on the international market . ”
“ The Planetary Regime might be given responsibility for determining the optimum population for the world and for each region and for arbitrating various countries ’ shares within their regional limits .
Control of population size might remain the responsibility of each government , but the Regime would have some power to enforce the agreed limits . ”
On page 917 , the authors advocate the surrender of national sovereignty to an armed international police force :
“ If this could be accomplished , security might be provided by an armed international organization , a global analogue of a police force .
Many people have recognized this as a goal , but the way to reach it remains obscure in a world where factionalism seems , if anything , to be increasing .
The first step necessarily involves partial surrender of sovereignty to an international organization . ”
It would be easy to dismiss Holdren as an eccentric nutjob , but the truth is that his views are an accurate representation of what is commonly believed among the global elite .
They are obsessed with the notion that this planet is massively overpopulated , and that if strict population control measures are not implemented quickly it will have catastrophic consequences for the planet .
Scientists who advocate eugenics and radical population control are funded and promoted by the global elite .
In fact , prior to becoming Obama ’s top science advisor , Holdren was the Teresa and John Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University .
The truth is that academia is littered with nutjobs such as this who want to see the vast majority of humanity wiped out .
Another example of this is Professor of Biology at the University of Texas at Austin Eric R. Pianka .
In an article entitled “ What nobody wants to hear , but everyone needs to know ” , Pianka makes the following startling statements :
First , and foremost , we must get out of denial and recognize that Earth simply cannot support many billions of people
This planet might be able to support perhaps as many as half a billion people who could live a sustainable life in relative comfort .
Human populations must be greatly diminished , and as quickly as possible to limit further environmental damage .
I do not bear any ill will toward humanity .
However , I am convinced that the world WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of us .
So the world “ might ” be able to support half a billion people ?
What about all the rest of us ?
Oh yeah , we apparently have to die .
But these nutjob scientists would not have the influence and positions they do if they were not funded by the ultra - wealthy global elitists who are also obsessed with population control .
On May 5th , 2009 , Bill Gates , David Rockefeller Jr. , Warren Buffett , George Soros , Michael Bloomberg , Ted Turner , Oprah Winfrey and a number of other ultra-wealthy Americans gathered for a super secret meeting in Manhattan .
Reportedly the goal of the meeting was to evaluate how their combined wealth could be used to slow the growth of the world ’s population .
There was a total news blackout by the American media of this clandestine gathering .
The group reportedly met at the home of Sir Paul Nurse , a British Nobel prize biochemist and the president of Rockefeller University .
The secret meeting supposedly so discreet that many of the billionaires ’ aides were only told they were at “ security briefings ” .
Fortunately , however , some details about the secret meeting have emerged .
According to one major U.K. newspaper , one anonymous person who attended the meeting said that “ a consensus emerged that they would back a strategy in which population growth would be tackled as a potentially disastrous environmental , social and industrial threat . ”
The same article included some other incredibly shocking quotes about the meeting from that same anonymous source …..
“ This is something so nightmarish that everyone in this group agreed it needs big - brain answers . ”
“ They need to be independent of government agencies , which are unable to head off the disaster we all see looming . ”
So the super - wealthy “ big- brains ” are going to come up with the answers to overpopulation and impose those answers on the rest of us ?
How arrogant can they possibly be ?
You know all of that money that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett donated to “ charity ” some time ago ?
Well , the reality is that a whole lot of it is going for population control programs – especially in the third world .
The reality is that this secret meeting is just another example of the sick obsession that the global elite has with population control .
Even in the western world now it seems as though there is a non -stop program to promote abortion , sterilization , family size limits , lower birth rates and other even more extreme population control measures .
In fact , the chair of the U.K. government ’s Sustainable Development Commission , Jonathon Porritt , said that parents who have more than two children are being “ irresponsible ” by creating an “ unbearable ” burden on the environment .
Porritt also said that curbing population growth through abortion and contraception is absolutely necessary if the fight against global warming is going to be won .
And it is the “ environmental movement ” that is behind much of this .
It is becoming increasingly popular to think of humans as a “ virus ” that are destroying the planet , and that what we need to do is to radically reduce the population to bring things back into balance .
For thousands of years , the freedom to marry and reproduce and to raise a family has been one of the most cherished and most basic of all human freedoms .
But now all of that is changing .
Now you have governments like China that have implemented a “ one child policy ” and you have other governments that are starting to talk about limits on family sizes .
But even without formal government action , today there are many , particularly in the Western world , who are been convinced by government propaganda to willingly restrict their own reproductive capabilities .
For example , one 27 year old woman named Toni Vernelli told the Daily Mail why she decided to get permanently sterilized : “ Every person who is born uses more food , more water , more land , more fossil fuels , more trees and produces more rubbish , more pollution , more greenhouse gases , and adds to the problem of over - population . ”
Some “ environmental activists ” have even gone to the absolute extreme by forming “ The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement ” which seeks to reduce the presence of humanity on earth completely .
Their motto is : “ May we live long and die out ” .
Does n’t that sound wonderful ?
So is what they are saying true ?
Is the ballooning population of the planet a huge threat to the environment ?
Do we need to implement strict population control for the good of humanity ?
The truth is that the world has more than enough space and resources for everyone if the elite were not so greedy , but instead the elite are pushing the governments of the world to implement population control programs .
We have started to see some of these population control measures begin to pop up in the Western world …..
* Women in the Netherlands who are deemed by the state to be unfit mothers will be sentenced to take contraception for a period of two years , according to a new bill before the Dutch parliament .
* In the U.K. , one influential think tank says that it is an “ eco- crime ” to have too many childrenand that we really need to examine the impact our large population is having on the earth .
* In South America , the government of Peru goes door to door pressuring women to be sterilized and they are funded by American tax dollars to do this .
Did you know that American tax dollars are being spent to sterilize the women of Peru ?
The reality is that the desire by the global elite to limit the population of the earth has been around for centuries .
Between 1798 and 1826 , English economist Thomas Malthus published six editions of his work entitled “ Essay on the Principle of Population ” , which argued that population growth inevitably outstrips food production .
The primary argument advanced by Malthus was that the English working class was poor not because they were exploited , but rather because there were way too many of them .
Malthus opposed welfare and higher wages because he believed they would allow the poor to survive and breed , thus compounding the overpopulation problem and leading to more poverty .
Of course Malthus was completely and totally wrong about all of this , but nonetheless his theories gained wide acceptance among the English elite of his day .
Many years later , Margaret Sanger , the founder of Planned Parenthood , vigorously promoted this type of twisted thinking in the United States .
The following is one of Margaret Sanger ’s most infamous quotes :
“ The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it . ”
Now keep in mind that this quote came out of the mouth of the founder of Planned Parenthood .
Unfortunately , the sick viewpoints of Malthus , Sanger and other population control advocates did not die out .
Rather , they seemed to gain steam as the population of the world absolutely exploded in the 20th century .
U.S. environmentalist Paul Ehrlich , in his 1968 book entitled “ The Population Bomb ” , argued for very strict population control measures , especially in the poorer areas of the world .
He warned that if we did not implement such measures we would be facing catastrophic problems very quickly .
Of course most of his dire predictions have now been documented to have been completely wrong , but his theories continue to wield a great deal of influence to this day .
Dr. Arne Schiotz , World Wildlife Fund Director of Conservation , said this in 1984 :
“ Malthus has been vindicated , reality is finally catching up with Malthus .
The Third World is overpopulated , it ’s an economic mess , and there ’s no way they could get out of it with this fast - growing population .
Our philosophy is : back to the village . ”
Unfortunately , the philosophies of Erlich , Schiotz and other population control advocates have garnered a substantial following even among powerful members of the United States government .
Just check out the following shocking quotes from Thomas Ferguson , who formerly worked in the State Department Office of Population Affairs …..
“ There is a single theme behind all our work–we must reduce population levels .
Either governments do it our way , through nice clean methods , or they will get the kinds of mess that we have in El Salvador , or in Iran or in Beirut .
Population is a political problem .
Once population is out of control , it requires authoritarian government , even fascism , to reduce it …. ”
“ Our program in El Salvador did n’t work .
The infrastructure was not there to support it .
There were just too goddamned many people ….
To really reduce population , quickly , you have to pull all the males into the fighting and you have to kill significant numbers of fertile age females … . ”
“ The quickest way to reduce population is through famine , like in Africa , or through disease like the Black Death … . ”
Unfortunately , the quotes above are typical of the mindset of the global elite .
The call for radical population control has grown louder than we have ever seen before .
College professors are given standing ovations by their students when they call for a 90 percent reduction in the human population of the planet .
Ted Turner makes the radical statement that , “ A total population of 250- 300 million people , a 95 % decline from present levels , would be ideal , ” and the global elite applaud him for it .
The Georgia Guidestones which call for us to “ maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature ” are increasingly cited by our leaders as an important , and perhaps even necessary , goal .
When did it become “ a good idea ” to wipe out 90 to 95 percent of mankind ?
Even Prince Philip , the husband of Queen Elizabeth , is obsessed with reducing population :
“ You cannot keep a bigger flock of sheep than you are capable of feeding .
In other words conservation may involve culling in order to keep a balance between the relative numbers in each species within any particular habitat .
I realize this is a very touchy subject , but the fact remains that mankind is part of the living world … .
Every new acre brought into cultivation means another acre denied to wild species . ”
Are you starting to understand how the global elite sees us ?
The truth is that they see us as a “ flock ” that must be culled from time to time .
How incredibly sick is that ?
In fact , Prince Philip , the “ Eco- Warrior ” , also once said that he would like to come back to earth as a disease after he died to help reduce the human population .
But Prince Philip is far from alone on this issue .
The call for human depopulation is coming from a myriad of other sources as well :
John Guillebaud , professor of family planning at University College London has said this :
“ The effect on the planet of having one child less is an order of magnitude greater than all these other things we might do , such as switching off lights .
An extra child is the equivalent of a lot of flights across the planet . ”
He also made this shocking statement : “ The greatest thing anyone in Britain could do to help the future of the planet would be to have one less child . ”
The infamous Club of Rome is certainly clear about who they think the “ enemy ” is …..
“ In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill … .
But in designating them as the enemy , we fall into the trap of mistaking symptoms for causes .
All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome .
The real enemy , then , is humanity itself . ”
– Club of Rome , The First Global Revolution , 1991
Mikhail Gorbachev has also weighed in on his view on overpopulation .
Many were stunned when he made this shocking statement : “ We must speak more clearly about sexuality , contraception , about abortion , about values that control population , because the ecological crisis , in short , is the population crisis .
Cut the population by 90 % and there are n’t enough people left to do a great deal of ecological damage . ”
The truth is that we are getting increasingly closer to the kind of world where the “ useless eaters ” that Henry Kissinger talked about will be “ eliminated ” .
Is this the kind of future that you anticipated for your children and your grandchildren ?
A world where the human “ flock ” is regularly “ culled ” to please the global elite ?
Not that it matters that the world is not even experiencing runaway population growth .
While the earth ’s population is indeed growing , the rate of growth is definitely slowing .
The population of the world grew by 140 % between 1950 and 2000 .
However , authorities are predicting a rise of only 50 % between 2000 and 2050 , and a rise of just 11 % in the 50 years beyond that .
In fact , in Russia they are actually starting to pay people to have children because the population there has been declining too much .
But the global elite have decided that the earth should only have about 500 million people , and that they are going to have to get rid of about 90 percent of us .
And one of the truly sad things is that many of you who will read this article actually agree with the global elite .
Many of you believe that we need sterilization , family size limits , forced abortion and even more draconian measures in order to avoid an environmental catastrophe .
The truth is that you have been brainwashed .
The truth is that you have been lied to .
The truth is that you have bought into a philosophy of death which completely devalues human life .
But this is what is being taught in universities all over the United States and Europe .
The population control and eugenics agenda of the global elite is being being propagandized by professors , scientists and government officials who have bought into this madness .
However , what most people do not realize is that the global elite not only intend to theorize about population control and eugenics .
They fully intend to radically reduce the population of the earth in their lifetimes – whether you like it or not .

Explanation : The July 22nd total solar eclipse was the longest of the 21st century .
From the point of maximum eclipse along the Moon 's shadow track across the Pacific Ocean , the Moon completely blocked the Sun for a total of 6 minutes and 39 seconds .
But from the deck of this cruise ship the duration of the total eclipse phase was extended to a whopping 6 minutes and 42 seconds by the ship 's motion along the shadow track .
This panoramic view of the scene shows the shimmering solar corona in a darkened daytime sky , with clouds silhouetted by a bright sky on the distant horizon , beyond the Moon 's shadow .
Mercury can be seen near the eclipsed Sun.
Venus lies near the upper right edge of the frame .

A little - noticed but historic milestone will be reached this week when the 500th person ever to fly in space blasts off .
The moment will come whenever NASA ’s shuttle Endeavour finally launches to continue building the international space station .
Endeavour ’s crew of seven will include four rookie astronauts , making their first trip into orbit .
But the crew agreed that former naval commander Chris Cassidy , 39 , who has led combat missions in Afghanistan , will take the honour .
Space website collectSpace reports the reaching of the 500 milestone and includes a list of all 500 brave spacemen and women .
There is some debate about which of the rookies will actually cross the space boundary first , considering their seating position and the roll of the spacecraft , but at the speed Endeavour will be going , it is probably academic .
First human in space was Russian Yuri Gagarin , in 1961 .
( First woman in space was another Russian , Valentina Tereshkova , in 1963 ) .
Interestingly , the 250th person in space was Britain ’s first astronaut , Helen Sharman .
A food chemist who helped invent Mars ice cream , Helen , now 46 , flew a Russian Soyuz ship to the Mir space station in 1991 .
The 26th man in space , Neil Armstrong , later became the first man on the Moon .
The shuttle Endeavour was due to launch on Saturday but that was scrubbed due to a hydrogen leak .
It is now set to fly between Wednesday and Saturday .
Shuttle commander Mark Polansky will continue his Twitter updates – although he has admitted that they will be uploaded for him by a PR person back on Earth .

I woke up one morning late last week to the news that taxpayers , already $ 149 billion in the hole in the Treasury Department 's TARP bailout program , are set to lose even more .
As rescued banks now try to extricate themselves from the government 's control , they must buy back stock warrants proffered at the time of the bailout , which , as the New York Times described it , offer " the right to purchase shares in each of the companies at roughly the price of their shares at the time of the deals . "
As it happens , thanks largely to that taxpayer - funded bailout , bank stocks have risen since last fall 's meltdown .
Selling those warrants , then , should mean a tidy profit for taxpayers .
But no such luck , it seems .
Almost a dozen small banks have already bought back their warrants , and for a considerable discount -- a mere 66 % of their value -- costing taxpayers upwards of $ 10 million .
If this were to continue when giant firms like JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , and Morgan Stanley come up to bat , taxpayers could be out up to $ 2.1 billion .
Think of that as a small potential thank - you note from the banking business to Americans for helping it out of a jam .
Right behind that bit of sprightly news was a report from the Associated Press that the giant insurance firm AIG , almost 80 % owned by taxpayers , was now back in consultation with the Obama administration over just how much more it should pay out in further retention bonuses -- this after multi-millions in such bonuses were already paid -- including " about $ 235 million for employees at AIG 's financial products unit . "
AIG 's near collapse , added the AP , " was not due to its traditional insurance operations , but instead risky derivatives contracts written by the financial products division . "
In addition to those traders , for 40 top execs of the dismally failed company , there is to be a payout of a mere $ 9 million in further bonuses for 2008 .
What a comedown !
Of course , who can be surprised by this sort of thing these days ?
Not , I assume , Barbara Garson , known in the Vietnam era as the author of the satiric play " MacBird , " who has since gone on to write books on American work life ( All the Livelong Day ) and on a single bank deposit as it made its dizzying way around our planet ( Money Makes the World Go Around ) .
For TomDispatch , she 's written a little mystery story about those financial - products types , what 's happened to them , and -- most strikingly -- their possible rebirth .
Think of her as this site 's equivalent of Miss Marple , set loose on our financially melted - down planet .
Tom
F inanciers were further from my life experience than either die casters or editors .
Yet the " do you know anyone who ? " method still proved an effective way of turning up unemployed hedge - fund analysts and bank loan officers -- and within a week at that .
It was only when I refined my search to ferret out unemployed financiers who had actually handled those infamous " toxic assets " that I hit the proverbial brick wall .
For the book I 'm writing about unemployed Americans , I had no trouble finding a ccountants , b rokers , c ashiers , or d ie casters .
Admittedly , I had to go out of town to interview the die casters .
But when I arrived , alphabetically , at unemployed e ditors , I had only to look in my address book .
Since mortgage - backed securities and the swaps that insure them had been the downfall of Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , Merrill Lynch , and the giant insurance company AIG , packs of bankers who worked on them must , I assumed , be roaming free on the streets of Manhattan .
Yet I could n't find a single one .
Finally , I phoned a law firm representing Lehman Brothers employees in a suit for the pay they were owed when the company shut down without notice .
I asked the lawyer if he could possibly inquire among his unemployed clients for someone , anyone , who used to work with mortgage - backed securities and might be willing to talk about how he or she was getting by today .
" I do n't have to use real names , " I assured him .
Many of the unemployed people I 'd already interviewed felt so lost and ashamed that I had decided not to use their real names .
Unemployed bankers deserve anonymity , too .
But the lawyer made it clear that that was n't the problem .
" Most of them were snapped up immediately by Barclays , " he said .
He represents other financial plaintiffs as well , and he seemed to think that the kind of person I was looking for had n't remained unemployed very long .
The Clues
How could that be ?
We 've heard ad nauseum about mortgage - backed securities .
They 're bonds " structured " out of thousands , or tens of thousands , of home or commercial mortgages .
The bond 's owner was to receive interest out of the mortgage payments from all those property owners .
He could earn a low 5 % interest if he opted to be paid out of the first money that came in .
( Institutional investors often chose that safe " tranche , " or slice , of the security . )
But back when mortgages seemed so safe , a hedge - fund gambler might have been happy to opt for the last mortgage payments to come in -- in exchange for heftier 7 % to 8 % interest rates .
Of course , that was the gamble .
Too many missed mortgage payments meant little or no returns for his fund .
When last I heard , more than half of U.S. mortgages were held this way , so it was a reasonable supposition that a lot of people had been employed structuring , trading , and insuring those bonds .
But who in his right mind would touch this stuff now ?
While that lawyer sounded like an honest , helpful fellow , I still wondered whether he was n't just brushing me off to protect his embarrassingly unemployed clients .
Soon after , however , I met a bank corporate loan officer who confirmed that his colleagues on the " structured side " were indeed still employed .
In fact , he thought he noticed a couple of new chairs at their trading desk in the bank 's trading room .
" Those damn things " had become so complicated , he speculated , that the people who put them together were now needed in similar numbers to " unwind the bank 's positions " -- that is , get them out of the deals .
That must be it , I thought , and recalled a moment soon after AIG got the last of its $ 182 billion bailout from the government .
At that time , the company braved a massive public outcry to award big bonuses to its top employees , including those who had created the " swaps " ( short for credit default swaps , or CDSs ) that swamped the company .
Like so many other companies , AIG claimed that bonuses were necessary to retain the " best brains , " especially those who understood the credit - default swaps .
These swaps are a type of derivative that was supposed to represent a way of insuring the very bonds we 've been talking about .
Here 's how it worked -- at least theoretically , at least before the ship went down :
On a given bond , say number 123456 , an insurance company like AIG would essentially say to a large investor , perhaps a mutual fund , " You pay us $ 7,000 a month and , if you fail to receive the interest on that bond for , say , two months , then we 'll buy the whole bond from you for the $ 200 million you paid for it . "
In other words , it was a private , custom - written contract to simply " swap " one of those bonds for money under certain agreed circumstances .
These deals were couched in such terms , rather than as straight insurance policies , because insurance is regulated and the regulations require setting aside relatively small amounts of money in reserve in case the disasters insured against occur .
But swaps are n't regulated .
Nothing need be set aside .
Here 's the remarkable thing : both the Bush and Obama administrations decided that the government would make good on these non-regulated , non-insurance policies .
The costs could be humongous .
Now , here 's an even more distressing complication .
You did n't have to own the original bond to buy the swap that was really an insurance policy .
An " investor " could approach AIG and say , " You know that Merrill asset - backed bond -- number 123456 ?
I 'll pay you $ 7,000 a month , too , and if the bond defaults , then you owe me 200 million also . "
It 's as if any number of people could buy ( or , really , bet on ) your life insurance policy .
Or think of a race track where anyone can go to the window and bet on any horse in any race -- and collect if it comes in .
( Or in this case , collect if mortgage payments did n't come in . )
If our government were merely going to cover the original mortgage - backed securities , the maximum payouts , though large , would at least be calculable .
If 50 % of the mortgages in the U.S. were , as they say , securitized , and if they all were to default , that would be a vast but finite loss .
But since any number of people could buy into the swaps on those bonds , the swap payouts could be an unknown amount that would be many times the value of the real buildings .
How many multiples of reality might that come to ?
Two times , 10 times , 100 times ?
Who knows ?
Remember , these are unregulated transactions .
And keep in mind that the " investment " being bailed out here has nothing to do with anything in the real world .
Neither party to these " me too " swaps owned , built , or financed the original housing , or anything else for that matter .
They were simply betting on whether a certain group of people would pay their mortgage bills .
Why our government would underwrite these bets , and why such gambling contracts are legal in the first place , is beyond me , but as we know , they were placed on a vast scale .
No wonder , I thought , that my swap men were all still employed .
After all , even if there 's no work for die - casters or editors , there 's still all that " unwinding " to do by the people who did the winding in the first place .
The Crime
Then I read this headline in the Financial Times : " Strange but true -- the credit specs are back . "
According to the column that followed by John Dizard , " [ T ] hanks to the Geithner Treasury 's policy of reform , rather than dissolution , CDS trading has regained a vampiric strength that the real economy still lacks . "
So , now I understood : the man I could n't find , the man who was n't unemployed , was n't just doing that final bit of unwinding or cleaning up old messes .
He was busy making new ones !
How could Dizard be certain , though , that the debt trade is really booming again ?
He cites " one friend of mine in the credit fund trade " who has " made money on both the downside and the upside during the past year . "
Of course , who can know for sure ?
If there was a derivative exchange along the lines of the New York Stock Exchange , we'd have a good idea of the volume of the trade .
But derivatives -- I know you 've heard this more than once -- are unregulated .
President Obama 's recent white paper on financial reform suggests that derivatives should , in fact , be regulated , except for what it refers to as " custom " products .
That , unfortunately , sounds like just the right - sized loophole for the financial instruments I 've described .
And --
I 'm sure you wo n't be surprised by this -- financiers are lobbying furiously to expand that hole .
The Motive
Why is there such an interest in reviving the debt market and why are financiers so determined to keep it unregulated ?
Are n't they scared of it , too ?
Let me quote Dizard one last time :
" After all , if the dictates of style and tax auditors say you have to go easy on conspicuous consumption , and if there 's no demand for the products of real capital spending , then you might as well take your cash to the track , or the corner credit default swap dealer . "
In other words , people are speculating on derivatives and derivatives of derivatives because there 's no action in the real world .
You can't invest in new real businesses or lend money to old real businesses for expansion unless people can afford to buy the products they 'll produce .
That brings me back to where I started : our real world .
You know , the one where just about everyone 's unemployed except those swap guys .

( Update 2010 - 07 - 14 : it seems that Perl 6 modules on the Perl 5 CPAN are not a good idea with the current infrastructure .
See the Perl 6 Module Directory for an alternative . )
About a month ago we had a discussion about distributing Perl 6 modules , again .
This time I also looked at cpan6.org and mailed Mark Overmeer about his progress and visions .
The discussion moved to the perl6 - language mailing list , and I went to vacations .
When I came back roughly three weeks later , there were nearly hundred messages on that subject in five different threads , and so far I did n't feel like reading it all .
( Additionally my mail server went down during that time , so I did n't even have them in my mailbox ) .
So instead of discussing things , I started to do something : I added meta data files to my Perl 6 JSON parser and uploaded it to CPAN .
I think that 's the first Perl 6 module on CPAN , discounting some modules included in distributions like pugs and v6.pm .
Since the documentation is in Perl 6 Pod , search .cpan.org does n't display it properly .
So my next steps will be to find out whom I can prod to implement Perl 6
Pod rendering and indexing , or if I have to do that myself ( and if yes , on which code base ) .
In parallel I 'll try to get the proto hackers to install from tarballs , or write that myself too .
In the end I 'd want Perl 5 and Perl 6 modules to coexist on CPAN , presumably with the option to select packages implemented in either language for searching .
About two months ago , I posted a blog asking if and why Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) was necessary to treat .
Alcoholics have certainly gotten sober without AA .
I wanted readers to suggest what aspects of AA , as opposed to say , training for a triathlon or finding God , they considered necessary pieces of that model .
Readers offered some good responses , including the following :
AA might be necessary for some and not for others , because there are different intensities of alcoholism and different personalities among alcoholics that make AA a better or worse fit ( in front of crowds , , more independent in problem solving , etc. ) .
AA 's sponsor , or one - on - one mentoring relationship , is an important element to that program .
Unlike other diversions including Church and exercise , AA provides a sustained focus on the specific problems of alcohol in a community of people who have experienced those problems .
AA includes a necessary focus on or surrendering willfulness to a higher power .
I recently had an interesting conversation that makes me want to add one more benefit to the list .
This point applies to any abstinence program .
It 's because abstinence is at the heart of AA that I 'm writing about it in this context .
One Bonus of Abstinence :
I do n't feel drawn to abstinence from my gut , but I can name one good reason it works .
When you do choose abstinence rather than moderation , you shift from a framework of " how much " behaviors to " yes / no " behaviors .
Some behaviors , which I 'm calling " how much " behaviors here , demand a small - scale internal debate each time they pop up .
Examples include " How much should I eat for breakfast ? " and " How much time should I work on my novel today ? "
The privately conducted debates behind these questions can give you a sense of freedom .
Here you get to tinker with how you act , with what you ingest , with what you produce .
You can feel liberated from external rules .
But the fact is that these " how much " questions also tax us .
They add to our level of insofar as they demand a lot of brain work .
Every time you approach one of these little decisions , you have to deal with a host of issues : moral questions , examination of self , memories of what 's worked in the past , estimations of what 'll work next time , what others think , etc. , etc . .
In contrast to " how much " behaviors are " yes / no " behaviors , which are habits we 've really adopted , so they 're simply not up for debate .
" Should I feed my kid ? "
" Should I show up at the office ? "
In these instances , you 've already set up some internal rule that feels inherent to your -- and is no longer questioned .
While these habits might sound more boring , they can be productive without being taxing .
Take exercise as an example : I 'm a daily runner .
Some people think this takes a lot of discipline .
But after 20 years of daily running , my morning run is amazingly easy .
It 's easier for me than it would be for someone who had not yet made the habit part of her identity .
I never ask myself " if " I should run some day .
I do it without the debate -- and in a big way , I get a lot out of it without spending much energy on the task .
When you do make a rule part of your identity , it takes some cognitive load off .
If there 's any way that abstinence can be incorporated into someone 's identity with a sense of joy ( even , say , as a 28 - day art project ) , then she might approach drinking with a different frame of mind .
At least , for a while , she 'll free herself of the stress related to questions of " how much ? "
A bamboo bicycle can take over a week to make by hand
By Kieron Humphrey
Lusaka
On the outskirts of Lusaka , Zambia , next year 's crop of bicycles is being watered by Benjamin Banda .
" We planted this bamboo last year , " he says , " and now the stems are taller than me .
When it 's ready we 'll cut it , cure it and then turn it into frames . "
Mr Banda , is the caretaker for Zambikes , a company set up by two Californians and two Zambians which aimed to build bikes tough enough to handle the local terrain .
Co-founder Vaughn Spethmann , 24 , recalls how it all started with a game of football .
Bamboo is the fastest growing woody plant in the world " We were here on a university field trip and we organized a match against some locals .
Afterwards we asked them what they did , and they said : ' Nothing ' .
They did n't have jobs .
" So we decided to come up with a business which would be a source of employment and provide a useful product . "
That product was the rugged , bright yellow Zambike , assembled at the firm 's smart red - brick workshop set in sun-browned farmland .
Other projects followed as the mechanics ' skills improved : a sturdy cargo bike , a bike trailer and a bike - drawn " zambulance " , now in use at 10 clinics around Lusaka .
Good vibrations Meanwhile Santa Cruz - based bike designer Craig Calfee was experimenting with bamboo as a material for bike frames .
His prototypes proved that the strength and lightness of the plant made it a great substitute for metal .
As a bonus it had excellent vibration - dampening properties , making it comfortable for riding over long distances .
It was eye - catching too - Mr Calfee 's stand was besieged when he unveiled his first bamboo frame at a bike show .
The bicycles are being targeted at the American market Mr Calfee hatched a plan to manufacture the frames in developing countries , distribute them in the US and share the profits .
He had already set up a workshop in Accra , Ghana , and started looking for more bike producers , nicknamed " bambooseros " .
The industry telegraph started humming and soon he was talking to Zambikes .
" We were so excited , " says Mr Spethmann .
" The thought of Zambian - made products being sold in the USA .
That just does n't happen . "
There are many reasons why it 's so unusual : capital is difficult to raise in Zambia ; tools and raw materials - if available - are expensive ; skilled labour is in short supply ; and bureaucracy is n't .
In this context having a low - cost raw material on the doorstep is a godsend .
" And of course there 's very little impact on the environment , " says Dustin McBride , the other American on the Zambikes management team .
Growth market Inside the workshop , bike mechanic Elastus Lemba is setting up treated bamboo pieces on a jig made from plumber 's pipes and bicycle parts .
The bicycle - making process has little impact on the environment
It looks low - tech , but that 's intentional .
Mr Calfee wanted a production process that did not require sophisticated machinery .
With wood glue holding the frame in place , Mr Lemba binds the joints using sisal - tough cord made from plant fibre soaked in epoxy .
Hand - making the frames in this way takes at least a week .
After a final sanding and coat of varnish , each batch of bamboosero bikes will be shipped to the USA , tested , fitted with wheels , pedals , handlebars and brakes , and put on sale .
So will the bike be a success ?
Mr Calfee thinks so , based on all the enquiries and advance orders he has received .
" Hundreds of people have asked when they can buy one .
From a bike messenger who wants an affordable fixie to a wealthy collector who wants one from each bamboosero location . "
It was never just about bikes .
We want to change lives
Mwewa Chikamba , Zambikes co-founder
He is convinced the price tag - $ 475 ( £ 290 ) for road or mountain bike frames , and more than $ 900 ( £ 550 ) for a finished bike - wo n't put people off .
" The only criticism I 've had is that they might be too cheap .
" After all , buyers are helping to get self - sustaining businesses off the ground in developing economies , and they 're getting a unique bike into the bargain . "
The mood is optimistic at Zambikes too .
Operations co-ordinator Divilance Machilika , watches company cook Fabian Mumba taking a finished bamboo bike for a spin around the yard .
" I can see these selling well in America .
They 'll like them because they 're natural , " he says .
Mr Machilika lived in a tent on the site for a year while the workshop was being built .
A quick learner , he soon mastered construction skills and bike mechanics .
Now he oversees day - to - day running of the workshop .
Benefit to the community
One of the founders , Mwewa Chikamba , says Mr Machilika is an example of what Zambikes wanted to achieve .
" It was never just about bikes .
We wanted to give our workers practical skills and reward their dedication .
We want to change lives , " he says .
Sisal is another plant used in the bamboo bike which is grown locally Assistance is also offered in the form of business coaching or discretionary loans - Mr Machilika used one such loan to buy a plot of land .
" I want to build three houses there .
I 'll use the rent money to start other businesses and employ people myself . "
Instead of charging interest , Zambikes asks staff to demonstrate that the investment made in them is benefiting their community .
Perseverance and an innovative approach to product design and working practices have helped Zambikes put down strong roots .
But in a business environment that leaves much to be desired , it is no surprise that they have not yet seen a profit .
If the bamboo bike shoots out of the shops as fast as Mr Calfee predicts , that may be about to change too .

By all accounts , Hac φ was a great success !
25 people attended ( from as far away as Chicago , Toronto , and Utrecht ) and we had a great time hanging out , eating good food , listening to some interesting talks , and , oh yes , hacking .
There was a wide range of Haskell experience represented among the participants , which made for a great atmosphere of collaboration and learning .
A collection of my pictures can be found here ;
Shae ’s pictures can be found here , here , here , and here .
Unfortunately there do n’t seem to be any pictures of when we went out for dinner and beer , but I can assure you that much fun was had by all .
I also have another post describing the talks on Saturday afternoon .
Here ’s a quick rundown of some of the things people worked on ( by no means complete ) :
Chris Eidhof ( chr1s ) and doug Beardsley ( mightybyte ) worked on the formlets library , making a bunch of internal changes .
Tracy Wadleigh ( twadleigh ) worked on his mathlink library for implementing Mathematica packages in Haskell .
Greg Collins ( gcollins ) made a number of improvements and bugfixes to the OSX installer for the Haskell Platform .
Chris Casinghino ( ccasin ) worked on creating some open - source tools for crossword puzzle construction and solving .
Edward Kmett ( edwardk ) and Shae Erisson ( shapr ) worked on Edward ’s small , mostly untyped , lazy functional programming language Kata ; Shae also did a bit of work on parsing FLAC files .
Ravi Nanavati ( ravi_n ) collaborated with Edward Kmett to design a monoid for error message collection and started planning for a Boston hackathon in January (? ) , among other things .
Mike Burns ( mike - burns ) finished a minimally working program called “ taggert ” that provides for a tagged view of a directory , using gtk2hs and HDBC - Sqlite3 .
Gershom Bazerman ( sclv ) worked on releasing his jmacro library for programmatic JavaScript generation .
Dan DaCosta ( chaosape ) worked on learning Haskell and designing a library for collection , aggregation , and analysis of network traffic , to be used for his Master ’s thesis .
Daniel Wagner ( dmwit ) worked on a library for parsing .sgf files .
Yours truly ( byorgey ) worked on a new splitting method for my Data .
List .
Split library , applied a few xmonad patches , and worked a bunch on my new combinatorial species library .
Those are the projects I know about ; there were also a number of other attendees , whose accomplishments were surely no less interesting even though I do n’t know what they were : Adam Turoff ( \z ) , Anton van Straaten ( mmmdonuts ) , Luke Hoersten ( Luke ) , Reece Heineke , Sasha Rush , Malik Hamro ( malikh ) , Andrew Robbins ( adu ) , Andrew Wagner ( chessguy ) , Aleks Jakulin ( AleksJ ) , Hristo Asenov ( hasenov ) , and Ken Takusagawa .
Please feel free to leave comments with information about projects I left out , more pictures , blog posts , or whatever !
Towards the end of the hackathon several people asked me whether we would be hosting another one next year .
We had n’t planned that far ahead , of course — but judging by how much fun this one was ( and how unstressful it was to organize ( although that was largely thanks to our amazing administrative coordinator , Cheryl Hickey , who handled a lot of the details ! ) ) , it ’s a distinct possibility !
In fact , since it looks like ICFP will be in Baltimore next year , perhaps we can help organize another hackathon in conjunction with that .
We shall see !
Pagani may be a low - volume producer of high - end automobiles but you have to give them credit for being able to use the same basic platform to come out with variation after variation of some pretty phenomenal cars .
The new 2010 Pagani Cinque Roadster is no exception .
It ’s essentially a convertible version of the Pagani Cinque Coupe which is just a street - legal version of the Zonda R track monster .
But somehow each new slight adaptation seems to wet our appetite just the same .
The upcoming 2010 Pagani Cinque Roadster will feature a Carbon - Titanium chassis that has been redesigned to compensate for the drop - top .
Because the engineering was so solid on the first go - round for the Coupe , this car has not had to add any additional weight for things like reinforcement braces .
The top itself actually gets stored underneath the hood .
Go figure .
The Cinque Roadster features a Mercedes - Benz AMG sourced V12 engine that ’s rated at 678 hp .
This is mated to a Cima sequential 6 - speed gearbox that has been robotized by Automac engineering .
The dry weight is only 2,667 pounds .
What all this really means is that the car can hit 62 mph in just 3.4 seconds , 124 mph in 9.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 217 mph .
But it does n’t just go fast , it can get down from those speeds in a controlled manner as well .
Braking from 62 mph to a complete stop takes just 2.1 seconds and it can slow from 124 to 0 in just 4.3 seconds .
To make all this possible , the Cinque Roadster is fitted with carbo- ceramic self - ventilated hydraulic servo Brembo brakes in a 6/4 caliper setup .
Pagani ’s attention to detail and product sourcing are always spot-on .
Just check out the APP monolitic wheels painted black and forged in aluminum and magnesium with size 19×9 in front and 20 × 12.5 in rear .
These bad boys are wrapped in Pirelli PZero tires measuring 255/35/19 up front and 335/30/20 in back .
This is a pretty stellar wheel and tire package .
Only 5 of the 2010 Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster will be built at a cost of 1.3 million Euro each .
But do n’t fret too much if you ca n’t get it on the first run .
If you have crazy money like Peter Saywell , you can always commission your own , like the Pagani Zonda PS .

Need some extra storage , but you donâ€™t have the money to spend on expensive bookcases ?
Why not build a bookcase yourself ?
Building a bookcase isnâ€™t always a simple task , but it doesnâ€™t have to be so difficult .
Using standard lumber , your basic tools and eight easy steps , you can build your own inexpensive and great looking bookcase .
Here are eight simple steps in creating your own bookcase .
Just keep in mind this is for your standard bookcase , if you want something smaller or bigger make sure you have the correct amount of lumber .
The bookcase measurements will be 72â€ x 32â€ ( 6â€™ x about 2â € ™6 â €  ) .
Â
You can always alter your wood to make the bookcase bigger or smaller if you choose to do that .
If youâ€™re unsure about something ask questions .
The last thing youâ€™ll want to do is buy the wrong piece of lumber after itâ€™s been cut and sanded down .
Now onto the fun part : building your bookcase .
Here is what youâ€ ™re going to need :
1 2 " x 10 " x 12 ' lumber
2 pieces of 1 " x 10 " x 8 '
" L " brackets ( 4 per shelf ) .
Piece of thin hardboard or 1/4 " plywood .
Brads ( 1/2 " ) and screws ( # 8 3/4 " long )
Sandpaper
Screwdriver and hammer
A saw or router
A drill and drill bits
If you plan on painting youâ€™ll need stain and paint
Step 1 : Have your 2â€x10 â€  12â €™ lumber cut into two pieces that are 72 â € long .
These two pieces will be the sides of your bookcase .
Step 2 : Take your two pieces of 1â€  X10 â € 8â€ ™ and have them cut into three sections each .
These sections , which are 32â€ , are going to be the top bottom as well as the shelves of your bookshelf .
Step 3 : Sand the edges of all your boards .
Depending on the type of wood you purchased , you can also paint or stain all of your boards .
Donâ€™t forget to paint the piece of plywood thatâ€™s going to be the back of the bookcase .
Step 4 : Once youâ€™ve decided how much space you want between each shelf , mark it on the sides of you bookcase with a pencil .
Step 5 : Attach the â€œLâ€ brackets to the sides of your bookcase and align them so that the shelf height matches where you marked the sides of the bookcase .
Remember to put the brackets 3â€ from the front and 3â€ from the rear of the sides of the bookcase .
It will look a lot nicer that way .
Step 6 : Starting at the top , tighten the top shelf to the â€œLâ€ brackets on both sides of your bookcase and then just work your way down .
Attach the shelves according to your marks .
Leave a space 1â€ from the top of your bookcase ; it looks a lot nicer that way .
Step 7 : If you painted your bookcase , paint your â€ œLâ€ brackets so that they make the color of your bookcase .
Step 8 : Cut the hardboard to fit the back for the bookcase and attach it with the brads .
You have completed your bookcase and all it took was eight easy steps .
Now that youâ€ ™re done , enjoy your beautiful bookcase .
Donâ€™t forget to brag about a job well done either !
We are being invaded .
Millions of exotic migrants are breezing into Britain , but the tabloid press can rest easy : these new arrivals are painted lady butterflies and the only resources they will devour are nectar and thistles .
In what could be the biggest influx of butterflies into this country in decades , millions have flown into Britain from the deserts of north Africa .
Up to 18,000 were spotted sailing on the breeze across Scolt Head Island on the north Norfolk coast : 50 arriving every minute according to Natural England nature reserve staff .
The mass migration began last Thursday when large numbers were seen off Portland Bill in Dorset .
Since then , our highest mountains , biggest cities and thickest forests have proved no obstacle : thousands of painted ladies have turned up everywhere , from central London to Dumfries and Galloway .
I saw one during the bank holiday at the foot of Snowdon in Wales : it looked rather pale and faded , but so would you after flapping your way here from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco .
Painted ladies reach our shores every summer , but the last major migration was in 1996 .
This year , rumours of an impending invasion began circulating in late winter .
A Spanish scientist , Constanti Stefanescu , reported seeing hundreds of thousands of them emerging in Morocco in mid-February after heavy winter rains in north Africa triggered the germination of food plants devoured by its caterpillars .
Aided by favourable winds and unimaginable reserves of stamina , large numbers were seen in Spain during April .
A few weeks later , they had reached France .
" We 've had reasonable migrations before , but nothing this sudden , " says Martin Warren , chief executive of Butterfly Conservation .
" All the signs are it could be one of the biggest ever . "
On the coast , all you may see is a flash of orange whizz past at head height .
When they settle on garden flowers they are as striking as their less adventurous relatives , the red admiral and the small tortoiseshell .
Certain weeds should be very afraid : painted lady caterpillars feast on thistles before emerging as an immaculate new generation of adult butterflies in August .
" It 's really quite wonderful , " says Matthew Oates , the National Trust 's adviser on nature .
" It may be that thistle - cutting or spraying is unnecessary this summer because the caterpillars will defoliate them for you . "
Come September , the painted ladies will be off again : the British - born generation begin an epic reverse trip , drawn by a mysterious calling to the hot , distant land of their mothers and fathers .
New Battlefront over Road Signs
Thousands of road signs are the latest front in Israel ’s battle to erase Arab heritage from much of the Holy Land .
Israel Katz , the transport minister , announced this week that signs on all major roads in Israel , East Jerusalem and possibly parts of the West Bank would be “ standardised ” , converting English and Arabic place names into straight transliterations of the Hebrew name .
Currently , road signs include the place name as it is traditionally rendered in all three languages .
Under the new scheme , the Arab identity of important Palestinian communities will be obscured : Jerusalem , or “ al Quds ” in Arabic , will be Hebraised to “ Yerushalayim ” ; Nazareth , or “ al Nasra ” in Arabic , the city of Jesus ’s childhood , will become “ Natzrat ” ; and Jaffa , the port city after which Palestine ’s oranges were named , will be “ Yafo ” .
Arab leaders are concerned that Mr Katz ’s plan offers a foretaste of the demand by Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel ’s prime minister , that the Palestinians recognise Israel as a Jewish state .
On Wednesday , Mohammed Sabih , a senior official at the Arab League , called the initiative “ racist and dangerous ” .
“ This decision comes in the framework of a series of steps in Israel aimed at implementing the ‘ Jewish State ’ slogan on the ground . ”
Palestinians in Israel and Jerusalem , meanwhile , have responded with alarm to a policy they believe is designed to make them ever less visible .
Ahmed Tibi , an Arab legislator in the Israeli parliament , said : “ Minister Katz is mistaken if he thinks that changing a few words can erase the existence of the Arab people or their connection to Israel . ”
The transport ministry has made little effort to conceal the political motivation behind its policy of Hebraising road signs .
In announcing the move on Monday , Mr Katz , a hawkish member of Likud , Mr Netanyahu ’s right - wing party , said he objected to Palestinians using the names of communities that existed before Israel ’s establishment in 1948 .
“ I will not allow that on our signs , ” he said .
“ This government , and certainly this minister , will not allow anyone to turn Jewish Jerusalem into Palestinian al Quds . ”
Other Israeli officials have played down the political significance of Mr Katz ’s decision .
A transport department spokesman , Yeshaayahu Ronen , said : “ The lack of uniform spelling on signs has been a problem for those speaking foreign languages , citizens and tourists alike . ”
“ That ’s ridiculous , ” responded Tareq Shehadeh , head of the Nazareth Cultural and Tourism Association .
“ Does the ministry really think it ’s helping tourists by renaming Nazareth , one of the most famous places in the world , ‘ Natzrat ’ , a Hebrew name only Israeli Jews recognise ? ”
Meron Benvenisti , a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem , said Israel had begun interfering with the Arabic on the signs for East Jerusalem as soon as it occupied the city in 1967 .
It invented a new word , “ Urshalim ” , that was supposed to be the Arabic form of the Hebrew word for Jerusalem , “ Yerushalayim ” .
“ I was among those who intervened at the time to get the word ‘ al Quds ’ placed on signs , too , after ‘ Urshalim ’ and separated by a hyphen .
But over the years ‘ al Quds ’ was demoted to brackets and nowadays it ’s not included on new signs at all . ”
He said Mr Katz ’s scheme would push this process even further by requiring not only the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew word for Jerusalem , but the replication of the Hebrew spelling as well .
“ It ’s completely chauvinistic and an insult , ” he said .
Meir Margalit , a former Jerusalem councillor , said official policy was to make the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem as invisible as possible , including by ignoring their neighbourhoods on many signs .
The transport ministry ’s plans for the West Bank are less clear .
In his announcement Mr Katz said Palestinian - controlled areas of the territory would still be free to use proper Arabic place names .
But he hinted that signs in the 60 per cent of the West Bank under Israeli military rule would be Hebraised , too .
That could mean Palestinians driving across parts of the West Bank to the Palestinian city of Nablus , for example , will have to look for the Hebrew name “ Shechem ” spelt out in Arabic .
Mr Benvenisti said that , after Israel ’s establishment in 1948 , a naming committee was given the task of erasing thousands of Arab place names , including those of hills , valleys and springs , and creating Hebrew names .
The country ’s first prime minister , David Ben Gurion , told the committee : “ We are obliged to remove the Arabic names for reasons of state . ”
In addition , the Arabic names of more than 400 Palestinian villages destroyed by Israel during and after the 1948 war were lost as Jewish communities took their place .
Israel ’s surviving Palestinian minority , today one - fifth of the population , have had to battle in the courts for the inclusion of Arabic on road signs , despite Arabic being an official language .
Many signs on national highways were provided only in Hebrew and English until the courts in 1999 insisted Arabic be included .
Three years later the courts ruled that Arabic must also be included on signs in cities where a significant number of Arabs live .
However , as the political climate has shifted rightward in Israel , there has been a backlash , including an unsuccessful bid by legislators to end Arabic ’s status as an official language last year .
Recently the Israeli media revealed that nationalist groups have been spraying over Arabic names on road signs , especially in the Jerusalem area .
Israel has also antagonised Palestinians in both Israel and the West Bank by naming roads after right - wing figures .
The main highway in the Jordan Valley , which runs through Palestinian territory but is used by Israelis to drive between northern Israel and Jerusalem , is named “ Gandhi ’s Road ” – not for the Indian spiritual leader but after the nickname of an Israeli general , Rehavam Zeevi , who called for the expulsion of Palestinians from Greater Israel .

Creating a pixel ruler from the command line
How to draw lines and text on images with Bash scripting , shell arithmetic , and ImageMagick

Sometimes I need to draw a few lines or some text on an image or a blank canvas .
Just recently I needed to include a simple image of a pixel ruler in a developerWorks article .
I wanted the image to be 572 pixels wide , to match the current recommended maximum for developerWorks article images as described in " Illustrating your article or tutorial for developerWorks . "
Lots of on - screen pixel rulers are available for Linux and for Windows ( see Related topics ) , but I just wanted a simple GIF , JPEG or PNG image .
This tip shows you how to use Bash scripting , shell arithmetic , and ImageMagick to create a pixel ruler .
Make a canvas
The first thing any artist needs is a canvas , so let 's create one using the XC pseudo image type in ImageMagick .
We also need a color , either one of the many named colors in ImageMagick , or a custom color .
( See Related topics for a link to the ImageMagick documentation , where you can find a full list of pseudo image types as well as color names . )
Listing 1 shows how to make a light blue 572x100 canvas using the convert command .
( The convert command is customarily used to convert to a different image format or otherwise alter an image . )
Listing 1 . Creating a canvas
convert - size 572x100 xc:lightblue ruler1.gif
Figure 1 shows our new canvas .
Figure 1 .
A light blue 572x100 pixel canvas for our ruler
Add a few lines
Now that we have a canvas , let 's draw marks to show the various points along the ruler .
72 ppi ( pixels per inch ) is standard for Web - based graphics , so let 's put our first mark at 72 pixels and make it extend 30 pixels from the bottom of the image .
Let 's also make the fill color for the line black and specify the two end points of the line .
Listing 2 . Adding a line to the canvas
convert - fill black - draw " line 72,70 72,100 " ruler1.gif ruler2.gif
Figure 2 shows our new image with a single line drawn on it .
Figure 2 .
The canvas with a single vertical line 72 pixels from the left
Doing this individually for each line we want on the ruler is n't too appealing .
So let 's use the seq command to generate a list of horizontal offsets 72 pixels apart and a for loop to draw our main lines on the ruler as shown in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . Adding lines to the canvas every 72 pixels
convert - fill black - draw " $( for n in $ ( seq 0 72 572 ) ;\ do echo line $ n,70 $ n,100 ; done ) " ruler1.gif ruler3.gif
Notice that we use two command substitutions to generate the individual line specifications for the draw operation .
We also put a mark at 0 , the left edge .
Figure 3 is now starting to look more like a ruler .
Figure 3 .
The canvas with vertical lines every 72 pixels from the left
Scripting more lines
At this point , our command line is getting a little complex , and we still have only the major marks on our ruler .
Time to start scripting .
In Listing 4 , we use shell arithmetic and for loops to place a 20 - pixel mark half way between the marks we already have , and to place 10 - pixel marks every 6 pixels between the longer marks .
We 'll call the script buildruler.sh and put it in our working directory for the purposes of this article .
Listing 4 .
Adding a full set of marks to the ruler
#!/bin/bash #
Take user parameters or set defaults rulername= " $ 1 " rulerlength = " $ 2 " rulername= " ${rulername:=ruler.gif} " rulerlength= " ${rulerlength:=572} " drawstring= " "
# Build the line definitions for the ruler marks for x1 in `seq 0 72 $ rulerlength` ; do drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ x1,70 $ x1,100 " for x2 in 0 36 ; do ( ( offset = $ x1 + $ x2 ) ) drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ offset,80 $ offset ,100 " for x3 in `seq 6 6 30` ; do ( ( offset2 = $ offset + $ x3 ) ) drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ offset2,90 $ offset2,100 " done done done # Create the ruler convert - size " ${rulerlength}x100 " xc:lightblue - fill black \ - draw " $ drawstring " " $ rulername "
Notice that we added a couple of parameters to allow a user to change the name of the ruler and to specify the length .
Our ruler now looks like Figure 4 .
We used the command ./buildruler.sh ruler4.gif to generate this ruler .
Figure 4 .
Our ruler with a full set of marks 6 pixels apart
Adding text
Quoting
One of the tricky things with scripting is knowing when quotes are needed and when they are not , and how to pass quoted strings as parameters .
Pay particular attention to the quoting used in these scripts .
Now let 's label the larger marks on our ruler with the numbers 0 , 72 , 144 , and so on .
We need to tell ImageMagick what font to use and what size and color it should be .
Obviously , the 0 should be at the left edge of the ruler , but if we place the two - and three - digit numbers at the 72 - pixel points , they will appear unbalanced .
To correct this , we 'll shift them slightly to the left , to make them appear more centered over the mark .
Our enlarged script is shown in Listing 5 .
Listing 5 . Adding labels to the ruler
#!/bin/bash #
Take user parameters or set defaults rulername= " $ 1 " rulerlength = " $ 2 " rulername= " ${rulername:=ruler.gif} " rulerlength= " ${rulerlength:=572} " drawstring= " "
# Build the line definitions for the ruler marks for x1 in `seq 0 72 $ rulerlength` ; do drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ x1,70 $ x1,100 " for x2 in 0 36 ; do ( ( offset = $ x1 + $ x2 ) ) drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ offset,80 $ offset ,100 " for x3 in `seq 6 6 30` ; do ( ( offset2 = $ offset + $ x3 ) ) drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ offset2,90 $ offset2,100 " done done done # Add the labels labelfont= " - fill black - font helvetica - pointsize 24 - draw " labelstring = " text 0,60 \ " 0 \ " " for x1 in 72 ; do ( ( offset = $ x1 - 12 ) ) labelstring =" $ labelstring text $ offset,60 \ " $ x1 \ " " done for x1 in `seq 144 72 $ rulerlength` ; do ( ( offset = $ x1 - 18 ) ) labelstring =" $ labelstring text $ offset,60 \ " $ x1 \ " " done # Create the ruler convert - size " ${rulerlength}x100 " xc:lightblue - fill black \ - draw " $ drawstring " $ labelfont " $ labelstring " " $ rulername "
Now our ruler looks like Figure 5 .
Figure 5 .
Our ruler with labels a full set of marks
Positioning text
So how did we know how much to offset the text or how far down from the top to place it ?
The short answer is that I experimented and guessed !
Not an ideal solution .
To do a better job on placing text , we need to know how big the rectangle containing the text will be .
But that depends on the font and whether the font is proportional and other things that are n't so easy to calculate .
Fortunately , in the same way that we can create a canvas with ImageMagick , we can also create a label .
We 'll create a title of Pixel Ruler and make it a 36 - point font .
The label is created as an image , and we can use the identify command to determine its size , as shown in Listing 6 .
Listing 6 . Creating a title and measuring its size
$ convert - fill NavyBlue - background Lavender - font helvetica - pointsize 36 \ label : " Pixel Ruler " label.gif $ identify " label.gif " label.gif GIF 175x36 175x36+0+0 8 -bit PseudoClass 256c 1.98 kb
We 've made the text navy blue and added a lavender background color to help the image stand out from this page background , but you get the same size image with or without the background color .
The resulting label image is shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 .
The label as an image
Even better than writing a file , we can use the ImageMagick INFO class to determine even more information about the text , including where the baseline is .
We 'll write the text onto a large enough canvas and then trim the canvas to the edge of the text as shown in Listing 7 .
Listing 7 .
Using the INFO image class to determine font information
$ convert - size 572x100 xc:lightblue - font helvetica - pointsize 36 \ - fill black - undercolor lavender - annotate +40+50 ' Pixel Ruler ' - trim info : xc:lightblue XC 174x36 572x100+40+23 16-bit DirectClass
Annotated text starts at a point whose y coordinate represents the baseline of the text .
The above output shows that the text fits in a box that is 174x36 pixels in size .
The 1 - pixel discrepancy between this and our earlier result is not significant .
The top of the box is positioned 23 pixels below the top of our original canvas .
Since the baseline was 50 pixels below the top of the original canvas , this means the baseline is actually 27 pixels ( 50 minus 23 ) below the top of the text , leaving 9 pixels for descenders .
Figure 7 illustrates the relationship using an image placed on the untrimmed canvas .
Figure 7 .
The label metrics
So now that we have the label dimensions , let 's place the baseline 40 pixels from the top of the image and center it horizontally .
Our final script is shown in Listing 8 and is also available for download .
Listing 8 .
Our final script
#!/bin/bash #
Take user parameters or set defaults rulername= " $ 1 " rulerlength = " $ 2 " rulername= " ${rulername:=ruler.gif} " rulerlength= " ${rulerlength:=572} " drawstring= " "
# Build the line definitions for the ruler marks for x1 in `seq 0 72 $ rulerlength` ; do drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ x1,70 $ x1,100 " for x2 in 0 36 ; do ( ( offset = $ x1 + $ x2 ) ) drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ offset,80 $ offset ,100 " for x3 in `seq 6 6 30` ; do ( ( offset2 = $ offset + $ x3 ) ) drawstring = " $ drawstring line $ offset2,90 $ offset2,100 " done done done # Add the labels labelfont= " - fill black - font helvetica - pointsize 24 - draw " labelstring = " text 0,60 ' 0 ' " for x3 in 72 ; do offset3 =$ ( ( $ x3 - 12 ) ) labelstring =" $ labelstring text $ offset3,60 ' $ x3 ' " done for x4 in `seq 144 72 $ rulerlength` ; do offset4 = $ (( $ x4 - 18 ) ) labelstring =" $ labelstring text $ offset4,60 ' $ x4 ' " done # Add a title titledimension = $ ( convert - size 572x100 xc:lightblue - font helvetica \ - pointsize 36 - fill black - undercolor lavender \ - annotate +40+50 ' Pixel Ruler ' - trim info : | awk ' {print $ 3 } ') titlewidth=${titledimension %x*} titlefont= " - fill NavyBlue - font helvetica - pointsize 36 " titlepos= $ (( ( ( $ rulerlength - $ titlew idth ) ) / 2 ) ) titletext = " text $ titlepos,30 ' Pixel Ruler ' " # Create the ruler convert - size " ${rulerlength}x100 " xc:lightblue \ - fill black - draw " $ drawstring " $ labelfont " $ labelstring " \ $ titlefont - draw " $ titletext " " $ rulername "
The final ruler is shown in Figure 8 .
Figure 8 .
The final ruler , complete with title
Not too bad for someone with no artistic skills !
A semi-practical example
When images are indented — as in lists , for example — the maximum width allowed on developerWorks is reduced accordingly .
So you can use these handy rulers as a check for any images you submit with an article .
This is a short ruler in an unordered list that was created with the command ./buildruler.sh ruler9.gif 400 .
Figure 9 . A 400 - pixel ruler
And this is an even shorter ruler that is further indented .
It was created with the command ./buildruler.sh ruler10.gif 300 .
Figure 10 .
A 300 - pixel ruler

Conclusion
In this short exercise , you 've seen some basic techniques for scripting images containing lines and text using ImageMagick .
You 'll find more techniques in our articles " Graphics from the command line " and " More graphics from the command line . "
You 'll also find a host of other examples at the ImageMagick home page .
See Related topics for links .
The scripts here are not bullet - proof .
For example , we do not validate that length is a positive number big enough for a meaningful ruler or that the file specified is a valid image file type for ImageMagick .
You will find other issues as well .
For example , the ruler labels may be truncated as in Figure 10 above , a possibility our script did not consider .
You can also parameterize as many aspects as you wish .
Try adding color or ruler height as parameters , for example .
While this tip has focused on using ImageMagick with Linux , ImageMagick is available for other platforms including Windows .
Try using these techniques with your favorite scripting tools on your favorite platform .

The Washington Post : RIP
The Washington Post died today .
It was five months short of its 132nd birthday .
News of the demise of the once - great news gathering organization came in a story by Mike Allen at Politico.com , which reported that Post publisher Katharine Weymouth has decided to solicit payoffs of between $ 25,000 and $ 250,000 from Washington lobbyists , in return for one or more private dinners in her home , where lucky diners will receive a chance for “ your organization ’s CEO ” to interact with “ Health - care reporting and editorial staff members of The Washington Post ” and “ key Obama administration and congressional leaders … ”
The decision by the Post ’s publisher to sell access to government officials was the latest–and , by far , the most horrific–in a series of disastrous decisions in the last two weeks which , taken together , have destroyed what was once one of the proudest brands in American journalism .
As news of the Politico story raced across the Internet this morning , former and present news executives inside and outside The Washington Post Company reacted with stunned horror .
As Allen put it in his Politico story , “ The offer ­ which essentially turns a news organization into a facilitator for private lobbyist - official encounters ­ is a new sign of the lengths to which news organizations will go to find revenue at a time when most newspapers are struggling for survival . ”
Arthur Gelb , the legendary former managing editor of The New York Times , declared , “ Say It Ain’t So , Katharine .
Where are the principles set by your grandmother and Ben Bradlee that had for so long imbued the Post ?
How can your reporters and editors we so admire and respect sit on their hands while this degradation evolves ? ”
The Post issued a statement which perfectly fits what Washington Post legend Bob Woodward once defined during Watergate as a “ non-denial denial ” :
The flier circulated this morning came out of a business division for conferences and events , and the newsroom was unaware of such communication .
It went out before it was properly vetted , and this draft does not represent what the company ’s vision for these dinners are , which is meant to be an independent , policy - oriented event for newsmakers .
As written , the newsroom could not participate in an event like this .
We do believe there is an opportunity to have a conferences and events business , and that the Post should be leading these conversations in Washington , big or small , while maintaining journalistic integrity .
The newsroom will participate where appropriate . ”
FCP pointed out to the Post spokeswoman that unless the company repudiated this idea altogether by the end of the day , the company ’s brand would be dead .
“ I do n’t appreciate that kind of talk , ” said Kris Coratti , director of communications for Washington Post Media .
“ You should n’t appreciate it , ” FCP replied .
But the failure to repudiate this idea will be fatal :
“ Underwriting Opportunity :
An evening with the right people can alter the debate , ” says the one - page flier .
“ Underwrite and participate in this intimate and exclusive Washington Post Salon , an off - the - record dinner and discussion at the home of CEO and Publisher Katharine Weymouth … Bring your organization ’s CEO or executive director literally to the table .
Interact with key Obama administration and congressional leaders … “ Spirited ?
Yes .
Confrontational ?
No .
The relaxed setting in the home of Katharine Weymouth assures it .
What is guaranteed is a collegial evening , with Obama administration officials , Congress members , business leaders , advocacy leaders and other select minds typically on the guest list of 20 or less . … ”
Later in the day , Washington Post Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli made this stab at damage control :
A flyer was distributed this week offering an “ underwriting opportunity ” for a dinner on health - care reform , in which the news department had been asked to participate .
The language in the flyer and the description of the event preclude our participation .
We will not participate in events where promises are made that in exchange for money The Post will offer access to newsroom personnel or will refrain from confrontational questioning .
Our independence from advertisers or sponsors is inviolable .
There is a long tradition of news organizations hosting conferences and events , and we believe The Post , including the newsroom , can do these things in ways that are consistent with our values .
Marcus
Over at the Dow Jones - owned site All Things Digital , Peter Kafka offered the swiftest and most idiotic reaction to the news , ignoring the fact that there might be any significant difference between paid and unpaid dinner parties :
But let me play devil ’s advocate :
What exactly would be so wrong about getting the paper ’s reporters or editors to to participate in one of these ?
This certainly would n’t be the first time that the Post has been at the nexus of power , money and influence ­ in fact , Weymouth ’s grandmother , Katharine Graham , was famous for hosting gatherings much like these at her house .
And publications of all stripes ­ including this one , as well as Dow Jones , which owns this site ­ frequently charge fees to attend networking events where their editorial staff participates .
In a chat today on washingtonpost.com , Post Congressional reporter Paul Kane cited Brauchli ’s memo as proof that the newsroom would not participate in these confabs–even though the statement of the company ’s corporate spokeswoman directly contradicted that .
And even if newsroom staffers are excluded from these dinners , the idea that the paper ’s publisher would be selling this kind of access remains far , far , far beyond the pale .
Early indications of the collapse of judgement at the Washington news organization included the decision to allow Glenn Beck to host a chat at washingtpost.
com - –a scant two weeks before Beck hosted certifiably - maniacal Michael Scheuer on his own program , so that Scheuer could strongly advocate a massive new terrorist attack on the United States by Osama Bin Laden .
Next came the firing of Dan Froomkin , the best and most original reporter on the Post ’s website –presumably because Froomkin wrote so many accurate stories pointing up the inadequacies of the national staff of the Post .
But both of those events paled next to this morning ’s news , which was leaked to Politico by a healthcare lobbyist .
In a piece of remarkable understatement , Mike Allen wrote , “ it ’s a turn of the times that a lobbyist is scolding The Washington Post for its ethical practices . ”
For the first one hundred years of its existence , the Post was a respectable but unremarkable newspaper .
All that began to change when Katharine Weymouth ’s grandmother , Katharine Graham , chose Ben Bradlee to lead the paper in 1968 .
During the next twenty - three years , by expanding the paper ’s national staff , opening many new bureaus abroad , inventing the Style section and hiring some of the finest reporters in America , Bradlee gave The New York Times the first serious competition it had received from a general - interest newspaper since the death of the New York Herald Tribune .
The paper ’s most celebrated period came when Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein did more than anyone else to unravel the Watergate scandal during the administration of Richard Nixon .
Most famously , when Bernstein called former Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell to read him one of his stories , Mitchell exploded , “ All that crap , you ’re putting it in the paper ?
It ’s all been denied .
Katie Graham ’s gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that ’s published .
Good Christ !
That ’s the most sickening thing I ever heard . ”
Graham ’s granddaughter , Katharine Weymouth , was widely admired within The Washington Post Company as she climbed up the corporate ladder before finally succeeding her uncle Donald Graham as the paper ’s publisher .
But the extraordinary economic pressures faced by every American newspaper as their traditional business model has collapsed has now led to a comparable collapse in corporate judgment .
When historians look back at this event , they will note it as the beginning of the end of newspapers as we have known them .

UPDATE : The Post Caves In–To Sanity
Reacting to the uproar , Katharine Weymouth announced early this afternoon that plans for the dinners at her house had been cancelled .
Washington
Post media reporter Howard Kurtz reported that “ Weymouth knew of the plans to host small dinners at her home and to charge lobbying and trade organizations for participation .
But , one of the executives said , she believed that there would be multiple sponsors , to minimize any appearance of charging for access , and that the newsroom would be in charge of the scope and content of any dinners in which Post reporters and editors participated . ”

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -- Wal - Mart Stores Inc , the world 's largest retailer , said Tuesday that it supports President Obama 's push to require large employers to offer health insurance to workers .
" We are for an employer mandate which is fair and broad in its coverage , " stated a letter addressed to Obama and signed by Mike Duke , the chief executive of Wal - Mart ; Andy Stern , the president of Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) and John Podesta , the CEO of the Center for American Progress .
Wal - Mart 's public statement of support for employer mandated coverage comes as Obama pushes for an overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system .
He has made a healthcare plan that reins in costs and covers most of the roughly 46 million uninsured Americans one of his top priorities .
While the president has left much of the details of health reform to Congress , he has told U.S. lawmakers he is open to requiring larger companies to provide coverage for employees but exempting smaller businesses .
In recent years , Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's largest private employer , has come under fire by labor - backed critic groups that accused it of mistreating employees and not offering adequate healthcare coverage .
Wal - Mart has worked to counter critics by promoting its healthcare initiatives , such as its $ 4 generic drug program .
In 2007 , it also joined with the SEIU , which has more than 1 million members , in calling for universal health - care coverage for all Americans by 2012 .
Wal - Mart said it supports an employer mandate that covers as many businesses as possible , as well as part - time and full - time employees .
The requirement would ultimately save companies money , it added .
" This choice will require employers to consider the trade - off of agreeing to a coverage mandate and additional taxes versus the promise of reduced health care cost increases , " it said .
It also said health care reform legislation should include provisions that reduce health costs , and that the retailer would support legislation that would put a public healthcare plan in place should private health insurers fail to meet price and competition targets , also known as a " trigger " provision .

Changes to the House of Commons regulations are decided upon by a small committee of six MPs including Miss Harman and Mr Duncan .
Both MPs have publicly stated that it is unacceptable for expense claims to be paid without receipts .
Miss Harman said in the spring : “ There would need to be receipts for all claims .
I really do think that that is something sensible which we could decide for ourselves now . ”
Apple has let loose a number of revealing new patent applications that cover some interesting technologies that could be used in future iPhones .
Haptic Tactile Feedback
Perhaps most interesting amongst the patent applications is the acknowledgement by Apple that despite the many advantages of the iPhone 's multi - touch screen , a lack of tactile feedback remains its biggest disadvantage :
However , one of a touchscreen 's biggest advantages ( i.e. , the ability to utilize the same physical space for different functions ) is also one of a touchscreen 's biggest disadvantages .
When the user is unable to view the display ( because the user is occupied with other tasks ) , the user can only feel the smooth hard surface of the touchscreen , regardless of the shape , size and location of the virtual buttons and / or other display elements .
This makes it difficult for users to find icons , hyperlinks , textboxes or other user - selectable input elements that are being displayed , if any are even being displayed , without looking at the display .
...
Unless touch input components are improved , users that , for example , drive a motor vehicle , may avoid devices that have a touch input component and favor those that have a plurality of physical input components ( e.g. , buttons , wheels , etc. ) .
The proposed solution is the adoption of " haptic " display technologies which allow for some tactile feedback from touch screen displays .
Apple proposes including a grid of piezoelectronic actuators that can be activated on command .
By fluctuating the frequency of these actuators , the user will " feel " different surfaces as their finger moves across it .
As an example , a display could include a virtual click wheel which vibrates at a different frequency as the center .
Users could easily sense the difference and use the click wheel without having to look at it .
Haptic technology has started gaining adoption in other mobile phones and there had been some talk that Apple might have been looking to adopt it .
Fingerprint Identification as an Input Method
A second very intriguing patent application suggests the detection of a user 's individual fingerprints as an input method .
Fingerprints have already been used in computers for security purposes , but Apple 's research involves the use of fingerprint patterns to actually identify distinct fingers .
This could then be used to produce specific functions depending on which finger is being used .
As shown in the table below , an index finger press might perform one action ( PLAY / STOP ) while a middle finger press could fast forward .
The reason for such a distinction again falls back on non-visual usage .
Instead of requiring the user to find a button on the touchscreen , the use of different fingers alone could trigger different commands .
RFID Reader
Finally , the last notable application covers the dual use of a touch screen as an RFID reader .
RFID tags are small circuits that can be embedded in objects for identification using a special reader .
Apple suggests that the an RFID antenna can be placed in the touch sensor panel itself , allowing it to also be used as a RFID reader .
As RFID tags become more prevalent , this could add a very useful function to future touch screen devices .
In a move that caught the sheriff ’s office off guard , the county board on Tuesday voted to decriminalize possession of less than 10 grams of pot in unincorporated areas of Cook County .
Those are the parts of the county not claimed by Chicago or its suburbs .
Leading the charge was Cmsr. Earlean Collins , a Democrat who admitted her grandson was busted for carrying a small amount of marijuana .
She said arrests like that clog the jails .
“ They got my grandson ... he had a half of joint in the car , ” Collins said .
“ They stopped him .
They took him to the police station .
They impounded his car and let him out the next morning .
Why do that ?
“ A lot of kids make a mistake , have a little marijuana , and they can avoid going to jail or court . ”
A spokesman for Sheriff Tom Dart , whose deputies and officers would administer the law , said the sheriff ’s office was caught off guard by the timing of the vote .
Spokesman Steve Patterson said the sheriff was expecting a series of public hearings before a vote .
Instead , the vote was taken on the same day the county board voted to scale back last year ’s controversial sales tax hike .
“ We ’d like there to be some discussion on it before it takes effect , ” Patterson said .
If Stroger signs the ordinance , it would take effect in 60 days .
Stroger said he was n’t sure if he ’ll sign or veto it .
“ I do n’t know , ” Stroger told CBS2 .
“ I was n’t paying enough attention to it .
I ’ll find out about it later .
I ca n’t comment on it . ”
The ticket option also means a bust wo n’t result in a criminal record .
It was unclear , however , what might happen to repeat offenders .
Collins said an administrative procedure would be available to those who want to fight a ticket .
Commissioner Gregg Goslin , a Republican who voted against the measure , said any laws to decriminalize pot should be done by the state .
“ You ca n’t have a patchwork quilt of law in every county .
That law should be voted on at the state level , ” Goslin said .
“ It gives too much discretion to police officers .
It ’s either against the law or it ’s not .
You need to have one standard .
“ I think it was as the wrong thing to do . ”
Nearly five years ago , Mayor Daley embraced a police sergeant ’s proposal to ticket people for small amounts of marijuana — from $ 250 for 10 grams of pot to $ 1,000 for 20 to 30 grams — but the plan never got off the ground .
“ It ’s decriminalized now , ” Daley said at the time .
“ They throw all the cases out .
It does n’t mean anything .
You just show up to court .
Another case goes out .
That 's all it is .
There 's nothing there .
They do n’t even show up — the offenders .
It does n’t mean anything . ”
Green States :
So far , 13 states have passed some form of decriminalization of marijuana .
The laws vary , but generally people caught with small amounts face fines or drug rehab programs rather than jail time .
In Illinois , possession of 2.5 grams or less is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $ 1,500 fine .
Here are the 13 states :
Alaska -- California -- Colorado -- Maine -- Massachusetts -- Minnesota -- Mississippi -- Nebraska -- Nevada -- New York -- North Carolina -- Ohio -- Oregon

Friday , July 3rd , 2009 | Written by Adam Ulick
U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs said this week that it believes that online gambling will eventually be legalized in the United States and several European gaming companies could benefit .
In a report to investors , Goldman Sachs used PartyGaming , operator of Party Poker , as a basis for determining the U.S. market ’s size , saying , “ Based on a simple ‘ grossing up ’ of Party Gaming ’s rake relative to its 9 % market share , the US poker market alone was worth $ 1.5 bn in 2008 . ”
If the U.S. were to legalize and regulate online gambling , the investment firm estimated that the poker market could actually be $ 3 billion , given that 30 percent of brick and mortar players start playing online and $ 300 in gross gaming revenue ( GGR ) is made per player .
Increase those numbers to 45 percent and $ 400 , and the U.S. market for poker alone could be as large as $ 6 billion .
Goldman Sachs estimates that the online casino market , which includes games such as online blackjack , slots , and roulette , would be of similar size , making the potential U.S. online gambling market as great as $ 12 billion .
The process will not be a fast one , warned Sachs , as is evidenced by the fact that the hearings for Representative Barney Frank ’s latest legislation to regulate online gambling have been pushed back to September .
The lure of tax revenue , though , should eventually push the federal government to allow gambling on the internet .
Goldman Sachs named four companies – PartyGaming , 888 , Playtech , and bwin – as ones that should significantly benefit from a re-opening of the United States online gambling market .
All of them , said the bank , “ have sufficient scale and own proprietary poker and / or casino software . ”
Essentially , they are all large enough and established enough to be in good position to grab a piece of the U.S. pie , when given the opportunity .
Of the four , bwin and Playtech are the two that Goldman Sachs believes have the highest ceiling .
Why ?
Because they would not only have the business - to - consumer ( B2C ) opportunities ( new player acquisition ) , but also the business - to - business ( B2B ) opportunities .
Both firms operate poker networks ( bwin owns the Ongame network and Playtech owns iPoker ) and are thus in the position to license out their software packages to companies who wish to enter the U.S. market .
Playtech , in particular , is also very strong in the online casino arena and has many licensees .
Goldman Sachs said that a major reason that neither PartyGaming nor 888 would see their share prices rise as much as bwin and Playtech should they all get the opportunity to enter the U.S. market is that this opportunity has already been factored into the companies ’ values .
Of the two , PartyGaming could have the best chance for growth , with 117 percent accretion in the B2C realm and 40 percent accretion in B2B .
If B2B provides the strongest opportunities , then Playtech will be in the best position to take advantage .
Interestingly , and this may play into the two companies ’ potential strength in U.S. customer acquisition , Party Poker and 888 come up the most in U.S. Google searches for “ online poker ” , even though both exited the U.S. market about two and a half years ago .
Search engine marketing company Greenlight did a study to see which sites appeared on the first page of results when various searches for poker related terms such as “ poker ” , “ online poker ” , and “ poker chips ” were made on Google .
Party
Poker led all online poker sites , appearing on the first page 45 percent of the time .
888 was close behind at 44 percent .
PokerStars was third place at 37 percent .
Wikipedia was actually the site that came up on the front page the most , 57 percent of the time .

The never ending war of words between former Sec. of State Colin Powell and talk show host Rush Limbaugh escalated today to include Obama Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor .
Powell said of Limbaugh ’s claims of reverse racism that it was , “ nonsense .
” Powell said that the GOP has a race problem .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Powell said , “ Judge Sonia Sotomayor seems like a gifted and accomplished woman .
She certainly has an open and liberal bent of mind but that ’s not disqualifying .
But she seems to have a judicial record that seems to be balanced and tries to follow the law .
And so I hope we do have a spirited set of hearings .
And Supreme Court confirmation hearings tend to always meet that standard .
And she ought to be asked about everything from both the left and the right .
What we ca n’t continue to have is to have somebody like a Judge Sotomayor who is announced , and based on one simple tricky but nonetheless case that the Supreme Court has now decided have her called a “ racist , ” or a “ reverse racist ” and she ought to withdraw her nomination because we ’re mad at her . ”
Advertisements
Powell addressed claims of racism and GOP ’s race problem , “ And when you have non-elected officials such as we have in our party who immediately shout racism or somebody who is quite prominent in the media says the only basis upon which I could possibly have supported Obama was because he was black and I was black even though I laid out my judgment on the candidates , then we still have a problem . ”
This is out of the no duh department , as it should be obvious to anyone who is paying attention that the GOP has a serious race problem .
The Republicans have neglected African American voters for decades , but put the nail in their own coffin when they decided to attack Hispanic voters with their racist stance on immigration .
There are n’t enough white Republicans in the United States for the GOP to win national elections .
Powell was only stating the obvious , when he addressed Limbaugh ’s race based attacks against Sotomayor .
When Limbaugh claims racism , or that Powell only supported Obama because he is black , his overwhelmingly white Republican listener ship eats it up , but he is only serving to further alienate minorities , and push them away from the GOP .
Between bites of a braised lamb shank , Richard von Houtman — or as his black American Express card reads : Baron Richard von Houtman — holds his iPhone sideways to display a recent call .
It 's a Chicago number alongside the name " Siohvaughn . "
As in Siohvaughn Wade , the ex-wife of 27 - year - old Miami Heat demigod Dwyane Wade .
" We spoke for 45 minutes , " von Houtman boasts , traces of a haughty British accent lingering after 20 years in the States .
" She says she 's going to send photos of herself with bruises after being beaten by Dwyane to Pat Riley . "
That 's Heat president Riley and , like many of von Houtman 's claims on this cool Monday afternoon in April , the story is unverifiable .
The squat 64 - year - old bodybuilder with thinning hair shaved to fuzz and the glowing - red complexion of a raw tuna steak is seated next to a patio table at the crowded Latin Café just north of downtown .
He 's dressed in khaki capris , an embroidered designer T - shirt , and loads of diamond jewelry , including a multicolored Jacob watch and a Superman medallion .
" I just do n't understand , " he continues with something resembling sincerity .
" How do you get bruises when you 're black ? "
The crack falls flat , but von Houtman barrels forward .
He 's arranged this lunch with a single objective : to disparage one of the National Basketball Association 's most popular players .
During the hourlong meal , von Houtman lets loose with a barrage of inflammatory allegations that he 'll repeat time and again for the next couple of months : that Dwyane Wade shuffled rapidly through mistresses and physically abused Siohvaughn ; that the star and his entourage transformed their Brickell office into a sex den for groupies ; and that Wade asked the baron to procure Deca - Durabolin , an anabolic steroid .
( Von Houtman says he refused . )
Perhaps more remarkable than the tawdry claims is the fact that von Houtman was until recently in business with Wade .
He claims to be an heir to a butter fortune and an ex-spy , a self - described " 007 without the license to kill . "
In fact , he is a former crony of a slain Dutch hashish kingpin , and U.S. Customs seized his Boca Raton mansion for the connection .
He 's been married five times and has a long , court - recorded history of violence against women .
After one wild episode in the late '90s , he was convicted of battery on three Palm Beach County cops .
In 2007 , he and Wade teamed up to create a chain of upscale sports bars and invest in a charter school company .
Within a year , both firms went down in flames .
In late 2008 , Wade was hit with the first of two breach - of - contract and antitrust lawsuits related to the failed partnerships .
And in January , Siohvaughn filed for divorce , alleging her husband was a serial adulterer who had abandoned their children and infected her with a sexually transmitted disease .
By the end of the month , after Wade filed a libel suit against his ex-wife , she retracted the scandalous claims .
Soon , von Houtman was publicly trumpeting the six - year NBA veteran 's alleged vices , first in letters to Riley and other Heat brass and then to South Florida media .
As with his ex , Wade sued von Houtman for libel .
Through publicists , he has refuted the baron 's claims as " fairy tales . "
And Wade tacitly promised collateral damage in an interview with New Times .
About von Houtman , he said , " Once the truth comes out , [ he 's ] going to be hurt more than me . "
It 's evident only the opening salvos have been fired in what will be an ugly and revelatory public feud that could continue for years — and wreck untold damage on the superstar 's reputation , which is nearly as valuable as his basketball skills .
After chugging a post - meal espresso , von Houtman pays the bill with a hundred , pushes out his chair , and lumbers to the parking lot .
He opens the driver 's door of his white 2009 Rolls Royce Phantom , setting off a chorus of soft dings , and then pauses .
" I do n't hate Dwyane , but I think he 's a fool , " he ruminates solemnly .
" He 'll always be able to make $ 20 million a year playing basketball , but not much more than that .
Why would a company sign on with Dwyane after his name has been smeared through the mud , rather than a LeBron James or somebody like that , who 's kept his dirty business behind closed doors ?
What you 're watching is the downfall of Dwyane Wade . "
----------
In early June , the first warm thunderstorm of hurricane season pummels a drab , custard - colored home just north of downtown Delray Beach .
Inside , a 35 - year - old woman with smeared bright red lipstick and sedate brown eyes recounts the years of abuse to which she claims Richard von Houtman subjected her .
" He would hit me in my legs with a belt so that other people would n't notice , " she says in a mousy voice .
Her 8 - year - old daughter , wearing a one - shouldered red dress , is too transfixed by Babar playing on the tube to notice Mom 's extremely adult talk .
Though most of her claims can be found in court records , the woman says she is still too " terrified " to have her name published .
She was , by von Houtman 's own casual admission , his mistress .
He kept her on the side for four years while he was married to his fifth wife , Hong Kong - born Lily Lee Cheng .
In 1996 , the mistress was a stunning , curvy 23 - year - old nail technician .
Von Houtman was a flashy 51 - year - old rake who drove a white Lamborghini and managed Nautilus Fitness Centers in Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale .
To the young manicurist , whose parents were in debt , the baron represented " a big score . "
The violence began eight months after they began dating , she says .
It was unrelenting .
Behind closed doors , she says , von Houtman punched her , choked her , and forced himself on her on a daily basis .
He loved mixing sex with violence .
In 1996 , she filed a restraining order against him , claiming he had " beat [en ] her with riding crops , " raped her the day before Christmas , and " threatened to kill her if she attempted to leave him , " according to court records .
When she did n't show up in court , the injunction was dropped .
" I was too scared , " she explains .
" I thought he would really kill me if I made the injunction official . "
Von Houtman did massive amounts of drugs , she says , from cocaine to Ecstasy to ingestible steroids .
After two years clean , she blames the baron for addictions to cocaine and other drugs that destroyed her mind .
So does her mother , a tough Swiss immigrant with whom the mistress still lives .
" Her mental problems are his fault , " the mom says with disgust .
" I 'd kill him if I was n't so scared of him myself . "
Von Houtman denies the accusations and says the women have no reason to fear him .
" Have you met [ the mistress ] ?
She 's absolutely insane , " he scoffs .
" I 've never used a drug in my life , except for a couple of glasses of wine , and I 've never beaten a woman . "
Indeed , it might be questionable hearsay if at least two of his ex-wives had n't made remarkably similar allegations in the public record .
Born in Bournemouth , Britain , as Richard Anthony Houtman , he'd been married and divorced three times in his home country before immigrating to South Florida in 1987 at age 42 .
Within two years , he had wed Leslie Frances Drucker , who was 13 years his junior .
It was an apparently violent 13 - week marriage .
During their 1989 West Palm Beach divorce , Drucker submitted photos of her bruised face after alleged beatings and testified that von Houtman often bound her and once punched out her front teeth .
" The husband is a violent and vicious individual who takes delight in assaulting his wife and threatening her life , " declared her lawyer , Martin Haines .
" The wife is in fear for her life and safety as [ von Houtman ] has threatened not only [ Drucker ] but her family , and has bragged to the wife of numerous killings ... he has perpetrated . "
Haines dissected the finances of a man who he says had a big - money lifestyle but no discernible income : " Von Houtman ... claims to obtain all his money in the form of loans from business associates in Amsterdam and from friends and family members .
Regardless of [ his ] lack of employment , in recent years he purchased with cash funds a waterfront home and lot in Boca Raton , Florida , costing $ 1.2 million , and a Lamborghini ...
Houtman has deposited cash money in various bank accounts in South Florida totaling more than $ 600,000 [ in a four - month period ] .
Some deposits were done by wire transfer from Amsterdam , some were direct deposits of foreign currency brought from Europe by Houtman , and some were made by depositing large numbers of small denominations . "
Haines 's conclusion : von Houtman " profits from drug trafficking . "
Indeed , von Houtman admits he had made his money as a real estate speculator working for a " Dutch businessman " named Klaas Bruinsma .
Nicknamed " the Minister , " Netherlands - born Bruinsma was Europe 's most notorious mob boss in the ' 80s , orchestrating the import of hundreds of tons of hashish from Pakistan to Europe .
Von Houtman allows that he took loans and invested for Bruinsma in Florida , including using the drug lord 's Panamanian mortgage company , Villiers Shipping , to buy the Boca Raton mansion where the baron lived from 1989 to 1991 .
Though Bruinsma served three prison stints for drug trafficking and attempted murder , von Houtman insists , " He was a good man , a man of my tastes , and an impeccable dresser .
He was a drug lord , but a legal drug lord : Hash and marijuana are perfectly legal in the Netherlands . "
In 1991 , the trafficker was shot dead in front of the Amsterdam Hilton .
The next year , U.S. Customs seized von Houtman 's Bruinsma - funded Boca house because it had been purchased with proceeds from drug trafficking .
" We are alleging that the narcotics transactions occurred in Europe , " Customs counsel Peter Quinter told reporters at the time , " in violation of foreign drug laws . "
The baron denies " absolutely " that he ever trafficked hashish with Bruinsma or funneled drug money into his partnerships with Wade .
But the confiscation is n't von Houtman 's only run-in with the authorities in his adopted country .
In 1997 , his fifth wife , Cheng , filed a restraining order against him .
On September 8 the next year , three Palm Beach County Sheriff 's Office deputies along with Cheng confronted him at the Boca Raton Nautilus .
When they attempted to arrest him for violating the order , he did not go gracefully .
According to a police report , he shoved the cops and fought back when they tried to cuff him , yelling , " I 'll break your arm ! "
One of the deputies came away with an injured finger .
He was charged with resisting arrest with violence , a felony that would have spelled deportation .
Cheng wrote in a letter to the judge that her husband had " lived a life of bullying and deceiving , " but von Houtman escaped with a misdemeanor battery conviction and probation .
The baron is more boastful than apologetic when he recalls that night of violence .
After a police officer reached for his pepper spray , von Houtman says , " I told him : ' I eat that stuff for breakfast . '
I left the cops lying in a pool of blood .
They would later say that if they knew who I was , they would 've brought ten officers . "
These days , von Houtman dates a 23 - year - old model who he says is a former fling of actor Colin Farrell .
And the roots of his wealth remain opaque .
He claims he has inherited a fortune from his family :
His mother , Dorothy , was the heiress to the Blue Bonnet margarine company ( New Times was unable to verify that claim with ConAgra Foods , the conglomerate that now owns the brand ) .
His military career , which he says included " jumping out of planes into deserts and jungles " for Britain and Israel , was lucrative — but , naturally , top - secret .
Von Houtman 's registered Florida enterprises include only sponsorship of a low - level dirt - biker , according to state files , and ownership of two active companies : Baron Global Industries LLC and Royal Global LLC .
Both are " commodity trading enterprises " whose addresses are listed as von Houtman 's 4,000 - square - foot Isle of Venice townhome in Fort Lauderdale .
" I broker jet fuel and oil deals with foreign countries , " he explains without giving any associates ' names .
" The government contacts I made through my military work have been very useful . "
Despite his diamond jewelry and multiple exotic vehicles , public records show he is not without financial trouble .
American Express is suing him for $ 440,514.96 that the company claims he owes on a black , or no-limit , card issued to him .
And the Isle of Venice crib , which he purchased in 2007 for $ 1.85 million , is in foreclosure .
In short , the baron is perhaps not unique in flash - is - everything South Florida .
But people like him do n't often land partnerships with top - tier sports stars .
----------
When Wade met von Houtman in 2007 , it would have been difficult to name a sports superstar with a cleaner image .
The lithe and aggressive six - foot - four shooting guard had beaten a hard - knocks childhood on Chicago 's South Side .
His father raised him while his drug - addicted mother bounced in and out of jail on petty charges .
The young baller married his longtime girlfriend , Siohvaughn , in 2002 , and they had two boys , Zion and Zaire .
He was picked fifth by the Heat in the 2003 draft , before his senior year at Marquette University .
Even as his national stock rose in 2006 , when he helped lead the Heat to a championship , Wade 's earnest and humble interviews never revealed a trace of prima donna .
In 2007 , Wade was named Father of the Year by the National Father 's Day Committee , which honors dads who show " high accomplishment in their chosen fields ... and enormous achievement as parents . "
( Perhaps the committee has had better classes : Among Wade 's co-honorees were infidelity icons Hulk Hogan and John Edwards . )
He founded a children 's charity , Wade 's World Foundation , and partnered with a similar group run by his then - teammate Alonzo Mourning .
He focused on mentoring poor inner-city children .
" I always said that if I got the opportunity to do something for kids that was n't done for me , I would do that , " he told New Times at a June charity event at the Overtown Youth Center .
" Our whole focus is to deal with kids like me growing up — kids from broken homes , kids that can't see no further than the dirt outside of their house — and give them an opportunity to see the world and understand that there 's a bigger picture . "
Wade entrusted the business of profiting from his fame to a childhood friend .
Since October 2007 , months after going into business with von Houtman , the basketball star 's Chicago buddy , Marcus Andrews , has been president of Wade Global Enterprises LLC , an umbrella company overseeing most of his off - the - court business .
In 2007 , Wade earned an estimated $ 12 million in endorsements , putting him at number ten on Fortune magazine 's list of most marketable athletes , just behind NFL quarterback Peyton Manning .
Which is to say Wade 's reputation was worth hundreds of millions of dollars when the baron met Andrews in late 2006 through a third party .
( Andrews declined to be interviewed , but in response to von Houtman 's myriad claims , said only : " Not true ! " )
Von Houtman says he was initially offered the chance to buy the rights to Wade 's likeness for T - shirt production .
The cost : $ 1 million .
" I had no idea who Dwyane Wade was at the time , " the baron recalls .
" I assumed he was a rapper .
When I looked into him and realized he had the potential to be a megastar , I immediately wanted to get my hooks into him . "
The T - shirt concept met an early demise .
Wade had a clothing contract with Converse , says von Houtman .
But the conversation evolved to include a chain of Hard Rock Café - like restaurants , complete with memorabilia and clothing stores .
A group of restaurateurs joined the project , most prominently Mark Rodberg , co-owner of Bucky 's Bar - B - Que in Boca Raton and Bucky 's Grill in Fort Lauderdale .
On August 6 , 2007 , according to court documents , von Houtman , Rodberg , Wade , and Andrews signed contracts sealing their partnership in an " upscale restaurant concept to be named D Wade's . "
For his licensing rights ,
Wade would receive 10 percent ownership or a minimum compensation of $ 1 million .
He would be required to make four appearances total at the restaurants per year , plus attend each grand opening .
" Mr. Rodberg and Mr. von Houtman led [ me ] to believe that they had much experience and expertise in the restaurant business , " Wade later claimed in court , " and that this deal could make everybody a lot of money . "
Instead , the enterprise was reminiscent of one of the baron 's marriages : stunted , hostile , and a source of copious litigation .
The first , smaller location opened with little fanfare on North Dixie Highway in Boca Raton in February 2008 .
The Fort Lauderdale D Wade's , a massive 34,000 - square - foot restaurant located at 1451 N. Federal Hwy . , launched the next month .
Wade showed up for the grand opening of the dark - wood - and - leather temple - to - the - flat - screen , where waitresses wore skintight referee - striped outfits .
He even brought along his mom .
Professional reviewers never made it to the eateries , but many amateurs were unkind .
" They basically turned the whole restaurant into a huge cheesy bar [ with ] display cases filled with D. Wade stuff , " one Chowhound user commented .
" Food is typical cheap bar food — fried this - and - that , potato skins , burgers , etc ....
What a disappointment . "
Behind the scenes , according to claims
Wade made in court , his partners were hatching schemes to cut him out of profits .
Four months after the Fort Lauderdale location opened , von Houtman sold his stake in the restaurants .
The new owners entered negotiations to expand the chain with former Kentucky governor and KFC founder John Y. Brown — " unbeknownst to Mr. Wade . "
Soon after , Wade claims in court papers , he was asked to invest $ 1 million in an under - construction Aventura location .
He declined .
The Boca Raton D Wade 's aborted in May 2008 .
The Fort Lauderdale restaurant followed suit two months later — right around the time the basketball star helped Team USA win an Olympic gold medal .
Wade then suspended the restaurants ' use of his name , according to court documents , effectively terminating the chain roughly a week before the Aventura location was scheduled to open .
The controversy also spelled the end for a side venture in which the baron claims to be still involved .
The partners had invested in a planned chain of five Fort Lauderdale - based charter high schools , to be called D. Wade 's Schools , that had been founded by a nonprofit called Mavericks in Education .
Wade was given an undisclosed percentage of shares in the schools , which would specialize in reforming dropouts .
The CEO of Mavericks , Mark Thimmig , claims that after the restaurant deal began to go sour , Wade " dropped off the face of the Earth . "
" The contract called for him to take an active part in promoting the schools , " Thimmig says .
" I have n't been able to reach him .
It 's a tragedy of missed opportunity . "
The next year would see Wade named in three lawsuits and damaged by divorce court revelations .
His sparkling image was tarnished for the first time .
----------
On July 17 , 2008 , Wade 's former partners sued the superstar in Miami - Dade Circuit Court , claiming he had not fulfilled his marketing obligations to the restaurants .
He counter - claimed the restaurateurs had attempted to cut him out of expansion plans .
Nine months later , the former partners sued in federal court , citing lost clothing and memorabilia sales and seeking $ 90 million in damages .
( Wade 's lead attorney , Michael Kreitzer , did not respond to emailed questions about the litigation . )
But von Houtman was not content to let the drama unfold in court .
Beginning in late 2008 , he began firing off emails to Pat Riley , lobbying the Heat president to " influence " a settlement to the restaurant lawsuits .
And this past February , he launched a smear campaign against the Heat player , meeting with the Palm Beach Post and New Times to make allegations about Wade 's personal life .
The baron casts Wade as a carousing pothead and provided New Times with a loose timeline of what he calls " disturbing behavior . "
One anecdote includes Wade and actor Jamie Foxx smoking a joint at SoBe 's Mansion Nightclub , with von Houtman tagging along .
Another has the superstar trolling for waitresses at their restaurants and using a rented Brickell office as a " place ... to bring girls to . "
The baron offers no strong evidence to back his claims .
Photos he touts as showing Wade and rapper Trick Daddy smoking weed on a Chicago stage do n't clearly show either man puffing anything .
The only one of von Houtman 's claims that is truly verifiable is the least shocking .
In September 2007 , Wade was driving a $ 400,000 Maybach in Aventura ( while texting , the baron says ) when he plowed into the rear bumper of an old Mercedes waiting at a stop light .
To keep the accident from being reported , von Houtman claims he sent the young female driver a check for the damage .
The woman 's mother , Reva Roiter , confirms that story .
Von Houtman says he is still owed the $ 6,800 he paid for the accident — a figure that represents a paltry 4 percent of Wade 's per -game salary .
For a time , those allegations were overshadowed by claims from Siohvaughn .
The star 's wife had filed for divorce and in January 2009 accused him of cheating on her , infecting her with an unspecified STD , and — perhaps the biggest blow to the former Father of the Year — abandoning his children .
" His failure to spend time with them ... has resulted in the children at times being afraid of him , " she claimed in papers filed in Miami - Dade Family Court .
" In fact , Zion ... does not recognize or know Dwyane ... and has cried uncontrollably the few times that Dwyane has attempted to hold him in his hands . ''
Wade reacted aggressively to the charges from his wife and former partner , filing libel suits against them .
After Siohvaughn withdrew her claims ,
Wade dropped the suit against her .
But the libel claim against the baron continued ; it hinged on the emails sent to Riley , which had become increasingly inflammatory .
" Behind closed doors , Mr. Wade is a bully and a coward , " von Houtman wrote March 15 .
" He and most of your Heat players are smoking , using cocaine and steroids .
I wonder how and why the Heat organization can condone such behavior ...
Is it just about selling tickets ? "
He ended the email , which he also sent to the home of Heat owner Micky Arison , with a flourish : " The Miami Heat : ' Drugs , Sex & Basketball . ' "
" [ Von Houtman 's ] scheme , " the libel complaint alleges , " is to contact Mr. Wade 's employer ... for the purpose of communicating false statements ... [ Von Houtman 's ] motive :
In order to cease from any further wrongful contacts , Mr. Wade should pay him an undisclosed sum of money . "
When he first learned , through a New Times reporter , of the lawsuit , von Houtman was wedged into a table at a downtown Fort Lauderdale Starbucks , swishing a tiny coffee around with thick fingers .
His blue eyes widened , but not with fear .
Defending his claims , he said , will allow him to shovel more dirt on Wade in the public record .
" I have been waiting for Dwyane to come after me like this , " he cooed .
" I will annihilate him . "
But there is one aspect of the lawsuit that truly concerns him : the dismantling of his use of the title " baron . "
" There is no evidence or history of nobility in the von Houtman family , " Wade claims .
Von Houtman faxed New Times two documents he hopes prove his nobility .
The first is an envelope , dated 1962 and from the British government 's War Office , to a " Baron Houtman " — his father , Jack , he says .
The second is a 1971 letter to Richard from the German embassy in London assuring him " every descendant of ... a baron would be called baron or baroness . "
" It 's ridiculous that I have to prove it , " he laments .
" I 've been a baron all my life . "
----------
It 's Thursday , June 11 , and Dwyane Wade is speaking with New Times at the Overtown Youth Center , a cheery after - school building on a desolate block , where he and Mourning are promoting the annual Summer Groove , a July event benefiting their two children 's charities .
He 's dressed casually in a light gray button - down , navy yachting shorts , and ankle - cut Converses ; a massive diamond - encrusted watch dangles from his left wrist .
Sans entourage , he at first toys with the keys of a baby grand piano tucked into the corner of an empty classroom .
As he sits at a desk , he looks gigantic in a room where everything is child - size .
This is a summer of great consequence for Wade .
He and Riley have already begun a public back - and - forth concerning his contract , which expires in 2010 .
Negotiations in the next couple of months could decide whether Wade remains in Miami for the long term .
And then there 's the libel suit he filed less than two weeks ago against his former partner — which he has refused to discuss publicly .
" In this media - driven world , people are going to be looking for attention , " Wade ruminates .
" And what better way to get it than to attack somebody who has the fame ?
But the truth always prevails ...
Once [ it ] comes out , you 're going to be hurt more than me . "
As the interview progresses , Wade 's watchful publicist , Lisa Joseph , sits down beside him .
When the superstar is asked to speak explicitly about the libel suit against von Houtman , he responds , " It 's really pretty simple ... , " before Joseph interjects .
" We 're going to have to end this interview if you can't stay on the charity event , " she says .
" Leave the personal personal , " continues Wade .
And the talk returns to permitted grounds .
Will von Houtman prevail ?
Probably not .
Eight days after this interview , the Heat star met President Obama at the White House for a summit on fatherhood .
But it likely will be years before Wade is free from the remnants of his disastrous business partnership — and the libel suit has done little to muzzle von Houtman .
Of the hoopster 's meeting with Obama , the baron complains , " The president is making a fool of himself . "
Then he makes several phone calls to Washington and recounts his claims to White House receptionists .
— Rolfe Winkler is a Reuters columnist .
The views expressed are his own —
By Rolfe Winkler
NEW YORK , July 6 ( Reuters ) – Credit default swaps nearly brought down the world financial system last fall when it was discovered that AIG Financial Products had written hundreds of billions of dollars worth of credit protection without setting aside sufficient reserves .
Yet since then , pathetically little has been done to get this corner of the derivatives market under control .
There ’s a simple way to fix the problem .
Regulate CDS as insurance .
That could happen if some state insurance legislators get their way .
Treating these financial weapons of mass destruction as insurance rather than swaps would subject them to sensible regulation .
But Wall Street is fighting the idea because it would hammer profits and , more importantly , force them to reduce leverage .
Are credit default swaps insurance ?
As with insurance contracts , the seller of credit protection promises to reimburse the buyer ’s losses in case his creditor defaults .
If that sounds like an insurance policy , that ’s because it is .
I recently attended a conference on derivatives regulation where a trader argued that CDS are n’t insurance .
Asked to describe their precise function , he struggled mightily for the correct infinitive , finally settling on “ to insure . ”
Why the obfuscation ?
For one thing , to pump up the real estate bubble Wall Street needed a cheap way to hide risk , for securities they marketed to investors and for their own balance sheet .
Toxic CDOs “ wrapped ” by an AIG insurance policy were suddenly marketable as AAA - rated investments .
Risky assets retained on Wall Street ’s collective balance sheet could be “ hedged ” with CDS in lieu of holding actual capital .
In properly regulated insurance markets , when insurers ramp up risk , their regulators force them to increase reserves .
As risks rise , so does the cost of insurance .
Had credit protection been properly regulated , it would have been too expensive to enable the fiction that subprime risk , wherever held , was somehow free .
Consequently , it ’s likely that risk would n’t have been manufactured in the first place .
Another reason to confuse the issue is that Wall Street makes markets trading CDS , a far more profitable business than selling insurance policies .
Selling insurance is pretty boring thanks to regulations that date back to 18th - century England .
In a recently published paper in the Connecticut Insurance Law Journal , Arthur Kimball - Stanley argues that , in its earliest days , insurance policies were often used to gamble .
Policies could be purchased for items that were n’t yours , and for amounts greater than the insured property was worth .
The moral hazard is obvious : Unregulated insurance gave speculators incentives to destroy property .
CDS turn investors into gamblers , allowing them to bet on corporate failure .
Take Delphi Corp .
When the auto - parts maker filed bankruptcy last fall , investors held $ 20 billion worth of CDS that referenced only $ 2.0 billion worth of bonds .
If CDS were subject to insurance laws , investors would be required to show an interest in the insured bonds .
This would drastically reduce trading volumes , hammering Wall Street ’s profits .
It would also reduce systemic risk .
The bank lobby counters that regulating CDS as insurance would restrict liquidity .
It would , but that ’s a red herring .
Wall Street is more concerned with the profitability of their trading desks and their ability to continue hiding risk .
And in any case , markets functioned fine before CDS .
With no solutions coming out of Washington , state authorities are taking the first steps to restore order .
This week the National Conference of Insurance Legislators , or NCOIL , will discuss model legislation for credit default insurance .
New York State Assemblyman Joseph Morelle , the chairman of the state ’s Committee on Insurance , is leading NCOIL ’s task force that drafted the legislation .
“ Credit default insurance can provide a very valuable function in the market by protecting legitimate credit investors , ” he argues .
“ But sacrificing fundamental business practices at the altar of liquidity is dangerous . ”
And very expensive .
The $ 183 billion needed so far to rescue AIG is but a fraction of the bill .
To it must be added much of the cost of recapitalizing the entire financial sector , which grew ridiculously overleveraged thanks to unregulated CDS .
All of this could have been avoided by applying the same laws to CDS that we apply to other insurance markets .
If we miss this opportunity to do so , expect banks to create new risks that will plunge the world back into the financial abyss .
Inflammation often causes more irreversible damage than the initial trauma , but this secondary damage , considered inevitable , may one day be preventable , the scientists say in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The compound , called Brilliant Blue G , blocks the cascade of events that leads to inflammation following a traumatic injury of the spinal cord , researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center report in a study involving rats .
July 29 , 2009 -- A compound that 's similar to the blue food dye in Gatorade and M&Ms may hold promise for people with spinal cord injuries , new research says .
Blue Dye Prevents Inflammation
After researchers led by Maiken Nedergaard , MD , director of neuromedicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center , injected Brilliant Blue G into rats with spinal cord injuries , the rodents showed improved mobility and even hobbled about .
They also temporarily turned blue .
Injured rats that were not given a dose of the blue dye did n’t walk at all .
The results of the study build on research by Nedergaard that was published in 2004 in the journal Nature Medicine .
That study showed that a substance called ATP , the energy source that keeps cells alive , runs out of control at the site of a spinal cord injury , activating a molecule known to cause inflammation and kill spinal neuron cells .
For these neurons , inflammation often causes more damage than the initial trauma to the spine , meaning that for treatment to work it must be administered immediately after the spinal cord injury .
Brilliant Blue G blocks ATP from flooding the spinal injury and triggering inflammation , the researchers say .
The authors say there is no effective way to “ treat acute spinal cord injury , apart from the use of steroids , which provide at best modest protection to a subset of patients . ”
Nedergaard says that although her research offers a promising new possible approach to treating spinal cord injuries , more research is needed .
Legendary Sims and Spore creator Will Wright is ready to try something new .
Electronic
Arts announced today that its Maxis guru is leaving to head up what 's described as a new " entertainment think tank " called Stupid Fun Club .
Wright has been self - funding Stupid Fun Club , which has operated out of a Berkeley warehouse , for nearly a decade .
The club has focused mainly on designing and building robots , as well as creating video productions based on them .
Wright and EA will co-own Stupid Fun Club , which will focus on developing new cross-media IP for games , movies , TV and toys .
EA has the right to develop game concepts that emerge from the think tank , and both the company and Wright have an equal stake .
Gamasutra spoke to Wright 's 12 - year colleague , EA Maxis VP and general manager Lucy Bradshaw , who says Wright 's been incubating this course for Stupid Fun Club since 2001 , " and it was something we agreed to and talked about within EA . "
Wright 's interested in pioneering new directions in IP , Bradshaw says , and has been " playing around with robots and these types of things ... as we were doing Spore , this has been one of his dreams . "
She sees Stupid Fun Club as more of an " evolution " on EA 's relationship with Wright and less a departure .
" It really is a partnership , where Will is going to be investing his time in Stupid Fun Club incubating new IP ... [ while ]
Maxis will continue to develop its own IP , and clearly we 're very focused on Spore . "
Bradshaw explains how EA 's partnership with Wright works on a business level -- both parties have an equal stake in the new organization and seats on the Board .
An unspecified third party has a " small " equity share and a Board spot , too .
" Will is going to be developing IP for many different forms of media , " Bradshaw explains .
" EA has a profit share in that , and has the right to do any game development [ on Wright 's concepts ] should we decide . "
So EA is entitled to first dibs on video game projects from Super Fun Club concepts .
" Having worked with Will before , there 's great potential for that kind of collaboration again , " says Bradshaw .
But should EA pass , other companies are free to develop Wright 's game concepts , including EA 's competitors -- although the fact that EA gets a profit share of any project created might suffice to ward off competitors even without an exclusivity deal .
Wright will also work with other media companies like TV , film and toys on extensions of his ideas .
" It 's exciting -- I 'd like to see where he 's going to branch out to , " says Bradshaw .
" There are areas of IP that really do n't fit within EA 's portfolio that he does want to pursue . "
Says Wright in a statement : " The entertainment industry is moving rapidly into an era of revolutionary change .
Stupid Fun Club will explore new possibilities that are emerging from this sublime chaos , and create new forms of entertainment on a variety of platforms . "
Wright also says he 's looking forward to continuing to work with his EA colleagues , and CEO John Riccitiello pledges his support for the venture .
" We believe in Will 's vision for Stupid Fun Club and we 're looking forward to partnering with Will and his team long into the future , " he says .
Maxis was founded by Wright and Jeff Braun in 1989 , and its innovative world and life sims SimCity and The Sims broke PC sales records and attained widespread cultural permeation .
The studio was acquired by EA in 1997 .
Bradshaw will continue to run Maxis and the upcoming products in the Spore franchise , while Rod Humble and his EA Play label will launch The Sims 3 in June of this year .
" Will has been an inspiration to our teams , and it 's been rewarding for us to bring his ideas to life , " she says .
" In addition to legendary games , Will 's legacy at EA will be the many talented people who worked with him and will now continue to contribute their own vision to the art of game development . "

Below a look at some of his astounding recent work .

The unpleasant incident in Cambridge , where a police officer arrested a professor after mistakenly thinking he was an intruder in his own home , has unfortunately become a national issue dominated by the question of race .
But race need not have anything to do with it .
I see this as another example of police abuse in our increasingly authoritarian country .
Conservatives are used to talking about the government as being tyrannical , socialist , and oppressive .
When John Ashcroft was being confirmed for Attorney General , Ted Kennedy mocked him for his belief that the 2nd Amendment was meant to ward of tyranny , since in the left - liberal ’s mindset , the democratic government can never be tyrannical .
But here ’s the interesting thing .
If the government is tyrannical , then so must be the police forces , which constitute the enforcement arm of the state .
If taxation is oppressive , it is only being carried out under threat of imprisonment and fines , which are administered by the police .
If gun control is tyranny , and it most certainly is , then the officers enforcing it must also be acting tyrannically .
It is impossible to have Big Brother and a benign police force .
If a police officer mistakenly enters a private home without permission , on a good faith misunderstanding that he is there to protect private property , I would certainly not react rudely .
But this standard should apply to non-officers of the law , too .
Under the natural law , we all have the same rights and limits on our behavior .
If a concerned neighbor came into my home thinking something was amiss , he ’d be a good - faith trespasser , and I ’d similarly treat him with some charitable respect .
However , being rude to someone for being in your home without your permission is not a crime .
Depriving someone of their liberty , even for a few hours , is a crime .
Arresting someone in their own home for being rude to you is an unjust act .
The police officer acted tyrannically , no matter how belligerent the professor was in his own home .
( Yes , I know he followed the cop out and continued to yell , but that ’s not an arrestable offense , either .
The officer should have driven away . )
Unfortunately , many on talk radio have jumped to defend the police , insisting that if you are rude to police , you get what you deserve , and if you are obedient to them , you will get along fine .
The latter is not always true , of course , in our increasingly militarized police state , where grandmas and little kids are being tasered , handcuffed and beaten ; where generally non-threatening people are shot in the back and rounded up in staggering amounts to fill up the government ’s cages .
“ My home is my castle ” is a central value in a free society grounded in property rights .
If police and bureaucrats can enter your castle freely , the free society is gone .
When Cory Maye defended his home against an intruder , he was sentenced , at first , to the death penalty — all because the intruder was a cop .
This is all backwards .
Police do not have any rights under natural law than anyone else does .
If some normal American broke into Maye ’s home — or a cop ’s home — regardless of his reason , and was shot dead , it would be a tragedy but few people would want the protector of his home to be executed .
This overall attitude is the attitude of a statist , and it is a double standard reeking of moral relativism .
The law is unchanging and it applies to all of us , regardless of what uniforms we are wearing .
It will be impossible to combat Obama ’s plans to erect ever more socialism and authoritarianism so long as so many opponents of his regime have a fetish for police power .
As Mao said , political power grows out of the barrel of a gun .
That gun is typically holstered next to a taser on the belt of an officer of the law .
Their enforcement of unjust laws is a key part of the problem .
So long as so many Americans consider rudeness to a cop to be an arrestable offense , we will never have our sweet land of liberty .
After Spain virtually ruled out imposing a " 3 - strikes " regime for illicit file - sharers , the entertainment industries said they would target 200 BitTorrent sites instead .
Now a judge has decided that sharing between users for no profit via P2P does n't breach copyright laws and sites should be presumed innocent until proved otherwise .
The entertainment industries in Spain must be progressively tearing their hair out in recent months as they experience setback after setback .
Most recently the ‘ Coalition of Creators and Content Industries ’ – which includes the likes of Promusicae and SGAE – had demanded a “ 3 - strikes ” regime for illicit file - sharers , but after they failed to provide viable and attractive authorized alternatives , ISPs lost patience and called off government - mandated talks .
The Coalition quickly backtracked , suggesting they would accept some type of throttling instead , but that fell largely on deaf ears too .
Then new Coalition president Aldo Olcese said that the solution would be to go after the country ’s 200 torrent sites instead , but this could also prove problematic .
Time and again Spanish courts have ruled that sites that link to infringing content are not illegal , providing profits are n’t made directly from any infringement .
But of course , wealthy operations like SGAE are n’t put off by such rulings and instead go after eDonkey and BitTorrent sites privately , often demanding that they are forced to close via injunction in advance of a full court hearing to assess their legality .
One such case involves the eD2 K link site elrincondejesus.com .
On May 13th the site received a complaint from none other than every Spanish sharing site ’s nemesis , SGAE .
Alleging Elrincondejesus “ abused ” its members copyrights , the site ’s owner was summoned to appear in court on June 5th .
At this hearing various things would be discussed , but SGAE hoped to get an early decision to suspend the operations of Elrincondejesus immediately , in advance of the full hearing which would happen at a later date .
On his site , the owner commented : “ As you know Elrincondejesus.com never had advertising ( or has now ) .
I ’m innocent and the only thing that I have done is provided links to other sites , like thousands of search engines in the world . ”
There would be a month long wait for the court ’s decision but today it came .
The judge dismissed SGAE ’s request for an immediate shutdown of Elrincondejesus .
“ P2P networks , as a mere transmission of data between Internet users , do not violate , in principle , any right protected by Intellectual Property Law , ” said Raul N. García Orejudo , a judge in Barcelona .
Although some activities are barred , those do not concern P2P he said , noting that there has to be a presumption of innocence .
Speaking with Elmundo.es , attorney Carlos Almeida - Sanchez said : “ This is the first time a court clearly states that P2P itself does not violate any rights . ”
On possible infringements of the Intellectual Property Act , the court said :
“ Adding a work or video recording to Emule , that has previously been converted to a compatible computer file , is not an act of reproduction , ” adding that “ Copying is not a profitable use , or collective use [ such as broadcasting in a store ] , as these two terms refer to the subsequent use made of the work once downloaded , after the copy . ”
Additionally , the Intellectual Property
Act describes distribution as needing something tangible , as in distribution via a website for example , which in this case ( as it ’s P2P ) does not exist .
However , the court order recognizes the possibility that public distribution may have occurred but this is difficult to prove , since any sharing could ’ve taken place with just one person .
The full trial will take place at a later date .
The sweet music of revenge : Singer pens YouTube hit after United Airlines breaks his guitar ... and shares plunge 10 %
When airlines damage or lose their passenger 's luggage , they normally - perhaps grudgingly - end up paying back compensation of a few hundred pounds .
But United Airlines are much more out of pocket in this case .
The company has lost 10 per cent of their share value - a massive $ 180 million - after being blamed for damaging a musician 's guitar .
See the video below :
Canadian singer Dave Carroll composed United Breaks Guitars after his Taylor acoustic was damaged at Chicago 's O'Hare airport .
His song has become a YouTube hit with nearly four million views in 10 days .
In the music video , Carroll relates his story , of how in spring 2008 he was travelling to Nebraska when other passengers exclaimed : ' They 're [ the baggage handlers ] are throwing guitars down there !'
Sure enough , his Taylor guitar had been smashed .

He went through a year of trying to gain compensation from the airline before being flatly told by an employee only known as Ms Irlweg : ' No ' .
So he took revenge - and , to his astonishment , soared to fame .
The catchy United Breaks Guitars - which cost just £ 90 to make - became a viral hit , and Carroll found himself appearing on U.S. breakfast shows , with his group Sons of Maxwell 's album flying off the shelves for the first time ever .
And as shares of United plummeted , horrified executives quickly offered Carroll money for the repair costs and flight vouchers worth £ 700 .
He told the airline to donate the sum to charity instead .
The guitar would have cost about £ 1,000 to fix .

[ caption ]
And it 's not over yet .
Carroll has composed another two songs about the incident , and the next one - about his dealings with customer relations , Ms Irlweg in particular - will be online soon .
United must be bracing itself for the onslaught , though Carroll has promised that the song will ' not be unkind ' to the unfortunate Ms Irlweg .
Carroll told the BBC today : ' I asked myself : " if Michael Moore was a singer - songwriter , what would he do ? " and I gathered my tools together and said I would write three songs about the airline , make videos about the airline and share them with the world . '
He said he was amazed to get so many hits - he had hoped to receive a million over the course of the year .
His song has helped him financially though - it is currently the 20th best - selling track on the Itunes music sale website in Canada .
Taylor Guitars has offered him a new guitar to use in upcoming music videos .
United Airlines said they would like to the video use for training purposes to ensure all customers receive better service from the company in future .
GURGAON , India 
It was supposed to be a showcase for how the United States and India can find common cause in fighting climate change : Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton toured an innovative , energy - efficient office building on Sunday in this city on the outskirts of New Delhi .
But simmering grievances about how countries should share the burden of cutting greenhouse gases abruptly changed the mood .
No sooner had Mrs. Clinton marveled at the building ’s environmentally friendly features  like windows that flood rooms with light but keep out heat  than her hosts vented frustration at American pressure on India to cut its emissions .
In a meeting with Mrs. Clinton , India ’s environment and forests minister , Jairam Ramesh , said there was “ no case ” for the West to push India to reduce carbon dioxide emissions when it already had among the lowest levels of emissions on a per capita basis .
“ If this pressure is not enough , ” he said , “ we also face the threat of carbon tariffs on our exports to countries such as yours . ”
Rather than projecting solidarity , the visit ended up laying bare the deep divide between developed and developing countries on climate policy  a gulf the Obama administration will have to bridge as it tries to forge a new global agreement on climate change later this year .
The illegal exporting of waste carries a maximum two - year jail sentence Brazil is to lodge a formal complaint that alleged illegal shipments of UK toxic waste have breached international conventions , its government has said .
Environment Agency officers and police in Britain raided three properties in the Swindon area of Wiltshire this week , arresting men aged 24 , 28 and 49 .
They want 1,400 tonnes of waste from 99 containers , said to include condoms and syringes , returned for inspection .
Brazil 's president has criticised rich countries for sending rubbish abroad .
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said many of them claimed to be opposed to pollution .
But he added : " Who is going to recycle a condom ?
Who is going to recycle hospital waste ?
The Environment Agency ... will not hesitate to prosecute any company or individuals found to have breached the strict laws on the export of waste
Liz Parkes , Environment Agency
" The only way out is for the containers to be sent back where they came from .
We do n't want to export our rubbish or to import the rubbish of others . "
Brazilian diplomats are to lodge a complaint with the organisation in Geneva , run by the United Nations , which oversees international codes governing the transport of hazardous material .
It is based on the Basel Convention , which bans shipments of toxic waste from industrialised nations , Brazil 's foreign ministry said in a statement .
It wants the origin of the containers traced and to find out how they ended up in three Brazilian ports - Santos , near Sao Paulo , and two others in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul .
The Environment Agency said it could not confirm claims the shipping containers held a mixture of household and clinical waste .
It said it plans to search through the rubbish once it has been returned to the UK and ensure it is handled and disposed of properly .
Prosecution threat
The three men were released on bail on Friday , pending further investigations .
Their passports have been seized , but for legal reasons , they can not be identified .
Head of waste Liz Parkes said the arrests marked " significant progress " in the investigation and that the agency was arranging for the waste to be shipped back to the UK .
She said : " The Environment Agency enforces the export of recyclable waste from England and Wales , and will not hesitate to prosecute any company or individuals found to have breached the strict laws on the export of waste .
" The United Kingdom has taken a strong global lead to stamp out the illegal waste trade , in order to protect people and the environment . "
Waste can be sent abroad for recycling , but it is illegal to export it for disposal .
The maximum penalty for illegally exporting waste is an unlimited fine or two years in prison .

Where stocks go from here will , of course , depend on the course of the economy .
Some economists caution that the incipient economic recovery could falter , resulting in a double - dip recession that would snuff out the recent stock market rally .
But for now , the optimists say that poking holes in recent earnings statements misses the point .
Investors , as ever , are looking ahead , and they are bullish on the prospects of many companies .
“ The excitement is where we might be 12 months from now , ” said David Kovacs , the chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners .
“ It does require some leap of faith , but I find this rally extremely justifiable . ”
Others point out that the improvement in the financial markets will help companies recover .
Many companies , including AT&T and Xerox , have managed to sell new shares to primp their balance sheets and raise cash .
Others have sold bonds as the credit markets have thawed .
Ford and others have refinanced their credit lines  a feat that would have been difficult , if not impossible , to pull off only months ago .
And big banks , though suffering from bad loans , have at least stabilized .
Stephen Stanley , the chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital , said that during this recession companies have cut back far more quickly and efficiently than they did in the past .
“ Firms are now much more nimble in terms of their payroll , ” he said .
But given the deep cuts , Mr. Stanley said the worry is that even though the economy might recover , employment could lag .

IT HAS been a long time since comments on the economy by an official of America 's Federal Reserve comments could be described as cheerful .
Yet there was no denying the upbeat tone of Ben Bernanke 's testimony to Congress on Tuesday July 21st .
Markets have experienced “ notable improvements , ” the Fed 's chairman told Congress .
The fear of investors has “ eased somewhat , ” and “ many markets are functioning more normally . ”
As for the economy , consumer spending has been stable , the drop in the housing market has moderated and many “ of our trading partners are also seeing signs of stabilisation . ”
His fingers may be crossed but it is clear that Mr Bernanke thinks the recession , if not over now , soon will be .
That is a far cry , though , from seeing a threat from inflation and Mr Bernanke made it clear that the federal funds target rate , now near zero , will remain there for a long time .
On Wall Street , most reckon that means until well into 2010 at least .
Yet the Fed is already under pressure to explain how it intends to tighten monetary policy , even by congressmen who usually want nothing of the sort .
The source of their angst is the explosion in the size of the Fed 's balance sheet .
It has financed its emergency loans to the financial system and purchases of long - term government and mortgage - related bonds ( the latter designed to push down long - term interest rates ) by printing money , or , more technically , creating new reserves for banks .
Such reserves now stand at $ 782 billion compared with a typical level of around $ 10 billion before the crisis .
And people who know nothing else about inflation do understand that it is what you get if you print enough money .
In fact the connection between bank reserves and inflation is rather weak .
Inflation is the result of demand exceeding supply .
Excess reserves are only a problem if banks turn them into new loans that generate new spending .
That 's unlikely to happen when the demand for credit is in the ditch and loan losses are crimping banks ' capital and lending capacity .
Still , both loan demand and bank capital will be healthy again some day .
Whether inflation follows depends on if the Fed raises interest rates in time and thereby curbs the appetite for credit .
Mr Bernanke spent much of his testimony explaining how he can do just that .
First , the Fed can pay higher interest on those reserves , giving an incentive to banks to leave them at the Fed rather than turn them into loans .
It could , if necessary , induce banks to lock up the reserves for long periods by offering them the equivalent of certificates of deposit .
It could soak up those reserves by borrowing from financial firms in the form of secured loans called “ reverse repos . ”
And if necessary , it could sell some of its bonds , which would push up long - term interest rates .
That , though , is not a preferred option .
Politics could also interfere with the Fed 's willingness to tighten monetary policy in time .
Congress 's nonpartisan investigative arm , the Government Accountability Office , can now audit the Fed with the exception of its monetary policy , lending programmes or relations with foreign central banks .
A bill in Congress would lift those prohibitions .
Mr Bernanke argued that the threat of such audits would lead investors to question the Fed 's willingness to do unpopular things , like tighten monetary policy , unsettling them and driving up long - term interest rates .
This is not idle speculation .
Anti-Fed sentiment was also strong in the 1970s , when Congress first sought to have the GAO audit the central bank .
Arthur Burns , chairman at the time , fought back , and a compromise was struck to allow audits , but with the current prohibitions .
Mr Burns later reflected that the effort of “ warding off legislation that could destroy any hope of ending inflation ” involved “ political judgments ” that may have weakened his anti-inflationary resolve .
For all the discussion , any tightening of policy is a long way off .
Housing may be stabilising but Mr Bernanke noted that commercial - property borrowers are struggling to refinance ; their defaults may pose the next big threat to the banking system .
While the threat of deflation disappeared from the Fed 's official post - meeting statement last month , it reappeared in the monetary - policy report that accompanied Mr Bernanke 's testimony .
The focus of monetary policy , it said , is “ to prevent a sustained decline in inflation below levels consistent ” with the Fed 's goals .
The report also noted that despite their success in raising new capital , banks ' lending contracted by nearly 7 % at an annual rate in the first half of the year .
That 's due both to lower demand and tighter lending standards : unused lines of credit fell by a dramatic 30 % in the first quarter .
Indeed , further easing should not be ruled out .
But how ?
Not only is the Fed funds rate in effect at zero , but the Fed 's foray into bond buying did not have the intended impact on long - term rates : they have risen , not fallen .
That is partly because of lower panicked demand for the shelter of bonds but also fear that such purchases would ultimately lead to inflation .
No wonder Mr Bernanke likes to discuss his options for tightening monetary policy ; they are better than his options for easing .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : X Haskell Bindings 0.3
I 'd like to announce the 0.3 . * series release of the X Haskell Bindings .
This release , like the prior 0.2.* series focuses on making the API prettier .
This release is based on the XCB protocol descriptions version 1.5
This does mean that there 's a good chance this is a breaking release for any code compiled against 0.2 .*.
The goal of XHB is to provide a Haskell implementation of the X11 wire protocol , similar in spirit to the X protocol C - language Binding ( XCB ) .
On Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xhb
Source : darcs get http://community.haskell.org/~aslatter/code/xhb/
New this release : * In 0.2 , a lot of the core protocol requests , events and replies were updated to use prettier Haskell datatypes for the various enums and bitmasks .
Thanks to Peter Harris 's work on the protocol description XML files , these niceties have extended out to all of the extension requests , events and replies and such .
*
Due to name clashes , I the type - names for events and errors now include an " Event " or " Error " suffix .
For example , the type " Notify " has become " NotifyEvent " .
* Now based on the protocol description version 1.5 , from 1.4 .

Because episode three is 37 minutes long , it was hard for BBC2 to schedule in the UK , and it was also felt that the short running time would make the episode feel curiously light .
The first three episodes were therefore edited down into episodes one and two for the UK .
This was mostly achieved by trimming within existing scenes ; few scenes were actually lost .
The final two episodes of the first series were also edited into a single double - length episode , possibly because it was around the Christmas period and was easier to fit into the holiday schedule than two regular - length slots .

THE ELECTRIC COUGH -SYRUP ACID TEST
From " Poor Man's PCP , " by Jim Hogshire , in the Spring issue of Pills - a - go - go , " the journal of pills , " published by Hogshire in Seattle .
This issue 's pill review is devoted to a chemical called Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide , the " DM " in DM cough syrups such as Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough .
It 's one of the most mystifying drugs in the pharmacopia .
Even though it can be found in virtually every over - the - counter cold , flu , and cough remedy , most reference works hardly mention it ; when they do , their information is sketchy and sometimes contradictory .
One reference book called it a " narcotic antagonist " with " very good analgesic " properties .
Other descriptions say DM is a cough suppressant only and does not kill pain .
It is supposedly non-addicting .
And it 's not supposed to get you high -- though legions of high - school and college students have formed an entirely different opinion .
DM produces " full warping of subspace , " in the words of one experimenter , who took more than the recommended dosage .
" Pin Head with expansive arms / legs .
Incredible head size .
Warping and folding of body .
Incredible spatial distortions . "
With this in mind , your faithful editor decided to carry out a Robitussin experiment of his own .
Last night I drank about eight ounces of DM cough syrup .
I was feeling kind of achy and wanted to see if it would kill pain .
After a couple of hours all my pain had gone away , and I went to bed .
It was midnight , but I felt neither awake nor asleep .
It was like a typical narcotic high - - mildly content , kind of nodding -- but not as pleasant .
At four o'clock in the morning I woke up suddenly and remembered that I had to go to Kinko 's copy shop and that I had to shave off about a week 's worth of stubble from my face .
These ideas were very clear to me .
That may seem normal , but the fact was that I had a reptilian brain .
My whole way of thinking and perceiving had changed .
I had full control over my motor functions , but I felt ungainly .
I was detached from my body , as if I were on laughing gas .
So I got in the shower and shaved .
While I was shaving I " thought " that for all I knew I was hacking my face to pieces .
Since I did n't see any blood or feel any pain I did n't worry about it .
Had I looked down and seen that I had grown another limb , I would n't have been surprised at all ; I would have just used it .
Looking back , I realize that I had already lost all sense of time .
The world became a binary place of dark and light , on and off , safety and danger .
I felt a need , determined it was hunger , and ate almonds until I did n't feel the need anymore .
Same thing with water .
It was like playing a game .
I sat at my desk and tried to write down how this felt so I could look at it later .
I wrote down the word " Cro-Magnon . "
I was very aware that I was stupid .
I think I probably seemed like Benny on L.A. Law .
I thought I would have trouble driving but I had none .
I only felt " unsafe " in the dark street until I got into the " safe " car .
Luckily there were only a couple of people in Kinko's and one of them was a friend .
She confirmed that my pupils were of different sizes .
One was n't quite round .
I knew I was fucked up .
I knew there was no way I could know if I was correctly adhering to social customs .
I did n't even know how to modulate my voice .
Was I talking too loud ?
Did I look like a regular person ?
I understood that I was involved in a big contraption called civilization and that certain things were expected of me , but I could not comprehend what the hell those things might be .
All the words that came out of my mouth seemed equal .
Instead of saying " reduce it about 90 percent " I could have said " two eggs and some toast , please . "
The whole world was broken down into elemental parts , each being of equal " value " to the whole -- which is to say , of no value at all .
I sat at a table and read a newspaper .
It was the most absurd thing I had ever seen !
Each story purported to be a description of a thing or an event , or was supposed to cover " news " of reality in another place .
This seemed stupid .
An article on the war in Burma was described as " the war the West forgot . "
It had an " at - a - glance " chart that said Burma was approximately three times the size of the state of Washington .
This was meaningless and I knew it .
The story did not even begin to describe the tiniest fragment of the reality of what was happening in that place .
Since I had n't always been a reptile , I knew things were what they call " complicated " and that the paper 's pitiful attempt to categorize individuals as " rebels " or " insurgents " or to describe the reasons for the agony was ridiculous .
I laughed out loud .
I found being a reptile kind of pleasant .
I was content to sit there and monitor my surroundings .
I was alert but not anxious .
Every now and then I would do a " reality check " to make sure I was n't masturbating or strangling someone , because of my vague awareness that more was expected of me than just being a reptile .
At one point I ventured across the street to a hamburger place to get something to eat .
It was closed and yet there were workers inside .
This truly confused me , and I considered trying to find a way to simply run in , grab some food , and make off with it .
Luckily , the store opened ( it was now 6 A.M. ) and I entered the front door like a normal customer .
It was difficult to remember how to perform a money - for - merchandise transaction and even more difficult to put it into words , but I was eventually successful .
I ate the hamburger slowly and deliberately .
If I had become full before I finished the hamburger , I think I would have simply let it fall from my hands .
The life of a reptile may seem boring to us , but I was never bored when I was a reptile .
If something started to hurt me , I took steps to get away from it ; if it felt better over there , that 's where I stayed .
Now , twenty - four hours later , I 'm beginning to get my neocortex back ( I think ) .
Soon , I hope to be human again .
ANIMAL CROSSING : REVIEW
The following is a transcript of a recording that came into my possession following a series of events I am not willing to explain .
But then , it was a crazy time in my life and I did a lot of things I 'm not completely proud of .
To cut a long story short , I had devoted that particular year of my pubescence to experimenting with my sexuality and a full account of the things I saw and did would make unpleasant reading , be thoroughly embarrassing for myself and would place me in violation of several non-disclosure agreements I signed with numerous powerful public figures .
Anyway , I received the recording from a hairy man in vinyl stockings who turned out to be a high - profile member of one of the world 's big secret services .
Apparently it had been circulating the spy networks as a piece of office entertainment , haunting forwarded emails on the computers of receptionists and data entry clerks from MI6 to the Pentagon .
All anyone seems to know ( or wants to admit ) about the tape is that it is a voice recording made by some kind of covert operative on assignment to investigate the headquarters of a suspect organisation .
The transcript in full now follows .
[ begin recording ] - is thing on ?
Oh , yes .
Agent ####### reporting .
This tape will serve as an audio account of my mission 's progress .
For reference purposes , I am required to repeat that the purpose of the mission is to infiltrate a gated community of what is considered a suspect organisation and investigate for possible links to international terrorism .
As I make this report , I have secured a hold - out position a few hundred yards away from the organisation 's camp .
It 's a beautiful part of the country .
I mean ... REALLY beautiful .
Almost to the point that it kind of creeps me out .
The rolling hills , the scattered trees , the deep blue colouring of the water , the perfect geometric shapes in the grass - it all kind of points to ... stylisation .
I do n't know how else to describe it .
With my binoculars I can see some of the members of the community now , going about their daily business .
The exact nature of that business is unclear .
All they seem to do is spend most of the day standing rigidly in place in front of their crude hut - like dwellings .
When they do move , all they do is meander aimlessly around with no apparent direction .
But I 'm definitely in the right place .
I recognise the uniform appearance of the residents from the dossier I was given .
Right now I 'm working on a theory that this is some kind of camp where small children or midgets are made to wear oversized animal costumes , such as those worn at theme parks .
I 'm assuming this is part of some indoctrination process or hazing ritual .
Tomorrow I will begin my infiltration attempt .
[ end recording ] [ begin recording ]
Day two .
Okay , I 'm pretty scared .
Not that I perceive any danger , but ... it 's just been frightening in a way I can't quite explain .
Creepy , I suppose .
Yeah .
A general feeling of creepiness that rises the more I investigate the town .
Even though I had endeavoured to fit in by having my legs surgically removed from the knees down and inflating my head to eight times its previous size , I was expecting a certain amount of resistance and hostility from the town 's denizens .
But it was spooky how welcoming they were , as if I was expected .
Not only was I expected , but one of the little huts had been arranged for my arrival .
No furniture was provided , however , except for a stereo and a crate , so I spent my first night shivering on the cold stone floor to the sound of jaunty synthesized music and woke with severe pain in my joints .
The strangest thing was when I was first entering the town , and I asked one of the little animal costume - wearing children / midgets what the town was called .
In response , he asked me " what would you like it to be called ? "
After a moment 's thought , I impishly said " Assfuckville " .
And now all the townsfolk refer to their community as Assfuckville , even ones who could not possibly have had time to be informed of the new name .
I am extremely confused .
I will now conclude today 's report and continue my investigations .
[ end recording ] [ begin recording ]
I am beginning to understand the nature of this society .
It seems to bear all the hallmarks of a cult .
Today I was introduced to the leader , a creature in a raccoon suit , who informed me that I owed him a substantial sum of money for the house I had assumed was a gift .
Not wishing to anger the locals until my position was firm , I agreed that 20,000 units of the local currency was a very reasonable sum for the wretched little hovel , and quickly left .
Strangely , while the raccoon creature who operates the town 's all - purpose shop will only deal in currency , most of the other inhabitants use a bartering system of economics .
Each of the animal - things operate small hovels like my own , and exchange wallpaper , carpets and various items of furniture for other accoutrements , although the actual value of the objects being exchanged seems to be completely arbitrary .
I was invited to take a look inside the home of a chicken woman , and found the place to be full of impractical furniture that the owner had no apparent use for .
There was a refrigerator and a stove , but neither could be opened , and they were not plugged into any electricity or gas supplies .
There was no bed , no toilet , nothing that might indicate normal human needs .
I made my excuses and immediately repaired to the town river , by which I have been fishing non -stop in order to repay my debt .
I 've also never seen any of the town population eat a meal , or indeed , anything .
And yet they surely must at some point .
[ end recording ] [ begin recording ]
In a previous report I mentioned how Assfuckville appeared to be completely stylised .
This was probably a poor choice of words .
A better description would be ' artificial ' .
Everything seems so ... unreal , manufactured almost , like the architects of this place took an extremely limited representation of the supposed ideal town and attempted to model their community around it .
I have already touched upon the bizarre habits of the townspeople , their homes , and their want for furniture and clothes that seems to be their only motivation or desire .
It 's like they have a vague understanding of a human lifestyle without knowing the exact details .
And then there is the museum , if you can call it that ; despite its grand architecture , it has absolutely no exhibits at all .
Exploring the place is a deeply disturbing experience , akin to visiting a ghost town , where the silence roars loudly in your ears .
It 's not just the people or the buildings .
It 's everything around me .
The fish in the river and the ocean will dart straight onto my hook the instant I drop it in front of them , like robots , and can remain outside water for indefinite amounts of time without suffocating .
And then there are the fruit trees .
On each one of them , exactly three prime examples of the fruit in question appear to have been stuck on the outside of the main clusters of leaves , unattached to any of the branches and easily shaken off .
Every morning , they 're there again .
I am certain there must be a team of workmen coming around during the night to replace dislodged fruit and bury fossils all around in random places , for reasons unknown .
I must sign off now .
One of the animal people is standing outside my house , shuffling back and forth as if desperate for the toilet .
I need to close all the curtains and sit in the dark for a little while .
[ end recording ] [ begin recording ]
Oh god , oh jesus fuck .
I do n't even know where to begin .
They are n't costumes .
I do n't know what the hell they are .
Some kind of godforsaken freaks is what they are .
My stomach feels raw from vomiting .
Okay .
Get it together .
Deep breaths , like they showed me at the academy .
Okay , right .
I 'll try to explain what I saw .
I had just deposited some more currency to pay off the house - those eager fish and clandestine fruits seem to go for a hell of a lot - when I saw what appeared to be some kind of ritual going on between two of the townsfolk - the chicken I interacted with earlier , and a pig who seems to be the only person who owns a toilet , albeit unobscured in the corner of their living room .
They were shuffling around each other tunelessly whistling an improvised song composed of randomly - chosen notes sung in an unvarying rhythm .
Occasionally they would pause to link hands and bow cheerfully towards each other .
After which , one of several things would happen - they would continue whistling , or one of them would suddenly be wearing a copy of the other one 's shirt , or they would go away suddenly offended and stomp around in exaggerated displays of fury or dismay ( a misguided attempt to emulate human social interaction , perhaps ? ) .
Anyway , while they were distracted I took the opportunity to try and get a closer look at their outfits , to see if I could find a seam or fastener .
I could n't .
The more I looked , the more convinced I became that these monsters were not human beings in costume , but rather obscene parodies of nature , a twisted and misshapen representation of an anthropomorphic animal .
What is this ?
Genetic engineering ?
Cloning ?
I feel sick .
I have to get out of here .
I am aborting the mission and retreating as of tomorrow .
[ end recording ] [ begin recording ]
I can't get out .
Come to think of it , I can't quite remember how I got in in the first place , but I certainly can't get out now .
The entire town is surrounded by tall cliffs , except to the north where a picket fence and a train track blocks the way .
I tried to get on board one of the trains that go through the town 's only station , but I was turned away because I did n't own a memory card .
It sounds insane , but it honestly seemed like a perfectly rational reason at the time .
I do n't even know what a memory card is .
I tried building a raft to escape via the ocean , but whenever I chopped down a tree , the trunk instantly dissolved into thin air the instant it hit the ground .
I 'm afraid I may be going mad .
I 'm afraid ... I think ...

There are about fifteen of the monsters in total .
However , there only seem to be around six unique personalities between them .
Groups of two or three will say , verbatim , the exact same things as each other .
I 'm working on a theory that this is some kind of opposite of a ' gestalt ' entity .
Rather than there being several individuals making up a single entity , we 're looking at a single entity spread out over several individuals .
Or maybe this is just another tactic to drive me insane .

Today I finished paying off my debt .
The little part of me that still feels hope thought , for one glorious instant , that perhaps this would be it .
Perhaps the architects of this nightmare would let me leave , now that I had met my responsibilities .
But that was n't the end .
Not by a long shot .
By the time I got home from paying the deposit , that fucking raccoon had already built an extension on my house and left behind a bill for eight times my previous debt .
The weird thing is , I was n't as shattered as I should have been .
It was almost ... pleasing .
I know that I am a prisoner of some ineffable horror , but when I thought I would be able to leave , there was a feeling ...
I can only describe it as ' regret ' .
It 's what they want , I know , and I should resist it , but all I want to do now is go fishing .

I do n't have much tape left .
I 'd better make this count .
When I was ten years old , my little sister had a huge collection of beanie babies .
She had the cow , the cat , the gorilla , the panda , yes , even the chicken and the pig .
She loved them so much .
She gave them all trite little names , made all sorts of homes and accessories for them .
I was ten years old .
I did n't know much .
But I knew two things .
I knew I wanted the Space Lazar Ultratron 8000 Action Figure .
And I knew that beanie baby collections could go for a large amount of money at the time .
So I stole her beanie babies , that she loved so much .
And I sold them .
God help me , I sold them on eBay to some middle - aged guy in child - molester glasses .
I took his money and I used it to buy a Space Lazar Ultratron 8000 Action Figure .
And I hated it .
It sat there in my room and stared at me all day , a reminder of my guilt .
My sister ran away after that .
My parents were hysterical .
They went into such a decline that I had to identify the body when they scraped my sister up from the middle of the interstate .
I 've never told anyone that .
But I know where I am now .
I am in purgatory .
But it 's not just any purgatory .
It 's my own personal purgatory .
Oh god , oh god , oh god , I should have realised .
We 've lost so many good people to that damn place and I just blundered right in .
And now I can never leave .

You may have been using some of these text - selection tricks ever since you fired up a computer with a mouse , but chances are you 'll find something below that you did n't know before .

Select By Words Instead of Characters
Instead of simply clicking and dragging your mouse , double - click the first or last word you want to highlight and hold down the mouse button on the second click ; then just drag the mouse as usual when selecting text and voilà — you 're selecting whole words rather than individual characters .
I 've tested this method with Firefox , Internet Explorer , Microsoft Word , Wordpad , and Notepad — but it 's probably an OS default , since it works in virtually any program I can think of .
You can get Word to do the same thing by default — without double - clicking — via the Edit tab in the Options dialog , but it 's an all or nothing affair .
The option is checked by default ; turning it off gives you greater flexibility for text selection once you know this trick .
Select Whole Paragraphs or Documents
Most applications will also select an entire paragraph with a triple - click .
Similar to the above method , if you triple - click before dragging the mouse , only whole paragraphs will be highlighted .
This can be a quick way to select an entire document by triple - clicking the first paragraph and dragging down to the last .

More Selection Options Using Word
While the above tips work most anywhere , Word seemingly has no end of different ways to select text .
Here are just some found by experimenting with different key combinations while clicking and / or dragging with the mouse :
Shift +click : Select from the current caret position to the mouse cursor location
: Select from the current caret position to the mouse cursor location Alt + double - click : Select from the beginning of a word to the mouse cursor location
: Select from the beginning of a word to the mouse cursor location Alt+click - and - drag : Select a rectangular block of text
: Select a rectangular block of text Ctrl+click : Select an entire sentence ; once one sentence has been selected this way , Shift +click or Ctrl+click - and - drag can be used to expand the selection to multiple contiguous sentences

Ask an Engineer
Answers to engineering ’s persistent questions .
Back in 2008 , before Facebook was big and the word “ tweet ” referred to anything but a bird sound , we started Ask an Engineer .
The idea was simple : people could ask MIT questions , and we would answer them .
Once the answer to a clue in the New York Times Saturday crossword puzzle , Ask an Engineer seeks to unravel the mysteries of engineering — from the mundane to the highly complex — for questions asked in a relatively pithy way .
We are not currently publishing new entries to Ask an Engineer , but that does n’t mean we ’ve lost interest in questions ( especially the ones asked by kids ) .
If you ’ve got one we have n’t answered ( see below ) , send us an email : askanengineer@mit.edu .
' Every government ­assumes deeds and ­misdeeds of the past , " writes Hannah Arendt in Eichmann and the Holocaust .
" It means hardly more , generally speaking , than that every generation , by virtue of being born into a historical continuum , is burdened by the sins of the fathers as it is blessed with the deeds of the ancestors . "
For Barack Obama this cuts both ways .
Talented as he is , he looks much more so when compared with the man who preceded him .
Just by showing up and stringing a few coherent sentences together , he embodies an improvement .
To earn acclaim in these early months , he has n't had to do anything good .
He merely had to announce that he would stop doing things that were bad .
On the other hand , he has inherited the scarred landscape of his predecessor 's tenure .
Bush 's wars , banks , car companies , secret prisons and untried prisoners are now his .
As the candidate he may have promised change , but as the president he must also simulate some sense of continuity .
Soaring ­rhetoric , however hopeful about the future , cannot erase the past , which has a habit of remaining with us .
Herein lies the tension in Obama 's deeply flawed attempts to come to terms with America 's recent disgraceful record of torture and detainment .
As a candidate he was consistent on two points .
First , he was opposed to torture and would close Guantánamo Bay .
" I believe that we must reject torture ­without equivocation because it does not make us safe , it results in unreliable intelligence , it puts our troops at risk , and it contradicts core American ­values . "
Second , he had no desire to prosecute those who have been guilty of human rights abuses .
" I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the Republicans as a partisan witch - hunt , because I think we 've got too many problems to solve . "
In short , by acknowledging the crimes while refusing to pursue the criminals he has promised to rectify America 's grim recent history without ever ­reckoning with it .
Events over the past few weeks have shown just how ethically and politically untenable this situation really is .
His first term looks as though it may be ­consumed by these issues anyway – and not on his terms .
Having released the torture memos , Obama then reversed his position on releasing photographs that accompanied them on the grounds that to do so would endanger US troops .
Having opposed trying Guantánamo prisoners under military commissions , he now supports it .
His decision to close Guantánamo has been delivered a huge blow by the Senate , which voted 90 - 6 to deny the funds necessary to do so .
Now he has proposed that suspects who cannot be tried in a federal court because evidence against them was obtained under torture could be held in " prolonged detention " in the US ­without trial .
In essence , he would transfer the legal architecture of Guantánamo to the mainland , as though the problem were one of geography rather than principle .
So much for core American values .
On one level we should not be surprised .
Obama was elected by Americans to represent American interests – which , in turn , are informed by American political realities .
And the reality is that , with a few notable exceptions , the Democrats have consistently failed to provide an unswerving , principled opposition to torture whenever they have had the power to do so , for fear of being branded unpatriotic .
Like their spinelessness over the Iraq war , this complicity in the name of pragmatism ultimately makes them more vulnerable to political attack , rather than less .
The speaker of the US House of ­Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , knows this only too well .
When asked why she took impeachment off the table before the 2006 elections , she said : " What about these other people who voted for that war with no evidence …
Are they going to be voting with us to impeach the president ?
Where are these ­Democrats going to be ?
Are they going to be voting for us to impeach a ­president who took us to war on ­information that they had also ? "
This makes the recent fiasco over her confused accounts of whether and when the CIA mislead her on ­waterboarding seem all the more ­disingenuous .
Allegations of torture from various sources were prevalent by that stage , and she chose not to believe them .
Her silence made her complicit , leaving her territory on the moral high ground foreclosed .
This should leave us in no doubt as to where the ultimate responsibility lies .
" Where all are guilty , no one is , " wrote Arendt .
" Confessions of collective guilt are the best possible safeguard against the discovery of culprits , and the very magnitude of the crime the best excuse for doing nothing . "
This is precisely how those who have now left the Bush administration have played it .
" The president instructed us that nothing we would do would be outside of our legal obligations under the convention against torture , " Condoleezza Rice said recently .
" So by definition , if it was authorised by the president , it did not violate our obligations under the convention against torture . "
But in the absence of moral leadership the national conversation has morphed seamlessly from human rights to national security , where the issue of torture and detention is debated not on the grounds of morality but efficacy .
With the former vice - president Dick Cheney leading the charge , the right has managed to mount a spirited defence of torture in which America 's rights as the potential , abstract victim of terrorism supersede detainees ' rights as actual victims of torture .
In the heady days following 9/11 , argues Cheney , observing constitutional niceties and international conventions was a luxury they could not afford .
Waterboarding , he said just last week , " prevented the violent deaths of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of innocent people " .
Cheney insists that by closing Guantánamo and putting a halt to torture Obama is making the country less safe .
These arguments are not difficult to counter .
There is not one shred of evidence any intelligence obtained as a result of torture has been used to prevent further attacks .
The best intelligence the Bush administration ever had was a month before 9/11 , when it rec­eived a memo entitled " Bin Laden determined to attack inside the US " from the FBI , warning of " patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings " .
No torture was involved ; no action was taken .
Conventions are devised precisely to set boundaries in moments of crisis – in periods of relative harmony there is not much need to refer to them .
The Geneva convention , in particular , was devised to establish the rules of engagement during times of war .
If the very fact of being at war is reason enough to discard it , then it has no meaning .
And finally , if showing the world what America has done would inflame anti-American sentiment then maybe America should n't do it in the first place .
The Obama administration 's desire to concentrate on the future is understandable .
But the past has a legacy and the present has consequences .
By ceding the principle to Cheney now we will all pay for it later .
Dan Choi is challenging the policy that bars him from being open about his sexuality
On paper , Dan Choi is everything the US military could have hoped for .
He is a graduate of the prestigious West Point academy , has served a tour in Iraq , and is fluent in Arabic and Korean .
But despite his talents and experience , the army is seeking to get rid of Choi because of another personal quality it considers incompatible with military life : Choi is openly gay .
In one of the last instances of government - sanctioned discrimination in America , the United States military allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military only if they keep quiet about their sexuality .
For more than a year after meeting his boyfriend and falling in love , Choi was forced to lie or risk joining a long list of almost 13,000 gay and lesbian personnel discharged in the past 16 years under the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
" What if I deploy and he can't come to the tarmac to wish me goodbye , " he asked himself , " or kiss me when I come back ? "
If he were to fall in combat , to whom would the army present the flag that draped his coffin ?
" I started my first relationship ever in life at age 27 , " Choi said .
" I 'm understanding finally what love is .
I have to make the decision : am I going to continue lying ? "
This winter , Choi decided the answer was no .
In March he announced on television that he is a gay soldier .
The military responded with a terse letter informing him he would be charged with violating army regulations .
Choi faces a disciplinary panel tomorrow .
" Specifically , you admitted publicly that you are a homosexual , " the letter read .
" Your actions negatively affected the good order and discipline of the New York Army National Guard . "
" It 's an insult to their professionalism , " Choi said of the insinuation that his fellow soldiers cannot abide a gay comrade .
" They care about what a person can do for the team .
We 're in a time of war .
We have bigger things to worry about than people being gay . "
The discharge of thousands of people from the military because of their sexuality over the past 16 years has generated strong criticism that it is diminishing US military strength at a time when the country can hardly afford it .
The Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns make onerous demands on manpower , and relations remain tense with Iran and North Korea .
But the army has discharged 59 gay Arabic linguists and nine gay Farsi linguists in the last five years , according to the Servicemembers Legal Defence Network .
Britain , Israel and dozens of other countries allow gay personnel to serve openly .
Aside from its impact on military readiness , Choi 's story tells of the policy 's personal toll on dedicated soldiers like him , who are forced to conceal the relationships that keep them going through long hours of training and combat and give them something to fight for .
" To me it was like being back in Iraq , " he said recently .
" You 're always looking around to see who can see you . "
Choi , 28 , served as an infantry officer , translator and language instructor in Iraq in 2006 and 2007 .
He looked forward to redeploying to Iraq , but his life took a profound turn in January 2008 when , during a furtive , curious visit to a gay nightclub in New York City , he met Matthew Kinsey , a 45 - year old executive at Gucci .
The two men had their first date soon after , at an Italian restaurant in New York City .
Choi arrived in uniform .
Over the coming months the two grew close .
Through Choi's strict upbringing in a religious immigrant household and his years in the military , he had never lived openly as a gay man .
Kinsey helped him through the experience .
" He 's dealing with things I dealt with in college , " Kinsey said , " in an environment where you can't be who you are . ' "
Choi delighted in his long - overdue emotional awakening .
" I look at Matthew , " he said , " and I think everybody should have this .
The whole world makes sense to me . "
In between his weekend jaunts to New York City , Choi 's comrades back at the base wondered why he was suddenly so cheery .
Choi was inexperienced in romance , and sought advice on gift ideas for the lover he called " Martha " ( should he buy her chocolates ?
Jewellery ? ) .
But the deceit took its toll .
" It was too much lying every day , " he said .
" It takes an incredible amount of energy to keep up the lie .
Every time I wanted to talk about it , I 'd have to make sure not to use the wrong pronoun . "
So Choi left the army , moved to New York City and signed up in a part - time position with a military unit controlled by the state of New York , but one that could deploy to Iraq .
In March , he announced his sexuality on a cable television chat show .
Soon after coming out , Choi returned to base for a weekend training session , where he directed live - fire exercises .
To his surprise the men had no unkind words for him , and those who approached him at a bar on base one evening praised his courage and trust in them .
He says they told him they cared less about his sexuality and more about the " capabilities you bring to the fight " .
If he concedes the charge , Choi will probably be offered an honourable discharge , albeit one that states he was expelled for being gay , he said .
But he says he intends to fight and if he loses , he risks forfeiting pension and health benefits and other financial advantages offered to American vets .
As he prepared for his hearing he took part in gay rights demonstrations and met members of Congress to advocate an end to the ban on openly gay soldiers .
" They have a hard enough job as it is , so why would you force them into the closet ? " he asks .
" Family makes a better soldier . "
A flawed compromise
The " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was Bill Clinton 's 1993 compromise with US military leaders who opposed his efforts to open the armed services to gay people .
The policy concedes that allowing gay people to serve in the military would undermine morale , good order , discipline and unit cohesion .
Since then , almost 13,000 people have been discharged .
Barack Obama has pledged to allow gay servicemen and women to serve openly , but the White House has yet to call for Congress to change the law .
More than 260 gay and lesbian service members have been discharged since Obama took office in January , according to the Servicemembers Legal Defence Network , causing impatience among gay rights advocates and some in the military .
According to Kapil Komireddi in these very pages , the demise of Pakistan is " inevitable " because it has since foundation been a source of division and extremism .
This is not a new argument .
Virtually every western analyst , now happily joined by a chorus of Indian observers mysteriously bereft of regional contexts and history , believes that the Pakistan state , as opposed to merely extremists within its borders , is the single greatest threat to international peace and security .
On paper , there is much to support this line of thinking .
Pakistan is , after all , a highly mismanaged , corrupt developing state that has fostered religious extremism for decades while continuing to build a formidable nuclear arsenal .
The prospect of the Taliban getting its hands on Pakistan 's nukes is the stuff of nightmares , and Dick Cheney 's dreams .
It is hard to think of a more frightening scenario .
With the exception of North Korea , no nuclear - armed nation is as scrutinised as Pakistan .
Yet nuclear proliferation is on the rise worldwide .
According to the Pentagon , Pakistan is expanding its nuclear arsenal more quickly than any other country .
But India is not far behind and , along with China , Russia and the United States , is busy improving the size and quality of its weapon delivery systems .
On closer reflection , the idea that the Pakistan state is inherently dangerous turns out to be a lazy mantra used by those who wish to ignore history and avoid a more complicated reality .
A nation state is a rather nebulous concept at the best of time .
But when a state as hurriedly created ( in 1947 ) , poorly managed and with as many centres of power as Pakistan is in question , it becomes difficult to establish diabolical intent , though not impossible .
Pakistan society is as divided as it is diverse , and its elites reflect these traits .
Within the army , the most powerful institution in the country , there are careerists , Islamists and khaki businessmen more consumed with wealth accumulation via shady army welfare trusts than nuclear jihad .
That is not to say the army is incapable of Machiavellian strategies .
For decades , it has looked to install a pro-Pakistan regime in Afghanistan .
Following the war with the Soviets in Afghanistan , and generous encouragement of the US and Saudi Arabia , the army looked to radical Islamists to fulfil this role .
It is also true that much of Pakistani society , including the army , has a pathological fear of India - engineered oblivion .
Even now there are strong suggestions the army is supporting anti-India militancy in Kashmir .
Along with commentators such as Komireddi , the US has routinely and very publicly criticised Pakistan for refusing to shift the lion 's share of its troops stationed along the border with India ( most of them are in Kashmir ) .
It is true that the army has been slow to react to the Taliban insurgency within Pakistan .
Only last month did it finally decide to mount decisive action against Taliban encroachment in the country , and this after years of reaching peace agreements that saw the insurgents move into as much as 11 % of the country .
But these sobering details do not an evil empire make .
Spare a thought for the Indian army .
As the security analyst Farrukh Saleem wrote recently :
The Pakistan army looks at the Indian army and sees its 6,384 tanks ... 672 combat aircraft ... its six out of 13 Indian corps that are strike corps ... [ all ] pointing their guns at Pakistan ... deployed to cut Pakistan into two halves .
The Pakistan army looks at the Taliban and sees no Arjun main battle tanks , ... no 155 mm Bofors howitzers , no Akash surface - to - air missiles , no BrahMos land attack cruise missiles , no Agni intermediate range ballistic missiles , no Sukhoi Su-30 MKI air superiority strike fighters , no Jaguar attack aircraft , no MiG - 27 ground - attack aircraft , no Shakti thermonuclear devices , no Shakti -II 12 kiloton fission devices and no heavy artillery .
This year alone , India will spend close to $ 40 bn ( US ) on its armed forces , up to eight times as much Pakistan .
It has fought four major wars with Pakistan and , in each , matched its much smaller rival in bellicosity and provocation .
Such facts do not to absolve Pakistan 's army of responsibility for stifling militancy .
But to consider Pakistan 's role in creating the instability currently engulfing the subcontinent without considering India is like studying the Cuban missile crisis without reference to American warheads pointed towards the then Soviet Union .
And therein lies the problem for so many Indians and Pakistanis .
Lost in the west 's division between good and bad third - world citizens , many have become blind to their country 's own ills .
It was in India , after all , that a pogrom arranged by fanatical Hindu groups assisted by the Gujarat government led to the murder of thousands of Muslims and Christians .
Fascism has an old pedigree in India – the anti-British nationalist Subhash Chandra Bose , who fought with the Japanese against Her Majesty 's forces during the second world war , marvelled at Hitler 's reinvigoration of the German state .
At the last Indian elections , the fascist Bajrang Dal and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh parties openly lobbied on a Hindu supremacist platform .
The reflections with the Taliban could not be clearer .
Many in Pakistan still refuse to accept that there is homegrown extremism in their country .
They remain convinced that Indian , Israeli or American agencies ( or all three in collusion ) are stoking the flames of extremism to discredit Pakistan because it is the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons .
All the while , Pakistani school children continue to be fed lies about Indian designs over the country and the virtues of Pakistan 's historically inept army .
For Indians , as for Pakistanis , the tired routine of pointing the finger across the border has served little other purpose than to deflect attention away from the very pressing problems at home .
The sad irony is that India and Pakistan still share much the same tribulations some six decades after they were sliced apart .
Mr. McNeill , one of the first mentors to sign on , draws from his own experience .
His father died when he was 6 years old , and at 21 , he was co-manager of the family grain elevator business and farm operations in Thomas , Okla .
Currently , a managing partner in SPP Mezzanine Funding , Mr. McNeill works with students from Suitland High School .
The best part of being a mentor , he said , is watching the students gain the self - confidence and poise to run their own business .
Across the nation , there has been increasing interest among young people in running their own businesses .
" The nation 's youth are looking at entrepreneurship as a major alternative career as they are being shut out of a shrinking job market in inner cities , " said Carl J. Schramm , president and chief executive of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation .
Marie Harrison , 15 , lives in a violence - ridden section of the Mission District of San Francisco where she struggles to get by as she cares for her 71 - year - old grandmother , Maria , who recently suffered a stroke .
Marie monitors her grandmother 's blood pressure and helps prepares her food .
She also helps raise her 12 - year - old sister , Megan , as well as attend Immaculate Conception Academy .
Marie has lived with her grandmother , who is her legal guardian , on the same block since she was just over a year old .
" The area where I live is n't safe .
There 's lots of drug and gang violence , " she said .
Last July , her cousin David was hit by a stray bullet .
Every Saturday , she said , she looks forward to attending a sewing and fashion program sponsored by the Turning Heads Project , which helps poor young people in San Francisco become more economically self - sufficient .
" Marie gained a lot of self - confidence and new skills attending our sewing and fashion programs and learning entrepreneurship , " said Jane Segal , her mentor and director for special projects .
Marie said , " We make pillows , skirts and purses in class . "
Piecing together fabrics donated by the Turning Heads Project , Marie fashioned her own prom dress .
" One of my high school friends bought one of my creations for $ 40 , " Marie said in a telephone interview .
" I 'm saving the money for college .
One day I would like to become a designer and own my own business . "
One of her Turning Heads classmates , Patrice Moananu , 15 , also lives with her grandmother , as well as five sisters in public housing in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco .
" I work as a youth intern at my school almost every day to help with the family finances , " Patrice said .
" I 've attended the Turning Heads fashion and sewing program for about a year , where I learned about starting my own business .
At first I was n't good at sewing , but the class has given me a new skill and new self - confidence . "
